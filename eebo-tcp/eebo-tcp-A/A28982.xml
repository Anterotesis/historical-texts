         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Have often wonder'd,
that, in so Inquisitive
an Age as This, among
those many Learned Men,
that have with much <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
as well as <hi>Acuteness,</hi>
written of the <hi>Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
(as They call Them,)
and some of Them of the
<hi>Principles</hi> too, I have not
met with any, that has
made it his <hi>business</hi> to write
of <hi>Nature Herself.</hi> This
will perhaps hereafter be
<pb facs="tcp:48184:3"/>
thought such an Omission,
as if, in giving an Account
of the Political Estate of a
Kingdom, One should Treat
largely of the Civil Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Military Officers,
and other Subordinate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
and of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Ranks and Orders
of Inferior Subjects and
Plebeians, but should be
silent of the Prerogatives
and Ways of Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>King;</hi> or, (to
use a Comparison more
suitable to the Subject,)
as if One should particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
treat of the Barrel,
Wheels, String, Ballance,
<hi>Index,</hi> and other Parts of
a <hi>Watch,</hi> without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:48184:3"/>
the <hi>Nature</hi> of the
<hi>Spring,</hi> that sets all These
a moving. When I say
this, I do not forget, that
the Word <hi>Nature</hi> is every
where to be met with in
the Writings of Physiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
But, though they
frequently employ the
<hi>Word,</hi> they seem not to
have much consider'd,
what Notion ought to be
fram'd of the <hi>Thing,</hi> which
they <hi>suppose</hi> and <hi>admire,</hi> and
upon Occasion <hi>celebrate,</hi>
but do not call in <hi>Question</hi>
or discuss. Weighing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with my self, of what
great Moment the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a right or a wrong
<hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> must be, in
<pb facs="tcp:48184:4"/>
Reference both to the
Speculative and Practical
Part of Physiology; I
judg'd it very well worth
the while, to make, with
Philosophical Freedom, a
serious <hi>Enquiry</hi> into the
Vulgarly Receiv'd <hi>Notion
of Nature;</hi> that, <hi>if</hi> it
appeared <hi>well-grounded,</hi> I
might have the Rational
Satisfaction of not having
acquiesc'd in It, till, after
a previous <hi>Examen; if</hi> I
should find it <hi>confus'd</hi> and
<hi>ambiguous,</hi> I might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remedy that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
by distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the Acceptions of
the Word; <hi>if</hi> I found it
<hi>dubious</hi> as to its Truth, I
<pb facs="tcp:48184:4"/>
might be shy in trusting
too much to a distrusted
Principle; and, <hi>if</hi> I found
<hi>erroneous,</hi> I might avoid
the raising Superstructures
of my Own, or relying on
those of Others, that must
owe their Stability to an
unsound and deceitful
Foundation. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many <hi>Atheists</hi> ascribe
so much to <hi>Nature,</hi> that
they think it needless to
have Recourse to a <hi>Deity,</hi>
for the giving an Account
of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the
Universe: And, on the
other side, very many
<hi>Theists</hi> seem to think the
commonly Received No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Nature,</hi> little less,
<pb facs="tcp:48184:5"/>
than necessary to the Proof
of the Existence and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God; I, who
differ from both these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and yet think every
true <hi>Theist,</hi> and much
more every true <hi>Christian,</hi>
ought to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for Truths, that
have so powerful an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on <hi>Religion,</hi> thought
my self, for Its sake, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to consider this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
both with the more
<hi>Attention</hi> and with regard
to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, being to write
this Treatise as a <hi>Physiologer,</hi>
not a <hi>Christian,</hi> I could not
rationally build any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Doctrine upon mere
<pb facs="tcp:48184:5"/>
               <hi>Revelation,</hi> which would
have been judg'd a <hi>Foreign
Principle</hi> in this <hi>Enquiry.</hi>
Only, since the Person, I
intentionally address'd my
Thoughts to, under the
Name of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> was
a good Christian, I held
it not impertinent, now
and then, upon the by,
to intimate something to
prevent or remove some
Scruples, that I thought
he might have, on the
score (I say not of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Theology, for That is
almost directly pertinent,
but) of the Christian
Faith. But these Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are very few, and but
transiently touch'd upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48184:6"/>
Since the Reader will
be told by and by both
That, and Why the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that make up the
following Treatise, were
not written in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Series</hi> of Times, but
many Years were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
between the Writing
of some of Them, and that
of Those which precede
and follow Them: I hope
it will be thought but a
venial Fault, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
do not appear so
Uniform, nor all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections
of its Parts so apt
and close, as, if no Papers
had been lost and supply'd,
might reasonably be look'd
for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48184:6"/>
I expect the Novelty of
divers of the Sentiments
and Reasonings, propos'd in
the following Discourse,
will be surprising, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
Many to look upon
the Author as a bold Man,
and much addicted to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes.</hi>
But, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
in a distinct Essay,
deliver'd my Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Paradoxes</hi> in general,
I shall not now ingage in
that Subject, but confine
my self to what concerns
the ensuing Paper. I say
then, in short, That in an
Opinion, I look upon its
being <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Antient,</hi> and
its being <hi>Singular</hi> or <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Receiv'd,</hi> as Things that
<pb facs="tcp:48184:7"/>
are but <hi>Extrinsical</hi> to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>true</hi> or <hi>false.</hi> And, as I
would never reject a <hi>Truth,</hi>
for being generaly Known
or Receiv'd, so will I not
conclude an Opinion to
be a <hi>Truth,</hi> merely because
great <hi>Numbers</hi> have thought
it to be so; nor think an
Opinion <hi>Erroneous,</hi> because
'tis not yet Known to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or because it opposes a
Tenent embrac'd by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
For I am wont to judge
of Opinions, as of Coins:
I consider much less in any
One, that I am to Receive,
whose Inscription it bears,
than what Metal 'tis made
of. 'Tis indifferent enough
to me, whether 'twas
<pb facs="tcp:48184:7"/>
Stamp'd many Years or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
since, or came but Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
from the Mint.
Nor do I regard through
how many, or how few,
Hands it has pass'd for Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
provided I know by
the Touch-stone, or any
sure Tryal, purposely made,
whether or no it be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and does or does not
deserve to have been Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
For, if upon due
proof it appears to be Good,
its having been long and
by Many receiv'd for such,
will not tempt me to refuse
it. But, if I find it Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
neither the Princes
Image or Inscription, nor
its Date (how Antient so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,)
<pb facs="tcp:48184:8"/>
nor the Multitude
of Hands, through which
it has pass'd unsuspected,
will engage me to receive
It. And one disfavouring
tryal, well made, will much
more discredit It with me,
than all those specious
Things, I have nam'd, can
recommend It.</p>
            <p>By this Declaration of
my Sentiments about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes</hi>
in General, I hope
it will be thought, that the
Motive I had to Question
that <hi>Notion of Nature,</hi> which
I dissent from, was not, that
this <hi>Notion</hi> is Vulgarly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
And I have this to
say, to make it probable,
That I was not ingag'd in
<pb facs="tcp:48184:8"/>
this Controversie, by any
Ambition of appearing in
Print an Heresiarch in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
by being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of a strange Doctrine,
that the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
was written about
the Year 1666. (that is, some
Lustres ago,) and that not
long after, the Youth, to
whom I dictated it, having
been inveigled to steal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
unknown to me or his
Parents, into the <hi>Indies,</hi>
(whence we never heard of
him since,) left the loose
Sheets, wherein (and not
in a Book) my thoughts had
been committed to Paper,
very incoherent, by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of divers necessary
<pb facs="tcp:48184:9"/>
Passages. Upon which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and my Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to take the Pains to
supply what was wanting,
those Papers lay by me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years together neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and almost forgotten;
'till the Curiosity of some
Philosophical Heads, that
were pleas'd to think they
deserv'd another Fate, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me to tack them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and make up the Gaps
that remain'd between their
Parts, by retrieving, as well
as, after so many Years, my
bad Memory was able to
do, the Thoughts I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had, pertinent to
those purposes. And indeed,
when I consider'd of how
<pb facs="tcp:48184:9"/>
vast importance it is in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and the Practice of
Physick too, to have a right
Notion of <hi>Nature;</hi> and how
little the Authority of the
generality of Men ought, in
so nice and intricate a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
to sway a free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Spirit; as I at first
thought myself oblig'd,
since <hi>others</hi> had not sav'd me
the labour, to make a <hi>Free
Enquiry</hi> into this Noble and
Difficult Subject, so I was
afterwards the more easily
prevail'd with, by those that
press'd the Publication of it.
With what Success I have
made this Attempt, I must
leave others to judg. But if
I be not much flatter'd,
<pb facs="tcp:48184:10"/>
whatever becomes of the
main Attempt, there will
be found suggested here and
there, in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse,
some Reflections
and Explications, that will
at least oblige the zealous
Assertors of the <hi>Vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Nature,</hi> to clear up the
Doctrine, and speak more
distinctly and correctly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Things that relate to it,
than hitherto has been usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
And that will be Fruit
enough to recompense the
Labour, and justifie the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
of a <hi>Free Enquiry.</hi> In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of which, since I
have been oblig'd to travel
in an untrodden Way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Guide, 'twill be
<pb facs="tcp:48184:10"/>
thought, I hope, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
than strange, if, in
attempting to discover di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>general</hi> Mistakes, I be
not so happy as to escape
falling into some <hi>particular</hi>
Ones myself. And, if among
<hi>These,</hi> I have been so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as to make any that is
injurious to Religion, <hi>as</hi> I
did not at all intend it, <hi>so,</hi> as
soon as ever I shall discover
it, I shall freely disown it
<hi>Myself,</hi> and pray that it may
never mislead <hi>Others.</hi> What
my Performance has been,
I have already acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
that I may be unfit
to judg; but, for my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I may make bold to
say, they were, <hi>to</hi> keep the
<pb facs="tcp:48184:11"/>
Glory of the Divine Author
of Things from being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp'd
or intrench'd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> upon
by His Creatures, and <hi>to</hi>
make His Works more
throughly and solidly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Studiers of Them.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend, and I
need not, that every one of
the Arguments, I employ in
the following Tract, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
especially if consider'd
as single. For Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Arguments would be
unsuitable to the very Title
of my Attempt; since, if
about the <hi>Receiv'd Notion of
Nature,</hi> I were furnish'd
with unanswerable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
my Discourse ought
<pb facs="tcp:48184:11"/>
to be styl'd, not a <hi>Free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi>
into the Vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Nature,</hi> I consider, but
a <hi>Confutation</hi> of It. And a
heap of bare Probabilities
may suffice to justifie a
Doubt of the Truth of an
Opinion, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
clearly evince to be
False. And therefore, if any
Man shall think fit to Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
upon the less Principal
or less necessary Parts of
this Treatise, perhaps I
shall not think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to be concern'd at It.
And even, if the main Body
of the Discourse itself shall
be attack'd from the Press;
I, who am neither Young
nor Healthy, nor ever made
Divinity, Philosophy, or
<pb facs="tcp:48184:12"/>
Physick, my Profession, am
not like to oppose him in
the same Way: Since, as I
ought not to wish, that any
Errors of mine (if this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
teach any Such,) should
prevail; so, if the Things I
have deliver'd be True for
the Main, I need not <hi>despair</hi>
but that, in such a Free and
Inquisitive Age as Ours,
there will be found Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Spirits, that will not
suffer weighty Truths to be
oppress'd, tho' the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of them should, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
from Contention,
or by want of Time or
Health, be themselves
kept from defending them.
Which I have thought fit
to take Notice of in this
<pb facs="tcp:48184:12"/>
Place, that the Truth (if
I have been so happy, as to
have found and taught It,)
may not suffer by my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
nor any Reader sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize,
that, if I shall leave a
Book Unanswered, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
acknowledg it to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable.
But This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
only the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Essay, not the
Order or Disposition of the
Parts: Since, if any shall
censure That, I shall not
quarrel with him about It.
For <hi>indeed, considering</hi> in how
<hi>preposterous</hi> an <hi>Order</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
I have here tack'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
came to Hand; and
how many Things are upon
that score unduly plac'd, I
shall not only be content,
<pb facs="tcp:48184:13"/>
but must desire, to have this
Rhapsody, of my own loose
Papers, look'd upon but as
an <hi>Apparatus,</hi> or Collection
of Materials, in order to
[what I well know this
maim'd and confus'd Essay
is not,] a compleat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Discourse. Yet (to
conclude,) I thought, that
the affording even of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Light, in a Subject so
Dark and so very Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
might keep an <hi>Essay</hi>
from being useless; and that
to fall short of <hi>Demonstration</hi>
would prove a pardonable
Fault, in a Discourse, that
pretends not to <hi>Dogmatize,</hi>
but <hi>only</hi> to make an <hi>Enquiry.</hi>

            <head>SECT. I.</head>
            <p>I Know not Whether or no it be a
Prerogative in the human Soul,
that, as 'tis itself a True and
Positive Being, so 'tis apt to
conceive all other things, as True
and Positive Beings also. But, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48184:14"/>
or no this Propensity, to frame
such kind of <hi>Idea's, suppose</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
I fear it <hi>occasions</hi> mistakes; and
makes us think and speak, after the
manner of True and Positive Beings,
of such things, as are but Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and some of them Negations or
Privations themselves; as Death,
Ignorance, Blindness, and the like.</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore, to stand
very carefully upon our Guard,
that we be not insensibly misled by
such an innate and unheeded Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to error, as we bring into the
World with us. And consequently
I may be allowed to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
among other Particulars, in
which this deluding Propensity of
our minds has too great, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected,
an Influence upon us; it
may not have impos'd on us, in the
<hi>Notion</hi> we are wont to frame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Nature.</hi> For this being the
fruitful Parent of other Notions, as
<hi>Nature</hi> herself is said to be of the
Creatures of the Universe; the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is so general in its Applications,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48184:14"/>
and so important in its Influence;
that we had need be jealously care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
of not over-easily admitting a
Notion, than which there can scarce
be any that more deserves to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
examin'd, before it be throughly
entertain'd.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore make bold to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
freely, Whether That, of which
we affirm such great Things, and to
which we ascribe so many Feats, be
that <hi>almost Divine thing,</hi> whose works
among others <hi>we</hi> are; or a <hi>Notional
thing,</hi> that in some sense is rather to
be reckon'd among <hi>our</hi> works; as
owing its Being to Human Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.</p>
            <p>I know, most men will be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd
with no mean prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so venturous an Attempt; but
I will not do <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Injury,
to measure Him by the prepossess'd
generality of Men; yet there are
two scruples which I think it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
to take notice of, to clear the
way for what shall be presented you
in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48184:15"/>
And first, it may seem an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and unfilial thing, to dispute
against <hi>Nature,</hi> that is taken by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
for the <hi>Common Parent</hi> of us all.
But though it be an undutiful thing,
to express a want of respect for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
Parent, yet I know not,
why it may not be allowable to <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
One, that a Man looks upon but
as a pretended one, or at least does up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
probable grounds doubt, Whether
she be so or no; and, 'till it appear
to me that she is so, I think it my
duty to pay my gratitude, not to I
know not what, but to that Deity,
whose Wisdom and Goodness, not
only design'd to make me a Man, and
enjoy what I am here bless'd with,
but contriv'd the World so, that
even those Creatures of his, who by
their inanimate condition are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of intending to gratifie me,
should be as serviceable and useful to
me, as they would be, if they could
and did design the being so; and you
may be pleas'd to remember, that, as
men may now accuse such an Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48184:15"/>
as I am, of impiety and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
towards <hi>Nature:</hi> So the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and other Worshipers of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Bodies, accus'd several of the
Ancient Philosophers, and all the
Primitive Christians, of the like
Crimes, in reference to the Sun;
whose Existence, and whose being a
Benefactor to Mankind, was far
more unquestionable, than that there
is such a <hi>Semi-Deity</hi> as Men call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
And it can be no great dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to me, to suffer on the like
Account with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> good Company,
especially, when several of the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
that Justifie them, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Apologize for me. I might add,
that, it not being half so evident to
me, that what is called <hi>Nature</hi> is my
<hi>Parent,</hi> as that all <hi>Men</hi> are
my <hi>Brothers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> by being the
<hi>Off-spring of God;</hi> (for the

               </gap> of <hi>Aratus</hi> is adopted

doing of <hi>them</hi> a service, by disabusing
them, to the paying of <hi>Her</hi> a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Respect. But setting Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48184:16"/>
aside, I have sometimes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
doubted, whether the <hi>Vulgar
Notion of Nature</hi> has not been both
injurious to the Glory of God, and a
great Impediment to the solid and
useful Discovery of his Works.</p>
            <p>And first, it seems to detract from
the Honour of the great Author and
Governor of the World; that Men
should ascribe most of the admirable
things that are to be met with in it,
not to him, but to a certain <hi>Nature,</hi>
which themselves do not well know
what to make of. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>Tis true that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
confess, that this <hi>Nature</hi> is a thing
of His establishing, and subordinate
to Him; but, though many confess
it when they are ask'd, Whether
they do or no? yet, besides that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
seldom or never lifted up their
eyes to any higher Cause, he that
takes notice of their way of ascribing
things to <hi>Nature,</hi> may easily discern,
that, whatever their words some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be, the Agency of God is little
taken notice of in their thoughts:
And however, it does not a little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48184:16"/>
darken the Excellency of the Divine
management of things, that, when
a strange Thing is to be effected or
accounted for, men so often have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to <hi>Nature,</hi> and think <hi>she</hi> must
extraordinarily interpose to bring
such things about: Whereas it
much more tends to the Illustration
of God's Wisdom, to have so fram'd
things at first, that there can sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never need any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Interposition of his Power.
And, <hi>as</hi> it <hi>more</hi> recommends the
skill of an Engineer, to contrive
an Elaborate Engine, so as that
there should need nothing to reach
his ends in it, but the contrivance
of parts devoid of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>than</hi> if it were necessary, that
ever and anon a discreet Servant
should be employ'd, to concur nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the Operations of this or that
Part, or to hinder the Engine from
being out of order: <hi>So</hi> it <hi>more</hi> sets
off the Wisdom of God in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of the Universe, that he can
make so vast a Machine, perform all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48184:17"/>
those many things which he design'd
it should, by the meer contrivance
of Brute matter, managed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Laws of Local Motion, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by his ordinary and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
<hi>than</hi> if he imployed from
time to time an Intelligent Overseer,
such as <hi>Nature</hi> is fancied to be, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate,
assist, and controul the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Parts. In confirmation of
which, you may remember, that the
later Poets justly reprehended their
Predecessors, for want of skill, in
laying the Plots of their Plays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they often suffered things to be
reduced to that Pass, that they were
fain to bring some Deity <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
upon the Stage, to help
them out.</p>
            <q>(Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus
vindice nodus,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>And let me tell you freely, that,
though I will not say, That <hi>Aristotle</hi>
meant the mischief his Doctrine did,
yet I am apt to think, that the Grand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48184:17"/>
Enemy of God's Glory made great
use of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Authority and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
to detract from it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>as Aristotle,</hi> by introducing
the Opinion of the Eternity of the
World, (whereof he owns himself
to have been the first Broacher) did,
at least in almost all Mens Opinion,
openly deny God the Production
of the World: <hi>So,</hi> by ascribing the
admirable Works of God, to what
he calls <hi>Nature,</hi> he tacitly denies
him the Government of the World.
Which suspicion, if you judg severe,
I shall not, at more leisure, refuse to
acquaint you, (in a distinct Paper)
why I take divers of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
relating to Religion, to be more
unfriendly, not to say pernicious, to
It, than those of several other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosophers.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to prevent
an Objection, that some may make,
as if, to deny the <hi>receiv'd Notion of
Nature,</hi> a Man must also deny <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
of which <hi>Nature</hi> is the Grand
Instrument. For in the first place,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48184:18"/>
my Opinion hinders me not at all
from acknowledging God to be the
Author of the Universe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Preserver and Upholder of it;
which is much more than the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick
Hypothesis,</hi> which (as we were
saying) makes the World Eternal,
will allow its Embracers to admit;
and those things which the School-Philosophers
ascribe to the Agency of
<hi>Nature,</hi> interposing according to
Emergencies, I ascribe to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>God</hi> in the first Fabrick of
the Universe; which He so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
contrived, that, if He but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his ordinary and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
there will be no necessity of
extraordinary interpositions, which
may reduce him, to seem as it were
to Play <hi>After-Games;</hi> all those Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
upon whose account Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
and Physicians seem to have
devis'd what they call <hi>Nature,</hi> being
foreseen and provided for in the first
Fabrick of the World; so that meer
Matter, so ordered, shall in such and
such Conjunctures of Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48184:18"/>
do all that Philosophers ascribe
on such occasions to their almost
Omniscient <hi>Nature,</hi> without any
knowledg of what it does, or acting
otherwise than according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Laws of Motion. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the difference betwixt their
Opinion of God's Agency in the
World, and that which I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
may be somewhat adumbrated,
by saying, That <hi>they</hi> seem to imagine
the World to be after the nature of a
Puppet, whose Contrivance indeed
may be very Artificial, but yet is
such, that almost every particular
motion the Artificer is fain (by
drawing sometimes one Wire or
String, sometimes another) to guide,
and oftentimes over-rule, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Engine; whereas, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to us, 'tis like a rare Clock, such
as may be that at <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> where
all things are so skilfully contriv'd,
that the Engine being once set a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
all things proceed according to
the Artificers first design, and the
Motions of the little Statues, that at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48184:19"/>
such hours perform these or those
things, do not require, like those of
Puppets, the peculiar interposing of
the Artificer, or any Intelligent Agent
imployed by him, but perform their
functions upon particular occasions,
by vertue of the General and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Contrivance of the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
The Modern <hi>Aristotelians</hi>
and other Philosophers would not be
tax'd as injurious to Providence,
though they now ascribe to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course of <hi>Nature,</hi> those regular
Motions of the Planets, that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and most of his Followers (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them the Christian <hi>School-men</hi>)
did formerly ascribe to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
guidance of Intelligent and
Immaterial Beings, which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to be the Movers of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Orbs. And when I consider,
how many things, that seem <hi>Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
to us, do frequently enough hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the World, I think it is more
consonant to the respect we owe to
Divine Providence, to conceive, that
as God is a most free, as well as a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48184:19"/>
most wise Agent, and may in many
Things have ends unknown to us:
He very well foresaw, and thought
fit, that such seeming <hi>Anomalies</hi>
should come to pass, since he made
them (as is evident in the Eclipses
of the Sun and Moon) the Genuine
consequences of the Order, He was
pleas'd to settle in the World; by
whose Laws the Grand Agents in the
Universe were impower'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
to act according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Natures he had given them;
and the course of things was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to run on, though that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the happening of seeming <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies,</hi>
and things really repugnant
to the Good or Welfare of divers
particular Portions of the Universe.
This, I say, I think to be a Notion
more respectful to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than to imagine, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do, that God has appointed
an Intelligent and Powerful Being,
called <hi>Nature,</hi> to be as his <hi>Vice-gerent,</hi>
continually watchful for the good of
the Universe in general, and of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48184:20"/>
particular Bodies that compose it;
whilst in the mean time, this Being
appears not to have the skill, or the
power, to prevent such <hi>Anomalies,</hi>
which oftentimes prove destructive
to multitudes of Animals, and other
Noble Creatures, (as in Plagues, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
and sometimes prejudicial to greater
Portions of the Universe, (as in
Earth-quakes of a large spread, Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Luminaries, great and
lasting Spots on the Sun, Eruptions
of Vulcan, great Comets or new
Stars that pass from one Region of
Heaven to another.) And I am the
more tender of admitting such a
<hi>Lieutenant</hi> to Divine Providence, as
<hi>Nature</hi> is fancied to be, because I
shall hereafter give you some Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in which it seems, that, if
there were such a thing, she must be
said to act too blindly and impotent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to discharge well the Part she is
said to be trusted with.</p>
            <p>I shall add, that the Doctrine, I
plead for, does much better than its
Rival comply with what Religion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48184:20"/>
teaches us, about the <hi>extraordinary</hi>
and <hi>supernatural</hi> Interpositions of
<hi>Divine Providence.</hi> For when it
pleases God to over-rule, or controul,
the establish'd course of things in the
World, by his own Omnipotent
Hand, what is thus perform'd may
be much easier discern'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to be <hi>miraculous,</hi> by them
that admit, in the ordinary course of
Corporeal Things, nothing but Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Motion, whose Powers Men
may well judg of; than by those
who think there is besides, a certain
<hi>Semi-Deity,</hi> which they call <hi>Nature,</hi>
whose Skill and Power they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to be exceeding great, and yet
have no sure way of estimating how
great they are, and how far they may
extend. And give me leave to take
notice to you, on this occasion, that
I observe the Miracles of our Saviour
and his Apostles, pleaded by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
on the behalf of their Religion,
to have been very differingly look'd
on by <hi>Epicurean</hi> and other Corpus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularian
Infidels, and by those other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48184:21"/>
Unbelievers who admit of a Soul of
the World, or Spirits in the Stars,
or, in a word, think the Universe
to be Governed by Intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
distinct from the Supream Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we call <hi>God.</hi> For this later sort
of Infidels have often admitted those
matters of Fact, which we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
call Miracles; and yet have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to solve them by Astral
Operations, and other Ways not here
to be specified: Whereas the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÃ n</hi>
Enemies of Christianity have
thought themselves oblig'd, resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deny the matters of Fact them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as well discerning, that the
things, said to be perform'd, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Mechanical Powers of Matter
and Motion, (as they were managed
by those, that wrought the Miracles,)
and consequently must either be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
to have been done, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
to have been truly Miraculous.</p>
            <p>But there may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be occasion,<note place="margin">See the III, the IV, and also the last Section of this Treatise.</note> both
to improve the things
already said, and add
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48184:21"/>
others, to satisfie Theological scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
about our <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I formerly told you, that 'twas not
only to the Glory of God, (as that
results from his Wisdom, Power, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>
Goodness, express'd in the World)
that I suspected the <hi>Notion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
that I am examining, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial,
but also to the Discovery of
his Works. And you will make no
great difficulty to believe me, if you
consider, that, whilst Men allow
themselves so general and easie a
way, or rendring accounts of things
that are difficult, as to attribute them
to <hi>Nature; shame</hi> will not reduce
them to a more industrious scrutiny
into the Reasons of Things, and <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity</hi>
itself will move them to it the
more faintly: Of which we have a
clear and eminent Example, in the
Ascension of Water in <hi>Pumps,</hi> and in
other <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of that kind,
whose true Physical Causes had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been found out, if the Moderns
had acquiesced, as their Predecessors
did, in that imaginary one, that the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48184:22"/>
World was Govern'd by a Watchful
Being, call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> and that she ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
a <hi>vacuum,</hi> and consequently is
still in a readiness, to do irresistibly
whatever is necessary to prevent it:
Nor must we expect any great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
in the discovery of the true
Causes of natural Effects, whilst we
are content to sit down with other,
than the particular and immediate
ones.</p>
            <p>'Tis not that I deny, that there are
divers things, as the number and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the Stars, the shapes and
sizes of Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> About which,
even a Philosopher being ask'd can
say little, but that it pleased the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Universe to make them
so; but when we give such general
Answers, we pretend not to give the
particular Physical Reasons of the
things propos'd, but do in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
we do not know them. To this
I add, that the veneration, wherewith
Men are imbued for what they call
<hi>Nature,</hi> has been a discouraging im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to the Empire of Man over
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48184:22"/>
the inferior Creatures of God. For
many have not only look'd upon it, as
an <hi>impossible</hi> thing to compass, but as
something of <hi>impious</hi> to attempt, the
removing of those Boundaries which
<hi>Nature</hi> seems to have put and setled
among her Productions. And whilst
they look upon her as such a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing, some make a kind of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Conscience, to endeavour so to
emulate any of her Works, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
them.</p>
            <p>I have staid so long, about remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the first of the <hi>two</hi> scruples I
formerly propos'd against my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
attempt, that, not to tire your
Patience, I shall in few words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
the second, which is, That I
venture to contradict the sense of the
generality of Mankind: To which I
answer, That in Philosophical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
it becomes not a Naturalist
to be so solicitous, <hi>what has been,</hi> or
is believ'd, as <hi>what ought to be so;</hi>
and I have also elsewhere, on another
occasion, shew'd, how little the sense
of the generality of Men, ought to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48184:23"/>
sway us in some Questions: But that
which I shall at present more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reply, is, First, That 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Men should be generally prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with such a <hi>Notion of Nature,</hi> as
I call in question, since Education
(especially in the Schools) has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued
them with it from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and even in their maturer years
they find it taken for granted, and
imployed not only by the Most but
by the Learnedst Writers, and never
hear it call'd in question by any; and
then it exceedingly complies with
our Innate Propensity, to think that
we know more than we do, and to
appear to do so. For to vouch <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
for a Cause, is an Expedient,
that can scarce be wanting to any
Man, upon any occasion, to seem to
know what he can indeed render no
good reason of.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>this</hi> first part of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I shall subjoin this second.
That the general custom of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to talk of a Thing as a real and
positive Being, and attribute great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48184:23"/>
matters to it, does but little weigh
with me; when I consider, that,
though <hi>Fortune</hi> be not any Physical
thing, but a certain loose &amp; undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
Notion, which a Modern Meta-Physician
would refer to the <hi>Classis</hi>
of his <hi>non Entia,</hi> yet not only the
Gentiles made it a Goddess,
<q>(Nos te facimus, Fortuna, Deam,
Coeloque locamus,)</q>
which many of them seriously Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd,
but eminent Writers, in
Verse and in Prose, Ethnick and
Christian, Ancient and Modern, and
all sorts of Men, in their common
Discourse do seriously talk of It, as
if it were a kind of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that
usurped a great share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World; and ascribe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
less to It, than they do to <hi>Nature.</hi>
And not to speak of what Poets, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists
and Divines tell us of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Ignorance and Vice, which
are but Moral defects: Let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what things are not only by these
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48184:24"/>
Men, but by the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
seriously attributed to Death,
to which so great and fatal a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is assign'd; and then if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
too, that this Death, which is
said to do so many and such wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, is neither a Substance, nor
a Positive Entity, but a meer Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we shall, I trust, the less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Feats ascribed to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
do infer, that there is really such
a Physical Agent as is suppos'd.</p>
            <p>And now having, as I presume,
clear'd our Enquiry, as far as 'tis yet
necessary, [and 'twill be further
done hereafter] from those Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that might make the Attempt
be censur'd before it be examin'd, I
proceed to the Inquiry it self;
wherein I shall endeavour (but with
the brevity my want of leisure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts)
to do these six things. <hi>First,</hi> To
give you a short account of the great
Ambiguity of the word <hi>Nature,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from its various acceptions. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
To shew you, that the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
also, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48184:24"/>
gives of <hi>Nature,</hi> does not afford a
clear or satisfactory Notion of it.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> To gather from the several
things, that are wont to be affirmed
of, or attributed to, <hi>Nature,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Notion of it, which cannot be
well gathered from the Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of its great ambiguity. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
I will mention some of those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that dissuade me from admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Notion of <hi>Nature. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
I shall endeavour to answer seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the chief things, upon which
Men seem to have taken up the <hi>Idea</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> that I disallow. And,
<hi>Sixthly,</hi> I shall propose some of the
chief <hi>Effata</hi> or <hi>Axioms,</hi> that are wont
to be made use of, concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in general, and shall shew, how
far, and in what sense I may admit
them.</p>
            <p>And here it may be opportune, to
prevent both mistakes and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of interrupting the <hi>Series</hi> of our
Discourse, to set down two or three
Advertisements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48184:25"/>
1. When any where in this Tract
I speak of the Opinions of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and the <hi>Peripateticks, as</hi> I would not
be thought to impute to him all the
sentiments of those that will be
thought his followers, some of which
seem to me to have much mistaken
his true meaning; <hi>so</hi> (on the other
side) I did not conceive, that my
Design oblig'd me to inquire anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into his true sentiments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the Origine of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
(as whether or no it were self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent,
as well as Eternal) or about
less important Points: Since, besides
that his expressions are oftentimes
dark and ambiguous enough, and
the things he delivers in several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
do not seem always very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent;
it suffic'd for my purpose,
which was to question Vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to examine those Opinions, that
are by the generality of Scholars ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> and <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Doctrines, by which, if he be
mis-represented, the blame ought to
light upon his Commentators and
Followers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48184:25"/>
2. The <hi>Rational Soul</hi> or <hi>Mind</hi> of
Man, as it is distinct from the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Soul, being an immaterial Spirit;
is a substance of so Heteroclite a kind,
in reference to things so vastly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from it as mere <hi>Bodies</hi> are,
that since I could neither, without
injuring it, treat of it promiscuously
with the Corporeal Works of God,
nor speak worthily of it, without fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
interrupting and disordering
my Discourse by Exceptions, that
would either make it appear intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
or would be very troublesome
to you or any other that you may
think fit to make my Reader; I
thought I might, for others ease and
my own, be allow'd to set aside the
considerations of it in the present
Treatise: And the rather, because
all other parts of the Universe being,
according to the receiv'd Opinion,
the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> we shall not
want in them Subjects more than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
numerous, whereon to make
our <hi>Examen.</hi> Though I shall here
consider the World but as the great
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48184:26"/>
System of things Corporeal, as it
once really was, towards the close of
the sixth day of the Creation, when
God had finish'd all his material
Works, but had not yet Created
<hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECT. II.</head>
            <p>I. A Considering Person may
well be tempted to suspect,
that Men have generally had but
imperfect and confused Notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Nature;</hi> if he but observes,
that they apply that <hi>Name</hi> to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, and those too such, as
have some of them very little depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on, or connexion with, such
others. And I remember that in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s
<hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> I met with a
whole Chapter expresly written, to
enumerate the various Acceptions
of the <hi>Greek</hi> word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render'd <hi>Nature;</hi> of which, if I
mistake not, he there reckons up six.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48184:26"/>
In <hi>English</hi> also we have not fewer,
but rather more numerous significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that Term. For <hi>sometimes</hi>
we use the word <hi>Nature,</hi> for that
<hi>Author of Nature,</hi> whom the School-men,
harshly enough, call <hi>Natura Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turans;</hi>
as when 'tis said, that <hi>Nature</hi>
hath made Man partly Corporeal,
and partly Immaterial. <hi>Sometimes</hi>
we mean by the <hi>Nature</hi> of a thing,
the <hi>Essence,</hi> or that which the School-men
scruple not to call the <hi>Quiddity</hi>
of a thing, namely, the <hi>Attribute</hi> or
<hi>Attributes,</hi> on whose score it is, what
it is; whether the thing be corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
or not; as, when we attempt to
define the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Angle,</hi> or of
a <hi>Triangle,</hi> or of a <hi>Fluid</hi> Body as
such. <hi>Sometimes</hi> we confound that
which a Man has by <hi>Nature,</hi> with
what accrues to him by Birth; as,
when we say, that such a Man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by Nature, or such a Child na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
forward, or sickly, or fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<hi>Sometimes</hi> we take <hi>Nature</hi> for
an Internal Principle of Motion; as,
when we say, that a Stone let fall in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48184:27"/>
the Air, is by <hi>Nature</hi> carried towards
the Centre of the Earth; and, on
the contrary, that Fire or Flame
does Naturally move upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometimes</hi> we understand by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
the Establish'd course of things,
as, when we say, that <hi>Nature</hi> makes
the Night succeed the Day: <hi>Nature</hi>
hath made Respiration necessary to
the Life of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometimes</hi> we take <hi>Nature</hi> for an
Aggregate of Powers belonging to
a Body, especially a Living one;
as, when Physicians say, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is strong, or weak, or spent;
or that in such or such Diseases,
<hi>Nature</hi> left to her self, will do the
Cure. <hi>Sometimes</hi> we take <hi>Nature</hi>
for the Universe, or System of the
Corporeal works of God; as, when
'tis said of a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> or a <hi>Chimera,</hi>
that there is no such thing in <hi>Nature,</hi>
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) in the World. And <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
too, and that most commonly,
we would express by the Word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
a Semi-deity, or other strange
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48184:27"/>
kind of Being, such as this Discourse
examines the Notion of. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these more Absolute Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if I may so call them, of the word
<hi>Nature;</hi> it has divers others (more
Relative) as <hi>Nature</hi> is wont to be set
in Opposition or Contradistinction
to other things; as, when we say of
a Stone when it falls downwards,
that it does it by a <hi>Natural motion;</hi>
but that if it be thrown upwards, its
motion that way is violent. So Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
distinguish Vitriol into <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
and <hi>Fictitious,</hi> or made by Art,
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the Intervention of Human
Power or Skill; so 'tis said, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kept suspended in a sucking
Pump, is not in its <hi>natural</hi> place, as
that is, which is Stagnant in the Well.
We say also, that Wicked Men are
still in the state of <hi>Nature;</hi> but the
Regenerate, in a state of <hi>Grace:</hi> That
Cures wrought by Medicines, are <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Operations; but the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ones, wrought by Christ and
his Apostles, were Supernatural.
Nor are these the only Forms of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48184:28"/>
Speech, that a more diligent Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
than I think it necessary I
should here be, might instance in,
to manifest the Ambiguity of the
word <hi>Nature,</hi> by the many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things 'tis applied to signifie;
tho' some of those already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
should be judged too near to be
co-incident. Among <hi>Latin</hi> Writers
I found the acceptions of the word
<hi>Nature</hi> to be so many, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
one Author reckons up no
less than fourteen or fifteen. From
all which 'tis not difficult to gather,
how easie 'tis for the generality of
Men, without excepting those that
write of <hi>Natural</hi> Things, to impose
upon others and themselves, in the
use of a word so apt to be mis-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
            <p>On this occasion I can scarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to tell you, that I have often
look'd upon it as an unhappy thing,
and prejudicial both to Philosophy
and Physick; that the word <hi>Nature</hi>
hath been so frequently, and yet so
unskilfully imploy'd, both in Books
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48184:28"/>
and in Discourse, by all sorts of Men,
Learned and Illiterate. For the very
great Ambiguity of this term, and the
promiscuous use Men are wont to
make of it, without sufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to its different Significations,
makes many of the Expressions
wherein they imploy it, (and think
they do it well and truly) to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not intelligible, or not proper,
or not true: Which Observation,
tho' it be not heeded, may, with the
help of a little attention, be easily
verified; especially because the Term
<hi>Nature</hi> is so often used, that you shall
scarce meet with any Man, who, if
he have occasion to discourse any
thing long of either Natural or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Subjects, would not find
himself at a great loss, if he were
prohibited the use of the word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and of those Phrases whereof
it makes the principal part. And I
confess I could heartily wish, that
Philosophers, and other Learned
Men (whom the rest in time would
follow) would by common (tho'
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48184:29"/>
perhaps Tacite) consent, introduce
some more Significant, and less am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
Terms and Expressions in
the room of the too licenciously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
word <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Forms
of Speech that depend on it. Or
would, at least, decline the use of
it, as much as conveniently they
can; and where they think they must
imploy it, would<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> add a word or two,
to declare in what clear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
sense they use it. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
somewhat of this kind be done,
Men will very hardly avoid being led
into divers mistakes, both of things,
and of one another; &amp; such wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
about Words and Names, will
be (if not continually multiplied)
still kept on foot, as are wont to be
manag'd with much heat, tho' little
use, and no necessity.</p>
            <p>And here I must take leave to
complain, in my own excuse, of the
scarce superable Difficulty of the
Task, that the design of a <hi>Free Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
puts me upon. For 'tis far more
difficult than any one that hath not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48184:29"/>
try'd, (and I do not know that any
Man hath,) would imagine, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
long of the Corporeal Works
of God, and especially of the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> that are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>Nature,</hi> and yet decline
making oftentimes use of that Term,
or Forms of Speech whereof 'tis a
main part; without much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and perhaps tedious, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions;
than I am willing to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with. And therefore I hope
you will easily excuse me, if, <hi>partly</hi>
to shun these, and to avoid using
often the same words too near one
another, and <hi>partly</hi> out of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to imploy Vulgar Terms, likely to
occasion or countenance Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
I have <hi>several times</hi> been fain
to use Paraphrases or other Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
less short than those commonly
received: And <hi>sometimes</hi> for one or
other of these Reasons, or out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence,
miss'd of avoiding the
Terms used by those, that admit and
applaud the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
whom, I must <hi>here</hi> advertise
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48184:30"/>
you, that <hi>partly</hi> because they do so,
and <hi>partly</hi> for brevity's sake, I shall
<hi>hereafter</hi> many times call, <hi>Naturists:</hi>
Which Appellation I rather chuse
than that of <hi>Naturalists;</hi> because,
many, even of the Learned among
them, as Logicians, Orators, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
Arithmeticians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not
Physiologers.</p>
            <p>But if on this occasion you should
be very urgent to know, what Course
I would think expedient, if I were to
propose any, for the avoiding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
use of so Ambiguous a
Word, as <hi>Nature:</hi> I should <hi>first</hi> put
you in mind, that, having but very
lately declar'd, that I thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
difficult, in Physiological Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
especially, to decline the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of that Term; you are not to
expect from me the satisfaction you
may desire in an Answer. And <hi>then</hi>
I would add, that yet my unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be altogether silent, when
you require me to say somewhat,
makes me content to try, whether
the mischief complain'd of, may not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48184:30"/>
be in some measure either obviated
or lessen'd, by looking back upon
the (Eight) various significations,
that were not long since deliver'd
of the Word <hi>Nature,</hi> and by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to express them in other
Terms, or Forms of Speech.</p>
            <p>1. Instead then of the Word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
taken in the first sense, <hi>[for
Natura Naturans,]</hi> we may make
use of the Term 'tis put to signifie,
namely, <hi>God;</hi> wholly discarding an
Expression, which, besides that 'tis
harsh and needless, and in use only
among the School-men, seems not
to me very suitable to the profound
Reverence we owe the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
since it seems to make the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi>
differ too little by far from a
<hi>Created</hi> (not to say an <hi>Imaginary)</hi>
Being.</p>
            <p>2. Instead of <hi>Nature</hi> in the second
sense, [for, <hi>That on whose account a
Thing is what it is, and is so call'd,]</hi>
we may imploy the Word <hi>Essence,</hi>
which is of great Affinity to it, if not
of an adequate import. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48184:31"/>
also we may make use of the
Word <hi>Quiddity,</hi> which, though a
somewhat Barbarous Term, is yet
frequently imploy'd, and well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
understood, in the Schools;
and, which is more considerable, is
very comprehensive, and yet free
enough from Ambiguity.</p>
            <p>3. What is meant by the Word
<hi>Nature</hi> taken in the third sense of it,
[for, <hi>what belongs to a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at its Nativity, or accrues to it by
its Birth,]</hi> may be express'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
by saying, that a Man or other
Animal is <hi>Born</hi> so; and sometimes
by saying, that a Thing has been <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated</hi>
such; and sometimes also,
that 'tis thus or thus Qualifi'd by its
<hi>Original Temperament and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Instead of the Word <hi>Nature</hi>
taken in the fourth Acception [for,
an <hi>Internal Principle of Local Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]</hi>
we may say sometimes, that this
or that Body <hi>Moves as it were,</hi> or else
that it <hi>seems to Move, spontaneously</hi>
(or <hi>of its own accord)</hi> upwards,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48184:31"/>
downwards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or, that 'tis put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this or that Motion, or determin'd
to this or that Action, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of such or such (proper) Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>5. For <hi>Nature</hi> in the fifth signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
[for, the <hi>establish'd course of
Things Corporeal]</hi> 'tis easie to substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
what it denotes, <hi>the establish'd
Order,</hi> or <hi>the setled Course of Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Instead of <hi>Nature</hi> in the sixth
sense of the Word [for, <hi>as Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of the Powers belonging to a Body,
especially a Living one]</hi> we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the <hi>Constitution, Temperament,</hi>
or the <hi>Mechanism,</hi> or the <hi>Complex of
the Essential Properties or Qualities,</hi> and
sometimes the Condition, the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
or the Texture of that Body.
And if we speak of the greater Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World, we may make use
of one or other of these Terms, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of the World, System of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Cosmical Mechanism,</hi> or the
like.</p>
            <p>7. Where Men are wont to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Word <hi>Nature</hi> in the seventh
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48184:32"/>
sense [for, the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> or the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme
of the Corporeal Works of God]</hi>
'tis easie, and as short, to make use
of the Word <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Vniverse;</hi> and
instead of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>
to substitute the <hi>Phaenomena of the
Vniverse,</hi> or <hi>of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. And, as for the Word <hi>Nature</hi>
taken in the eighth and last of the
fore-mention'd Acceptions [for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as some <hi>Pagans</hi> styl'd Her) <hi>a
Goddess,</hi> or a kind of <hi>Semi-Deity]</hi>
the best way is not to imploy it in
that sense at all; or at least as seldom
as may be, and that for divers Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which may in due place be met
with in several Parts of this Essay.</p>
            <p>But though the foregoing Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Terms and Phrases may be
much increas'd, yet I confess it makes
but a part of the Remedy, I propose,
against the future mischiefs of the
confus'd Acception of the Word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and the Phrases grounded on it.
For besides the Synonymous Words,
and more literal Interpretations late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propos'd, a dextrous Writer may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48184:32"/>
oftentimes be able to give such a
Form (or, as the Modern <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
speak, such a <hi>Tour)</hi> to his many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
variable Expressions, as to avoid
the necessity of making use of the
Word <hi>Nature;</hi> or sometimes so
much as of those shorter Terms, that
have been lately substituted in its
place. And to all this I must add,
that <hi>though</hi> one or two of the eight
fore-mention'd Terms or Phrases, as
<hi>Quiddity</hi> and <hi>Cosmical Mechanism,</hi> be
Barbarous or Ungenteel; and some
other expressions be less short than
the Word <hi>Nature: Yet</hi> 'tis more the
Interest of Philosophy to tolerate a
harsh Term, that has been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Schools in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sense, and bear with some Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastical
Expressions, than not to
avoid an Ambiguity that is liable to
such great inconveniences as have
been lately, or may be hereafter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</p>
            <p>There are, I know, some Learned
Men, who, (perhaps being startled
to find <hi>Nature</hi> usually spoken of so
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48184:33"/>
much like a kind of <hi>Goddess,)</hi> will
have the <hi>Nature</hi> of every thing, to be
only the <hi>Law</hi> that it receives from
the Creator, and according to which
it acts on all occasions. And this
Opinion seems much of kin to, if not
the same with, that of the famous
<hi>Helmont,</hi> who justly rejecting the
<hi>Aristotelian</hi> Tenent of the Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Hostility of the Elements, will
have every Body, without any such
respect, to act that which 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to act. And indeed this
Opinion about <hi>Nature,</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clear nor comprehensive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
seems capable of a fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And there is oftentimes
some resemblance between the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and regular Motions of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Bodies, and the Actions of
Agents, that, in what they do act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to Laws. And even I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
scruple not, to speak of the
Laws of Motion and Rest, that God
has establish'd among things Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
and now and then, (for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake, or out of Custom) to call
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48184:33"/>
them, as Men are wont to do, the
<hi>Laws of Nature:</hi> Having in due
place declar'd, in what sense I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and imploy these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But to speak strictly, (as becomes
Philosophers in so weighty a matter)
to say that the <hi>Nature</hi> of this or that
Body, is but <hi>the Law of God prescrib'd
to it,</hi> is but an improper and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Expression. For, <hi>besides</hi> that
this gives us but a very defective <hi>Idea</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> since it omits the general
Fabrick of the World, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of particular Bodies, which
yet are as well necessary as Local
Motion itself, to the production of
particular <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Phaenomena's;
besides</hi> this, I say, and other imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of this <hi>Notion of Nature,</hi> that
I shall not here insist on, I must
freely observe, that, to speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a <hi>Law</hi> being but a <hi>Notional Rule
of Acting according to the declar'd
Will of a Superior,</hi> 'tis plain, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an Intellectual Being can
be properly capable of receiving and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48184:34"/>
acting by a <hi>Law.</hi> For if it does not
understand, it cannot know what
the Will of the <hi>Legislator</hi> is; nor can
it have any Intention to accomplish
it, nor can it act with regard to it;
or know, when it does, in Acting,
either conform to it or deviate from
it. And <hi>'tis intelligible to me,</hi> that
God should at the Beginning impress
determinate Motions upon the Parts
of Matter, and guide them, as he
thought requisite, for the Primordial
Constitution of Things: and that ever
since he should, by his ordinary and
general Concourse, maintain those
Powers, which he gave the Parts of
Matter, to transmit their Motion
thus and thus to one another. But <hi>I
cannot conceive,</hi> how a Body, devoid
of understanding and sense, truly so
call'd, can moderate and determine
its own Motions; especially so, as to
make them conformable to Laws,
that it has no knowledg or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of. And that Inanimate Bodies,
how strictly soever call'd <hi>Natural,</hi>
do properly act by Laws, cannot be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48184:34"/>
evinc'd by their sometimes acting
Regularly, and, as Men think, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to determinate Ends: Since in
Artificial things we see many Motions
very orderly perform'd, and with a
manifest Tendency to particular and
pre-design'd Ends; as in a Watch,
the Motions of the Spring, Wheels
and other parts, are so contempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and regulated, that the Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Dyal moves with a great Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and seems to moderate its
Motion, so as not to arrive at the
Points, that denote the time of the
day, either a minute sooner, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
later, than it should do, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the hour. And when a Man
shoots an Arrow at a Mark, so as to
hit it, though the Arrow moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Mark, as it would if it
could and did design to strike it, yet
none will say, that this Arrow moves
by a Law, but by an External, tho'
well directed, Impulse.</p>

            <p>II. BUT possibly the Definition
of a Philosopher may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
us from the perplexities, to
which the Ambiguous expressions of
common Writers expose us. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought fit to to consider, with a
somewhat more than ordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the Famous Definition of
<hi>Nature</hi> that is left us by <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
which I shall recite rather in <hi>Latin</hi>
than in <hi>English,</hi> not only because 'tis
very familiarly known among Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
in that Language, but because
there is somewhat in it, that I confess
seems difficult to me, to be without
Circumlocution render'd intelligibly
in <hi>English: Natura</hi> (says
He) <hi>est Principium &amp;
causa Motus &amp; Quietis
ejus,<note place="margin">2 Phys. c. 1. l. 3.</note> in quo inest, primo per se, &amp; non
secundum accidens.</hi> But <hi>though</hi> when
I consider'd that according to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48184:35"/>
the whole World is but a System
of the Works of <hi>Nature;</hi> I thought
it might well be expected, that the
Definition of a thing, the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
in Natural Philosophy, should
be clearly and accurately deliver'd;
<hi>yet</hi> to me this celebrated Definition
seem'd so dark, that I cannot brag of
any assistance I received from it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the framing of a clear and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
<hi>Notion of Nature.</hi> For I
dare not hope, that what, as to me,
is not itself intelligible, should make
me understand what is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or explicated by it. And when
I consulted some of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
upon the sense of this Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I found the more considerate
of them so puzzled with it, that their
Discourses of it seem'd to tend, rather
to free the Maker of it from Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
and Self-contradiction, than to
manifect that the Definition itself is
good and instructive, and such as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a fair account of the thing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd.
And indeed, <hi>though</hi> the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Veneration they cherish for their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48184:36"/>
Master, engages them to make the
best they can of the Definition given
by him, even when they cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it without strain'd Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>yet</hi> what every one seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in gross, almost every one of
them censures in parcels; this Man
attacking one part of the Definition,
and that Man another, with Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so weighty, (not to call some
of them so unanswerable) that if I
had no other Arguments to urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, I might borrow enough
from the Commentators on it, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
my dislike of it.</p>
            <p>However, we may hereafter have
occasion to consider some of the main
parts of this Definition, and in the
mean while, it may suffice that we
observe, that several things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
receiv'd as belonging to the
<hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Notion of Nature,</hi> that are
not manifestly or not at all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in this <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Definition,
which doth not declare, whether the
Principle or Cause (which Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
already makes the sense doubtful)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48184:36"/>
here mention'd is a Substance, or an
Accident; and if a Substance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Corporeal or Immaterial, nor is
it clearly contain'd in this Definition,
that <hi>Nature</hi> does all things most
wisely, and still acts by the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
ways without ever missing
of her end, and that she watches
against a <hi>vacuum</hi> for the welfare of
the Universe, to omit divers other
things, that you will find ascrib'd to
her in the following Section: To which I now proceed.</p>
            <p>That the great shortness of this
Third Section may not make it too
disproportionate in length, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
this Tract consists of; I shall
in this place, though I doubt it be not
the most proper that could be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
endeavour to remove betimes
the Prejudice, that some Divines and
other Pious Men may perhaps enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
upon the account, as they think,
of Religion, against the care I take,
to decline the frequent use of that
Word <hi>Nature,</hi> in the Vulgar Notion
of it: Reserving to another and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48184:37"/>
place some other things, that may
relate to the Theological scruples, if
any occur to me, that our <hi>Free Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
may occasion.</p>
            <p>The Philosophical Reason that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
me to forbear, as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
I can, the frequent use of
the Word <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Forms
of Speech that are deriv'd from it, is,
That 'tis a Term of great Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
On which score I have observ'd,
that, being frequently and unwarily
imploy'd, it has occasion'd much
darkness and confusion in many Mens
Writings and Discourses. And I
little doubt, but that others would
make the like Observations, if early
Prejudices and universal Custom did
not keep them from taking notice of
it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think my self oblig'd, by
the just Veneration I owe and pay
<hi>Religion,</hi> to make use of a Term so
inconvenient to <hi>Philosophy.</hi> For I
do not find that for many Ages the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> that then were the only
People and Church of God, made
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48184:37"/>
use of the Word <hi>Nature</hi> in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Notion of it. <hi>Moses</hi> in the whole
History of the Creation, where it had
been so proper to bring in this first
of second Causes, has not a word of
<hi>Nature.</hi> And whereas Philosophers
presume, that she, by her Plastick
Power and Skill, forms Plants and
Animals out of the Universal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the Divine Historian ascribes
the Formation of them to Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>Fiat.</hi> Gen. i. 11. <hi>And God
said, let the Earth bring forth Grass,
and the Herb yielding Seed, and the
Fruit tree yielding Fruit after his
kind,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Vers. 24, God
said, Let the Earth bring forth the
living Creature after its kind,</hi> &amp;c.
Vers. 25, <hi>And God</hi> (without any
mention of <hi>Nature) made the Beast
of the Earth after his kind.</hi> And I
do not remember, that in the Old
Testament, I have met with any one
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word that properly signifies
<hi>Nature,</hi> in the sense we take it in.
And it seems, that our <hi>English</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
of the Bible were not more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48184:38"/>
fortunate in that, than I; for, having
purposely consulted a late Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
I found not that Word <hi>Nature</hi>
in any Text of the Old Testament.
So likewise, though <hi>Iob, David</hi> and
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and other <hi>Israelitish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
do, on divers occasions, many
times mention the <hi>Corporeal Works of
God,</hi> yet they do not take notice of
<hi>Nature,</hi> which our Philosophers
would have his great <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in
what relates to <hi>them.</hi> To which,
perhaps it may not be impertinent to
add, that, though the late famous
<hi>Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel,</hi> has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
written a Book of numerous
Problems touching the Creation, yet
I do not remember that he imploys
the Word <hi>Nature,</hi> in the receiv'd
Notion of it, to give an account of
any of Gods Mundane Creatures.
And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, who
was no stranger to the Heathen
Learning, writing to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
who were <hi>Greeks,</hi> speaks of the
Production of Corn out of Seed
sown, he does not attribute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48184:38"/>
Body to <hi>Nature,</hi> but when he
had spoken of a <hi>grain of
Wheat,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xv. 37, 38.</note> or some other seed</hi>
put into the ground, he
adds, that <hi>God gives it such a Body as
he pleaseth, and to every seed its own
Body,</hi> i. e. the Body belonging to its
kind. And a greater than St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
speaking of the gaudiness of the <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
(or, as some will have it, <hi>Tulips</hi>)
uses this Expression, <hi>If God so cloath
the grass of the Field,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matt.</hi> vi.
28, 29, 30. The Celebrations that
<hi>David, Iob,</hi> and other Holy <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
mention'd in the Old Testament,
make an occasion of the admirable
Works they contemplated in the
Universe, are address'd directly to
<hi>God</hi> himself, without taking notice
of <hi>Nature.</hi> Of this, I could multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Instances, but shall here, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity's
sake, be contented to name a
few, taken from the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi>
alone. In the hundredth of those
<hi>Hymns,</hi> the Penman of it makes this,
<hi>That God has made us,</hi> the ground of
an Exhortation, <hi>To enter into his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48184:39"/>
Gates with Thanksgiving, and into his
Courts with Praise,</hi> Psal. lxxix. 34.
And in another, <hi>Let the Heaven and
Earth praise God,</hi> [that is, give Men
ground and occasion to Praise Him]
congruously to what <hi>David</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
says to the Great Creator of
the Universe. <hi>All thy work's shall
praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints
shall bless thee,</hi> Psal. cxlv. 10. And
in another of the Sacred Hymns, the
same Royal Poet says to his Maker,
<hi>Thou hast cover'd me in my Mothers
womb. I will praise thee, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
are thy works, and that my soul
knoweth right well,</hi> Psal. cxxxix. 13,
14.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one may not on this occasion
add, that, if Men will need takes in
a Being subordinate to God, for the
management of the World; it seems
more consonant to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to depute <hi>Angels</hi> to that charge,
than <hi>Nature.</hi> For I consider, that,
as to the <hi>Coelestial</hi> Part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48184:39"/>
in comparison of which the
<hi>Sublunary</hi> is not perhaps the ten-thousandth
part; both the Heathen
<hi>Aristotelian</hi>'s, and the School Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
among the <hi>Christians,</hi> teach,
the <hi>Coelestial Orbs</hi> to be moved or gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Intelligences,</hi> or <hi>Angels.</hi> And
as to the lower or <hi>sublunary World,</hi>
besides that the Holy Writings teach
us, that <hi>Angels</hi> have been often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by God for the Government
of Kingdoms, (as is evident out of
the Book of <hi>Daniel)</hi> and the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and Punishment of particular
Persons; one of those Glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
is, in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
expresly styl'd <hi>the Angel
of the Waters:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xvi. 5.</note> Which
Title divers Learned Interpreters
think to be given him, because of his
Charge or Office, to oversee and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Waters. And I remember,
that in the same Book there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of an Angel, that
had <hi>Power,<note place="margin">Rev. xiv. 18.</note> Authority,</hi> or
<hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>)
<hi>over the Fire:</hi> And though the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48184:40"/>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> gives another conjecture
of the Title given the <hi>Angel of the
Waters;</hi> yet in his Notes
upon the next Verse save
one,<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> he teaches, That
there was an Angel appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Souls that were kept under
the Altar there-mention'd. And if
we take the <hi>Angel of the Waters</hi> to
be the Guardian or Conserver of
them, (perhaps as the <hi>Romans</hi> (in
whose Empire St. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote) had
special Officers to look to their Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
and other Waters;) it may
not be amiss to observe (upon the
by) that he is introduc'd <hi>Praising</hi>
his and his fellow-Spirits Great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator:
Which is an Act of Religion,
that, for ought I know, none of the
<hi>Naturists,</hi> whether <hi>Pagan</hi> or even
<hi>Christians,</hi> ever mention'd their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to have perform'd.</p>
            <p>I know it may on this occasion be
alledg'd, that <hi>subordinata non pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and <hi>Nature</hi> being <hi>God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
her</hi> Works are indeed <hi>his.</hi> But
that he has such a Vicegerent, it is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48184:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one of the main businesses of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
to call in Question, and till
the Affirmative be solidly prov'd,
(nay, and tho' it were so) I hope I
shall be excus'd, if with <hi>Moses, Iob,</hi>
and <hi>David,</hi> I call the Creatures, I
admire in the visiible World, <hi>the
Works of God,</hi> (not <hi>of Nature)</hi> and
praise rather <hi>Him</hi> than <hi>Her,</hi> for the
wisdom and goodness displayed in
them: Since among the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
till they were over-run and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Idolatrous Nations, there was
for many Ages a deep silence of such
a Being, as we now call <hi>Nature.</hi>
And I think it much more safe and
fit, to speak as did those, who for
so long a time were the peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>God,</hi> than which the <hi>Heathen
Poets</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who were
very prone to ascribe Divinity to <hi>his</hi>
Creatures, and sometimes even to
<hi>their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mention these things, not with
Design to ingage in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
about the Authority or Use of
the Scripture in Physical Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48184:41"/>
but to obviate or remove a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
that (as I formerly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
I fear may be taken up, upon
the account of Theology or Religion,
against my studiously unfrequent
imploying the word <hi>Nature,</hi> in the
vulgar sense of it; by shewing, that,
Whether or no the Scriptures be not
design'd to teach us higher and more
necessary Truths than those that
concern Bodies, and are discovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the meer light of Reason;
both its expressions and its silence
give more countenance to our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
than to that of the <hi>Naturists.</hi>

by <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, as great a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi>
as he was, has not been able

what <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought <hi>Nature</hi> to be,

<hi>yet</hi> the best way, I know, to inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigate
the commonly receiv'd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Nature,</hi> is, to consider what
<hi>Effata</hi> or <hi>Axioms</hi> do pass for current

Writers, and by the generality of

            <p>From all these Particulars put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it may appear, that the
<hi>vulgar Notion of Nature</hi> may be
conveniently enough expres'd by
some such Description as this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nature</hi> is a most wise Being, that
<hi>does nothing</hi> in vain, <hi>does not</hi> miss of
her Ends; <hi>does always</hi> that which
(of the things she can do) is best to
be done; and this she <hi>does</hi> by <hi>the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48184:42"/>
most direct</hi> or <hi>compendious ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
employing any things superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>nor</hi> being wanting in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
she teaches &amp; inclines every
one of her Works to preserve it self.
And, as in the <hi>Microcosm (Man)</hi>
'tis she that is the Curer of Diseases,
so in the <hi>Macrocosm (the World,)</hi> for
the conservation of the Universe,
she abhors a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> making parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Bodies act contrary to their
own Inclinations and Interests, to
prevent it, for the publick Good.</p>
            <p>What I think of the Particulars,
that make up this Paneygrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Nature,</hi> will (God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting)
be told you in due place;
my present work being only to make
you the clearest Representation I
can, of what Men generally (if they
understand themselves) <hi>do,</hi> or with
Congruity to the Axioms they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and use, <hi>ought</hi> to conceive <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to be.</p>
            <p>'Tis not unlike that you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
or wish, that on this occasion,
I should propose some Definition or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48184:43"/>
Description of <hi>Nature,</hi> as my own.
But declining (at least at present)
to say any thing, Dogmatically,
about this matter, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I may not, on this occasion,
confess to you, that I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been so Paradoxical, or (if you
please) so Extravagant, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain,
as a serious Doubt, what
I formerly intimated, <hi>viz. Whether
Nature be a Thing, or a Name?</hi> I
mean, whether it be a <hi>real</hi> Existent
Being, or a <hi>notional</hi> Entity, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of kin to those fictitious Terms,
that Men have devis'd, that they
might compendiously express several
things together, by one Name? as
when, for Instance, we speak of the
<hi>Concocting Faculty</hi> ascrib'd to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
those that consider, and are
careful to understand, what they
say, do not mean I know not what
Entity, that is distinct from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, as 'tis an Engine curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
contriv'd, and made up of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and fluid parts; but, observing
an actuating power and fitness in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48184:43"/>
the Teeth, Tongue, Spittle, Fibres
and Membranes of the Gullet and
Stomach, together with the natural
Heat, the Ferment, or else the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,)</hi>
and some other Agents, by
their Co-operation, to cook or dress
the Aliments, and change them into
Chyle; observing these things, I
say, they thought it convenient, for
brevity's sake, to express the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex</hi>
of those Causes, and the <hi>Train
of their Actions,</hi> by the summary
<hi>Appellation</hi> of <hi>concocting Faculty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst I was indulging my self,
in this kind of Ravings, it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my mind, that the <hi>Natuists</hi> might
demand of me, How, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
their Notion, I could give
any tolerable Account of those, most
useful, Forms of Speech, which Men
imploy, when they say, That <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does this</hi> or <hi>that;</hi> or, That <hi>such
a thing is done by Nature,</hi> or <hi>according
to Nature,</hi> or else happens <hi>against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
And this Question I thought the
more worth answering, because these
Phrases are so very frequently us'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48184:44"/>
by Men of all sorts, as well Learned
as Illiterate, that this Custom hath
made them be thought, not only
very convenient, but necessary; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that I look upon it as none
of the least things, that has procur'd
so general a reception to the <hi>vulgar
notion of Nature,</hi> that these ready
and commodious Forms of Speech
suppose the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>It may therefore, in this place,
be pertinent to add, That such Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as, that <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Faculty,</hi> or
<hi>Faculty,</hi> or <hi>Suction, doth this or that,</hi>
are not the only ones, wherein I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that Men ascribe to a <hi>notional</hi>
thing, that which, indeed, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by <hi>real</hi> Agents; as, when
we say, that the <hi>Law</hi> punishes Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with Death, that it protects the
Innocent, releases a Debtor out of
Prison, when he has satisfied his
Creditors (and the Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice)
on which, or the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
we may justly say, That 'tis
plain that the <hi>Law,</hi> which, being in
it self a dead Letter, is but a <hi>notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48184:44"/>
Rule, cannot, in a Physical sense,
be said to perform these things;
but they are really performed by
Judges, Officers, Executioners, and
other Men, acting according to
that Rule. Thus, when we say,
that <hi>Custom does this or that,</hi> we
ought to mean only, that such
things are done by proper Agents,
acting with Conformity to what
is usual, (or customary) on such
Occasions. And, to give you an yet
more apposite Instance, do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how many Events are wont to
be ascrib'd to <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>Chance;</hi> and
yet <hi>Fortune</hi> is, in reality, no Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cause of any thing, (for which
Reason probably it is, that Ancienter
Naturalists than <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
intimates, take no notice of it,
when they treat of <hi>Natural</hi> Causes,)
and only denotes, that those Effects,
that are ascribed to it, were produc'd
by their true and proper Agents,
without intending to produce them;
as, when a Man shoots at a Deer,
and the Arrow lightly glancing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48184:45"/>
the Beast, wounds some Man that
lay beyond him, unseen by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
'tis plain, that the Arrow is
a Physical Agent, that acts, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its Fabrick and Motion, in
both these Effects; and yet Men will
say, that the slight hurt it gave the
Deer, was brought to pass accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the course of <hi>Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Archer design'd to shoot
the Beast; but the mortal Wound,
it gave the Man, happen'd by
<hi>Chance<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi> because the Archer intended
not to shoot Him, or any Man else.
And, whereas divers of the old
<hi>Atomical Philosophers,</hi> pretending
(without good Reason, as well as
against Piety) to give an account
of the Origin of things, without
recourse to a Deity, did sometimes
affirm the World to have been made
by <hi>Nature,</hi> and sometimes by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
promiscuously employing those
Terms: They did it, (if I guess a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right)
because they thought neither
of them to denote any true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Physical Cause,</hi> but rather certain
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48184:45"/>
               <hi>Conceptions,</hi> that we Men have, of
the manner of acting of true and
proper Agents. And therefore,
when the <hi>Epicureans</hi> taught, the
World to have been made by <hi>Chance,</hi>
'tis probable, that they did not look
upon <hi>Chance,</hi> as a True and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonick
Cause of the System of
the World, but believ'd all things
to have been made by the <hi>Atoms,</hi>
considered as their Conventions and
Concretions into the Sun, Stars,
Earth, and other Bodies, were
made without any Design of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
those Bodies.</p>
            <p>Whilst this Vein of framing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes
yet continued, I ventur'd to
proceed so far, as to Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one may not infer, from what
hath been said, That the chief Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
a Philosopher receives from
what Men call <hi>Nature,</hi> be not, that
it affords them, on divers occasions,
a Compendious way of expressing
themselves? Since (thought I,) to
consider things otherwise than in a
Popular way, when a Man tells me,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48184:46"/>
that <hi>Nature does such a thing,</hi> he does
not really help me to understand, or
to explicate, how it is done. For it
seems manifest enough, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is done in the World, at least
wherein the rational Soul intervenes
not, is really effected by Corporeal
Causes and Agents, acting in a
World so fram'd as Ours is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws of Motion setled by
the Omniscient Author of things.</p>
            <p>When a Man knows the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of a <hi>Watch</hi> or <hi>Clock,</hi> by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the several pieces of it, and
seeing how, when they are duely
put together, the Spring or Weight
sets one of the Wheels a work, and
by that another, till by a fit Conse
cution of the Motions of these and
other parts, at length the <hi>Index</hi>
comes to point at the right Hour of
the Day: The Man, if he be wise,
will be well enough satisfied with
this knowledge of the Cause of the
propos'd Effect, without troubling
himself to examine, whether a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Philosopher will call the time-measuring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48184:46"/>
Instrument, an <hi>Ens per se,</hi>
or an <hi>Ens per accidens?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it performs its Operations by
virtue of an internal Principle, such
as the Spring of it ought to be? or
of an external one, such as one may
think the appended Weight? And,
as he, that cannot, by the Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
affections of the parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
matter, explicate a <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
will not be much help'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how the Effect is produc'd,
by being told, that <hi>Nature</hi> did it:
<hi>So,</hi> if he can explain it Mechanically,
he has no more need to think, or
(unless for brevity's sake) to say,
that <hi>Nature</hi> brought it to pass, than
he, that observes the Motions of a
Clock, has to say, that 'tis not the
<hi>Engine,</hi> but 'tis <hi>Art,</hi> that shews the
Hour; whereas, without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that general and uninstructive
Name, he sufficiently understands
how the parts, that make up the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
are determin'd by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and the <hi>Series</hi> of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48184:47"/>
to produce the Effect that is
brought to pass.</p>
            <p>When the lower end of a Reed,
being dipp'd, for Instance, in Milk or
Water, he that holds it, does cover
the upper end with his Lips, and
fetches his Breath, and hereupon
the Liquor flows into his Mouth:
We are told, that <hi>Nature</hi> raiseth it
to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and this way
of raising it, is call'd <hi>Suction;</hi> but,
when this is said, the word <hi>Nature</hi>
does but furnish us with a short
Term, to express a concourse of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Causes; and so does in other
Cases, but what the Word <hi>Suction</hi>
does in this. For neither the one,
nor the other, helps us to conceive,
how this, seemingly spontaneous,
Ascension of a heavy Liquor is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
which they that know, that
the outward Air is a heavy fluid,
and gravitates, or presses, more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>other parts</hi> of the Liquor, than
the Air, contained in the Reed,
(which is rarefy'd by the Dilatation
of the Sucker's <hi>Thorax)</hi> does upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48184:47"/>
the <hi>included part</hi> of the Surface, will
readily apprehend, that the smaller
pressure will be surmounted by the
greater, and, consequently yield to
the Ascension of the Liquor, which
is, by the prevalent external pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
impell'd up into the Pipe, and
so into the Mouth, (as I, among
others, have elswhere fully made
out.) So that, according to this
Doctrine, without recurring to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s
Care, to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
one that had never heard of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick
Notions of <hi>Nature,</hi> or of
<hi>Suction,</hi> might very well understand
the mention'd <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> And
if afterwards he should be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the receiv'd Opinions,
and Forms of Speech, us'd on this
occasion, he would think, that so to
ascribe the Effect to <hi>Nature,</hi> is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
if not also erroneous; and that
the common Theory of <hi>Suction</hi> can
afford him nothing, but a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Term, to express, at once the
Concourse of the Agents, that make
the Water ascend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48184:48"/>
How far, I think, these extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Reasonings may be admitted,
you will be enabled to discern, by
what you will hereafter meet with,
relating to the same Subjects, in the
VII. Section of this Discourse. And
therefore, returning now to the rise
of this Digression, namely, That
'tis not unlike you may expect, I
should, after the Vulgar Notion of
<hi>Nature,</hi> that I lately mention'd,
without acquiescing in it, substitute
some Definition or Description of
<hi>Nature,</hi> as Mine: I hope you will
be pleas'd to remember, that the
Design of this Paper was, to <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi>
not <hi>propose</hi> a new one of my own.
And indeed the Ambiguity of the
Word is so great, and 'tis, even by
Learned Men, usually employ'd to
signifie such different things; that,
without enumerating &amp; distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its various Acceptions, 'twere
very unsafe to give a Definition of
it, if not impossible to deliver one
that would not be liable to Censure.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48184:48"/>
I shall not therefore presume to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
a thing, of which there is yet
no settled and stated Notion agreed
on among Men. And yet, that I
may, as far as I dare, comply with
your couriosity, I shall tell you, that
if I were to propose a Notion, as
less unfit than any I have met with,
to pass for the <hi>principal Notion</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
with regard to which, many
Axioms and Expressions, relating
to that Word, may be not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
understood, I should distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the <hi>universal,</hi> and the
<hi>particular Nature</hi> of Things. And,
of <hi>universal Nature,</hi> the Notion, I
would offer, should be some such as
this, That <hi>Nature is the Aggregate
of the Bodies, that make up the World,
framed as it is, considered as a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by virtue whereof, they Act and
Suffer according to the Laws of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
prescrib'd by the Author of Things.</hi>
Which Desrciption may be thus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras'd,
That <hi>Nature,</hi> in general,
is, <hi>The Result of the Vniversal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Corporeal Substance of the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48184:49"/>
considered as it is contrived
into the present Structure and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the World, whereby all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that compose it, are inabled to act
upon, and fitted to suffer from, one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to the setled Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
I expect, that this Description
will appear <hi>Prolix,</hi> and require to be
heedfully perus'd: But the Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateness
and Importance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
hindred me from making it
shorter, and made me chuse rather
to presume upon your Attention,
that not endeavour to express my
self intelligibly and warily, about a
Subject of such moment. And this
will make way for the other <hi>(Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate)</hi>
Notion, that is to attend the
former Description: Since the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Nature,</hi> of an <hi>Individual Body,</hi>
consists in the <hi>general</hi> Nature, <hi>apply'd
to a distinct portion of the Vniverse.</hi>
Or rather, supposing it to be plac'd,
as it is, in a World, fram'd by God,
like Ours, it consists in a <hi>Convention
of the Mechanical affections</hi> (such as
Bigness, Figure, Order, Scituation,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48184:49"/>
Contexture, and Local Motion) <hi>of
its parts,</hi> (whether sensible or insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
<hi>convenient and sufficient to
constitute</hi> in, or <hi>to entitle</hi> to, <hi>its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Species or Denominations, the
particular Body they make up, as the
Concourse of all these is considered as
the Principle of Motion, Rest, and
Changes, in that Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will have me give to these
two Notions more compendious
Expessions, now that, by what
hath been said, I presume, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
my Meaning; I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
what I call'd <hi>General Nature,</hi>
by <hi>Cosmical Mechanism,</hi> that is, a
Comprisal of all the Mechanical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
(Figure, Size, Motion, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
that belong to the matter of the
great System of the Universe. And,
to denote the <hi>Nature</hi> of this or that
Particular Body, I shall style it, the
Private, the Particular, or (if you
please) the Individual <hi>Mechanism</hi> of
That Body; or, for Brevity's sake,
barely the <hi>Mechanism</hi> of it, that is,
the <hi>Essential. Modification,</hi> if I may
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48184:50"/>
so speak, by which, I mean, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal
of all its Mechanical Affections
conven'd in the Particular Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
as 'tis determinately plac'd,
in a World so constituted, as Ours is.</p>
            <p>'Tis like, you will think it strange,
that in this Description I should
make the <hi>present Fabrick of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
a Part, as it were, of the
Notion I frame of <hi>Nature,</hi> though
the generality of Philosophers, as
well as other Men, speak of Her, as
a plastick Principle of all the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
Bodies, as if they were Her Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
and therefore they usually call
them, the <hi>Works of Nature;</hi> and the
Changes that are observ'd in them,
the <hi>Phaenomena of Nature.</hi> But, for
my part, I confess, I see no need to
acknowledg any Architectonick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
besides <hi>God,</hi> Antecedent to the
first Formation of the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> whose School
either devis'd, or mainly propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Received Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi>
conceiving (not only Matter, but)
the World to be Eternal, might look
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48184:50"/>
upon it, as the <hi>Province,</hi> but could
not, as the <hi>Work of Nature,</hi> which,
in their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is its <hi>Guardian,</hi>
without having been its <hi>Architect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> themselves, that
would refer all things, that are done
in the World, to <hi>Nature,</hi> cannot,
according to their Principles, make
what they now call <hi>Nature,</hi> to have
been Antecedent to the first Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our present World. For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> whilst
their numberless <hi>Atoms</hi> wildly rov'd
in their infinite <hi>Vacuity,</hi> they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
belonging to them, but <hi>Bigness,
Figure</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi> And 'twas by
the Coalition, or Convention of these
<hi>Atoms,</hi> that the World had its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
So that, according to
them, it was not <hi>Nature,</hi> but
<hi>Chance,</hi> that Fram'd the World;
though afterwards, this Original
Fabrick of things, does, by virtue of
its Structure, and the innate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loseable
motive power of <hi>Atoms,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
things in the same state for the
main; &amp; this course, though casually
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48184:51"/>
fallen into, &amp; continued without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
is that, which, according to their
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> ought to pass for <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as meer Reason doth not
oblige me to acknowledge such a
<hi>Nature,</hi> as we call in Question, Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Origin of the World;
so neither do I find, that any <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
contain'd in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
clearly teaches, that there was
then such a Being. For, in the History
of the <hi>Creation,</hi> 'tis expresly said,
that <hi>In the beginning God made the
Heavens and the Earth;</hi> and, in the
whole Account that <hi>Moses</hi> gives of
the progress of it, there is not a word
of the Agency of <hi>Nature;</hi> and, at
the later end, when God is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
as making a re-view of all the
Parts of the Universe, 'tis
said,<note place="margin">Gen. i. 31.</note> that <hi>God saw every
thing that he had made;</hi>
and 'tis soon after added,
that <hi>He blessed and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Seventh Day,<note place="margin">Gen. ii. 3.</note> because, in it,</hi>
(or rather, <hi>just before it,</hi> as I find
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Particle elsewhere us'd,)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48184:51"/>
               <hi>He had rested from all his Works,
which God created and made.</hi> And tho'
there be a passage in the Book of
<hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. xxxviii. 4, 6, 7.</note> that, probably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
argues the <hi>Angels</hi>
(there call'd, the <hi>Sons of God)</hi> to have
existed, either at the beginning of the
first Day's Work, or some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it; yet 'tis not there so much
as intimated, that they were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operators,
with their Maker, in the
Framing of the World, of which
they are represented as <hi>Spectators</hi>
and <hi>Applauders,</hi> but not so much as
<hi>Instruments.</hi> But since <hi>Revelation,</hi>
as much as I always reverence it, is,
I confess, a Foreign Principle in
this <hi>Philosophical Enquiry,</hi> I shall
wave it here, and tell you, That,
when I consult only the Light of
Reason, I am inclin'd to apprehend
the First Formation of the World,
after some such manner as this.</p>
            <p>I think it probable, (for I would not
Dogmatize on so weighty, and so
difficult a Subject,) that the Great
and Wise Author of Things, did,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48184:52"/>
when he first Form'd the universal
and undistinguish'd matter, into the
World, put its Parts into various
Motions, whereby they were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
divided into numberless Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of differing Bulks, Figures, and
Scituations, in respect of each other.
And that, by his Infinite Wisdom
and Power, he did so guide and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
the Motions of these Parts, at
the beginning of things, as that
(whether in a shorter or a longer
time, Reason cannot well determine)
they were <hi>finally</hi> dispos'd into that
Beautiful and Orderly Frame, we
call the <hi>World;</hi> among whose Parts
some were so curiously contriv'd, as
to be fit to become the Seeds, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Principles, of Plants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals.
And I further conceive,
that he setled such Laws or Rules, of
Local Motion, among the Parts of
the Universal Matter, that by his
ordinary and preserving <hi>Concourse,</hi>
the several Parts of the Universe,
thus once completed, should be
able to maintain the great Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48184:52"/>
or System and Oeconomy,
of the Mundane Bodies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the <hi>Species</hi> of Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
So that, according to this
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I suppose no other Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of the Universe, but <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whose Almighty Power, still
accompanied with his Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
did at first Frame the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
World, according to the Divine
<hi>Idea</hi>'s, which he had, as well <hi>most
freely,</hi> as <hi>most wisely,</hi> determin'd to
conform them to. For, I think, it
is a Mistake to imagine, (as we are
wont to do) that what is call'd, the
<hi>Nature</hi> of this or that Body, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compris'd in its <hi>own Matter,</hi> and
its (I say not <hi>Substantial,</hi> but) <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Form;</hi> as if from that, or
these only, all its Operations must
flow. For an Individual Body, being
but a Part of the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass'd
with other Parts of the
same great <hi>Automaton,</hi> needs the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
or Concourse, of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
(which are external Agents)
to perform divers of its Operations,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48184:53"/>
and exhibit several <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s, that
belong to it. This would quickly
and manifestly appear, if, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
an Animal or an Herb could
be remov'd into those Imaginary
Spaces, the School-men tell us of,
beyond the World; or into such a
place, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> fancy their
<hi>Intermundia,</hi> or empty Intervals,
between those numerous Worlds,
their Master dream'd of. For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Structures of these living
Engines be, they would as little,
without the Co-operations of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Agents; such as the <hi>Sun, Aether,
Air,</hi> &amp;c. be able to exercise their
Functions, as the great Mills, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
us'd with us, would be to
Grind Corn, without the assistance
of Wind or running Water. Which
may be thought the more credible,
if it be considered, that by the meer
Exclusion of the Air, (tho' not of
Light, or the Earth's Magnetical <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi>
&amp;c.) procur'd by the Air-pump,
Bodies plac'd in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
large Glass, will presently
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48184:53"/>
come into so differing a state, that
warm Animals cannot live in it; nor
flame (tho' of pure Spirit of Wine)
burn; nor Syringes draw up Water;
nor Bees, or such winged Insects, fly;
nor Caterpillars crawl; nay, nor
Fire run along a train of dryed Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder:
All which I speak upon my
own experience. According to the
foregoing <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I consider the
frame of the World already made,
as a Great, and, if I may so speak,
Pregnant <hi>Automaton,</hi> that, like a
<hi>Woman</hi> with Twins in her Womb,
or a <hi>Ship</hi> furnish'd with Pumps, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is such an Engine as
comprises, or consists of, several les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Engines. And this Compounded
<hi>Machine,</hi> in conjunction with the
<hi>Laws of Motion,</hi> freely establish'd
and still maintain'd, by God among
its Parts; I look upon as a <hi>Complex
Principle,</hi> whence results the setled
Order, or Course, of things Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.
And that which happens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this course, may, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speaking, be said to come to pass
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48184:54"/>
               <hi>according to Nature,</hi> or to be <hi>done by
Nature,</hi> and that which thwarts this
Order may be said to be <hi>Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
or <hi>contrary to Nature.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
though Men talk of <hi>Nature</hi> as
they please, yet whatever is done
among things Inanimate, which
make incomparably the greatest part
of the Universe, is really done but
by particular Bodies, acting on one
another by <hi>Local Motion,</hi> Modifi'd
by the other <hi>Mechanical Affections</hi> of
the Agent, of the Patient, and of
those other Bodies, that necessarily
concur to the Effect, or the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
produc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N.</hi> B. Those, that do not relish the
knowledg of the Opinions and Rights
of the Ancient <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi>
may pass on to the next or V. Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and skip the whole following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion,
compris'd between double
Paratheses's, which, though neither
impertinent nor useless to the scope
of this Treatise, is not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48184:54"/>
[In the foregoing (III.) Section
of this Treatise, I hope I have given
a sufficient Reason of my backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to make frequent use of the
Word <hi>Nature,</hi> and now, in this (IV.)
Section, having laid down such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
of <hi>Nature,</hi> as shews that
her Votaries represent her as a <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess,</hi>
or at least a <hi>Semi-Deity:</hi> 'Twill
not be improper in this place, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<hi>some of the Reasons</hi> of my dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
with the <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi>
it self, as well as with the use of the
<hi>Name;</hi> and to shew, why I am not
willing to comply with those Many,
that would impose it upon us as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
friendly to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these reasons I shall the rather
propose, because not only the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of other Learned Men, (as I
just now intimated) but that of
Divines themselves, for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or for some other cause,
seem not to have well consider'd so
weighty a matter.</p>
            <p>To manifest therefore the Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Aspect, that the <hi>Vulgar Notion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48184:55"/>
of Nature</hi> has had, and therefore pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
may have, on <hi>Religion;</hi> I think
fit, in a general way, to premise,
what things they are, which seem to
me to have been the Fundamental
Errors, that mis-led the Heathen
World, as well Philosophers as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For, if I mistake not, the
looking upon meerly Corporeal, and
oftentimes Inanimate Things, as if
they were endow'd with Life, Sense,
and Understanding; and the ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to <hi>Nature,</hi> and some other <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
(whether real or imaginary)
things that belong but to <hi>God,</hi> have
been some, (if not the chief) of the
Grand Causes of the <hi>Polytheism</hi> and
<hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most Ancient <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (taking
the word in its laxer sense) or at
least one of the earliest, seems to have
been the Worship of the <hi>Coelestial
Lights,</hi> especially the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon:</hi>
That kind of <hi>Aboda zara,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
(as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers call strange
or false Worships) being the most
Natural, as having for its Objects,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48184:55"/>
Glorious Bodies, Immortal, always
regularly mov'd, and very beneficial
to Men. There is Recorded, in the
<hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> a Passage of <hi>Iob,</hi> who
is probably reputed to be, at least, as
Antient as <hi>Moses,</hi> which seems to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that this Worship, of the two
great Luminaries, was practis'd in
his time, and look'd upon as <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
by Religious Men, and, as our
<hi>English</hi> Version renders the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Words, <hi>Punishable by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
If,</hi> says <hi>Iob, I beheld the Sun
when it shined, or the Moon walking in
brightness: And my heart hath been
secretly inticed, or my mouth hath kiss'd
my hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> xxxi. 26, 27. And
that this <hi>Idolatry</hi> was practis'd in
<hi>Moses</hi>'s time, may be gather'd from
that Passage in <hi>Deuteromy. And
lest thou lift up thine eyes unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp; when thou seest the Sun, &amp; the
Moon, and the Stars, even all the Host
of Heaven. shouldst be driven to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them, &amp; serve them,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 4. 19.
The <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> or, as many Criticks call
them, the <hi>Zabians,</hi> are by some very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48184:56"/>
Learned Men thought to have been
the earliest <hi>Idolaters:</hi>
And the ablest of the
<hi>Iewish Rabbies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">More Nevoch. lib. iii. cap. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi>
makes them to be so Antient,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was put to Dispute
against them. And their Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had so over-spread the East, in
<hi>Moses</hi>'s time, that the same <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
judiciously observes, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Ceremonial Laws, given
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> were instituted in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Idolatrous Opinions,
Magical Rites, and other Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of these <hi>Zabians.</hi> Of this, he
(seconded therein by our Famous
<hi>Selden)</hi> gives several Instances; to
which,<note place="margin">Histor. Orientalis. lib. i. cap. 8.</note> some are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Learned
<hi>Hottinger.</hi> But this
only upon the By; my purpose, in
mentioning these <hi>Zabians,</hi> being to
observe to you, that they look'd upon
the <hi>Planets,</hi> and especially the <hi>Sun</hi> and
<hi>Moon,</hi> as <hi>Gods,</hi> &amp; Worshipp'd them
accordingly, taking them for <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Beings,</hi> that had a great Interest
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48184:56"/>
in the Government of the World.</p>
            <p>This may be prov'd out of some
<hi>Eastern</hi> Writers, especially <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi>
who, in one
place,<note place="margin">Lib. iii. cap. 36.</note> asserts the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
to have Ador'd
the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Host of
Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. xvii. &amp; 16. 2 Chron. xxxiii. &amp; 3.</note> (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
styles the <hi>Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Lights</hi>) as true
Gods. And this we shall the less
wonder at, if we consult another
place of the same
Learned Author,<note place="margin">Mor. Nevoch. lib. iii. cap. 25.</note>
where he informs the
Readers, that these Idolaters (the
<hi>Zabians</hi> or <hi>Chaldaeans)</hi> made Statues
of Silver and Gold, those for the <hi>Sun,</hi>
and these for the <hi>Moon;</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Consecrated by certain Rites and
Ceremonies, did invite, and, as it
were, attract the Spirits of these Stars
into those Shrines: Whence they
would speak to their Worshippers,
acquaint them with things Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and even Predict to them things
to come. And of some such sort of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48184:57"/>
               <hi>speaking-Images,</hi> some learned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
suppose the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi>
(as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Text calls them)
to have been,<note place="margin">Gen. xxxi. &amp; xix. vers. 30.</note> that <hi>Laban</hi> so priz'd,
as to call them <hi>his Gods:</hi> Which 'tis
guess'd <hi>Rachel</hi> stole from her Father,
lest, by consulting them, he might
learn what way her Husband and his
Company had taken in their flight.
And the same great <hi>Rabbi,</hi> having
inform'd his Readers that he saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Books of the <hi>Zabian Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
somewhere mentions one or two,
that treated of <hi>speaking-Images.</hi> And
'twas perhaps from these <hi>Zabians,</hi> or
their Disciples, that <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Stoical Sect, taught, as
<hi>Stobaeus</hi> informs us, that the Sun,
Moon, and the rest of the Stars were
indow'd with Understanding and
Prudence. And <hi>Seneca,</hi> an eminent
Champion of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
Sect,<note n="*" place="margin">Sen. de Benef. lib. vii. cap. 21.</note> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<hi>Epicurus</hi> and
<hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> (whose Disciple he was
in that Opinion) that they held the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48184:57"/>
Sun to be a burning Stone, or an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
of Casual Fires, and any

            </p>
            <p>I am sorry, I could not avoid think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to have
been involv'd in the great Error we

which Supposition, he presently
attempts to give some such Account
of the Origin of the World's Frame,

            </p>
            <p>But this upon the By. Nor did
this Opinion, of the Divinity of the
Coelestial Bodies, die with the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
or the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers.
For I found, by some Questions I
propos'd to an Inquisitive Person,
who, having liv'd many years in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and several of the Neighbouring
Kingdoms, had acquired Skill enough
in the Tongues to converse with the
Natives; I found, I say, that in a
solemn Conference he had with some
of the more Eminent and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Doctors of the <hi>Chineses</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they frankly profest, that they
Believe the Heavenly Bodies to be
truely Divine, and to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd,
and that upon this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ground, That they imparted to
Men such good things, as Light,
Heat, Rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Consequences of these.
And this Belief they declar'd, they
thought more Rational, than that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48184:59"/>
of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who Worship a
Deity, whose neither Shape, nor
Colour, nor Motion, nor Efficacy
on Sublunary things, were at all
visible. It agrees very well with
the Opinion of the
Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> who,
as <hi>Origen</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Origen. <hi>cont.</hi> Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum. l. <hi>v.</hi>

I will not here enquire, whether
these Old Heathen Philosophers did,
besides the Stars and other Beings,
that they ador'd as Gods, Believe
one only <hi>Numen</hi> or Supream Deity.
But that may suffice for my present
purpose, which seems manifest, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they ascrib'd to Sensible Beings,
Attributes peculiar to the True
God; that this was occasion'd by
their thinking them Intelligent and
Governing, and that these Inferiour
Beings were, by far, the most usual
and familiar Objects both of their
Discourses and their Worship, and
that they did (to use the Phrase of
the Apostle of the Gentiles) Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

do the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the
whole Heavenly Host, since all these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Heavenly Quire, do with just
Men celebrate the Supream God, and his
only Begotten [Son.]</hi> The Boldness
of these unjustified Paradoxes I the
the less wonder at, when I consider,
what has for many Ages been taught
by the School Philosophers, from
<hi>Aristotle;</hi> namely, that the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial

Powerful and Active Beings.
'Tis true, that in the Jews and

the malignity of the Error, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd,
was Corrected and Master'd
by the sound and Orthodox Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
they held together with it.
But still 'tis dangerous for those, that

God,</hi> to Adopt Premises that
have been able to Mis-lead such Great
Persons, and from which many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Philosophers have plausibly
enough drawn Consequences very
repugnant to true Religion. Nor are
Christians themselves so much out
of danger of being seduc'd by these
Heathenish Notions, about an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
World, but that (not again to
mention the Apostate Emperor) even
in these times there is lately sprung
up a Sect of Men, as well professing
Christianity, as pretending to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;
who (if I be not mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of their Doctrine) do very
much symbolize with the Ancient
Heathens, and talk much indeed of
God, but mean such a One, as is
not really distinct from the Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Intelligent Universe; but
is, on that account, very differing
from the True God, that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Believe and Worship. And,
though I find the Leaders of this
Sect to be look'd upon, by some
more Witty than Knowing Men, as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48184:62"/>
the Discoverers of unheard of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
in Physicks and Natural The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology;
yet their <hi>Hypothesis</hi> does not
at all appear to me to be <hi>new,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when I remember, besides the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of the Ancients, cited in this
Paper, some others of the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
such as is particularly that of
<hi>Lucan.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The great Affinity between the
<hi>Soul of the World,</hi> so much talk'd
of among the Heathen Philosophers,
and the thing that Men call <hi>Nature,</hi>
makes it fit for me to take notice, in
this place, of the Influence which
the Belief of that <hi>Imaginary Soul</hi> had
upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with reference to
Religion.</p>
            <p>That divers of the Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
held the <hi>World</hi> to be Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48184:63"/>
hath been observed by more
than one Learned Man. But that
which makes more for my present
purpose, is, that the same Old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
did also (at least for the most
part) Believe, that this <hi>Mundane
Soul</hi> was not barely a Living, but
a most Intelligent and wisely Active
Being. This may be easily enough
discerned by him, that shall heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
peruse <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi>'s Lives
of the Philosophers, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Zeno.</hi> But at present I shall
rather make use of an Author, who,
though he be very seldom cited for
Philosophical History, seems to me
to have been very well vers'd in it.
The Writer I mean, is the Acute
Sceptick <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> (who is
thought to have lived about <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s
time, and by some, to have been
his Nephew;) who recites a long
Ratiocination of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> which,
whether it be solid or not, is at least
ingenious and plausible, but too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix
to be Transcrib'd in this place,
where it may suffice to say, that he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48184:63"/>
thus concludes: <hi>Est ergo Mundus
mente praeditus &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sextus Empir. adversus Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. <hi>lib.</hi> 8.</note>
&amp;c. which
Assertion <hi>Sextus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thus proposes for
him; <hi>Si non esset aliqua Mens in Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
neque ulla Mens in te esset. Est
autem in te Mens aliqua; ergo est
etiam in Mundo. Et Ideo Mundus est
Mente &amp; Intelligentia praeditus.</hi> The
same Sceptick introduces <hi>Zeno Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens.</hi>
discoursing thus; <hi>quod immittit
semen ejus quod est particeps rationis, est
ipsum quoque rationis particeps. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
autem emittit Semen ejus quod est
particeps rationis; est ergo Mundus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
particeps.</hi> To which Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
I might add many others out
of the same Author, who, in the
same Discourse, tells us, That the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> held the <hi>World</hi> to be an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi>
But the Opinion that the Old
Philosophers, we have been speaking
of, held of the World's being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with an Understanding or
Rational Soul, will be yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by what I now proceed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to manifest how this Opinion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48184:64"/>
of theirs led them to the Worship of
another, than the True <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> in the lately ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Discourse of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> infers
from the <hi>Worlds</hi> being an <hi>Intelligent</hi>
Being, that it is also a <hi>Divine</hi> One;
for to the lately recited Conclusion,
<hi>Est ergo Mundus mente praeditus &amp;
intelligens,</hi> he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subjoins this Other,<note place="margin">P. M. 326.</note> 
               <hi>Et
ideo Deus.</hi> And alittle
after, repeating their Discourse that
defended this Argumentation of
<hi>Xenophon</hi> against an Objection, he
concludes their Reasoning thus; <hi>Ideo
Mundus est mente &amp; Intelligentia prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus:
Cum sit autem Mente &amp; Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia
praeditus, est etiam Deus. Quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum</hi>

            <p>If it be objected, that the Passages,
I have cited out of Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
concern the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi>
and not <hi>Nature;</hi> I Answer, that the
Affinity of these Two is so great, that
divers of the Old Sages seem to have
confounded them, and not to have

and pernicious Errors they were led
into, by the Belief that the Universe

with Life, but Understanding and
Providence, may suffice to make us
<hi>Christians</hi> very Jealous of admitting
such a Being, as that which Men
venerate under the Name of <hi>Nature:</hi>
Since they ascribe to it as many
wonderful Powers and Prerogatives,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48184:65"/>
as the Idolaters did to their Ador'd
<hi>Mundane Soul.</hi> But I shall give a
further Answer to the above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Objection, if I can shew, how
Sacrilegiously they abus'd the Being
we are speaking of, as well under

that of the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> On
this occasion I remember a Passage

            <p>To the <hi>recital</hi> of the Irreligious
Errors of the Ancient Heathens,
about the <hi>Divinity of the World,</hi> and
some of its Principal Parts, as the
<hi>Sun, Moon, Stars, Aether,</hi> &amp;c. I
should add a <hi>redargution</hi> of them;
if I thought it necessary, in this place,
solemnly to refute Opinions, some of
which are altogether <hi>precarious,</hi> and
others very <hi>improbable.</hi> Those <hi>Greek</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48184:67"/>
and <hi>Latin</hi> Philosophers, that held the
<hi>Sun</hi> to be a Fire, were much at a loss
to find out Fuel to maintain the
Flame. But those <hi>Zabians</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>
that thought him indow'd, not
only with a living Soul, but with
Understanding and Will, must, if
they had duly consider'd things, have
ben much more puzzled, to find not
only Food for so vast a Body, (above
160 times bigger than the <hi>Terraque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Globe)</hi> but to find in him the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
necessary to the preparation
and digestion of that Food, and to
the other Functions that belong to
Animal-Nutrition. And, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the <hi>Cartesian Hypothesis,</hi> the Way
whereby the Sun, fix'd Stars, and
Planets, are Generated, will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifest them to be neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
nor Living Bodies. And,
perhaps, I could here propose a quite
other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> about the <hi>Nature</hi>
of the Sun, and the Fuel of its Fire,
that may be countenanc'd by some
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> and <hi>Experiments,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making him other than an Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48184:68"/>
and altogether Inanimate Body,
whose Flame needs to be repair'd by
Fuel furnish'd to it nearer hand, than
from the Sea or Earth. But I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
omit such Objections against
the Opinion I oppose, as, though
drawn from the Dictates of sound
Philosophy, about the Origine of
things, may be question'd without
being to be clear'd in few words.
'Tis also without proof, that 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
and asserted, That the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Bodies, newly mention'd,
are indow'd with Understanding
and Prudence, especially, so as to
be able to know the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Transactions of Men, and
hear and grant the Prayers of their
Worshippers. And the Moon, which
was one of their Principal Deities,
and by them prefer'd before all the
other Planets and Stars, the Sun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
is so Rude and Mountainous
a Body, that 'tis a wonder that Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Men, who consider'd how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
how various, and how noble
Functions belong to a sensitive Soul,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48184:68"/>
could think, a Lump or Mass of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so very remote from being fitly
Organiz'd, should be Animated and
Govern'd by a true living &amp; sensitive
Soul. I know that both these Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Coelestial Globes, and
also the Heathen Disciples of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
besides divers of the same
mind, even among the <hi>Christians,</hi>
say great and lofty things of the
Quintessential Nature of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies, and their consequent Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility;
of the Regularity of
their Motions, and of their Divine
Quality of Light, that makes them
refulgent. But the persuasion they
had, of this Quintessential Nature of
the Superior Part of the World, was
not, if I guess aright, grounded upon
any solid Physical Reason, but was
entertain'd by them for its Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Opinion they had of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of the Coelestial Bodies: Of
which, <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">See Lib. xi. cap. 3.</note>
especially in his
Books <hi>De Coelo,</hi> speaks
in such a way, as hath not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48184:69"/>
among his Followers; to such
an excessive Veneration for those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as is neither agreeable to true
Philosophy, nor friendly to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
He himself takes notice, that
the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> held
our <hi>Earth</hi> to be One
of the Planets,<note place="margin">Aristot. de Coelo. l. xi. c. 13.</note> and
that it moved about the Sun, which
they plac'd in the middle of the
World. And since this Hypothesis,
of the Earths Motion, was in the last
Age reviv'd by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> not only
those great Men <hi>Keplerus, Galileo,</hi>
and <hi>Gassendus,</hi> but most of the best
Modern Astronomers; and, besides
<hi>Des-Cartes</hi> and his Sect, many other
Naturalists have imbrac'd this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis:</hi>
Which, indeed, is far more
agreeable to the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> not only
than the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (who
was plainly mistaken about the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Consistence of the Heavens)
but than the Ancient and generally
received <hi>Ptolomaick</hi> System. Now,
supposing the <hi>Terraqueous Globe</hi> to be
a Planet, he that considers, that 'tis
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48184:69"/>
but a round Mass of very Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Substances, (as appears by
the differing Natures of its great
constituent Parts, <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea)</hi>
whose Surface is very rude and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and its Body opacous, unless as
it happens to be inlightned by the
the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and so
very Inorganical for so much as Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
that it seems wholly unfit to
be a living Animal, much less a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
one. I say, he that considers
such things will scarce be forward
to ascribe Understanding and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
much less a Divine Nature,
to the other Stars. As for Instance,
to the Moon, which our best Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes
manifest to be a very Craggy
and Mountainous Body, consisting
of Parts of very differing Textures,
(as appears by her brighter Parts
and permanent Spots) and which
of herself is Opacous, having no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Light, but what she borrows
from the Sun, and perhaps from the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48184:70"/>
As for the boasted Immutability
of the Heavenly Bodies, besides that
it may be very probably call'd in
question by the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of some
(for I do not say every one) of the
Comets, that by their <hi>Parallax</hi>
were found to be above the Moon,
and consequently in the Coelestial
Region of the World; besides this,
I say, the Incorruptibleness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
of the Heavenly Bodies
is more than probably disproveable
by the sudden and irregular Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Changes and Destruction, of
the Spots of the Sun: Which are
sometimes so suddenly destroyed,
that, I remember, in the Year
1660. on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> having left
in the Morning a Spot, whose Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we had long observ'd through an
excellent Telescope, with an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
that it would last many days
visible to us, we were surpriz'd to
find, that when we came to observe
it again in the Evening, it was quite
dissipated, though it seemed thick;
and by comparing it to the Sun, we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48184:70"/>
estimated the extent of its Surface to
be equal to that of all <hi>Europe.</hi> As to
the constancy of the motions of the
Stars; if the Earth, which we know to
be Inanimated, be a Planet, it moves
as constantly and regularly about the
Sun, (in that which they call the
Great Orb,) as the other Planets
do, or as the Moon doth about the
Earth. And I consider, that though
we should suppose our Globe not to
be a Planet, yet there would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
be a constant motion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
enough, of a great Part of it:
Since (bating some Anomali's, that
Shores, Winds, and some other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
things, occasion,) there is
a Regular Ebbing and Flowing twice
a Day, and also Spring-Tides twice
a Month, of that vast Aggregate
of Waters, the Ocean; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is not inferior in Bulk to the
whole Body of the Moon, and
whereof also vast Tracts are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
observed to Shine.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, Whereas a great
Proof of the Divinity of the Stars
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48184:71"/>
is taken from their Light; though
I grant it to be the noblest of Sensible
Qualities, yet I cannot think it a
good proof of the Divine, or very
Excellent, <hi>Nature</hi> of Bodies endow'd
with it, whether they be Coelestial
or not. For whereas the <hi>Zabians</hi>
and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> Consider'd and Ador'd
the Planets, as the Chief Gods, our
Telescopes discover to us, that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Sun, (if he be one, rather than
a Fix'd Star) they Shine but by a
borrow'd Light; in so much that
<hi>Venus,</hi> as vividly Luminous as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to the naked Eye, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
seen (as I have beheld it)
Horn'd like the Moon in no long
time after her Change. And at this
rate also the Earth, whether it be a
Planet or no, is a Luminous Body,
being enlightned by the Sun: And
possibly, as a Body forty times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
communicates more Light to
the Moon, than it receives from
Her, as is probably Argued from the
Light seen on the Surface of the
Moon in some of Her Eclipses. And,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48184:71"/>
though in the Night, when the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath widened the Pupils of our
Eyes, and the Moon Shines with an
unrival'd Lustre, she seems exceeding
Bright, yet she may be, for ought I
know, more Opacous than the solid
Part of the Terrestrial Globe. For
I remember, that I have more than
once heedfully observ'd a small Cloud
in the West, where the Moon then
was, about Sun-set; and comparing
them together, the little Cloud,
as Opacous and Loose a Body as it
was, reflected the Light as strongly
to my Eye, as did the Moon, that
seem'd perhaps to be not far from It,
both of them appearing like little
whitish Clouds, though afterwards,
as the Sun descended lower and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
beneath the Horizon, the Moon
grew more and more Luminous.
And, speaking of Light Indfienitely,
'tis so far from Arguing a Divine <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in the Bodies that are endow'd
with it, whether, as the <hi>Planets,</hi> by
participation from an External Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
or as the <hi>Sun,</hi> from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48184:72"/>
Principle; that a burn'd Stone,
witness that of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> will afford,
in proportion to its Bulk, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
more borrow'd Light than one
of the Planets. And a Light from
its Internal Constitution may be
found, not only in such abject Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as Insects, whether winged, as
the <hi>Cucupias</hi> of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> or creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as our Glow-worms; but also
in Bodies Inanimate and Corrupted,
as in rotten Wood, in stinking Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and divers other putrify'd
Fishes. I cannot now stay to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
how the <hi>Zabians,</hi> and such
Idolaters as they, could make out
the Connexion, Symmetry, and
Subordination or Dependance of the
several Parts of the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of so many different and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Beings, endowed not only with
Animal Souls, but with their Distinct
and Peculiar Understandings and
Wills, and many of them also with
Divine <hi>Nature.</hi> Nor shall I consider,
how strange a Monster, rather than
an Animal and a Deity, those many
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48184:72"/>
Heathen Philosophers and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
must make of the Universe,
who held it to be but <hi>one;</hi> and yet
were of the Paradoxical Opinion,
that (as hath been elsewhere noted)
is roundly profess'd by <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> at
the very beginning of his Physical
Eclogues, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>These, I say, and the like Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against the Pagan Doctrine,
I must not now insist on, because I
perceive that I have slipp'd into a
somewhat long Digression, which yet
perhaps may not be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
or useless,) which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall here break off, to resume
and conclude the Discourse, that
this Section was allotted to, which
I might easily have enlarg'd, but I
presume there is enough said in it
already, to let you see, that 'tis a
dangerous thing to Believe other
Creatures, than Angels and Men,
to be Intelligent and Rational; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48184:73"/>
to afcribe to any of them an
Architectonick, Provident and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Power. And though I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
acknowledge, that that there is
no great danger, that <hi>well Instructed</hi>
Christians should, like some Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Worship <hi>Nature</hi> as a <hi>Goddess;</hi>
yet the things I formerly alledg'd,
to shew it unsafe to cherish Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of kin to those that mis-led a
Multitude even of Philosophers,
make me fear too many, and not a
few of the Learned themselves, may
have a Veneration for what they call
<hi>Nature,</hi> much greater than belongs
to a meer Creature: If they do not,
to use a Scripture Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25.</note>
               <hi>Worship the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
above</hi> or <hi>besides</hi> the
<hi>Creator,</hi> who, and not the <hi>World,</hi>
nor the <hi>Soul</hi> of It, is the True <hi>God.</hi>
And though I should grant, that the
received Notion of <hi>Nature</hi> doth
neither subvert, nor much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any Principle of <hi>Religion:</hi> Yet
that is not enough for the purpose
of those <hi>Naturists</hi> I Reason with,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48184:73"/>
since they are here supposed to make
it a fault in others, not to ascribe to
the <hi>Nature</hi> they Venerate, as much as
themselves do: And they represent
their own Notion of it, not only as
Innocent, but as very Useful, if not
necessary to Religion.]</p>

         <div n="5" type="section">

            <p>IV. I Come now, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> to
acquaint you with some of
the Reasons, that have made me
backward to entertain such a Notion
of <hi>Nature,</hi> as I have hitherto Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of. And I shall at present
comprise them under the following
five.</p>
            <p>I. The first whereof, is, That
such a <hi>Nature,</hi> as we are speaking of,
seems to me to be either asserted, or
assum'd without sufficient Proof.
And this single Reason, if it be well
made out, may, I think, suffice for
my turn. For, in matters of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48184:74"/>
where we ought not to take up
any thing upon Trust, or believe it
without Proof, 'tis enough to keep
us from believing a thing, That we
have no positive Argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to assent to it, though we
have no particular Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. And, if this Rule be to
take place in lesser Cases, sure it
ought to hold in this, where we are
to entertain the belief of so <hi>Catholick</hi>
an <hi>Agent,</hi> that all the others are
look'd upon but as its Instruments,
that act in subordination to it; and
which, being said to have an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Agency in many of the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
of the World, cannot but be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be Demonstrable by divers
of them. I have yet met with no
Physical Arguments, either Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative,
or so much as considerably
Probable, to evince the Existence of
the <hi>Nature,</hi> we examin. And, though
I should admit the use, that some
Divines contend for, of the <hi>Holy
Scriptures</hi> in Philosophical Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
yet I should not be persuaded
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48184:74"/>
of the Existence of the <hi>Nature,</hi> we
Dispute of. For, I do not remember,
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> any where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to us, that there is such a thing,
(in the sense by me question'd)
though (as I formerly noted more
fully in the IV. Section,) in <hi>Genesis</hi>
and some other places, where the
Corporeal Works of God are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated of, (though in order to
Spiritual ends) one might probably
enough expect to find some mention
of God's Grand Vicegerent in the
Universe of Bodies, if he had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
any such. But, whatever be
the true cause of the <hi>Scriptur's</hi> silence
about this matter, the silence itself is
sufficient to justifie me, for examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freely, by <hi>Reason,</hi> a thing that is
not impos'd on my belief by <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And, as for the Physical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that may be brought in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the question'd Notion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
I shall, e're long, examine the
Principal of them, and shew that
they are not Convincing. To these
things may be added, as to the Proof
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48184:75"/>
drawn from the <hi>General Opinion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Nature,</hi> That, being a Popular,
not a Physical Argument, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
pass for currant with the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
but ought not to do so with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.</p>
            <p>II. The second Reason is taken
from the Unnecessariness of such a
<hi>Nature,</hi> as is pretended. For, since a
great part of the Work of true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
has been, to reduce the
Principles of things to the smallest
Number they can, without making
them insufficient; I see not, why we
should take in a Principle, of which
we have no need. For, supposing
the common <hi>Matter</hi> of all Bodies to
have been at first divided into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
minute Parts, by the Wise
Author of <hi>Nature,</hi> and these Parts to
have been so dispos'd of, as to form
the World, constituted as it now is;
and <hi>especially,</hi> supposing that the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Laws of Motion,</hi> among the
Parts of the <hi>Matter,</hi> have been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,
and several Conventions of
Particles contrived into the Seminal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48184:75"/>
Principles of various things; all
which may be effected by the meer
<hi>Local Motion</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> (not <hi>left to
itself,</hi> but <hi>skilfully guided</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World) if (I say)
we suppose these things, together
with God's ordinary and general
Concourse, which we very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
may: I see not, why the same
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that we now observe in
the World, should not be produc'd,
without taking in any such Powerful
and Intelligent Being, distinct from
<hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Nature</hi> is represented to be.
And, 'till I see some Instance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the contrary, I am like to
continue of this mind, and to think
that the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we observe, will
genuinely follow from the meer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
and Constitution of the World.
As, supposing the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> to
have been put, at first, into such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about the Earth, as Experience
shews they have; the determinate
Celerity of these Motions, and the
Lines, wherein they are performed,
will make it necessary, that the Moon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48184:76"/>
should be sometimes Full, sometimes
scarce Illuminated at all to us-ward,
sometimes Horned, and, in a word,
should exhibit such several <hi>Phases</hi>
as every Month she doth, and that
at some times <hi>She</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> should
have a Trine, or a Quadrate Aspect,
&amp;c. and that now one, and now the
other of them, should at set times
suffer an <hi>Eclipse:</hi> Though these <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses</hi>
were by the <hi>Romans</hi> and
others of old, and are by many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd
Nations at this day, look'd
upon as Supernatural things; and
though also <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his Followers, fancy'd, that
such Regular Motions could not be
maintain'd without an Assistent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
which He and They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Assign'd to each of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Orbs. And indeed the difficulty,
we find, to conceive, how so great a
Fabrick, as the World, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in Order, and kept from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
again to a <hi>Chaos,</hi> seems to arise
from hence, that Men do not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
consider the unsearchable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48184:76"/>
of the Divine Architect or
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> (as the
Scripture styles him)
of the World,<note place="margin">Heb. xi. 10.</note> whose
piercing Eyes were able to look at
once quite through the Universe, and
take into his Prospect both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and end of Time: So that
perfectly fore-knowing, what would
be the Consequences of all the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conjunctures of Circumstances,
into which <hi>Matter,</hi> divided and
mov'd according to such <hi>Laws,</hi> could,
in an <hi>Automaton</hi> so Constituted as
the Present World is, happen to
be put; there can nothing fall out,
unless when a Miracle is wrought,
that shall be able to alter the Course
of things, or prejudice the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, any further, than He
did from the Beginning foresee, and
think fit to allow.</p>
            <p>Nor am I sure, that the received
Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi> though it be not
<hi>necessary,</hi> is at least <hi>very useful,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
Physical <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> For,
besides that, I shall shew e're long,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48184:77"/>
that several Explications, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to it is presum'd to be the
most advantagious, are not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd:
To give the <hi>Nature</hi> of a
Things for the Cause of this or that
particular Quality, or Operation of
it, is to leave Men as ignorant as they
were before; or, at least, is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that a Philosopher can, in
such Cases, assign no better particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and immediate <hi>Causes</hi> of Things,
than a Shepherd or a Tradesman, that
never learnt Natural Philosophy, can
assign of the same things, and of a
Thousand others. And though it be
true, (as I formerly also intimated)
that, in many Cases, Philosophers
themselves can answer no otherwise,
to such Questions as may be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them, than by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing;
yet such Answerers do not declare
the proper Cause of a Dark <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
but only that he, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
them, does not yet know it:
And so this indefinite Notion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which is equally applicable to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48184:77"/>
the resolving of all difficulties, is not
useful to disclose the thing, but to
delude the Maker of the Question,
or hide the ignorance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer.</p>
            <p>III. My third Argument is, That
the <hi>Nature,</hi> I question, is so dark and
odd a thing, that 'tis hard to know
what to make of it, it being scarce,
if at all, intelligibly propos'd, by
them that lay most weight upon it.
For it appears not clearly, whether
they will have it to be a <hi>Corporeal</hi>
Substance, or an <hi>Immaterial</hi> One, or
some such thing, as may seem to be
betwixt both; such as many <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi>
do represent <hi>substantial Forms,</hi>
and what they call <hi>real Qualities,</hi>
which divers School-men hold to be
(at least by Miracle) separable from
all <hi>Matter</hi> whatsoever. If it be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Corporeal,</hi> I confess, I understand
not, how it can be so Wise, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Omniscient an Agent, as they
would have it pass for. Besides that,
if it be a Body, I would gladly know,
what kind of Body it is, and how,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48184:78"/>
since, among Bodies, there can be no
Penetration of Dimensions, this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can so intimately pervade, as they
pretend <hi>Nature</hi> does, all the other
Bodies of the World? And to
this I would add divers other Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that would not be easily answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
(But I shall resume this Third
Argument in another place.) If it
be said, that <hi>Nature</hi> is a <hi>Semi-substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
as some of the Modernest School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are pleas'd to call <hi>substantial
Forms,</hi> and <hi>real Qualities;</hi> I roundly
answer, that I acknowledge no such
Chymerical and Unintelligible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and shall only desire you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to them a good part of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
made in certain Papers, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by a Chymico-Physical Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
about <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Origine,</hi> and inexplicable <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
of the imaginary <hi>substantial
Forms</hi> of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
therefore, that this <hi>Nature,</hi> we
speak of, if it be any thing positive,
should be an <hi>Immaterial</hi> Substance.
But <hi>to have Recourse to such an one,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48184:78"/>
as a Physical Agent, and not only a
Determiner, but the Grand Author,
of the Motion of Bodies, and that,
especially in such familiar <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
as the Ascension of Water in
<hi>Pumps,</hi> the Suspension of it in <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Pots</hi>
for Gardens, the running of
it through <hi>Siphons,</hi> and I know not
how many others) and <hi>to Explain
its Casuality,</hi> as they speak, will, I
think, prove a Work exceeding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult:
Though I shall not here spend
time to shew you the farther incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of such a Supposition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do that hereafter; and, in the
mean-while, contenting myself to
observe, as to many of the <hi>Naturists,</hi>
That, though their Doctrine may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, they seem rather content to
talk darkly, and uncertainly, of what
they call <hi>Nature,</hi> than by clearly-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
it, expose it to Objections not
easie to be answered, and <hi>who</hi> foresee
the advantage, that the unsetledness
of the Notion gives them, to pretend
Knowledg, or disguise Ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48184:79"/>
IV. Since many of the most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst the <hi>Naturists</hi> are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and not few of them Divines
too, it may not be improper (which
else I should, perhaps, think it would
be,) to add, in this place, that the
next thing, for which I dislike the
Vulgar Notion (or <hi>Idea)</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
is, That I think it dangerous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in general, and consequently
to the Christian.</p>
            <p>For this Erroneous Conceit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds
the True God of divers Acts
of Veneration and Gratitude, that
are due to Him from Men, upon the
account of the Visible World, and
diverts them to that Imaginary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they call <hi>Nature,</hi> which has no
Title to them; for, whilst <hi>Nature</hi> is
suppos'd to be an Intelligent Thing,
that wisely and benignly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
all that is done among Bodies,
'tis no wonder that the generality of
Philosophers, and, after their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of other Men, should admire and
praise Her, for the wonderful, and
for the useful things that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48184:79"/>
in the World. And, in effect,
though <hi>Nature,</hi> in that sense of the
Word I am speaking of, be never
(that I remember) to be found in
the Sacred Writings; yet, nothing
is to be more frequently met with
(and that adorn'd with <hi>Titles</hi> and
<hi>Encomiums)</hi> in the Books of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
than <hi>Nature</hi> and Her Effects.
And, if we consider, that, whatever
has been said, by some, in excuse of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, yet the generality
of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> from whom the
Vulgar Notion of <hi>Nature</hi> is chiefly
receiv'd, made the World to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and referr'd all the Transactions
among the Bodies it contains, to what
they call'd <hi>Nature.</hi> Whence, 'twill
not be difficult to perceive, that, if
they do not quite exclude God, yet,
<hi>as</hi> they leave him no Interest in the
first Formation of the Universe; <hi>so</hi>
they leave him but very little in the
Administration of the Parts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of, especially the Sublunary
Ones. So that, instead of the True
<hi>God,</hi> they have substituted, for us, a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48184:80"/>
kind of a <hi>Goddess,</hi> with the Title of
<hi>Nature:</hi> Which, as they look upon
as the immediate Agent and Director
in all excellent Productions, so they
ascribe to Her the Praise and Glory
of Them.</p>
            <p>Whether this great Error, in a
Point of such Importance, may not
Undermine the Foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
I think it may not irrationally
be suspected. For, since the most
General and Efficacious Argument,
that has persuaded Philosophers,
and other Men, that there is a
<hi>God</hi> and a consideration of the
<hi>Providence,</hi> is afforded by the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
World, wherein so many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and other Things are observ'd,
that are manag'd (or perform'd)
with such Conduct and Benignity,
as cannot justly be ascrib'd but to
the Wisdom and Goodness of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
They that ascribe these Things
to mere <hi>Nature,</hi> do much weaken the
force of that Argument, if they do
not quite take away the necessity of
acknowledging a Deity, by shewing,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48184:80"/>
that, without any need of having
Recourse to Him, of the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World and of what is
perform'd among Things Corporeal,
an Account may be given. <hi>Though,</hi>
when Men are put upon considering
the matter, and press'd to declare
themselves more clearly, they are
asham'd to affirm, that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
are the same Thing, and, will
confess, that She is but his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
<hi>yet,</hi> in Practise, their Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and their Praises are frequently
given to <hi>Nature,</hi> not to <hi>God:</hi> In like
manner, as, <hi>though</hi> the Sun be the
Fountain of Light, and the Moon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
all Hers from the Sun; yet the
Sea, in Its grand Motions of Ebbing
and Flowing, appears to respect the
Moon, and not the Sun: For thus,
the generality of Men, <hi>though</hi> they
will acknowledg that <hi>Nature</hi> is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
and subordinate to <hi>God,</hi> do yet
appear to regard <hi>Her</hi> more than <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be short, <hi>Nature</hi> uses to be so
frequently recurr'd to, and is so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
in the Writings of Physiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48184:81"/>
that the excessive Veneration
Men have for <hi>Nature,</hi> as it has made
some Philosophers (as the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
deny</hi> God, so, 'tis to be fear'd,
that it makes many <hi>forget Him:</hi>
And, perhaps, a suspicious Person
would venture to add, That, <hi>if other
Principles hindred not</hi> (as, I know,
that in many, and, think, that in
most, of the Christian <hi>Naturists</hi> they
do,) the Erroneous <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>
would, too often, be found to have a
strong tendency to shake, if not to
subvert, the very Foundations of all
Religion; mis-leading those that are
inclin'd to be its Enemies, from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
the Necessity of a God, to the
Questioning, if not to the denyal, of
his Existence.</p>
            <p>V. My Fifth and Last Argument
is taken from hence; That I observe
divers <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which do not
agree with the Notion or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Nature,</hi> that I Question.
For, if indeed there were such an
Intelligent, Powerful and Vigilant
Being, as Philosophers are wont to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48184:81"/>
Describe <hi>Nature</hi> to be, divers things
would not be done, which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
assures us are done.</p>
            <p>And here I shall once for all give
an Advertisement, which I desire
may be call'd to mind, whenever
there shall be Occasion, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
part of this Tract, which
is this; That, because Inanimate
Bodies are usually more simple, or
less compounded, and of a slighter
and less complicated or curious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
than Animals or Plants,
I thought fit to chuse most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
I employ, rather among
<hi>lifeless Bodies,</hi> whose Structure and
Qualities are more easy to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
and with Brevity Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of, than among <hi>living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
whose Textures, being Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
are much more intricate and
subtil. And this Course I did not
scruple to take, because the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braters
of <hi>Nature</hi> give her a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or rather an Empire, as large
as the World, and will have her
Care and Jurisdiction reach, as well
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48184:82"/>
to Inanimate as to Living Bodies;
and accordingly most of the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Instances they Alledge, of her
Providence and Power, are taken
from Bodies destitute of Life; as
when they tell us, That the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Water in Sucking-Pumps,
and the Sustentation of it in Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Watering-Pots, are caus'd by
<hi>Nature</hi>'s abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum:</hi>
That heavy Bodies (unhinder'd) fall
to the Ground in a Perpendicular
Line, because <hi>Nature</hi> directs them
the shortest way to the Centre of the
Earth; and that Bubbles Rise thro'
the Water, and Flames Ascend in
the Air, because <hi>Nature</hi> directs these
Bodies to re-join themselves to their
respective Elements; to omit other
Instances of this sort, that there will
be occasion to mention hereafter:
Till when, these may suffice to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
my taking most of my Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from Inanimate Bodies; though
I shall not confine my self to these,
especially when I shall come to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Objections that are taken from
<hi>living Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48184:82"/>
The foregoing Advertisement will
be, I hope, found conducive to clear
the way for my Fifth Argument,
lately propos'd, which concludes,
that, if indeed there were such a
Being, as <hi>Nature</hi> is usually Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be, several things would be
otherwise Administred in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
than Experience shews they
are.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the Particulars
that may be propos'd to make this
good, would swell this Discourse
much beyond the Bulk to which my
Haste obliges me to confine it. But,
to make you amends for the <hi>Paucity</hi>
of <hi>Instances,</hi> I shall now name, by
the <hi>kind</hi> of them, I shall propose
such as, for the most part, are taken
from those very things, whence the
Wisdom and Vigilancy of <hi>Nature</hi>
is wont to be confidently Argued,
which I the rather do, that by such
I may make way for, and shorten
the Answers I am to give to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
e're-long to be Examined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48184:83"/>
First then, Whereas the great
Care and Vigilancy of <hi>Nature,</hi> for
the common Good of the Universe,
is wont to be Demonstrated from the
watchful Care she takes, to prevent
or replenish a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which would
be very Prejudicial to the Fabrick
of the World: I Argue the quite
contrary from the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that
occur about a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
'tis Alledg'd, that <hi>Nature,</hi> in great
Pumps, and in the like Cases, lifts
up the heavy Body of Water in
spight of its tendency towards the
Centre of the Earth, to obviate, or
fill up a Vacuity; and that out of
a Gardener's Pot, or Inverted Pipe,
stopp'd at one end, neither the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor even Quick-Silver, that is
near fourteen times as heavy, will
fall down, lest it should leave a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi>
behind it; I demand how it
comes to pass, that, if a Glass-Pipe
be but a Foot longer than 34 or 35
Feet; or an Inverted Tube, fill'd
with Quick-silver, be but a Finger's
breadth longer than 30 Inches, the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48184:83"/>
Water in the one, and the Quick-silver
in the other, will subside,
though the one will leave but about
a Foot, and the other but about an
Inch, of deserted Space, which they
call <hi>Vacuum,</hi> at the top of the Glass.
Is it possible, that <hi>Nature,</hi> that in
Pumps is said to raise up every Day
so many Hundred Ton of Water,
and, if you will believe the Schools,
would raise it to any height, (left
there should be a <hi>Vacuum)</hi> should
not have the Discretion, or the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to lift up, or sustain, as much
Water as would serve to fill one Foot
in a Glass-Tube, or as much Quick-silver
as an Inch of a slender Pipe
will contain, to obviate or replenish
the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> she is said so much to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor?
sure, at this rate, she must
either have very little Power, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Knowledge of the Power
she has. So likewise, when a Glass-Bubble
is blown very thin at the
Flame of a Lamp, and Hermetically
seal'd whilst 'tis very hot, the Cause,
that is rendered, why 'tis apt to break,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48184:84"/>
when it grows cold, is, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Air, which was before rarefied
by the Heat, coming to be Condens'd
by the Cold, left the space deserted
by the Air, that thus Contracts itself,
should be left void, <hi>Nature,</hi> with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
breaks the Glass in pieces.
But, by these Learned Mens favour,
if the Glass be blown but a little
stronger than ordinary, though at
the Flame of a Lamp, the Bubble, as
I have often tryed, will continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken,
in spight of <hi>Natures</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> Which
needs not at all to be recurr'd to in
the Case. For the Reason, why the
thin Glass-Bubble broke not when
'twas hot, and did when it grew cold,
is plainly this; That, in the former
state, the Agitation of the Included
Air, by the Heat, did so strengthen
the Spring of it, that the Glass was
thereby assisted and enabled to resist
the weight of the Incumbent Air:
Whereas, upon the Cessation of that
Heat, the Debilitated Spring of the
<hi>Internal,</hi> being unable to assist the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48184:84"/>
Glass, as formerly, to resist the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the <hi>External</hi> Air, the Glass
itself being too thin becomes unable
to support the Weight or Pressure of
the Incumbent Air, the Atmosphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pillar, that leans upon a Bubble
of about two Inches Diameter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
to above one Hundred
Pound Weight; as may be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded from a late Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I have try'd, and you may
meet with in another Paper. And
the Reason, why, if the Bubble be
blown of a due thickness, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
whole after it is Cold, is, that
the thickness of it, though but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assisted by the weakned Spring of
the Included Air, is sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Weight of the Incumbent
Air, though, several times, I have
observed, the Pressure of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphaere,
and the resistence of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to have been, by Accident, so
near the <hi>aequipollent,</hi> that a much less
outward Force, than one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
applyed to the Glass, as, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
a Pound, or a less Weight, gently
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48184:85"/>
laid on it, would enable the outward
Air to break it, with Noise, into a
Multitude of pieces. And, now give
me leave to consider, how ill this
Experiment, and the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that happen in Glass-Pipes,
wherein Water and Quick-silver
subside, agree with the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Apprehension, Men have of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
For, if in case She did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the falling down of the Water,
or the Quicksilver, there would be
no such <hi>Vacuum</hi> produced, as She is
said to abhor; Why does She seem
so solicitious to hinder it? And why
does She keep three or four and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Foot of Water in Perpendicular
height, contrary to the nature of all
heavy Bodies, suspended in the Tube?
And, Why does she furiously break
in pieces a thin seal'd Bubble, such
as I come from speaking of, to hinder
a <hi>Vacuum?</hi> if in case She did not
break it, no <hi>Vacuum</hi> would ensue.
And, on the other side, if we admit
her Endeavours, to hinder a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
not to have been superfluous, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48184:85"/>
consequently foolish, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that, where these endeavours
succeed not, there is really produc'd
such a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as She is said to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor.
So that, as I was saying, either
She must be very indiscreet to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Herself, and to transgress Her
own ordinary Laws, to prevent a
danger She need not fear; or Her
strength must be very small, that is
not able to fill a Vacuity, that half a
Pint of Water, or an Ounce of Quick-silver,
may replenish; or break a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Glass-Bubble, which, perhaps, a
Pound Weight on it, would, with
the help of so light a Body as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
Air, crush in pieces.</p>
            <p>The other Grand Instance, that is
given of the Wisdom of <hi>Nature,</hi> and
Her watchfulness for the Good of the
whole World, is, the Appetite She
has Implanted in all heavy Bodies,
to descend to the Centre of the
Earth, and in all light Ones, to
ascend towards Heaven; or, as some
would have it, towards the Element
of Fire, contiguous to the Orb of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48184:86"/>
Moon. But, for positive Levity, 'till
I see it better prov'd, than it hath
hitherto been, I allow no such thing
Implanted in Sublunary Bodies; the
<hi>praepollent</hi> Gravity of some, sufficing
to give others a Comparative or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Lightness. As a piece of
Oak, or the like Wood, being let go
in the Air, falls down by its own Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
or rather by virtue of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of that Gravity; but if it be
let go under Water, it will, though
it be never so great a Log or piece of
Timber, ascend, with a considerable
force, to the top of the Water;
which, I hope, will not be ascribed
to a positive Levity, since, when it
descended in the Air, 'twas by its
Gravity that it did so. But not to
insist on this, nor to take notice, how
wisely <hi>Nature</hi> has Implanted into all
heavy Bodies an Appetite to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the Centre of the Earth,
which, being but a Point, is not able
to contain any one of Them; not to
urge these things, I say, I will only
invite you to consider one of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48184:86"/>
most familiar things that occur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
heavy Bodies.</p>
            <p>For, if, for Example, you let fall a
Ball upon the Ground, it will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
to a good height, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that from whence you let it
fall, or, perhaps, will make several
lesser Rebounds, before it come to
rest. It it be now ask'd, Why the
Ball, being let out of your Hand,
does not fall on this or that side, or
move upwards, but falls directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Centre of the Earth, by
that shortest Line, (which Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitians
call <hi>Linea Directionis)</hi> which
is the Diameter of the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Centre of Gravity of
the Ball? 'Twill be readily Answer'd,
That this proceeds from the Balls
Gravity, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Innate Appetite,
whereby it tends to the Centre of
the Earth the nearest way. But then
I demand, Whence comes this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
<hi>i. e.</hi> this Motion upwards?
For, 'tis plain, 'tis the Genuine Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Motion downwards,
and therefore is encreas'd according
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48184:87"/>
as that Motion in the Ball was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
by falling from a greater
height: So that it seems, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
does, in such Cases, play a very
odd Game, since She forces a Ball,
against the Laws of heavy Bodies, to
ascend divers times upwards, upon
the Account of that very Gravity,
whose Office it is to carry it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the directest way: And, at
least, She seems, in spight of the
Wisdom ascribed to Her, to take Her
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>asures very ill, in making the
Ball move downwards with so much
violence, as makes it, divers times,
fly back from the place She intended
it should go to. As if a Ball which
a Child can play with, and direct as
he pleases, were so unweildy a Thing,
that <hi>Nature</hi> cannot manage it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
letting it be hurried on with far
greater violence, than her Design re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>The Reflection, I have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on a <hi>Ball,</hi> may (<hi>mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
as they speak) be applyed to a
<hi>Pendulum.</hi> For, since 'tis unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48184:87"/>
affirm'd, by all that have written
of it, that it falls to the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
upon the Account of its Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
It must not be deny'd, that 'tis
from a Motion proceeding from the
same Gravity, that the swinging
Weight passes beyond the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and consequently ascends, and
oftentimes makes a multitude of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adroms,
or Vibrations; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
does very frequently ascend,
before it comes to rest in the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular:
Which is the Position where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its Gravity is best comply'd with,
and which therefore it had been best
setled in at first.</p>
            <p>I shall not here mention those
Grand <hi>Anomalies,</hi> or <hi>Exorbitances,</hi> even
in the vaster Bodies of the Universe;
such as Earth-quakes, that reach some
Hundreds of Leagues, Deluges, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Eruptions of Fire, Famines
of a large spread, Raging Pestilences,
Coelestial Comets, Spots in the Sun,
that are recorded to have obscured
it for many Months; the sudden
Appearing, the Dis-appearing, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48184:88"/>
the Re-appearing of Stars, that have
been judg'd to be as high, as the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fix'd Ones. I will not, I
say, enquire how far these <hi>Anomalies</hi>
agree to the Character wont to be
given of <hi>Natures</hi> Watchfulness and
Vigilancy, because, probably, I may
have hereafter a fit opportunity to
do it, and must now proceed to the
remaining Instances I promis'd you,
which are taken from what happens
to <hi>Animals:</hi> As soon as I shall have
dispatch'd some Considerations and
Advertisements, that seem necessary
to be premis'd, to what I have to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about that difficult Subject.</p>
            <p>If the past Discourse give rise to a
Question, <hi>Whether the World, and
the Creatures that compose it, are as
perfect as they could be made?</hi> The
Question seems to me, because of
the Ambiguity of the Terms, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
to be resolv'd by a single An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But yet, because the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
is not wont to be discuss'd, and
is, in my Opinion, of Moment, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Natural Theology; I shall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48184:88"/>
venture briefly to intimate some of
the Thoughts that occurr'd to me
about it: Having first declar'd, that
I am, with reason, very backward to
be positive in a matter of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Extent of the <hi>Divine Power</hi>
and <hi>Wisdom</hi> being such, that its
Bounds, in case it have any, are not
known to me.</p>
            <p>This premis'd, I consider, that the
sense of the Question may be, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
God could make the Material
World, and the Corporeal Creatures
It consists of, better and more perfect
that they are? speaking in a general
way and absolute sense: Or else, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
the particular Kinds or Orders
of the Creatures, in the World, could
any of them be made more perfect
or better, than they have been made?</p>
            <p>To Answer the Question in the
first-nam'd sense of it, I think it very
unsafe to deny, that God, who is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and Omniscient, and an
Owner of Perfections, which, for
ought we know, are participable in
more different manners and degrees
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48184:89"/>
than we can comprehend, could not
<hi>Display,</hi> if it be not fitter to say
<hi>Adumbrate,</hi> them, by Creating a
Work more excellent than this
World. And, his Immense Power
and Unexhausted Wisdom consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it will not follow, either, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this World of Ours is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
piece of Workmanship, the
Divine Architect could not have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
It; or, because God himself is
able to make a greater Master-piece,
this exquisitely contriv'd System is
not admirably Excellent.</p>
            <p>But the propos'd Question, in the
other sense of it, will require some
more words to resolve it. For, if
we look upon the several <hi>Species</hi> of
Visible Creatures, under a more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Consideration, without respect
to the Great <hi>System</hi> of the Universe,
of which they are Parts, or to the
more particular <hi>Designs</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
it seems manifest, that many
sorts of Creatures might have been
more perfect than they are, since
they want many compleating things,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48184:89"/>
that others are indow'd with; as an
Oyster, that can neither hear, nor
see, nor walk, nor swim, nor fly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is not so perfect a Creature, as an
Eagle, or an Elephant, that have
both those Senses that the Oyster
wants, and a far more active Faculty
of changing places: And, of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
of perfection in Creatures
of differing kinds, the Examples are
too obvious to need to be enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But if the Question be better
propos'd, and it be inquir'd, not <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
God could have made more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Creatures, than many of those
he has made, for that, 'tis plain, He
could do, because He has done it;
but, <hi>Whether</hi> the Creatures were not
so curiously and skilfully made, that
'twas scarce possibly they could have
been better made, with due regard to
all the wise Ends He may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have had in making them,
it will be hard to prove a Negative
Answer.</p>
            <p>This I shall indeavour to illustrate
by a Supposition. If one should come
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48184:90"/>
into the well-furnish'd Shop of an
excellent Watch-maker, and should
there see a plain Watch, design'd
barely to shew the Hour of the Day;
another, that strikes the Hours; a third
that is also furnish'd with an Alarm;
a fourth, that, besides these, shews
the Month Current, and the Day of
it; and lastly, a fifth, that, over and
above all these, shews the Motions of
the Sun, Moon and Planets, the Tydes,
and other Things, which may be
seen in some Curious Watches. In
this Case, I say, the Spectator, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
him judicious, would, indeed,
think one of these Watches far more
Excellent and Compleat than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but yet he would conclude
each of them to be perfect in its own
own kind, and the Plain Watch to
answer the Artificer's <hi>Idea</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in making it, as well as the
more Compounded and Elaborate
one did. The same thing may, in
some Circumstances, be further Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
by considering the Copy of
some excellent Writing-Master, for,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48184:90"/>
though there we may find some
Leaves written in an <hi>Italian</hi> Hand,
others in a <hi>Secretary,</hi> and, in others,
Hands of other Denominations;
though one of these Patterns may be
much Fairer, and more Curious than
another, if they be compar'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet, if we consider their equal
Conformity to the respective <hi>Idea's</hi>
of the Author, and the suitableness
to the Design he had of making each
Copy, not as Curious, Sightly and
Flourishing as he could, but as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the true <hi>Idea</hi> of the sort
of Hand he meant to exhibit, and
the Design he had to shew the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Number and Justness of his
Skill, by that of the Patterns he
made Compleat in the respective
Kinds; we shall not think, that any
of them could have been better'd by
him: And if he should have made a
<hi>Text</hi>-Hand as fair as a <hi>Roman</hi>-Hand,
by giving it more Beauty and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he would not have made it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in its Kind, but spoil'd it, and, by
a Flourish of his Skill, might have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48184:91"/>
given a Proof of his want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But, to return thither whence I
began to make this Excursion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<hi>Eleutherius,</hi> you will object
against the Examples I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
before it, that the Exceptions,
I have taken at some of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of <hi>Nature,</hi> may be as well
urg'd against <hi>Providence,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the One as well as the Other,
from the Government of the World.</p>
            <p>But to this I Answer, that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is Foreign to the Question,
which is about <hi>Mens Notion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
not <hi>God's Providence;</hi> which, if
it were here my Task to Assert, I
should establish It upon Its proper
and solid Grounds: such, as <hi>the</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Perfections of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which both engage and enable
Him to Administer His Dominion
over all things; <hi>His</hi> being the Author
and Supporter of the World; <hi>The</hi>
exquisite Contrivance of the Bodies
of Animals, which could not proceed
but from a stupendious Wisdom;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48184:91"/>
               <hi>The</hi> supernatural Revelations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoveries
He has made of Himself,
and of His particular care of His
Creatures, by Prophecies, Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
true Miracles, and other ways,
that transcend the Power, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
or, at least, over-rule the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Laws of Motion in Matter: By
these, I say, and the like proper Means,
I would evince Divine Providence.
But being not now oblig'd to make
an Attempt, which deserves to be
made very solemnly, and not in such
haste as I now write in. I shall, at
present, only observe to you, that the
Case is very differing between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
and <hi>Nature,</hi> and therefore
there is no necessity, that the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
I have made against the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
should hold against the Former.
As, (to give you a few Instances of
the Disparity) in the <hi>first</hi> place, it
appears not, nor is it likely, that 'tis
the Design of <hi>Providence</hi> to hinder
those <hi>Anomalies</hi> and <hi>Defects,</hi> I have
been mentioning: Whereas, 'tis said,
to be the Duty and Design of <hi>Nature,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48184:92"/>
and Her only Task, to keep the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
in Order, and procure, in all
the Bodies that compose it, that
things be carried on, in the best and
most regular way that may be, for
their Advantage. <hi>Secondly, Nature</hi>
is confess'd to be a Thing inferior to
God, and so but a subordinate Agent,
and therefore cannot, without dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to Her Power, or Wisdom,
or Vigilancy, suffer divers things to
be done, which may, without Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to <hi>God,</hi> be permitted by <hi>Him;
who</hi> is not only a self-existent and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Being, but the Supream and
Absolute Lord, and, if I may so speak,
the Proprietor of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Whence both <hi>Melchizedec</hi> and
<hi>Abram</hi> style Him, <hi>(Gen.</hi> xiv. 19, 23.)
not only the most High God, but,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Koneh,</hi> Possessing (or, as our
Version has it, Possessor of) Heaven
and Earth: And <hi>Who,</hi> when He
made the World, and established the
Laws of Motion, gave them to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
not to <hi>Himself.</hi> And so, being
obliged to none, either as His Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48184:92"/>
or Benefactor, He was not bound
to Make, or Administer, Corporeal
Things after the best manner, that
He could, for the good of the things
themselves: Among which, those
that are capable of Gratitude, ought
to Praise and Thank Him, for having
vouchsafed them so much as they
have, and have no Right to except
against His having granted them no
more. And, as being thus oblig'd
to none of his Works, He has a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Right to dispose of them; so,
He has other Attributes, which He
may justly Exercise, and both intend
And expect to be Glorified for, besides
his Goodness to Inferior Creatures:
and His Wisdom may be better set
off to Men, and perhaps to Angels or
Intelligences, by the great Variety of
His Contrivances in His Works, than
by making them all of the excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Kind: As <hi>Shadows</hi> in Pictures,
and <hi>Discords</hi> in Musick, skilfully
Plac'd and Order'd, do much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Painter, and the Musician.
Perhaps it may be added, That the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48184:93"/>
permitting the Course of Things to
be somewhat violated, shews, by the
Mischief such Exorbitances do, how
good God has been in setling and
preserving the <hi>orderly Course</hi> of
Things. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As God is a most
Absolute and Free, so He is an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient,
Being; and, as, by His Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Dominion over the Works of
His Hands, He has a Right to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of them, as He thinks best for
His own Glory, so upon the score of
His unfathomable Wisdom, He may
have Designs, and, if I may so speak,
Reaches, in the <hi>Anomalies</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the World, which we Men are
too short-sighted to discern; and
may exercise as much Wisdom, nay,
and as much Providence (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Man, the Noblest Visible
Object of His Providence) in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(as in Divine Miracles) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
from what Men call the <hi>Laws
of Nature,</hi> as He did at first in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
them: Whereas the Office
of <hi>Nature,</hi> being but to preserve the
Universe in General, and Particular
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48184:93"/>
Bodies in It, after the best manner
that their respective Conditions will
permit; we know, what 'tis She
aims at, and, consequently, can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
discern, when She misses of Her
Aims, by not well Acting what is
presum'd to be Her Part. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
We must consider, that, as God
is an Independent, Free and Wise,
so He is also a Just Agent; and
therefore may very well be suppos'd
to cause many Irregularities and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances
in the World, to punish
those, that Men have been guilty of.
And, whereas <hi>Nature</hi> is but a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-Mother
to the Creatures, and
looks e'ne upon wicked Men, not in
their Moral but in their Physical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
God expresly declares, in
the Sacred Scriptures, that, upon
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, He <hi>Curs'd the Ground,</hi> or
<hi>Earth, for Man's sake,</hi> Gen. iii. 17, 18.
and that there is no penal <hi>evil in the
City</hi> that is not deriv'd from Him,
<hi>Amos</hi> iii. 6. He is not over-rul'd,
as Men are fain to say of Erring <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
by the head-strong Motions of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48184:94"/>
the Matter, but sometimes purposely
over-rules the regular Ones, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
His Justice; &amp; therefore Plagues,
Earth-quakes, Inundations, and the
like destructive Calamities, though
they are sometimes Irregularities in
<hi>Nature,</hi> yet, for that very Reason, they
are design'd by <hi>Providence;</hi> which
intends, by them, to deprive wicked
Men of that Life, or of those blessings
of Life, whereof their Sins have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them unworthy. But, whil'st
I mention <hi>Designs,</hi> I must not forget,
that Mine was only to give you a
Tast of the Considerations, by which
one may shew, that such things, as
manifest <hi>Nature</hi> to act unsuitably to
the Representation that is made of
Her, may yet, when attributed to
<hi>Divine Providence,</hi> be made out
to have nothing inconsistent with
It.</p>
            <p>And yet, somewhat further to clear
this weighty matter, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some things, but briefly hinted in
what I have been lately Discoursing,
I think it fit, before I descend to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48184:94"/>
Particulars, that I am to employ
against the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi>
to premise somewhat by way of
Caution, that I may do <hi>some</hi> Right
(though I can never do <hi>enough,)</hi> to
<hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and take care
betimes, that no Use, Injurious to It,
may be made of any thing that my
Argument hath oblig'd me, or will
oblige me, to say about that Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Thing, Vulgarly call'd <hi>Nature,</hi>
either in This or the VI. Section, or
any other Part of our present <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive then, that the Divine
Author of Things, in making the
World, and the particular Creatures
that compose it, had respect to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ends; some of them knowable by
us Men, and others hid in the Abyss
of the Divine Wisdom and Counsels.
And that of those Ends, which are
either manifest enough to us, or, at
least, discoverable by Human Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Industry, some of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
are, <hi>The</hi> manifestation of the
Glory of God, <hi>The</hi> Utility of Man,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48184:95"/>
and <hi>The</hi> maintenance of the System
of the World; under which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
the Conservation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Creatures, and, also, the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of some Kinds of them.</p>
            <p>But this General Design of God,
for the welfare of Man and other
Creatures, is not (as I conceive)
to be understood, but with a twofold
Limitation.</p>
            <p>For, First, <hi>though</hi> Men, and other
Animals, be furnish'd with Faculties
or Powers, and other Requisites, to
enable them to preserve themselves,
and procure what is necessary for
their own welfare, <hi>yet</hi> this Provision,
that God has been pleas'd to make
for them, is made with reference to
what <hi>regularly,</hi> or what <hi>most usually,</hi>
happens to Beings of that <hi>Species</hi> or
Sort that they belong to; but not
with regard to such things as may
happen to them irregularly, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and (in comparison of the
others,) unfrequently. Thus it is,
in General, far better for Mankind,
that Women, when they are brought
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48184:95"/>
to Bed, should have their Breasts
fill'd with Milk, to give Suck to the
new-born Babe, than that they should
not; though sometimes, as, if the
Child die in the Delivery, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, and in some other Cases
also, the plentiful recourse of Milk
to the Mothers Breasts proves trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
and inconvenient, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
also dangerous, to her. Thus
a Head of Hair is, for the most part,
useful to the Person, whether Man or
Woman, that <hi>Nature</hi> has furnish'd
with it, though, in some Cases (as
of Consumptions, and in a few other
Circumstances) it happens to be
prejudicial to the Wearer; and
therefore Physicians do often, with
good success, prescribe, that it be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
off. Thus the Instinct, that Hens
have to Hatch their Eggs and take
care of their Young, is, in General,
very useful, if not necessary, for the
Conservation of that <hi>Species</hi> of Birds;
and yet it sometimes mis-guides and
deludes them, when it makes them
take a great deal of pains to Brood
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48184:96"/>
upon those Duck-eggs, that House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,
(having taken a way the Birds
own Eggs) lay in her Nest, which
makes her very solicitous to Hatch
and take care of Ducklings, instead
of Chickens. Thus 'tis an Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ordinarily is profitable for
Man, that his Stomach should nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
or reject things that have a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
taste or smell, because the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of those things, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for his Nourishment, are well,
or, at least, not ill-tasted; and yet,
on some occasions of Sickness, that
disposition of the Stomach to refuse,
or vomit up, nauseous Purges, and
other dis-tastful Medicines, (as such
Remedies are usually loathsom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
proves very prejudicial, by
being a great impediment to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Health. And thus (to be
short) the Passions of the Mind, such
as Fear, Joy and Grief, are given to
Man, for his Good; and, when
rightly us'd, are very advantageous,
if not absolutely necessary, to him:
Though, when they grow unruly, or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48184:96"/>
are ill-manag'd, as it but too often
happens, they frequently prove the
Causes of Diseases, and of great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
as well to the passionate Man
himself, as to Others.</p>
            <p>The second Limitation (which
has a natural Connexion with the
former,) is this, That the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Author of Things, who, in His
Vast and Boundless Understanding,
comprehended, at once, the whole
System of His Works, and every
Part of it, did not <hi>mainly</hi> intend the
Welfare of such or such particular
Creatures, but <hi>subordinated</hi> His Care
of their Preservation and Welfare, to
His Care of maintaining the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
System and Primitive Scheme or
Contrivance of His Works, and
especially those Catholick Rules of
Motion, and other Grand Laws,
which He at first establish'd among
the Portions of the Mundane Matter.
So that, when there happens such a
Concourse of Circumstances, that
particular Bodies, fewer or more,
must suffer, or else the setled Frame,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48184:97"/>
or the usual Course of Things, must
be alter'd, or some general Law of
Motion must be hinder'd from taking
place: In such Cases, I say, the
Welfare and Interest of Man himself
(as an Animal) and much more That
of inferior Animals, and of other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Creatures, must give way to
the Care, that <hi>Providence</hi> takes of
Things of a more General and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Nature or Condition.</p>
            <p>Thus (as I formerly noted) God
establish'd the Lines of Motion, which
the Sun and the Moon observe, tho'
he foresaw, that, from thence, there
would necessarily, from time to time,
ensue <hi>Eclipses</hi> of those Luminaries;
which he chose rather to permit, than
to alter that Course, which, on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
accounts, was the most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Thus a blown Bladder, or a
Foot-Ball, falling from a considerable
height upon the Ground, rebounds
upwards, and so, contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Heavy Bodies, moves from
the Centre of the Earth, lest the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Laws of Motion, whereby
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48184:97"/>
the Springyness and Reflection of
Bodies, in such Circumstances, are
established, should be violated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd
upon.</p>
            <p>Thus, He thought not fit to furnish
<hi>Sheep</hi> with Paws, or Tusks, or Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Animosity, or Craft, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
or preserve themselves from
Wolves and Foxes, and other Beasts
of Prey. And tame and fearful
<hi>Birds,</hi> such as Hens, are so ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for defence, that they seem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be the food of Hawks,
Kites, and other rapacious Ones.
Thus <hi>Oysters,</hi> having neither Eyes
nor Ears, are not near so well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, as the generality of Beasts
and Birds, and even most other
Fishes. And thus <hi>Silk-Worms</hi> (to
name no other Catterpillars,) usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(at least in these Countries,) live
not much above half a Year, being
less furnish'd with the Requisites of
longaevity, than the generality of
Birds, and Beasts, and Fishes.</p>
            <p>I have thought fit to lay down the
two foregoing Limitations, partly,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48184:98"/>
because they will be of use to me
hereafter, and, partly, because they
contain something, that may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to what hath been lately Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
on behalf of the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
(as it falls under the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist</hi>'s
Consideration.) For, by
these Limitations, we may perceive,
that 'tis not just, presently to deny,
or censure the Providence of God,
<hi>when-ever</hi> we see some Creatures less
compleatly furnish'd to maintain
themselves; <hi>or</hi> some Cases less provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, than we think they might
be; <hi>or</hi> seeming <hi>Anomalies</hi> permitted,
which we look upon as mischievous
Irregularities. For the Welfare of
Men, or of this or that other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sort of Creatures, being not
the Only, nor, in likelihood, the
Principal End of God, in making the
World; it is neither to be admir'd
nor reprehended, that He has not
provided for the safety and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of Particular Beings, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than well consists with the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of Beings of a more considerable
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48184:98"/>
Order, and, also, will comport with
his Higher Ends, and with the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the more General Laws
and Customs, setled by Him among
Things Corporeal: So that divers
seeming <hi>Anomalies</hi> and <hi>Incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
whence some take occasion to
Question the Administration of
Things, and to deny the Agency of
Providence, do not only comport
with it, but serve to accomplish the
Designs of It.</p>
            <p>I have the more expresly declar'd
my Mind on this occasion, because,
indeed, of the two main Reasons,
which put me upon so difficult a
Work, as I foresaw this Treatise
would be, <hi>as</hi> one was, the Love I
bear to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Philosophical Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
so</hi> the other was, a just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for <hi>Religion.</hi> For thinking it
very probable, that, in so Inquisitive
an Age as This, some Observations,
like Mine, about <hi>Nature itself,</hi> might
come into the minds of Persons ill-affected
to <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> who
would be glad and forward to wrest
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48184:99"/>
them, and make a perverse use of
them; I thought it better, that such
Notions should be candidly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
by One that would take care
to accompany them with those Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that may keep them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
injurious to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having premis'd the two forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Advertisements, to obviate Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions;
I hope, I may now
safely proceed to Particulars; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for Brevity's sake, I shall here
mention but a few, leaving you to
add to them those others, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in other parts of this Treatise.</p>
            <p>In the first place then, I shall take
notice, that there are several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Persons that have been choak'd
with a Hair, which they were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either to cough up, or swallow
down. The reason of this fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
is, probably, said to be the
Irritation that is made, by the stay of
so unusual a thing, as a Hair, in the
Throat; which Irritation occasions
very violent and disorderly, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive,
Motions to expel it, in the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48184:99"/>
Organs of Respiration, by which
Means the continual Circulation of
the Blood, necessary to the Life of
Man, is hinder'd, the Consequence
whereof is speedy Death. But this
agrees very ill with the Vulgar Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of such a Kind and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Being, as they represent <hi>Nature,</hi>
which is always at hand to preserve
the Life of Animals, and succour
them in their (Physical) dangers
and distresses, as occasion requires.
For since a Hair is so slender a Body,
that it cannot stop the Throat, so as
to hinder, either, the free passage of
Meat and Drink into the Stomach,
or, that of the Air to or from the
Lungs; (as may be argued from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
no-way Mortal Excrescences and
Ulcers in the Throat,) were it not a
great deal better for <hi>Nature,</hi> to let
the Hair alone, and stay, 'till the
Juices of the Body have resolv'd or
consum'd it, or some favourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
have remov'd it, than like a
passionate and transported Thing, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, like a Fury, with such blind
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48184:100"/>
violence, as, instead of ejecting the
Hair, expels the Life of him, that was
troubled with it?</p>
            <p>How the Care and Wisdom of
<hi>Nature</hi> will be reconcil'd to so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and disorderly a Proceeding, I
leave Her Admirers to consider. But
it will appear very reconcileable to
<hi>Providence,</hi> if we reflect back upon
the lately given Advertisement. For,
in regard of the use and necessity of
Deglutition, and in many Cases of
Coughing and Vomiting, it was, in
the General, most convenient, that
the Parts that minister to these Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
should be irritated by the sudden
Sense of things that are unusual,
though, perhaps, they would not be
otherwise dangerous or offensive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as we formerly noted,) 'twas
fit, that the <hi>Providence of God</hi> should,
in making Provision for the Welfare
of Animals, have more regard to
that, which usually and regularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
them, than to extraordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or unfrequent Accidents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48184:100"/>
Though most Women are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the Stink of the smoaking
Wick of a Candle, which is no more
than Men also are, yet it has been
frequently observ'd, that Big-bellied
Women have been made to Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by the smell of an extinguish'd
Candle, which would before have
indeed displeas'd, but not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
the same Persons: So that it
seems, <hi>Nature</hi> is, in these Cases, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far from being so prudent and
careful, as Men are wont to fancy
Her, since, by an Odour, (which,
if calmly receiv'd, would have done
no harm to the Teeming Woman,)
She is put into such unruly Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports:
And, instead of watching for
the Welfare of the Teeming Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whose Condition needed a
more than ordinary measure of Her
care and tenderness, She violently
precipitates her poor Charge into a
danger, that oftentimes proves fatal,
not only to the Mother, but the Child
also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48184:101"/>
The improper, and oftentimes
hurtful, Courses that <hi>Nature</hi> takes,
in Persons that are sick, some of one
Disease, some of another, will be,
hereafter, taken notice of in oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
places; and therefore, for the
present, I shall only observe, that
<hi>Nature</hi> seems to do Her Work very
weakly, or bunglingly, in the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Monsters, whose Variety and
Numerousness is almost as great as
their Deformity, or their Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
insomuch that several Volums
have been written, and many more
might have been, to give the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of them. How these gross
Aberrations will agree with that
great Uniformity, and exquisite Skill,
that is ascrib'd to <hi>Nature,</hi> in her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Productions, I leave the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists</hi>
to make out. I know, that some
of them lay the fault upon the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
of the Matter, that would
not be obsequious to the <hi>Plastick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> but I can hardly admit
of this Account from Men of such
Principles, as they are that give it:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48184:101"/>
for 'tis strange to me, they should
pretend, that <hi>Nature,</hi> which they
make a kind of <hi>Semi-Deity,</hi> should
not be able to mould and fashion so
small, and soft, and tractable, a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Matter, as that wherein the
first Model and Efformation of the
<hi>Embrio</hi> is made; when, at the same
time, they tell us, That 'tis able, in
Sucking-Pumps, to raise, and, if need
be, sustain, whole Tons of Water, to
prevent a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> And can, in Mines,
toss up into the Air, Houses, Walls,
and Castles, and, perhaps, the Rocks
they are built on, to give the kindled
Gun-powder the Expansion, that its
New state requires.</p>
            <p>Other Arguments, that, by a light
Change and easie Application, may
be made use of and added to these,
against the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
may be met with in divers Parts
of this Treatise, and especially in the
VII. Section; for which Reason
(among others) I decline lengthning
this Part of my Discourse with the
mention of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48184:102"/>
I foresee it may be said, that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we admit such a Being as <hi>Nature,</hi>
to contrive and manage Things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
and, in a Regular and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
way, direct them to their
respective Ends, there will appear
no visible Footsteps or Proof of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom in the Corporeal
World. And this Argument, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
is so specious, that 'twas one of
the things that made me the longest
hesitate, what I should think of the
Receiv'd Notion of <hi>Nature.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
further consider'd the matter, I
saw it might be answer'd, that the
curious Contrivance of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and many of Its Parts, and the
orderly Course of Things Corporeal,
with a manifest Tendency to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Ends, are <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi>
and do not depend upon the Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such a Being, as they call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
but, setting aside this or that
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> may be known by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
if those that make the
Inspection be Attentive and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:
As, when a Man sees a Humane
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48184:102"/>
Body skilfully Dissected by a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Anatomist, he cannot, if he be
intelligent and unprejudic'd, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that there is a most curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and exquisite Contrivance in that
Incomparable Engine, and in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Parts of it, that are admirably
fitted for distinct and determinate
Functions or Uses. So that I do not at
all, nor indeed can, suppress the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Tokens of Wisdom and Design,
that are to be observed in the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Construction and orderly Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the World and Its Parts:
But I endeavour to refer these Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Wisdom to the true and
proper Cause. And whereas, in the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Objectors, there
may be three Causes assign'd of
these Specimens or Foot-steps of
Wisdom, namely, <hi>God, Nature,</hi> and
<hi>Chance;</hi> if, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by me propos'd, <hi>Nature</hi> be laid
aside, the Competition will remain
only between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chance:</hi> And
sure he must be very dull, or very
strongly prejudic'd, that shall think
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48184:103"/>
it reasonable to attribute such admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Contrivances and such regular
Conducts, as are observable in the
Corporeal World, rather to <hi>Chance,</hi>
(which is a blind and senseless Cause,
or indeed no proper Cause at all, but
a kind of <hi>Ens rationis)</hi> than to <hi>a most
Intelligent Being,</hi> from which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousest
Productions may with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
be expected: Whereas, if such
a Celebrated Thing, as <hi>Nature</hi> is
commonly thought, be admitted,
'twill not be near so easie to prove
the Wisdom (and consequently the
Existence) of God by His Works,
since they may have another Cause,
namely, that most watchful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
Being, which Men call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
And this will be especially
difficult in the <hi>Peripatetick Hypothesis</hi>
of the Eternity (not of Matter only,
for in that the <hi>Atomists</hi> and others
agreed with them, but) of the
World. For, according to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Universe, there appears
no necessity, that God should have
any thing to do with it, since he did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48184:103"/>
not make this <hi>Automaton,</hi> but it was
always Self-existent, not only as to
Matter, but to Form too: And as
for the Government or Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bodies it consists of, that is
the proper business of <hi>Nature.</hi> And
if it be Objected, that this Being is
by its Assertors acknowledg'd to be
subordinate to God; I shall answer,
<hi>That,</hi> as, upon the
Reasons and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
I elsewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,<note place="margin">See the IV. Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
it may justly be question'd,
Whether many Philosophers, and
perhaps some Sects of them who are
Adorers of <hi>Nature,</hi> confess'd Her to
be but the Substitute of a Superior
and Divine Being? <hi>So,</hi> this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and subordination is not so easie
to be prov'd against those that side
with those other Ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who either acknowledg'd no
such thing, or expresly deny'd it.
Besides that, this Objection <hi>supposes</hi>
the Existence and Superiority of a
Deity, which therefore needs to be
<hi>prov'd</hi> by other ways; whereas in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48184:104"/>
               <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I propose, the same <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
that discover admirable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and manifest Designs in the
Corporeal World, do themselves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a solid Argument, both of the
Existence and of some of the grand
Attributes of God, with which the
rest, that properly belong to Him,
have a necessary Connexion.</p>

            <p>V. HAving, in the foregoing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
propos'd some of
the Considerations, that have dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
me with the <hi>Receiv'd Notion
of Nature,</hi> it may now be justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that I should also consider,
what I foresee will be alledg'd in Its
behalf, by the more Intelligent of Its
Favourers. And I shall not deny the
Objections, I am going to name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Opinion, to be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
especially for this Reason, that I
am very unwilling to seem to put
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48184:104"/>
such an Affront upon the generality
as well of Learned Men as of Others,
as to maintain, that they have built
a Notion of so great weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
upon slight and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Grounds.</p>
            <p>The Reasons, that I conceive may
have induced Philosophers to take
up, and rely on, the <hi>Receiv'd Notion
of Nature,</hi> are such as these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>And the first Argument, as one of
the most obvious, may be taken from
the general Belief, or, as Men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
Observation, that divers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as particularly Earth, Water,
and other Elements, have each of
them its natural Place assign'd it in
the Universe; from which Place, if
any portion of the Element, or any
mixt Body, wherein that Element
predominates, happens to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
it has a strong incessant Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to return to it; because, when
'tis there, it ceases either to <hi>gravitate,</hi>
or (as some School-men speak) to
<hi>levitate,</hi> and is now in a place, which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48184:105"/>
               <hi>Nature</hi> has qualifi'd to preserve it,
according to the Axiom, that <hi>Locus
conservat locatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Argument I answer, that
I readily grant, that, there being such
a Quantity of very bulky Bodies in
the World, 'twas necessary they
should have Places adequate to their
bigness; and 'twas thought fit by
the wise Architect of the Universe,
that they should not be all blended
together, but that a great Portion of
each of them should, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of things, be dispos'd of and
lodg'd in a distinct and convenient
Place. But when I have granted
this, I see not any necessity of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
likewise, what is asserted in the
Argument above-propos'd. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
Bodies having no Sense or
Perception, (which is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Animadversive Beings) it
must be all one to them in what
Place they are, because they cannot
be concern'd to be in one Place rather
than in another, since such a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
would require a knowledg,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48184:105"/>
that Inanimate things are destitute
of. And, for the same reason, a
Portion of an Element, remov'd, by
force or chance, from what they call
its proper Place, can have no real Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to return thither: For, who
tells it 'tis in an undue Place, and that
it may better its Condition by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
into another? And who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
it, whether that Place lies on
this hand of it, or that hand of it,
or above it, or beneath it? Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
indeed have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
aware of the weakness of the
Argument, drawn from the vulgarly
propos'd Instance (which yet is the
best that is wont to be imploy'd,) of
Earthy Bodies, which being let fall
from the top of an House, or thrown
into the Air, do of themselves fall, in
a direct Line, towards the Centre
of the Earth; and therefore they
have strengthned this Argument, as
far as might be, by pretending, that
these Bodies have not indeed, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Philosophers were wont to
think, an Appetite to descend to the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48184:106"/>
Centre of the Earth, but to the great
Mass of their Connatural Bodies. I
I will not therefore accuse these Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
of the inconsiderate Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Predecessors, who
would have <hi>Nature</hi> make all heavy
Things affect to lodg themselves in
the Centre of the Earth, which (as
was formerly noted,) being but a
Point, cannot contain any one of
them, (how little soever it be;) but
yet the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of these Moderns
is liable, though not to <hi>that,</hi> yet, to
<hi>other</hi> weighty Objections.</p>
            <p>For the First Argument, I lately
imploy'd, will hold good against
these Philosophers too, it not being
conceivable, how an Inanimate Body
should have an Appetite to re-joyn
Homogeneous Bodies, neither whose
situation, nor whose distance from it,
it does at all know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It does not appear that
all Bodies have such an Appetite, as is
presum'd, of joyning themselves to
greater Masses of Connatural Bodies;
as, if you File the end of an Ingot or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48184:106"/>
Bar of <hi>Silver</hi> or of <hi>Gold,</hi> the Filings
will not stick to their own Mass,
though it be approach'd never so
near, or made to touch them, and
much less will they leap to it, when
'tis at a distance from them. The like
may be said almost of all Consistent
Bodies we are acquainted with, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Loadstone</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that participate of one of those
two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis obvious to them that
will observe, that, that which makes
Lumps of Earth, or Terrestrial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fall through the Air to the Earth,
is some general Agent, whatever
that be, which, according to the wise
disposition of the Author of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
determines the Motion of those
Bodies, we call heavy, by the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ways that are permitted them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Central part of the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous
Globe; Whether the Body,
put into Motion downwards, be of
the same, or a like, or a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature, from the greater Mass of
Matter, to which, when 'tis aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48184:107"/>
it rests there? If, from the side
of a Ship, you let fall a Chip of
Wood out of your Hand, when your
Arm is so stretch'd out, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
or shortest Line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that and the Water, lies never
so little without the Ship, that Chip
will fall into the Sea, which is a fluid
Body, and quite of another Nature
than itself, rather than swerve in the
least from the <hi>Line of Direction,</hi> as
Mechanicians call it, to rejoyn itself
to the great bulk of Wood, whereof
the Ship, though never so big, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.
And, on the other side, if a
Man, standing upon the Shore just by
the Sea, shall pour out a Glass of
Water, holding the Glass just over
his Feet, that Water will fall into
the Sand, where 'twill be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
soak'd up and dispersed, rather
than deviate a little, to joyn itself to
so great a Mass of Connatural Body,
as the Ocean is.</p>
            <p>And as to what is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and made part of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I am answering, That
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48184:107"/>
Water does not weigh in Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is in its own natural Place,
and <hi>Elementa in proprio loco non gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitant.</hi>
I deny the matter of Fact,
and have convinc'd divers curious
Persons by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to the <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat. Paradoxes.</hi>
               </note> that Water
does <hi>gravitate in</hi>
Water, as well as <hi>out</hi>
of it, though indeed it does not <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravitate,</hi>
because 'tis Counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
by an equal weight of Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Water, which keeps it from
descending.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, For the Maxim, that
<hi>Locus conservat locatum;</hi> besides that,
it has been prooflesly asserted, and
therefore, unless it be cautiously
explain'd, I do not think my self
bound to admit it; besides this, I
say, I think, that either the proper
Place of a Body cannot be inferr'd,
as my Adversaries would have it,
from the Natural tendency of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to it; or else it will not hold true
in general, that <hi>Locus conservat loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
as when, for Instance, a poor
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48184:108"/>
unluky Seaman falls, from the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of a Ship, into the Water,
does the Sea, to which he makes
such hast, preserve him or destroy
him? And when in a foul Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
a lump of Soot falls into the
Hearth, and presently burns up
there, can we think that the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Nature</hi> gave the Soot an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to hasten to the Fire, as a
greater Bulk of its Connatural Body,
or a Place provided by <hi>Nature</hi> for
its Conservation.</p>
            <p>And now I speak of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Appetite of Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Bodies; I remember, what
I lately forgot to mention in a fitter
place; That Bubbles themselves may
overthrow the Argument, I was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.
For if a Bubble happens
to arise from the bottom of a Vessel
to the upper Part of it, we are told,
that the Haste, wherewith the Air
moves thorow Water, proceeds from
the Appetite it has to quit that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
Place, and re-joyn the
Element, or great Mass of Air, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48184:108"/>
at the very Surface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a very thin skin of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
together with which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
a Bubble. Now I demand,
how it comes to pass, that this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of the Air, which, when it was
at the bottom of the Water, and
also in its passage upwards, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have enabled it to Ascend
with so much eagerness and force,
as to make its way thorow all the
incumbent Water, (which possibly
was very deep,) should not be able,
when the Air is arriv'd at the very
top of the Water, to break thorow
so thin a Membrane of Water,
as usually serves to make a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and which suffices to keep it
from the beloved Conjunction with
the great Mass of the External Air?
especially since they tell us, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Motion grows more quick, the
nearer it comes to the End or Place
of rest; the Appetites of Bodies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
with their approaches to
the Good they aspire to; upon which
account, Falling Bodies, as Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48184:109"/>
are said (though falsesly) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their swiftness, the nearer they
come to the Earth. But if, setting
aside the Imaginary Appetite of the
Air, we attribute the Ascension of
Bubbles to the Gravity and Pressure
upwards of the Water, 'tis easie Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drostatically
to Explicate, why Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
often move slower when they
come near the Surface of the Water,
and why they are detain'd there;
which last <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> proceeds
from this, that the Pressure of the
Water being There incosiderable,
'tis not able to make the Air quite
Surmount the Resistence made by
the Tenacity of the Superficial Part
of the Water. And therefore in
good <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> whose Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Glutinousness is far less than
that of <hi>Water,</hi> Bubbles rarely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
upon the Surface of the Liquor,
but are presently broken and vanish.</p>
            <p>And to make this presum'd Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
of the smaller Portions of the
Air to unite with the great Mass of it,
appear the less probable; I shall add
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48184:109"/>
that I have often observ'd, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in that state which is usually call'd
its Natural State, is wont to have
store of Aerial Particles mingled
with it, notwithstanding the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the External Air, that
is incumbent on the Water, as may
appear by putting a Glass full of
Water into the Receiver of the new
Pneumatical Engine. For the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the External Air being by
the Pump taken off, there will, from
time to time, disclose themselves in
the Water, a multitude of Bubbles,
made by the Aerial Particles, that lay
conceal'd in that Liquor.</p>
            <p>And I have further try'd, as I
doubt not but some others also have
done, that, by exactly inclosing,
in a conveniently shap'd Glass,
some Water, thus freed from the Air,
and leaving a little Air at the top of
the Vessel, which was afterwards
set by in a quiet place; the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles
of that incumbent Air did,
one after another, insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Water, and remain'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48184:110"/>
lodg'd in it; so little Appetite has
Air, in general, to flee all Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Water, and make its
escape out of that Liquor; though,
when sensible Portions of it happen
to be under Water, the great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
in Gravity, between those
two Fluids, makes the Water press
up the Air. But, though 'twere easie
to give a Mechanical Account of the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of mingled Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet, because it cannot be done
in few Words, I shall not here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it; the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being sufficient, to render the
Supposition of my Adversaries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</p>
            <p>Another Argument, in favour of
the Received Opinion of <hi>Nature,</hi>
may be drawn from the strong Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
that Bodies have to recover
their <hi>Natural state,</hi> when by any
means they are put out of it, and
thereby forced into a State that is
called <hi>Preternatural;</hi> as we see, that
Air being violently compress'd in a
blown Bladder, as soon as the force
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48184:110"/>
is remov'd, will return to its first
Dimensions: And the Blade of a
Sword being bent by being thrust
against the Floor; as soon as the
force ceases, restores itself, by its
innate power, to its former straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And Water, being made Hot
by the fire, when 'tis removed
thence, hastens to recover its former
Coldness.</p>
            <p>But though I take this Argument
to have much more weight in it,
than the foregoing; because it seems
to be grounded upon such real <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of Nature,</hi> as those newly
recited, yet I do not look upon it as
Cogent.</p>
            <p>In Answer to it therefore, I shall
represent, that it appears by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
lately mention'd, that the
Proposers of the Argument ground
it on the affections of Inanimate
Bodies. Now, an Inanimate Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Matter being confessedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of Knowledge and Sense, I see
no Reason, why we should not think
it uncapable of being concern'd to be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48184:111"/>
in One state or constitution, rather
than Another, since it has no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that, which it is in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
nor remembrance of that, from
which it was forc'd; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
no Appetite to forsake the
Former, that it may return to the
Latter. But every Inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
(to say nothing now of Plants
and Bruit Animals, because I want
time to launch into an ample Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse)
being of itself indifferent to
all Places and States, continues in
in that Place or State to which the
action and resistence of Other Bodies,
and especially Contiguous Ones, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
determine it.</p>
            <p>As to the Instance afforded by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I consider, that before it be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
That Water, being Heated,
returns of itself to its Natural Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it were fit, that the Assertors
should determine, what degree or
measure of Coldness is Natural to
that Liquor; and this, if I mistake
not, will be no easie Task. 'Tis true
indeed, that, in reference to us Men,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48184:111"/>
Water is usually Cold, because its
minute Parts are not so briskly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as those of the Blood and Juices,
that are to be found in our Hands,
or other Organs of Feeling. But,
that Water is actually cold in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Frogs, and those Fishes that
live in it, whose Blood is cold as to
our Sense, has not, that I know of,
been prov'd, nor is easie to be so.
And I think it yet more difficult to
determine, what degree of Coldness
is natural to Water, since this Liquor
perpetually varies its Temperature,
as to Cold and Heat, according to
the temper of the Contiguous or the
Neighbouring Bodies, especially the
Ambient Air. And therefore the
Water of an unshaded Pond, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
though it rests in its proper
and natural Place, as they speak, yet
in Autumn, if the Weather be fair,
the Temperature of it will much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the compass of the same Day,
and the Liquor will be much hotter
at Noon, than early in the Morning,
or at Midnight; though this great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48184:112"/>
diversity be the Effect only of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Agent, the <hi>Sun,</hi> acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its regular Course. And, in
the depth of Winter, 'tis generally
confess'd, that Water is much colder
than in the Heat of Summer; which
seems to be the Reason of what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by Watermen, as a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing, namely, that in Rivers,
Boats equally Laden will not sink
so deep in Winter as in Summer, the
cold Condensing the Water, and
consequently making it heavier <hi>in
specie,</hi> than it is in Summer, when
the Heat of the Ambient Air makes it
more thin. In divers parts of <hi>Africk,</hi>
that Temperature is thought natural
to the Water, because 'tis that which
it usually has, which is far hotter
than that which is thought natural
to the same Liquor in the frigid
Zone. And, I remember, on this
occasion, what perhaps I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
mention'd upon another, that
the <hi>Russian Czars</hi> chief Physician in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
me, that in some Parts of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi>
(one of the more <hi>Northern</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48184:112"/>
Provinces of that Monarch's Empire,
Water is so much more Cold, not
only than in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> but
than in <hi>England,</hi> that two or three
foot beneath the surface of the
Ground, all the Year long (even in
Summer itself,) it continues Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the form of Ice, so Intense is
the Degree of Cold that there seems
natural to it. This odd <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
much confirms what I lately intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
of the Power of Contiguous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and especially of the Air, to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Degree of the coldness of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I particularly mention the Air,
because, as far as I have try'd, it has
more Power to bring Water to its
own Temperature, than is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppos'd. For <hi>though,</hi> if, in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time,
a Man puts his Hand into
Water, that has lain expos'd to the
Sun, he will usually feel it Cold, and
so conclude it much colder, than
the Ambient Air; <hi>yet,</hi> that may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happen upon another Account,
namely, that the Water being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hundred times a more Dense
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48184:113"/>
Fluid than the Air, and consisting of
Particles more apt to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Pores of the Skin, a
greater Part of the Agitation of the
Blood and Spirits, contained in the
Hand, is communicated to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and thereby lost by the Fluids
that part with it. And the Minute
Particles of the Water, which are,
perhaps, more Supple and Flexible,
insinuating themselves into the Pores
of the Skin, which the Aerial Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
by Reason of their Stifness, and
perhaps Length, cannot do; they
come to affect the somewhat more
Internal Parts of the Hand, which,
being much Hotter than the <hi>Cuticula</hi>
or Scarf-skin, makes us feel them
very Cold; as, when a Sweating
Hand is plung'd into Luke-warm
Water, the Liquor will be judg'd
Cold by Him, who, if his Other
Hand be very Cold, will with it feel
the same Water Hot. To confirm
which Conjecture, I shall add, that,
having sometimes purposely taken a
Seal'd Weather-glass, whose inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48184:113"/>
Liquor was brought to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the Ambient Air, and
thrust the Ball of it under Water,
kept in the same Air, there would
be discover'd no such Coldness in
the Water, as One would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
the former Reason of the
sensible Cold the Hand feels, when
thrust into that Liquor, having here
no Place. To which I shall add, that
having, for Tryal's sake, made Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very Cold, by dissolving <hi>Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac</hi>
in it, in Summer time, it
would, after a while, return to its
usual degree of Warmth. And,
having made the same Experiment
in Winter, it would return to such a
Coldness, as belong'd to it in that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
So that it did not return to any
Determinate degree of Coldness, as
Natural to it, but to that Greater
or Lesser, that had been Accidentally
given it by the Ambient Air, before
the <hi>Sal-armoniac</hi> had Refrigerated
It.</p>
            <p>As to the Motion of Restitution, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
upon the Removal or Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48184:114"/>
of the Force in Air violently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
and in the Blade of a Sword
forcibly bent; I confess it seems to
me a very difficult Thing, to assign
the true Mechanical Cause of It.
But yet, I think it far more likely,
that the Cause should be Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
than, that the Effect proceeds
from such a Watchfulness of <hi>Nature,</hi>
as is pretended. For First, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
Whether we have any Air
here Below, that is in Other than a
Preternatural or Violent State; the
Lower Parts of our Atmospherical
Air being constantly compress'd by
the weight of the Upper Parts of the
same Air, that lean upon them.</p>
            <p>As for the Restitution of the bent
Blade of a Sword, and such like
Springy Bodies, when the force that
bent them is remov'd; my Thoughts
about the Theory of <hi>Springynes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to another Paper. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I shall here only, by way of
Argument <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> consider,
in Answer to the Objection; That
if, for Example, you take a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48184:114"/>
long and narrow Plate of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that has not been hammer'd, or
compress'd, or, which is surer, has
been made red-hot in the Fire, and
suffer'd to cool leasurely, you may
bend it which way you will, and it
will constantly retain the last curve
Figure, that you gave It. But if,
having again streightned this Plate,
you give it some smart stroaks of a
Hammer, it will, by that meerly
Mechanical Change, become a Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Body: So that, if with your
Hand you force it a little from its
Rectitude, as soon as you remove
your Hand, it will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
its former Streightness. The
like may be observ'd in Copper,
but nothing near so much, or scarce
at all, in Lead. Now upon these
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I demand, Why, if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
be so careful to restore Bodies
to their former State, She does not
restore the Silver Blade or Plate to
its Rectitude, when it is bent this
way or that way, before it be Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd?
And why a few stroaks of a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48184:115"/>
Hammer (which, acting violently,
seems likely to have put the Metal
into a Preternatural State,) should
entitle the Blade to <hi>Nature</hi>'s peculiar
Care, and make Her solicitous to
restore it to its Rectitude, when it
is forc'd from It? And Why, if the
Springy Plate be again Ignited and
Refrigerated of itself, <hi>Nature</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
Her former Care of It, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it quietly to continue in what
crooked Posture, One pleases to put
it into? Not, now, to demand a
Reason of <hi>Nature</hi>'s greater Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Silver, and Copper and Iron,
than to Lead and Gold itself, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Motion of Restitution;
I shall add to what I was just now
saying, that even in Sword-Blades
it has been often observ'd, That
though, if soon after they are bent,
the force that bent them be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
they will nimbly return to
their former straightness; yet, if
they (which are not the only Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Bodies, of which this has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,)
be kept too long bent, they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48184:115"/>
will lose the Power of recovering
their former streightness, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in that crooked Posture, though
the force that put them into it cease
to act: So that, it seems, <hi>Nature</hi> easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgets the care She was presum'd
to take of it, at first.</p>
            <p>There is an Axiom that passes for
current among Learned Men, <hi>viz.
Nullum violentum durabile,</hi> that seems
much to favour the Opinion of the
<hi>Naturists,</hi> since 'tis grounded upon
a Supposition, that what is <hi>violent,</hi> is,
as such, contrary to <hi>Nature,</hi> and, for
that Reason, cannot last long. And
this trite Sentence is, by the Schools
and even some Modern Philosophers,
so particularly apply'd to Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that some of them have, not
improbably, made it the Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
token, whereby to distinguish
Natural Motions from those that are
not so; that the Former are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or at least very durable, whereas
the Later, being continually check'd
more and more by the Renitency of
<hi>Nature,</hi> do continually decay, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48184:116"/>
within no long time are suppress'd or
extinguish'd: But, on this occasion,
I must crave leave to make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reflections.</p>
            <p>1. It may be justly Question'd,
upon Grounds laid down in another
Part of this Essay, Whether there
be any Motion, among Inanimate
Bodies, that deserves to be call'd <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,</hi>
in Contradistinction to <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi>
since among such, all Motions,
where no Intelligent Spirit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes,
are made according to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and almost, if not more than
almost, Mechanical Laws.</p>
            <p>2. Methinks, the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi>
who are wont to be the most forward
to imploy this Axiom, should find
but little Reason to do so, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how unsuitable it is to their
Doctrine, That the vast Body of the
Firmament and all the Planetary
Orbs are, by the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi>
with a stupendious swiftness, whirl'd
about, from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> in four and
twenty Hours, contrary to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
tendency; and, That this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48184:116"/>
and rapid Motion, of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
greater Part of the Universe,
has lasted as long as the World itself,
that is, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Ages.</p>
            <p>3. We may observe here below,
that the Ebbing and Flowing of the
Sea, which is generally suppos'd to
proceed either from the Motion of
the Moon, or that of the Terrestrial
Globe, or some other External Cause,
has lasted for some Thousands of
Years, and probably will do so, as
long as the present System of our
<hi>Vortex</hi> shall continue. I consider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that the other great Ocean, the
Atmosphere, consists of numberless
Myriads of Corpuscles, that are here
below continually kept in a violent
State; since they are Elastical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whereof the Lower are still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
by the weight of the Higher.
And, to make a Spring of a Body, it
is requisite that it be forcibly bent or
stretch'd, and have such a perpetual
endeavour to fly open, or to shrink
in, that it will not fail to do so, as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48184:117"/>
soon as the External Force, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it, is remov'd. And, as for
the States of Inanimate Bodies, I do
not see, that their being or not being
<hi>Natural</hi> can be, with any certainty,
concluded, from their being or not
being very <hi>Durable.</hi> For, not to
mention, that Leaves that wither in
a few Months, and even Blossoms
that often fade and fall off in few
Days, are as well Natural Bodies, as
the solid and durable Trees that bear
them; 'tis obvious, that, whether
we make the State of Fluidity, or
that of Congelation, to be that which
is Natural to Water, and the other
that which is Violent; Its change
from one of those States into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and even its return to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
State, is oftentimes, at some Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and in some Places, made very
speedily, perhaps in an Hour or less,
by Causes that are acknowledg'd to
be Natural. And Mists, Hail, Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
Lightning, Falling-Stars, to
name no more, notwithstanding their
being Natural Bodies, are far from
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48184:117"/>
being lasting, especially in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Glass, wherein the Ingredients,
Sand and Fixt Salt, are brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by great violence of Fire. And
the Motion that a thin Plate, or slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Wire, of this Glass can exercise,
to restore itself to its former Position,
when forcibly bent, is (in great
part) a lasting Effect of the same
violence of the Fire. And so is the
most durable perseverance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolubleness
of the Alcalisate Salt,
that is one of the two Ingredients of
Glass, notwithstanding its being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily dissoluble in Water and
other Liquors, and not uneasily e'ne
in the moist Air itself.</p>
            <p>There is a distinction of <hi>Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Violent,</hi> that
is so generally receiv'd and us'd, both
by Philosophers and Physicians, that,
I think, it deserves to have special
Notice taken of it in this Section;
since it implicitely contains an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Existence of the Thing
call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> by supposing it so
manifest a Thing, as that an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48184:118"/>
Distinction may justly be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on It.</p>
            <p>This imply'd Objection, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
is somewhat difficult to clear;
not for any great Force, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in It, but because of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of the Terms, wherein the
Distinction is wont to be imploy'd:
For most Men speak of the propos'd
Distinction of <hi>Motion,</hi> in so obscure,
or so uncertain a way, that 'tis not
easie to know what they mean by
either of the Members of It. But
yet some there are, who endeavour
to speak Intelligibly, (and for that
are to be commended) and define
<hi>Natural Motion</hi> to be That, whose
Principle is within the Moving Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
itself; and <hi>Violent Motion,</hi> That
which Bodies are put into by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Agent or Cause. And, in
in regard these speak more clearly
than, the rest, I shall here principally
consider the lately mention'd Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
In the Sense They give It.
I say then, that, even according to
this Explication, I am not satisfied
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48184:118"/>
with the Distinction: For, whereas
'tis a Principle received, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
employ'd, by <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and his Followers, <hi>Quicquid move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ab alio movetur;</hi> it seems, that,
according to this Axiom, all Motion
may be called <hi>Violent,</hi> since it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
from an External Agent; and
indeed, according to the School Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
the Motion of far the
greatest Part of the Visible World,
though this Motion be most Regular
and Lasting, must, according to the
propos'd Distinction, be reputed
<hi>Violent;</hi> since they assert, that the
Immense Firmament itself, and all
the Planetary Orbs, (in comparison
of which vast Coelestial Part of the
World, the Sublunary Part is little
more than a Physical Point,) is
perpetually (and against its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Tendency,) hurry'd about the
the Centre of the World, once in
Twenty four Hours, by an External,
though Invisible, Agent, which they
therefore call the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi>
And as for the <hi>Criterion</hi> of Natural
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48184:119"/>
Motion, that, <hi>Its Principle is within
the Moving Body,</hi> it may be said,
that all Bodies, once in the State of
Actual Motion, whatever Cause
first brought them to It, are mov'd
by an Internal Principle: As, for
Instance, an Arrow, that actually
flies in the Air towards a Mark,
moves by some Principle or other
residing within itself; for, it does
not depend on the Bow 'twas shot
out of, since 'twould continue, tho'
That were Broken, or even annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
nor does it depend upon the
<hi>Medium,</hi> which more resists than
assists its Progress, as might be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewn, if it were needful; and,
if we should suppose the Ambient
Air either to be annihilated, or
(which in our Case would be <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent,)</hi>
render'd uncapable of either
furthering or hindring its Progress,
I see not why the Motion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
must necessarily cease, since in
this Case there remains no <hi>Medium</hi>
to be penetrated, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
oppose its Progress. When in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48184:119"/>
a Watch that is wound up, the
Spring endeavours to unbend or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
itself; and when the String of
a drawn Bow is broken or let go,
the Spring of the former, and the
woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>y Part of the later, does each
return to a less crooked Line. And
though these Motions be occasioned
by the forcible Acts of External A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
yet the Watch, Spring, and
the Bow, have in themselves (for
ought appears to those I Reason
with,) an inward Principle, by
which they are mov'd till they have
attain'd their Position. Some, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
would add, that a Squib, or a
Rocket, though an artificial Body,
seems, as well as a falling Star, to
move from an Internal Principle:
But I shall rather observe, that, on
the other side, External Agents are
requisite to many Motions, that are
acknowledg'd to be <hi>Natural,</hi> as, to
omit the Germination and Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of divers Plants, as Onions,
Leeks, Potato's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though hung
up in the Air, by the heat of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48184:120"/>
Sun in the Spring; to pass by this,
I say, if in the Pneumatical Engine
or Air-Pump, you place divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
as Bees, Flies, Catterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and withdraw the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Air from the Receiver, they
will lye moveless, as if they were
dead, though it be for several hours,
whilst they are kept from enjoying
the presence of the Air: But, when
the External Air is permitted again
to return upon them, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be reviv'd, (as I have with
pleasure try'd,) and be brought to
move again, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Kinds; as if a Fly, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
resembled a little Windmill
in this, that being Moveless of itself,
it required the Action of the Air to
put its Wings and other Parts into
Motion. But, to insist no farther on
these Arguments <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> we
may consider, that, since Motion
does not essentially belong to Matter,
as Divisibility and Impenetrableness
are believ'd to do; the Motions of
all Bodies, at least at the beginning
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48184:120"/>
of Things, and the Motions of most
Bodies, the Causes of whose Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we can discern, were impress'd
on them, either by an External Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Agent, God; or by other
Portions of Matter (which are also
Extrinsecal Impellers) acting on
them.</p>
            <p>And this occasion invites me to
observe, that, though <hi>Motion</hi> be
deservedly made one of the Principal
Parts of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Definition of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Natura est Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium quoddam &amp; Causa, cur id mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veatur &amp; quiescat, in quo inest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aristot. Auscult. lib. II. cap. 1.</note> yet Men are
wont to call such
Motions <hi>Natural,</hi> as
are very hard to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
from those,
they call <hi>Violent.</hi> Thus, when Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
falls down to the Ground, they
tell us, that this <hi>Motion</hi> is <hi>Natural</hi> to
that Liquor, as 'tis a heavy Body;
but when a Man spurts up Water
out of his Mouth into the Air, they
pronounce that <hi>Motion,</hi> because of
its tendency upwards, to be <hi>contrary
to Nature.</hi> And yet when he draws
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48184:121"/>
Water into his Mouth, by sucking it
through a long Pipe held Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
they will have this <hi>Motion</hi>
of the Water, though directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to be not <hi>Violent,</hi> but <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
So when a Foot-Ball, or Blown
Bladder, being let fall upon a hard
Floor, rebounds up to a good height,
the Descent and Ascent are both said
to be <hi>Natural Motions,</hi> though the
former tends towards the Centre of
the Earth, and the later recedes as far
as it can do from it. And so if from
a considerable height you let fall a
Ball of some close Wood, that yet is
not too heavy, as Oak or the like, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a deep Vessel of Water, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
a great way in that Liquor, by
a <hi>Natural Motion;</hi> and yet its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Motion</hi> upwards ought not to
be esteem'd <hi>Violent,</hi> since, according
to the Schools, being lighter <hi>in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
than Water, 'tis <hi>Natural</hi> to it to
affect its proper Place, for which
purpose it must ascend to the top of
the Liquor, and lye afloat there;
and yet 'tis from these tendencies to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48184:121"/>
opposite Points, (as the <hi>Zenith</hi> and
the <hi>Nadir)</hi> that Men are wont to
judg many <hi>Motions</hi> of Bodies to be
<hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Violent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, since it must be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to a Lifeless and Insensible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to what place 'tis made to move,
all its <hi>Motions</hi> may, in some respect,
be said to be <hi>Natural,</hi> and in another,
<hi>Violent:</hi> For as very many Bodies of
visible Bulk are set a moving by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Impellents, and, on that score,
their <hi>Motions</hi> may be said to be <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi>
so the generality of Impell'd
Bodies do move either upwards,
downwards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> toward any Part
of the World, in what Line or Way
soever they find their <hi>Motion</hi> least
resisted; which Impulse and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
being given by vertue of
what they call the general Laws of
<hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Motion</hi> may be said to
be <hi>Natural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here take notice, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Epicurean Hypothesis,</hi>
it need not at all be admitted, that
<hi>Motion</hi> must be produc'd by such a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48184:122"/>
Principle, as the Schoolmens <hi>Nature.</hi>
For, according to that great and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Sect of Philosophers, the <hi>Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
every indivisible Corpuscle has
actual Motion, or an incessant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to change Place, essentially
belonging to it, as 'tis an <hi>Atom:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that in no case it can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of this Property or Power.
And all sensible Bodies being, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these Physiologers, but casual
Concretions or Coalitions of <hi>Atoms;</hi>
each of them needs no other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Motion, than that unloseable
endeavour of the <hi>Atoms</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it; and happen, on the account
of Circumstance, to have the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the more numerous, or at
least the predominant, Corpuscles,
determin'd one way. And to these
I might add some other such Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But I shall, in this place, say
no more concerning Motion, <hi>not only</hi>
because, even after having consider'd
the differing Definitions, that <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
Cartesius,</hi> and some other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
have given of it, I take it to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48184:122"/>
be too difficult a Subject, to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explicated in few words; <hi>but</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the only occasion I had to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it here, was, to shew that the
vulgar Distinction of it into <hi>Natural</hi>
and <hi>Violent</hi> is not so clear and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded,
as to oblige us to admit
(what it supposes,) that there is
such a Being, as the <hi>Naturists</hi> assert.</p>
            <p>I come now to consider the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that may be drawn in favour
of the <hi>Receiv'd Notion of Nature,</hi>
from the <hi>Critical Evacuations</hi> which
happen at certain times in Diseases,
and the strange Shifts that <hi>Nature</hi>
sometimes makes use of in them, to
free Herself from the Noxious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that oppress'd Her.</p>
            <p>This Argument I willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
to be very considerable.
For we really see, that in Continual
Feavers, especially in hotter Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
there do usually happen, at
certain times of the Diseases, Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Critical Commotions or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
after which the Morbifick
Matter is dispos'd of and discharg'd
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48184:123"/>
by Ways strange and surprising, to
the great and speedy Relief of the
Patient, if not to his perfect Cure; as
may appear by many Instances, to be
met with in the Observations of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scians
about Feavers, Pleurisies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Upon this Account, I take the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
drawn from <hi>Crises's</hi> to be much
the weightiest, that can be urg'd for
the Opinion from which I Dissent,
and therefore I shall employ the
more words in clearing this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Difficulty.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I desire it may be
kept in mind, that I do not only <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,</hi>
but <hi>teach,</hi> that the Body of
a Man is an incomparable <hi>Engine,</hi>
which the most wise <hi>Author</hi> of
Things has so skilfully fram'd, for
lasting very many Years, that, if there
were in it an Intelligent Principle of
Self-preservation, (as the <hi>Naturists</hi>
suppose there is) Things would not,
in <hi>most Cases,</hi> be better or otherwise
manag'd, for the Conservation of the
Animals Life, than they generally
are. So that the <hi>Question</hi> is not,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48184:123"/>
Whether there is a great deal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Wisdom exercis'd, in
the <hi>Crises's</hi> of Diseases, but upon what
Account it is, that these apposite
Things are perform'd? The Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Opinion of Physcians is, that 'tis
that Intelligent Principle they call
<hi>Nature,</hi> which, being solicitous for
the Welfare of the Patient, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress'd
by the quantity or hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Morbifick Matter, watches
Her opportunity (especially when
'tis concocted) to expel it hastily
out of the Body, by the most safe and
convenient Ways, which, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition of the Patient, can be
taken. And I, on the other side, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<hi>Crises's</hi> to the Wisdom and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Providence of God, exerting
Itself by the Mechanism, <hi>partly</hi> of
that great Machine, the <hi>World,</hi> and
<hi>partly</hi> of that smaller Engine, the
<hi>Human Body,</hi> as 'tis constituted in
the Patients present Circumstance.
And the Reasons that hinder me,
from acquiescing in the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Physicians about <hi>Crises's,</hi> are
principally these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48184:124"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> I observe that <hi>Crises's,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so call'd, do very seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in other than Feavers, and the
like acute Diseases; where, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common Course of
Things, the Malady is terminated,
in no long time, either by Recovery,
or Death, or a change into some
other Disease: But Chronical-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
such as Coughs, Dropsies,
Gouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless they happen to be
accompany'd with Feaverish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
are not wont to have <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's;</hi>
which argues, that <hi>Nature</hi> doth
not make Critical Evacuations, upon
the account of such Care and
Watchfulness, as Physicians ascribe
them to: Since She neglects to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
so Salutary an Expedient in
Diseases, that are oftentimes no less
Dangerous and Mortal, than divers
acute Diseases, which She attempts
to Cure by <hi>Crises's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next I consider, that <hi>Critical Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations</hi>
may be procur'd by the bare
Mechanism of the Body. For, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>That,</hi> it will often happen,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48184:124"/>
that the Fibres, or motive Organs of
the Stomach, Bowels, and other
Parts, being Distended or Vellicated
by the Plenty or Acrimony of the
Peccant Matter, will, by that Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be brought to contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
vigorously, and to throw out
the Matter that offends the Parts,
either by the Emunctories or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Shores
of the Body, or by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Passages the proscrib'd Matter
can be, with most ease, discharg'd.
Thus, when some Men find their
Stomachs burden'd with a Clog of
Meat or Drink, they use to thrust
their Fingers into their Throats, and,
by that Mechanical way, provoke
the Stomach to disburden itself of its
offensive Load, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to <hi>Natures</hi> Watchfulness for a
<hi>Crisis,</hi> which probably She would
not (at least so seasonably) attempt.
And thus, whereas 'tis usual enough,
for <hi>Crises's</hi> to be made in Feavers by
large <hi>Haemorrhagi's</hi> at the Nose, and
sometimes at other Parts, which is
ascrib'd to <hi>Natures</hi> Watchful Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48184:125"/>
for the Patients Recovery; I
must take leave to add, that it hath
been divers times observ'd, that, even
after Death, large Bleedings have
succeeded, at the Nose and other
Parts of the Body: Which shews,
that such Excretions may be made
by vertue of the Structure of it, and
the Turgescence and Acrimony of
the Humours, without any Design
of <hi>Nature,</hi> to save the Life of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
already Dead.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if it did appear by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that all, or almost all, the
<hi>Crises's</hi> of Diseases, did either expel
the Morbifick Matter, or at least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
relieve the Patient, the Critical
Attempts of <hi>Nature</hi> would much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Opinion Men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of her Vigilance and Conduct:
But unwelcome Instances daily
shew, that, as some <hi>Crises's</hi> are <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
(as they call them) so others
prove <hi>Mortal.</hi> And among those that
do not directly or presently kill the
Patient, there are divers that leave
him in a worse Condition, than he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48184:125"/>
was before. And therefore, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not, that Physicians have thought
themselves oblig'd to lay down seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circumstances, as necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites
of a laudable <hi>Crisis,</hi> if any of
which be wanting, 'tis not thought
of the best kind; and if the contrary
to some of them happen, 'tis to be
judg'd either pernicious, or at least
hurtful. For, whereas there are two
general Ways, suppos'd to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by <hi>Nature</hi> in making <hi>Crises's,</hi>
the one by expulsion of the Peccant
Matter out of the Body, and the
other by the setling of the Matter
somewhere within it: Neither of
these two Ways is constantly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>
            <p>And therefore Experience hath
oblig'd Physicians to divide <hi>Crises's,
not only</hi> into <hi>perfect,</hi> that fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the event of the Disease, and
<hi>imperfect,</hi> that do but alter it for the
better or the worse; but into <hi>Salutary,</hi>
that quite deliver the Patient, and
<hi>Mortal,</hi> that destroy him. And to
a Perfect and Salutary <hi>Crisis,</hi> some
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48184:126"/>
Learned Men require no less than six
Conditions; namely, that it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
by Signs of Coction of the
Peccant Matter; that it be made by a
manifest and sufficiently copious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
or Translation; that it be
made upon a Critical Day, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
fourteenth, twentieth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that it leave no Relicks behind it,
that may indanger a Relapse; that
it be made safely, that is, without
dangerous Symptoms: And lastly,
that it be suitable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of
the Disease, and the Patient. By this
it may appear, that 'tis no common
thing to meet with a Perfect and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
<hi>Crisis,</hi> so many laudable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
must concur in it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Nature</hi> doth usually take up
with but imperfectly good Ones, and
it were happy if She made not better,
provided She made no worse. But
'tis found, by sad Experience, that
She rouses Herself up to make a <hi>Crisis,</hi>
not only upon improper, and, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
call them, Intercident Days,
such as the Third, Fifth, Ninth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:48184:126"/>
or upon those they call Empty or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Days, which seldom afford
any <hi>Crisis,</hi> and much seldomer a good
One, but also when there appear not
any signs of Coction, or at least of
due Coction, and by these unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Attempts weaken the Patient,
and encrease the Malady, or perhaps
make it speedily Mortal. Nor will
it justifie <hi>Nature,</hi> to say, with some
Learned Physicians, that these At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
are Accidentally brought on
by the Acrimony or Importunity of
the Morbifick Matter, by which She
is provok'd, before the time, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
an Expulsion of it. For if
<hi>Nature</hi> be indeed so Prudent and
Watchful a Guardian, as She is
thought, She ought not to suffer Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be provok'd to act Preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and make furious Attempts,
that lavish to no purpose, or worse
than no purpose, that little strength
the Patient hath so much need of.
And therefore Physicians do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very well, when, to act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the Dictates of Prudence,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48184:127"/>
they forget, how much Wisdom they
are wont to ascribe to <hi>Nature,</hi> and
employ their best Skill and Remedies
to suppress or moderate the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Motions, or the improper and
profuse Evacuations, that irritated
<hi>Nature</hi> rashly begins to make. And
<hi>though</hi> the <hi>Crises's</hi> that are made by a
Metastasis of the Peccant Matter, or
by lodging it in some particular Part
of the Body, whether External or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
be oftentimes, when they are
not Salutary, somewhat less Hurtful,
than those that are made by Excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>yet</hi> these do frequently, though
perhaps more slowly, prove Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enough, producing sometimes
inward Imposthumes, and sometimes
External Tumors, in Parts that are
either Noble by their Functions, or
by their Situation, or Connexion, or
Sympathy with others, that are not
to be without Hazard or great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
oppress'd.</p>
            <p>I know that Physicians make it a
great Argument of <hi>Nature's</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Skill, that She watches
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48184:127"/>
for the Concoction of the Peccant
Matter, before She rouses Herself up
to expel it by a <hi>Crisis.</hi> What is to
be meant by this <hi>Coction of Humours,</hi>
(for it ought not to be confounded
with the <hi>Coction of the Aliments)</hi>
they are not wont so clearly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
But, as I understand it, when
they say that a Portion of Peccant
Matter is brought to Coction, they
mean, that it has acquir'd such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as makes it more fit, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to be separated from the sounder
Portion of the Mass of Blood, or from
the consistent Parts, to which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
formerly adhered, and to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
expell'd out of the Body.
This may be partly exemplifi'd by
what happens in some recent Colds,
where the Lungs are affected, in which
we see, that, after a few days, the
Phlegm is made more fluid; and that
which is lodg'd in the Lungs, (not
sticking so fast to the inside of the
<hi>Aspera Arteria)</hi> is easily brought up
by Coughing, which could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg
it before. And in Feavers, that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48184:128"/>
separation in the Urine, formerly
Cloudless, that Physicians look upon
as a good sign of <hi>Coction,</hi> seems to
be produc'd by some part of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Matter, that, beginning to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Blood, mingles
with the Urine, and is not usually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from it, whilst this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is warm; but when it is grown
cold, does, on the score of its Weight
or Texture, somewhat recede, and
appear in a distinct Form, as of a
Cloud, a Sediment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they mean by <hi>Coction,</hi> 'tis plain
enough, by what hath been lately
noted, that, on many occasions, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
doth not wait for it, but unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
and oftentimes dangerously,
attempts to proscribe the Matter that
offends Her, before it be duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for Expulsion.</p>
            <p>I come now to that Circumstance
of <hi>Crises's,</hi> that is thought the most
Wonderful, which is, that <hi>Nature</hi>
does oftentimes by very unusual
Ways, and at unexpected Places, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Matter that offends Her,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48184:128"/>
and thereby either Cures, or nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Relieves, the Patient. And it
must not be deny'd, that, in some
cases, the Critical Evacuations have
somewhat of Suprising in them;
and I shall also readily grant, that,
<hi>N. B.</hi> [Divine Providence may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
interpose, not only in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of Diseases by way of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but in the removal of
them in the way of Mercy.] But,
setting aside these extraordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
I think it not absurd to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that the performances of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
in common <hi>Crises's,</hi> may be
probably referr'd, <hi>partly</hi> to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
condition of the Matter to
be expell'd, and <hi>partly</hi> (and indeed
principally) to some peculiar Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Primitive Fabrick of some
Parts of the Patients Body, or some
unusual change made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of these Parts by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
itself, or other Accidents; which
Original or Adventitious disposition,
of the Sick Man's Body, not being
visible to us, at least whilst he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48184:129"/>
we are apt to ascribe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Accidents of a <hi>Crisis,</hi> if it
prove Salutary, to the wonderful
Providence of <hi>Nature.</hi> And, if it
happen to be other than Salutary,
we are wont to overlook them. To
illustrate this Matter, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that plentiful Evacuations,
procured by Medicines, are a
kind of Artificial <hi>Crises's:</hi> We see,
that some Bodies are so constituted,
that, <hi>although</hi> the peccant Humour,
wrought on by the Medicine, ought,
as the Physitian thinks, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by Siege, and indeed is wont
to be so, in the Generality of those
that take that kind of Medicine, as,
for Instance, Rhubarb or Senna; <hi>yet</hi>
the peculiar disposition of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's
Stomach will make that an
<hi>Emetick,</hi> which was intended to be,
and regularly should be, a <hi>Cathartick.</hi>
Nor does this Constitution of the
Stomach equally regard all Purging
Medicines; for the same Stomach,
that will reject them in the Form,
for Instance, of a Potion, will quietly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48184:129"/>
entertain them, being in the Form of
Pills. And to this let me add what we
observe of the Operation of Mercury;
which though, if it be duly prepared,
it is usually given to procure Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially to Succulent Bodies;
yet there are some Patients, wherein,
instead of Salivating, 'twill violently
and dangerously work downwards,
like a Purge, or make some other
unexpected Evacuation. And I have
seen a Patient, who, though Young
and very Fat, could not be brought
to Salivate, neither by the Gentler
ways, nor by Turbith-Mineral and
Other harsher Medicines, though
administred by very skilful Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Chyrurgeons. And this
Peculiarity may be as well <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
as <hi>Native.</hi> For some Persons,
especially after Surfeits, having been
rufly dealt with, or at least tyr'd out
with a Medicine of this or that kind
of Form, will afterwards Nauseate
and Vomit up the like Medicine, tho'
in other Bodies it be never so far
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>ing Emetick. We see also, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48184:130"/>
sometimes Sudorifick Medicines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of procuring Sweat, prove
briskly Diuretick, and sometimes
either Purging or Vomitive. From
all this we may Argue, that the
qualities of the irritating Matter, and
much more the particular dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Patients Body, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Evacuations at unexpected Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I remember too, that, among the
Observations I have met with of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Physitians, there are Instances
of Periodical and Critical Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
at very inconvenient, as well
as unusual, Vents; as some Women
are Recorded to have had their <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
sometimes at the Eyes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the Navil, and sometimes
at the Mouth; of which there seems
no cause so probable, as some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Structure, whether Native or
Adventitious, of the Internal Parts
concern'd in that discharge; and of
such unusual Structures, Anatomists
must have seen Many, since I my self
have observ'd more than One or Two.
If these uncommon Ways of disposing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48184:130"/>
of the Morbifick Matter were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Salutary to the Patient, the
Argument grounded on them would
have more weight: But though
most Men take notice of this sort of
<hi>Crises's,</hi> but when they are Lucky,
yet an Impartial Observer shall often
find, that ill-condition'd and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Crises's</hi> may be made by unusual
and unexpected ways. And, in
some Translations of the Morbifick
Matter to distant and nobler Parts,
perhaps it will be as difficult to
shew, by what Channels or known
Ways the Matter pass'd from one to
another, as 'tis to determine, how
it was conducted to those Parts, at
which it was the most happily Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing Discourse about
<hi>Crises's,</hi> there is, I confess, much of
Paradox; and 'twas unwillingly
enough; that I made an Excursion,
or In-road, into a Subject that has
been look'd upon as the Physitians
peculiar Province. And, you may
remember, that not far from the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48184:131"/>
beginning of this little Book, I told
you, that I was willing to decline
medling with Other, than Inanimate
Bodies: Living Ones being, as of a
less simple Sort, so of a more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Speculation; which Reflexion
will, I hope, excuse me to you, if
you find, that my propos'd Brevity,
or the difficulty of the Subject, has
had any great Influence on what I
write, about Health, Diseases and
<hi>Crises's.</hi> And, as for the Sons of
<hi>Aesculapius,</hi> it may be represented to
them, in my favour, that, besides
that I have treated of Sickness and
<hi>Crises's,</hi> rather as a Physiologer than
a Physician, I could not leave them
unconsider'd, without being thought,
if not to betray, at least to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to, the Cause I was to plead
for.</p>
            <p>If it should be dislik'd, that I
make the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the merely
Corporeal Part of the World, under
which I comprize the Bodies of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
though not the Rational
Souls of Men, to be too generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48184:131"/>
to Laws Mechanical; I hope
you will remember, for me, several
things dispers'd in this Treatise, that
may, when laid together, afford a
sufficient Answer to this Surmize;
and particularly, that almost all the
Modern Philosophers, and among
Them divers eminent Divines, scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not to forsake the spread Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That the Coelestial Orbs were
mov'd and guided by Intelligences;
and to explicate, by Physical Causes,
the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon,
the Production or Apparition and
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Comets, and other
Things, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as
other Heathens, both Ancient and
Modern, have ascrib'd to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Agency of Divine Causes.
This allows me to observe to you,
that, since these Modern <hi>Naturalists</hi>
and Divines are wont to explicate
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the vast Coelestial
Bodies, by their Local Motions and
the Consequences of Them; <hi>They
do, as well as I,</hi> endeavour to <hi>account
for what happens in the incomparably
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48184:132"/>
greatest Part of the Vniverse,</hi> by
<hi>Physico-Mechanical Principles and
Laws.</hi> And, even in the Terrestrial
Part of the World, which we Men
inhabit, most of the Moderns, that
have freed themselves from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of the Schools, do not stick
to give <hi>Statical, Hydro-Statical,</hi> and
other Mechanical Explications of the
Ascension of Water in Pumps, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of it in Watering-Pots, whose
upper Orifices are clos'd, and of other
various <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
unanimously ascrib'd to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s
wonderful Providence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in Her care to hinder a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps you will think it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for me to provide against their
Censure, who will dislike what I
have written about <hi>Crises's,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have <hi>ascrib'd too much</hi> to
merely Physical Causes, but (on the
contrary,) because I do not strictly
<hi>confine</hi> my self to Them. For I
doubt, that if you should shew these
Papers to some of your Friends, that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48184:132"/>
affect to be strict <hi>Naturalists,</hi> they
will think it strange, that in one of
the Clauses in the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about <hi>Crises's,</hi> (I mean, that
to which this Mark <hi>N. B.</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd,)
I admit that their Events
may sometimes be vary'd by some
peculiar Interposition of God. But
yet I own to you, that the Clause,
'tis like they would take Exceptions
at, did not unawares slip from my
Pen. For 'tis my setled Opinion,
that Divine Prudence is often, at
least, conversant in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
about the Actions of Men, and
the things that happen to Them, or
have a necessary Connexion with the
One, or the Other, or Both. And
<hi>tho'</hi> I think it probable, that in the
Conduct of that far greatest Part
of the Universe, which is merely
Corporeal, the Wise Author of it
does seldom <hi>manifestly</hi> procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
from the settled Course of
the Universe, and especially from
the most Catholick Laws of Motion:
<hi>Yet,</hi> where Men, who are Creatures,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48184:133"/>
that He is pleas'd to indow with
Free Wills, (at least in reference to
things not Spiritual,) are nearly and
highly concern'd; I think he has,
not only sometimes by those <hi>signal</hi>
and <hi>manifest</hi> Interpositions we call
<hi>Miracles,</hi> acted by a Supernatural
way, but, as the Sovereign Lord
and Governor of the World, doth
divers times, (and perhaps oftner
than mere Philosophers imagine)
give by the Intervention of Rational
Minds, as well united, as not united,
to human Bodies, divers such deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
to the Motion of Parts in
those Bodies, and of Others, which
may be affected by Them, as by Laws
merely Mechanical, those Parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would not have had: By which
Motions, so determin'd, either Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Fatal <hi>Crises's,</hi> and many other
Things, conducive to the Welfare or
Detriment of Men, are produc'd.</p>
            <p>The Interposition of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
in cases of Life and Death,
might be easily shewn to Christians
out of divers Passages of Scripture,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48184:133"/>
which expresly propos'd long Life as
a Reward to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Children,<note place="margin">The Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> xx.</note> and to

among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and threatens <hi>bloody
and deceitful Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm v. 6.</note>
that they <hi>shall not

               <note place="margin">Psalm lv. 23.</note>
and which relates, that a King
of <hi>Israel</hi> had his Disease made Mortal
by his Impious recourse to the false
God of <hi>Eckron;</hi> and
that,<note place="margin">2 Kings i. 16.</note> upon <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s
Prayers and Tears,
God was pleased to
add fifteen Years to
his Life,<note place="margin">Isa. xxxviii.</note> and grant a special Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to an outward Medicine, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to his threatning Sore. To
which Passages divers may be added
out of the New-Testament also, and
especially that of
St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James v. 25.</note> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
the Sick to
seek for Recovery by Prayer; and
that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where, speaking
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48184:134"/>
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the unworthy
Receivers of the Sacrament of the
Eucharist, he tells them, that, <hi>For
that cause, divers were
become sick and weak
among them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 30.</note> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
also died.</hi> But though the nature
of this Discourse dissuades me from
imploying here the Authority of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> yet it allows me to observe,
(what is considerable on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that Natural Theology and
Right Reason comport very well
with our propos'd Doctrine. For, as
I lately intimated, and do more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew in another
Paper,<note n="*" place="margin">A Discourse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Miracles.</note> God has
left to the Will of
Man the direction of
many Local Motions in the Parts of
his own Body, and thereby of some
others; though the Mechanical
Laws, on which the ordinary Course
of Things mainly depends, do not
only regulate the Motions of Bodies,
but the Determinations too: And
since Man himself is vouchsaf'd a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48184:134"/>
Power, to alter, in several Cases, the
usual Course of Things, it should
not seem incredible, that the latent
Interposition of Men, or perhaps An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or other Causes unthought of
by Us, should sometimes be imploy'd
to the like purposes by God, who is
not only the All-wise Maker, but the
Absolute, and yet most Just and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign,
Rector of the Universe, and of
Men.</p>
            <p>To conclude the Excursion, which
I hope will not appear useless, that
has been occasion'd by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Crises's,</hi> I think it becomes
a Christian Philosopher, to admit, in
general, that God doth sometimes in
a peculiar, though hidden way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
in the ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
and events of <hi>Crises's;</hi> but yet, that
this is done so seldom, at least in a
way that we can certainly discern,
that we are not hastily to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to an extraordinary <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and much less to the strange
care and skill of that question'd Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48184:135"/>
Case, though perhaps unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
if it may be probably accounted
for by Mechanical Laws, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Course of Things.</p>
            <p>And here, though in a place less
proper than I might have chosen, if
I had timely remembred it, I shall,
both in reference to the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Accidents that sometimes happen
in <hi>Crises's,</hi> and more generally to the
seemingly irregular <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of
the Universe, venture to offer you a
Notion, that perhaps you will not
dislike. I think then, that, when we
consider the World, and the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Changes that happen in It, with
reference to the Divine Wisdom and
Providence; the Arguments for the
<hi>Affirmative</hi> ought, in their kind, to
have more force than those for the
<hi>Negative.</hi> For it seems more allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to argue a Providence from the
exquisite Structure and Symmetry of
the Mundane Bodies, and the apt
Subordination and Train of Causes,
than to infer from some Physical <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies,</hi>
that Things are not fram'd
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48184:135"/>
and administred by a wise Author
and Rector. For the Characters
and Impressions of Wisdom, that are
Conspicuous in the curious Fabrick
and orderly Train of Things, can,
with no probability, be referr'd to
blind Chance, but must be to a most
Intelligent and Designing Agent.
Whereas, on the other hand, besides
that the <hi>Anomalies,</hi> we speak of, are
incomparably fewer, than those
Things which are regular, and are
produc'd in an orderly Way; besides
this, I say, the Divine Maker of the
Universe being a most free Agent,
and having an Intellect infinitely Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to Ours, may, in the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of seemingly irregular <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
have Ends unknown to us, which
even the <hi>Anomalies</hi> may be very fit to
compass.</p>
            <p>Thus, when a Man, not vers'd in
the Mathematicks, looks upon a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Geographical Globe, though,
as soon as he perceives that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Bignesses, and particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Kingdoms and Provinces,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48184:136"/>
and the apt Situations, true Distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Bearings of the Cities and
Towns he knows by Sight or Fame,
be rightly set down; he cannot but
conclude, from these Impresses of
Art or Skill, that this was the Work
of a designing Artificer. But though
he also sees on the same Globe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circles, as the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi>
the <hi>Meridians,</hi> &amp;c. if he be a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Man, he will not think that these
were made by Chance only, because
he knows not the Reasons or Uses of
Them, or because some of the Lines,
as those Curve-Lines the Seamen
call <hi>Rumbs,</hi> are not, like the other,
Circular, but do odly, and with a
seeming Irregularity, intersect them:
But will rather think, that the Artist,
that had knowledg enough to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Globe of the Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in a Body not two foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
had also skill enough to draw
those Lines, with some Design wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the same Skill, though not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to those that are unacquainted
with his Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:48184:136"/>
I did not incogitantly speak of <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities,</hi>
as if they might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be <hi>but seeming</hi> Ones. For I
think it very possible, that an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of so vast a Comprehension, and
so piercing a Sight, as is the Maker
of the World, might, in this great
<hi>Automaton</hi> of His, have so order'd
Things, that divers of Them may
appear to us, and as it were break
out, abruptly and unexpectedly, and
at great distances of Time or Place
from one another, and on such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
be thought Irregular; which
yet really have, both in his Preordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and in the Connection of
their Genuine Causes, a reference
that would, if we discern'd it, keep
us from imputing it either to <hi>Chance,</hi>
or to <hi>Nature's Aberrations.</hi> To illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this a little, let us consider,
that if, when the Jesuits, that first
came into <hi>China,</hi> presented a curious
striking Watch to the King, he that
look'd to it had wound up the Alarm,
so as to strike a little after One; if,
I say, this had been done, and that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48184:137"/>
these <hi>Chineses,</hi> that look'd upon it as
a living Creature, or some <hi>European</hi>
Animal, would think, that when
the <hi>Index,</hi> pointing at two of the
Clock, likewise struck the same
Hour, and so three, four, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
they would judg that these
Noises were regularly produc'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they (at equal Intervals of
time) heard them, and whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Index</hi> pointed at an Hour,
and never but then; but when the
Alarm came unexpectedly to make a
loud, confus'd, and more lasting
Noise, they could scarce avoid think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Animal was sick, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
disorder'd: And yet the
Alarming noise did as properly flow
from the Structure of the little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and was as much design'd by
the Manager of it, as those Sounds of
the Clock, that appear'd manifestly
Regular.</p>

            <head>SECT. VII.</head>
            <p>I proceed now to the Sixth and
Difficultest part of my Task,
which is to shew, That the most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and current <hi>Effata</hi> and <hi>Axioms</hi>
concerning <hi>Nature,</hi> that are wont to
be imploy'd in the Writings of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
may have a fair Account
given of them, agreeably to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
I have hitherto propos'd, tho'
these <hi>Axioms</hi> do some of them <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi>
and others seem strongly to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
the receiv'd Notion of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear the way for the ensuing
Explications, I must desire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
to mind the two Cautions I have
formerly offer'd you (in the Fifth
Section,) wherewith I would have
the common Doctrine, about the
Ends or Designs of <hi>Nature,</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
or limited. And therefore
I shall not here repeat, what I there
said, but only add in two words,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48184:138"/>
that if those, and some few other
such things, had been observ'd and
duly consider'd, they might perhaps
have prevented much of the Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and some of the Errors, that
relate to the Notion of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope you have not forgot, that
the design of this Paper was, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi>
not to establish a new One of my
own. And indeed the Ambiguity
of the Word is so great, (as hath in
the Second Section been made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
and 'tis, even by Learned
Men, frequently imploy'd to signifie
such different Things; that, without
Enumerating and Distinguishing its
various Acceptions, it were very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe</hi>
to venture a giving a <hi>Definition</hi>
of it, and perhaps it were very <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
to give any, that would not be
liable to censure. I shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here presume to <hi>define</hi> a Thing,
of which I have not found a stated
and setled Notion so far agreed on
amongst Men, but that I was oblig'd,
out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and Others, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48184:138"/>
in the Fourth Section, a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<hi>Representation</hi> of the vulgarly
receiv'd <hi>Idea,</hi> or Notion of <hi>Nature:</hi>
And afterwards to draw up, as well
as I could, instead of an accurate <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,</hi>
tolerable <hi>Descriptions</hi> of
what, on most occasions, may be
intelligibly meant by It. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
desiring and presuming, that
you will retain in your Mind, and,
as occasion shall require, apply, in
the following Part of this Essay, the
Things already delivered in the
Fourth Section, I will not trouble
you with the Repetition of Them.</p>
            <p>But before I descend to treat of
the particular <hi>Effata</hi> or Sentences,
that are Receiv'd concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's</hi>
Actings, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nor unuseful, to try if we can
clear the way, by considering in
what sense <hi>Nature</hi> may, or may not,
be said <hi>to act at all,</hi> or <hi>to do this or
that.</hi> For, for ought I can clearly
discern, whatsoever is perform'd in
the merely Material World, is really
done by particular Bodies, acting
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48184:139"/>
according to the Laws of Motion,
Rest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are setled and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by God among Things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.
In which <hi>Hypothesis, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
seems rather a Notional Thing,
than a true Physical, and distinct or
separate, Efficient; such as would
be, in case <hi>Aristotles</hi> Doctrine were
true, one of those Intelligences, that
he presum'd to be the Movers of the
Coelestial Orbs. But Men do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
express themselves so very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously
or intricately, when they
say, that <hi>Nature does this and that,</hi>
or, that <hi>She acts thus and thus;</hi> that
'tis scarce (if at all) possible to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
their Expressions into any
Forms of Speech, adequate to the
Original and yet Intelligible. For
which Reason, though I have in the
Section said something to the same
purpose with what I am now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet the difficulty and weight
of the Subject makes me think it
may be expedient, if not necessary,
in this place somewhat more fully
to declare what Men do, or should,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48184:139"/>
mean, when they speak of <hi>Nature's
acting,</hi> or of a Thing's being Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
done or performed, by giving
their Words and Phrases sometimes
one Interpretation, and sometimes
another.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Sometimes</hi> when 'tis said, that
<hi>Nature does this or that;</hi> 'tis less
proper to say, that 'tis done <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
than, that it is done <hi>according
to Nature.</hi> So that, <hi>Nature</hi> is not
here to be look'd on, as a distinct or
separate Agent, but as a Rule, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Systeme of Rules, according
to which, those Agents, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
they work on, are, by the Great
Author of Things, determin'd to
act and suffer.</p>
            <p>Thus, when Water is rais'd in a
Sucking-Pump, 'tis said, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
makes the Water ascend after
the Sucker, to prevent a <hi>Vacuum;</hi>
though in reality this Ascension is
made, not by such a separate Agent,
as <hi>Nature</hi> is fancied to be, but by
the Pressure of the Atmosphere, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Water, according to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48184:140"/>
Statical Rules, or the Laws or the
<hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of Liquors, settled by
God among Fluids, whether Visible
or Pneumatical. So, when the strict
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> tell us, that all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Coelestial Orbs, being by a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that they call <hi>Violent,</hi> hurried
about the Earth every four and
twenty Hours from East to West;
each of the Planetary Orbs has a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Motion,</hi> that is quite contrary,
tending from the West to the East:
If they will speak congruously to
their Master's Doctrine, they must
use the term <hi>Natural</hi> in the sense our
Observation gives It: Since <hi>Aristotle</hi>
will have the Coelestial Orbs to be
moved by external or separate Agents
namely, Spiritual <hi>Intelligences.</hi> Our
Observation may be also illustrated
by other forms of Speech, that are
in use; as when 'tis said, that the
Law takes care of Infants and Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
that their indiscreet Actions
or Omissions should not damnifie
their Inheritances; and, that the
Law Hangs Men for Murther, but
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48184:140"/>
only Burns them in the Hand for
some lesser Faults; of which Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Meaning is, that Magistrates
and other Ministers of Justice, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the Law of the
Land, do the things mention'd. And
it tends yet more directly to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to take Notice, that 'tis common
to ascribe to Art those things that
are really perform'd by Artificers,
according to the Prescriptions of the
Art, as when 'tis said, that Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
(as the Name imports,)
measures Lands, Astrology foretels
Changes of Weather and other fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Accidents, Architecture makes
Buildings, and Chymistry prepares
Medicines.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Sometimes,</hi> when divers Things,
such as the Growth of Trees, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turations
of Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are said to
be perform'd by the course of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
the Meaning ought to be, that
such things will be brought to pass
by their proper and immediate Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
according to the wonted <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
and <hi>Series</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> of their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48184:141"/>
Thus 'tis said, that, by the course
of <hi>Nature</hi> the Summer days are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than those of the Winter: That,
when the Moon is in Opposition to
the Sun, (that is in the Full Moon,)
that Part of Her Body which respects
the Earth, is more Enlightned than
at the New Moon, or at either of the
Quadratures: And lastly, That
when She enters more or less into
the Conical Shadow of the Earth,
She suffers a total or a partial Eclipse.
And yet these and other Illustrious
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be clearly explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without recourse to any such
Being as the <hi>Aristotelians Nature,</hi>
barely by considering the Situations
and wonted Motions of the Sun or
Earth, and the Moon, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to each other, and to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Globe.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be amiss to
take notice, that we may sometimes
usefully distinguish between the
<hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> more properly so
call'd, and the <hi>Custom of Nature,</hi> or,
if you please, between the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48184:141"/>
and General Constitutions
among Bodily Things, and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws, (if I may so call them,)
that belong to this or that particular
sort of Bodies. As, to resume and
somewhat vary our Instance drawn
ftom Water; when this falls to the
Ground, it may be said to do so by
virtue of the <hi>Custom of Nature,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost constantly usual for that
Liquor to tend downwards, and
actually to fall down, if it be not
externally hinder'd. But when
Water ascends by Suction in a
Pump, or other Instrument,
that Motion, being contrary to
that which is wonted, is made
in virtue of a more Catholick <hi>Law
of Nature,</hi> by which 'tis provided,
that a greater Pressure, which in
our case the Water suffers from the
weight of the Incumbent Air, should
surmount a lesser, such as is here
the Gravity of the Water, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
in the Pump or Pipe.</p>
            <p>The two foregoing Observations
may be farther illustrated, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48184:142"/>
in what sense Men speak of
things which they call <hi>Praeter-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
or else <hi>Contrary to Nature.</hi> For
divers, if not most, of their Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of this kind, argue, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is in Them taken for the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and Subordinate, or, as it were,
the Municipal Laws establish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Bodies. Thus Water, when
'tis intensly Hot, is said to be in a
<hi>Praeter-natural</hi> State, because it is in
One that 'tis not usual to It, and, Men
think, doth not regularly belong to
It; though the Fire or Sun, that
thus agitates It and puts it into this
State, is confess'd to be a Natural
Agent, and is not thought to act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than according to <hi>Nature.</hi>
Thus, when a Spring, forcibly bent,
is conceiv'd to be in a State contrary
to its <hi>Nature,</hi> as is argued from its
incessant Endeavour to remove the
compressing Body; this State, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Praeter-natural,</hi> or contrary to
<hi>Nature,</hi> should be thought such, but
in reference to the Springy Body.
For otherwise 'tis as agreeable to the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48184:142"/>
grand Laws, that obtain among
Things Corporeal, that such a Spring
should remain bent by the degree of
Force, that actually keeps it so, as
that it should display itself in spight
of a less, or incompetent, Degree of
Force. And to omit the Six <hi>Non-natural</hi>
Things, so much spoken of
by Physitians, I must here take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that though a Disease be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reckon'd as a <hi>Praeter-natural</hi>
Thing, or, as Others carry the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
further, a State <hi>contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
yet, that must be understood
only with reference to what custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
happens to a human Body:
Since excessively cold Winds, and
immoderate Rains, and sultry Air,
and other Usual Causes of Diseases,
are as Natural Agents, and act as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to the Catholick Laws of
the Universe, when they produce
Diseases, as when they condense
the Clouds into Rain or Snow, blow
Ships into their Harbour, make
Rivers overflow, ripen Corn and
Fruit, and do such other Things,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48184:143"/>
whether they be hurtful or benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to Men. And, upon a like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
when Monsters are said to be
<hi>Praeternatural</hi> Things; the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is to be understood with regard
to that particular <hi>Species</hi> of Bodies,
from which the Monster does enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
deviate, though the Causes,
that produce that Deviation, act but
according to the general Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Things Corporeal are guided.</p>
            <p>3. I doubt, whether I should add
as a Third Remark, or as somewhat
that is referrable to one or both
of the Two foregoing, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
when 'tis said, that <hi>Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
this or that Thing,</hi> we are not
to conceive, that this Thing is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
really produc'd by other than by
proper Physical Causes or Agents;
but, in such Expressions, we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to look upon <hi>Nature,</hi> either as a
Relative Thing, or as a Term im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to denote a Notional Thing,
with reference whereunto Physical
Causes are consider'd, as acting after
some peculiar manner, whereby we
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48184:143"/>
may distinguish their Operations
from those that are produc'd by other
Agents, or perhaps by the same, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
as acting in another Way.
This, I think, may be Illustrated by
some other receiv'd Expressions, or
Forms of Speech. As, when many
of the Ancient, and some of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
Philosophers, have said, that
<hi>Things are brought Fatally to pass;</hi>
they did not mean, that <hi>Fate</hi> was a
distinct and separate Agent, but only,
that the Physical Causes perform'd
the Effect, as, in their Actings, they
had a necessary Dependance upon one
another, or an inviolable Connexion
that link'd them together. And on
the other side, when Men say, as they
too frequently do,
that <hi>Fortune or
Chance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Differunt autem Fortuna &amp; Casus, quia Casus latius patet. Quod enim Ã  Fortuna est, Casu est: hoc autem non omne est Ã  Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. <hi>Arist. Auscult.</hi> lib. ii. cap. 4.</note>

               </gap>
(for <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
and his Followers
distinguish Them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
what unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
happens to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48184:144"/>
Deliberating or Designing, and to the
later, what happens to Inanimate or
Undesigning Beings,) <hi>has done this
or that:</hi> Considerate Philosophers do
not look upon <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>Chance</hi> as a
true and distinct Physical Cause, but
as a Notional Thing, that denotes,
that the proper Agents produc'd the
Effect without an Intention to do so,
(as I have more fully declar'd in the
Fourth Section.)</p>
            <p>One may, for ought I know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Impertinence, refer to this our
Third Observation, That many
Things are wont to be attributed to
<hi>Time;</hi> as, when we say, that <hi>Time</hi>
ripens some Fruits that are too early
gather'd; that it makes many things
moulder and decay, <hi>(Tempus edax
rerum;)</hi> that 'tis the Mother of Truth;
that it produces great Alterations,
both in the Affairs of Men, and in
their Dispositions and their Bodies:
To omit many other Vulgar Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which represent Time as the
Cause of several Things, whereof
really it is but an Adjunct or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48184:144"/>
of the Effects, (however
Coincident with the successive Parts
of Time, and so, some way, related
to It) being indeed produc'd by other
Agents, that are their true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Efficients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometimes</hi> likewise, when it is said,
that <hi>Nature does this or that,</hi> we ought
not to suppose, that the Effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a distinct or separate Being;
but, on such Occasions, the Word
<hi>Nature</hi> is to be concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>d to signifie a
Complex or Convention of all the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Properties, or necessary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that belong to a Body of that
<hi>Species</hi> whereof the real Agent is, or
to more Bodies respectively, if more
must concur to the Production of the
Effect. To this sense we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
many of those Forms of
Speech, that are wont to be imploy'd,
when Physicians, or others, speak of
what <hi>Nature</hi> does in reference to
Diseases, or the Cure of them. And,
to give a right sense to such Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
I consider <hi>Nature,</hi> not as a
Principal and Distinct Agent, but a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48184:145"/>
kind of Compounded Accident, that
is (as it were) made up of, or results
from, the divers Properties and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that belong to the true Agents.
And, that the Name of a <hi>Compounded
Accident</hi> may not be startled at, I
shall, to explain what I mean by it,
observe, that, as there are <hi>some</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
or Accidents, that, at least in
comparison of <hi>others,</hi> may be call'd
<hi>Simple,</hi> as Roundness, Streightness,
Heat, Gravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so there are
<hi>others,</hi> that may be conceiv'd as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</hi>
or made up of several Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
united in one Subject: As, in
divers Pigments, Greenness is made
up of Blew and Yellow, exquisitely
mix'd; Beauty is made up of fit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
taking Features, just Stature,
fine Shape, graceful Motions, and
some other Accidents of the Human
Body and its Parts. And, of this sort
of Compounded Accidents, I am apt
to think, there are far more, than, at
the first mention of them, one would
imagine. And to this kind of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the Expressions, that <hi>Naturists</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:48184:145"/>
do on divers occasions imploy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
me to think, that, what is call'd
<hi>Nature</hi> has a great Affinity, at least
in reference to those Occasions. On
which Supposition, one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that, <hi>as</hi> when 'tis said, that
<hi>Health</hi> makes a Man Eat well, Digest
well, Sleep well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Considering
Men do not look upon <hi>Health</hi> as a
Distinct and Separate Cause of these
Effects; but, as what we lately call'd
a <hi>Compounded Accident,</hi> that is, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
of all the Real and Genuine
Causes of good Appetite, Digestion,
Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> insomuch that <hi>Health</hi> is
not so properly the Cause of these,
as their Effect or Result: <hi>So</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Things that <hi>Nature</hi> is said to do,
we need conceive no more, than that
the Effects are produc'd by Physical
Bodies and Qualities, or other proper
Causes; which, when we consider
as conspiring, or rather concurring,
to produce the same Effect, by a
Compendious Term we call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48184:146"/>
By these and the like ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
I thought fit to try,
whether I could give an Intelligible
and Commodious sense to divers
of the <hi>Maxims</hi> or <hi>Sentences;</hi> and
other Forms of Speech, that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by those, that, on many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in differing Expressions,
say, <hi>That Nature does this or that,
and acts thus and thus.</hi> But I confess,
that to clear all those ambiguous and
unskilfully fram'd Axioms and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
I found to be so intricate and
difficult a Task, that, for want of
Time, and perhaps too of Patience,
I grew weary before I had prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it to the utmost. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>though</hi> 'tis not improbable, that
some Light may be given in this dark
Subject, by what I have been now
saying, (as immature and unfinish'd,
as it is) especially if it be reflected
on in Conjunction with what hath
been formerly deliver'd (in the
Fourth Section) about <hi>Nature,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and Particular; <hi>yet</hi> I shall, at
present, make but very little use of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48184:146"/>
the Things that have been now said,
in expounding the <hi>Axioms</hi> I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to consider in this Seventh
Section; hoping, that I may, by the
help of other <hi>Mediums,</hi> dispatch my
Work without them. And, to do it
the more easily; I shall, without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myself to the Order wherein they
are marshall'd after the beginning of
the Fourth Section, treat of them in
the Order wherein I think their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
may give most Light to
one another, or in That, wherein the
Papers that belong'd to them were
retriev'd.</p>
            <p>The first of the receiv'd Axioms I
shall consider, is, that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
that <hi>Omnis Natura est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatrix
sui;</hi> where, by the Word
<hi>Nature,</hi> I suppose, they understand a
Natural Body, for otherwise I know
not what they meant: Now this
Axiom easily admits of a twofold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
For, either it may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
no more, than that no one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
does tend to its own Destruction,
that is, to destroy Itself: Or else,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48184:147"/>
that in every Body there is a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> upon whose Score,
the Body is vigilant and industrious
to preserve Its Natural State, and to
defend Itself from the Violence and
Attempts of all other Bodies that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
It, or endeavour to destroy or
harm It.</p>
            <p>In the former of these two Senses,
the Axiom may be admitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any prejudice to our Doctrine.
For since according to our <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
Inanimate Bodies can have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Appetites, nor Hatreds, nor
Designs, which are all of them Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
not of Bruit Matter but of
Intelligent Beings; I, that think In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
Bodies have no Appetites
at all, may easily grant, that they
have not any to destroy themselves.</p>
            <p>But, according to the other Sense
of the propos'd Axiom, 'twill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that every Body has within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Principle, whereby it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and with all its Power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to compass its own Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And both to do those things,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48184:147"/>
that tend thereunto, and oppose all
endeavours, that outward Agents,
or internal Distempers, may use in
order to the Destruction of It.</p>
            <p>And as this is the most Vulgar
Sense of this Axiom, so 'tis chiefly
in this Sense, that I am concern'd to
Examine It.</p>
            <p>I conceive then, that the most
Wise Creator of Things did at first
<hi>so</hi> frame the World, and settle such
Laws of Motion between the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that, as Parts, compose It; <hi>that</hi>
by the Assistence of his General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the Parts of the Universe,
especially those that are the Greater
and the more Noble, are lodg'd in
such Places, and furnish'd with such
Powers, that, by the help of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Providence, they may have
their Beings continued and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as long and as far forth, as the
Course he thought fit to establish, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Things Corporeal, requires.</p>
            <p>Upon this Supposition, which is
but a reasonable one, there will appear
no necessity to have any recourse,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48184:148"/>
for the Preservation of particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to such an Internal Appetite
and Inbred Knowledg in each of
them, as our Adversaries presume.
Since, by virtue of the Original
Frame of Things, and established
Laws of Motion, Bodies are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
determined to act on such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
after the Manner they would
do, if they had really an Aim at
Self-preservation: As you see, that,
if a blown Bladder be compress'd,
and thereby the included Air be
forc'd out of its wonted Dimensions
and Figure, it will uncessantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to throw off, and repel, that
which offers Violence unto It; and
first displace that Part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Body, that it finds Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
though in all this, there be no
Appetite in the Air, (as I elswhere
shew;) no more than in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to that particular Figure, to
maintain itself in which it seems so
concern'd.</p>
            <p>Thus, 'tis all one to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>lump of
Dough, whether you make it into a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48184:148"/>
round Loaf, or a long Rowl, or a
flat Cake, or give it any other Form:
For whatever Figure your Hands or
your Instruments leave in It, that it
will retain, without having any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to return to that, which it last
had. So, 'tis all one to a piece of
Wax, whether your Seal Imprints
on It the Figure of a Wolf, or that
of a Lamb. And, for Brevity's sake,
to pass by the Instances that might
be drawn from what happens to
Wood, and Marble, and Metals, as
they are differently shap'd by the
Statuaries Art and Tools; I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe, that the Mariner's Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
before it is excited, may have
no particular Propensity to have
respect to one Part of Heaven, more
than another; but when it has
been duly touch'd upon a Load-stone,
the <hi>Flwer-de-Luce</hi> will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to regard the North, and the
opposite Extream the South. So
that, if the <hi>Lilly</hi> be drawn aside,
towards the East or towards the
West, as soon as the Force, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48184:149"/>
it, is remov'd, it will return
to its former Position, and never
rest, 'till it regard the North. But,
in spight of this seeming Affection
of the <hi>Lilly</hi> to that Point of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
yet, if the Needle be duly
touch'd upon the contrary Pole of
the same or another vigorous Load-stone,
the <hi>Lilly</hi> will presently forget
its former Inclination, and regard
the Southern Part of Heaven; to
which Position it will, as it were,
spontaneously return, having been
forc'd aside towards the East, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West, if it be again left
to its Liberty. So that, though it
formerly seem'd so much to affect
one Point of Heaven, yet it may, in
a trice, be brought to have a strong
Propensity for the Opposite: The
<hi>Lilly</hi> having, indeed, no Inclination
for one Point of Heaven, more than
another, but resting in that Position,
to which it was last determin'd by
the prevalence of Magnetical <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
And this Example may serve to
illustrate and confirm, what we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48184:149"/>
have been lately saying in General.</p>
            <p>II. Another Received Axiom
concerning <hi>Nature,</hi> is, That She
never fails or misses of Her End,
<hi>Natura sine suo nunquam excidit.</hi>
This is a Proposition, whose Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
makes it uneasie for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
my Sense of It. But yet, to
say somewhat, if by <hi>Nature</hi> we here
understand that Being, that the
School-men Style <hi>Natura Naturans,</hi>
I grant, or rather assert, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
never misseth its End. For the
Omniscient and Almighty Author
of Things, having once fram'd the
Word, and establish'd in It the
Laws of Motion, which he constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintains, there can no Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or Anomaly, happen, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among the greater Mundane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that he did not from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
foresee and think fit to permit,
since they are but genuine Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of that Order of Things, that,
at the Beginning, he most wisely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted.
As I have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in Instances of the <hi>Eclipses</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:48184:150"/>
of the Sun and Moon; to which I
could add Others, as the Inundations
of <hi>Nilus,</hi> so necessary to the Health
and Plenty of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And though, on
some special Occasions, this Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Order, either seemingly or real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
has been violated, as when the
<hi>Sun</hi> is said to have Stood still in the
days of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to
have Divided itself to give free Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> led by <hi>Moses;</hi>
yet these things having been rarely
done, for weighty Ends and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
by the peculiar Intervention of
the first Cause, either guiding or
over-ruling the Propensities and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Secundary Agents; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, that God is frustrated of
his Ends by these design'd, though
seeming, Exorbitances, by which he
most Wisely and Effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishes
Them. But, if by <hi>Nature</hi> be
meant such a Subordinate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as Men are wont to understand
by that Name, I doubt the Axiom is
in many Cases false; for though it
it be true, as I have often said, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48184:150"/>
the Material World is so constituted,
that, <hi>for the most part,</hi> Things are
brought to pass by Corporeal Agents,
as regularly, as if they designed the
Effects they produce, yet there are
<hi>several Cases,</hi> wherein Things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
quite otherwise.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis confess'd, that when a
Woman is with Child, the Aim of
<hi>Nature</hi> is, to produce a Perfect or
Genuine human <hi>Foetus;</hi> and yet we
often see, that <hi>Nature</hi> widely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Her Mark, instead of That, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a Monster. And of This we
have such frequent Instances, that
whole Volumes have been publish'd,
to recount and describe these gross
and deform'd Aberrations of <hi>Nature.</hi>
We many times see, (and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted,) that in Feavers, and
other acute Diseases, She makes
Critical Attempts upon improper
Days, and in these unseasonable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
does not only, for the most
part, miss of her End, which is to
Cure the Patient, but often brings
him to a far worse Condition, than
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48184:151"/>
he was in, before She us'd those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying
Endeavours. To this may
may be referr'd the Cheats Men put
upon <hi>Nature;</hi> as when, by Grafting,
the Sap, that <hi>Nature</hi> raises with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to feed the Fruit of a white
Thorn. (for Instance,) is by the
Gardener brought to nourish a
Fruit of quite another Kind. So,
when Maulsters make Barley to
sprout, that Germination, whereby
<hi>Nature</hi> intended to produce Stalks
and Ears, is perverted to a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Purpose, and She deluded.
And now, to annex some Arguments
<hi>ad Hominem,</hi> we are told, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
makes every Agent aim at as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulating
the Patient to itself, and
that upon this account, the Fire aims
at converting Wood, and the other
Bodies it works on, into Fire: But,
if this be so, <hi>Nature</hi> must often miss
of Her End in Chymical Furnaces,
where the Flame does never turn
the Bricks, that it makes red-hot,
into Fire; nor the Crucibles, nor
the Cuples, nor yet the Gold and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48184:151"/>
Silver, that it throughly pervades,
and brings to be of a Colour, the
same, or very near the same, with
its own, and keeps in a very intense
Degree of Heat, and in actual Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And, even when Fire acts upon
Wood, there is but one Part of it
turn'd into Fire, since, to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Soot and concreted
Smoke, the Ashes remain fix'd and
incombustible. And so, to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instance <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> when we
are told, that <hi>Nature</hi> makes Water
ascend in Sucking-Pumps, <hi>ob fugam
Vacui,</hi> She must needs (as I formerly
noted to another Purpose,) miss of
Her Aim, when the Pump exceeds
Five and Thirty, or Forty, Foot in
Height; for then, though you
Pump never so much, and withdraw
the Air from the upper Part of the
Engine, the Water will not ascend
to the Top; and consequently, will
leave a Cavity, for whole replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
She was suppos'd to have rais'd
that Liquor Two or Three and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:48184:152"/>
III. Another of the celebrated
Axioms concerning <hi>Nature,</hi> is, that
She always acts by the shortest or
most compendious Ways, <hi>Natura
semper agit per vias brevissimas.</hi> But
this Rule, as well as divers Others,
does, I think, require to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
explained and limited, before
it be admitted. For, 'tis true, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>hat,
as I have frequently occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate,
the Omniscient Author of
the Universe has so Fram'd It, that
most of the Parts of it act as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in order to the Ends of It, as
if they did it with Design. But,
since Inanimate Bodies, at least,
have no Knowledge, it cannot reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
be suppos'd, that they mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and vary their own Actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Exigency of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Circumstances, wherewith they
must of necessity be unacquainted,
and therefore it were strange, if
there were not divers Occurrences,
wherein they are determin'd to Act
by Other, than the shortest, Ways
that lead to particular Ends, if those
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48184:152"/>
Other Ways be more congruous to
the General Laws or Customs, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
among Things Corporeal.
This I prove by Instances taken from
Gravity itself, which is, perhaps,
that Quality, which of all others is
most probably referr'd to an inbred
Power and Propension. For 'tis
true, that if a Stone, or another
heavy Body, be let fall into the free
Air, 'twill take its Course directly
towards the Centre of the Earth;
and, if it meet with an inclining
Plane, which puts it out of its Way,
it will not for all that loss its Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards the Centre, but run
along that Plane, by which Means
its Tendency downwards is prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
though not, as before, in a
perpendicular Line, yet in the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Way it is permitted to take.
These obvious <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
agree very well with the
Vulgar Axiom, and possibly were
the chief Things that induc'd Men
to frame it. But now let us suppose,
that a small Bullet of Marble or Steel,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48184:153"/>
after having for a pretty space fallen
through the Air, lights upon a Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Marble, or some such hard
Stone, that lies, as Floors are wont
to do, Horizontal; in this Case, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
shews, (as was formerly
noted on another occasion) that the
falling Stone will rebound to a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Height, (in Proportion to
That it fell from) and falling down
again rebound the second time, tho'
not so high as before; and, in short,
rebound several times, before, by
setling upon the Floor, it approaches,
as near as is permitted it, to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of heavy Bodies. Whereas, if
<hi>Nature</hi> did in all Cases act by the
most Compendious ways, this Bullet
ought not to rebound at all; but, as
soon as it found, by the hardness of
the Floor, it could descend no lower,
it ought to have rested there, as in
the nearest place it could obtain to
the Centre of the Earth, whence
every Rebound must necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it to a greater Distance. And
so likewise, when a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48184:153"/>
Bullet fasten'd to the end of a String,
is so held, that the String is <hi>(praeter
propter)</hi> Perpendicular to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
if it be thence let fall, it will not
stop at the Perpendicular Line, or
Line of Direction, which is suppos'd
to reach from the Nail or other Prop,
through the Centre of the Bullet, to
the Centre of the Earth, but will pass
beyond it, and vibrate or swing to
and fro, 'till it have pass'd again and
again the Line of Direction, for a
great while, before the Bullet come
to settle in it, though, whenever it
removes out of it, towards either
hand, it must really ascend or move
upwards, and so go further off
from the Centre of the Earth, to
which, 'tis pretended, its innate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity
determines it to approach, as
much and as soon as is possible. But
this Instance having been formerly
touch'd upon, I shall now observe, to
the same purpose, that having taken
a good Sea-Compass, [and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
succeeded with a naked,
yet nicely pois'd, Needle] and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48184:154"/>
the Magnetick Needle to rest
North and South; if I held the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Pole of a good Loadstone at a
convenient Distance, on the right or
left hand of the Lilly, this would be
drawn aside from the North Point
towards the East or West, as I
pleas'd; and then the Loadstone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remov'd quite away, the Lilly of
the Needle would indeed return
Northward, but would not stop in
the Magnetick Meridian, but pass on
divers Degrees beyond it, and would
thence return without stopping at
the <hi>Meridian Line:</hi> And so would,
by its Vibrations, describe many
Arches still shorter and shorter, 'till
at length it came to settle on <hi>it,</hi> and
recover that Position, which, if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
always acted by the most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Ways, it should have rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the first time, that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of the Loadstone it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
it. But the Truth is, that, at
least, Inanimate Bodies, acting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledg or design of their own,
cannot stop or moderate their own
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48184:154"/>
Action, but must necessarily move as
they are determin'd by the Catholick
Laws of Motion, according to which,
in one Case, the <hi>Impetus,</hi> that the
Bullet acquires by falling, is more
powerful to carry it on beyond the
Line of Direction, than the Action
of the Causes of Gravity is to stop it,
assoon as it comes to the nearest
place they can give it to the Centre
of the Earth. And something like
this happens in <hi>Levity,</hi> as well as
<hi>Gravity;</hi> for if you take an oblong
and conveniently shap'd piece of
light Wood, as Firr or Deal, and,
having thrust or sunk it to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of a somewhat deep stagnant
Water, give it Liberty to ascend, it
will not only regain the Surface of
the Water, where, by the Laws of
Gravity, it ought to rest, and did rest
before it was forc'd down, but it will
pass far beyond that Surface, and in
part as it were shoot itself up into
the Incumbent Air, and then fall
down again, and rise a second time,
and perhaps much oftner, and fall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48184:155"/>
again, before it come to settle in its
due place, in which it is in an <hi>aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi>
with the Water, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to press it upwards.</p>
            <p>Another of the Sentences that are
generally receiv'd concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
is, that She always does what is
best to be done: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
semper quod opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
est facit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Natura semper id facit quod est op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum eorum quae fieri possunt. <hi>Arist. de Coelo.</hi> lib. ii. C. 4. See also <hi>Arist. de Gen.</hi> lib. ii. cap. 10. Â§. 22.</note> But
of this it will not be
safe for me to deliver
my Opinion, 'till I
have endeavour'd to
remove the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Words; for they easily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of two different Senses, since they
may signifie, that <hi>Nature</hi> in the
whole Universe does always that
which is best, for the conservation of
It in its present State; or, that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to each Body in particular, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
does still what is best, that is,
what most conduces to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Welfare of that Body. If
the first of these Senses be pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Axiom will be less liable to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48184:155"/>
Exception. But then, I fear, it will
be difficult to be positively made
out, by such Instances as will prove,
that <hi>Nature</hi> acts otherwise than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
according to Laws Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;
and therefore, 'till I meet
with such Proofs, I shall proceed to
the other Sense that may be given
our Axiom, which, though it be the
most usual, yet, I confess, I cannot
admit, without it be both explain'd
and limited. I readily grant, that
the All-wise Author of Things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
has so fram'd the World,
that most things happen in it, as if
the particular Bodies that compose
it, were watchful both for their
Own Welfare, and That of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
But, I think, withall, that
particular Bodies, at least Those that
are Inanimate, acting without either
Knowledg or Design, their Actions
do not tend to what is best for them
in their private Capacities, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than will comport with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Laws of Motion, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Customs establish'd among
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48184:156"/>
Things Corporeal: So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to these, divers Things are
done that are neither the Best, nor
so much as Good, in reference to the
welfare of particular Bodies.</p>
            <p>These Sentiments I am induc'd to
take up, not only by the more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Considerations, that have
been formerly discours'd of and
therefore shall not here be repeated,
but by daily Observations and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Experience.</p>
            <p>We see oftentimes, that Fruit-Trees,
especially when they grow
old, will for one Season be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
with Fruit, that soon after
they decay and die; and even whilst
they flourish, the excessive Weight
of the too numerous Fruits does not
seldom break off the Branches they
grow upon, and thereby both hinders
the Maturity of the Fruit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
the Death of the Tree: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
this fatal Profuseness would have
been prevented, if a wise <hi>Nature,</hi>
harbour'd in the Plant, did, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd,
solicitously intend its Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48184:156"/>
We see also in divers Diseases, and
in the unseasonable and hurtful <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's</hi>
of Feavers, how far, what Men
call, <hi>Nature</hi> oftentimes is, from doing
that, which is best for the Sick Man's
Preservation. And indeed, (as hath
been formerly noted on another Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicaon,)
in many Diseases, as Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Convulsions, Cholera's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
a great Part of the Physicians Work
is, to appease the Fury, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Errors, of <hi>Nature,</hi> which
being, as 'twere, transported with
a blind and impetuous Passion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably
produces those dangerous
Disorders in the Body, that, if She
were wise and watchful of its Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
She would have been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to prevent, as the Physicians to
remedy Them.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, that, if <hi>Nature</hi>
be so Provident and Watchful for the
Good of Men and other Animals, and
of that Part of the World, wherein
they live; How comes it to pass,
that from time to time, She destroys
such Multitudes of Men and Beasts,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48184:157"/>
by Earthquakes, Pestilences, Famine,
and other Anomalies? And, How
comes it so often to pass in Teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Women, that, perhaps by a
Fright, or a longing Desire, or the
bare Sight of any outward Object,
<hi>Nature</hi> suffers Herself to be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,
and is brought to forget
Her Plastick Skill so much, as, instead
of well-form'd Infants, to produce
hideous Monsters, and those often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so mishapen and ill-contriv'd,
that not only Themselves are unfit
to live one Day, or perhaps one
Hour, but cannot come into the
World without killing the Mother
that bare Them. These and such
other Anomalies, though (as I have
elsewhere shewn,) they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Catholick Laws of
the Universe, and may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for in the Doctrine of God's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Providence; yet they would
seem to be Aberrations, incongruous
enough to the <hi>Idaea</hi> the Schools give
of <hi>Nature,</hi> as of a <hi>Being,</hi> that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Axiom hitherto consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48184:157"/>
               <hi>does always that which is best.</hi>
But 'tis time that we pass from that,
to the Examen of another.</p>
            <p>Though I have had occasion to
treat of <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Fifth Section,
yet I must also say something about
it in This, because I there consider'd
it, but as it is imploy'd by the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi>
and others, to shew the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Principle they call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
But <hi>now</hi> I am to treat of it, not
so much as an Argument to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
as on the score of its belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a (very plausible) Axiom to
be consider'd; although I fear, that,
by reason of the Identity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
(though consider'd in the Fifth
Sect. and here, to differing purposes)
I shall scarce avoid saying something
or other, co-incident with what has
been said already.</p>
            <p>V. The Word <hi>Vacuum</hi> being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous,
and us'd in differing Senses, I
think it requisite, before I declare my
Opinion about the generally receiv'd
Axiom of the Schools, that <hi>Natura
Vacuum horret,</hi> (or, as some express
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48184:158"/>
it, <hi>abhorret Ã  Vacuo)</hi> to premise the
chief Acceptions in which, I have
observ'd, the Term <hi>Vacuum</hi> to be
made use of. For it has sometimes
a <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi>
or strict, Signification. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Speech, <hi>To be empty,</hi> usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes,
not to be devoid of all Body
whatsoever, but of that Body that
Men suppose should be in the Thing
spoken of, or of That which it was
fram'd or design'd to contain; as
when Men say that a Purse is empty,
if there be no Mony in it; or a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when the Air is squeez'd out;
or a Barrel, when either it has not
been yet fill'd with Liquor, or has
had the Wine or other Drink drawn
out of it. The Word <hi>Vacuum</hi> is also
taken in another sense by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
that speak strictly, when they
mean by it, a Space within the World,
(for I here meddle not with the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Spaces of the School-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of the Universe,)
wherein there is not contain'd any
Body whatsoever. This Distinction
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48184:158"/>
being premis'd, I shall inform you,
that taking the Word <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the
strict Sense, though many, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, some of my best Friends,
press'd me to a Declaration of my
Sense about that famous Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<hi>An detur Vacuum,</hi> because, they
were pleas'd to suppose, I had made
more Tryals than others had done
about it, yet I have refus'd to declare
myself, either <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Contra,</hi> in that
Dispute. Since the decision of the
Question seems to depend upon the
stating of the true Notion of a Body,
whose Essence the <hi>Cartesians</hi> affirm,
and most other Philosophers deny, to
consist only in Extension, according
to the three Dimensions, Length,
Breadth, and Depth or Thickness:
For, if Mr. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Notion be
admitted, 'twill be irrational to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> since any Space, that is
pretended to be empty, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to have the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
and consequently all that
is necessary to Essentiate a Body.
And all the Experiments, that can be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48184:159"/>
made with Quicksilver, or the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china
Boyliana</hi> (as they call it,) or
other Instruments contriv'd for the
like Uses, will be eluded by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians,</hi>
who will say, that the space
deserted by the Mercury, or the Air,
is not empty, since it has Length,
Breadth, and Depth, but is fill'd by
their <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> that is fine
enough to get freely in and out of
the Pores of the Glasses, as the <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
of the Loadstone can do. But
though, for these and other Reasons,
I still forbear (as I lately said I have
formerly done,) to declare either
way in the Controversie about <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
yet I shall not stick to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
that I do not acquiesce in the
Axiom of the Schools, that <hi>Nature
abhors a Vacuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, First, I consider, that the
chief, if not the only, Reason, that
moves the Generality of Philosophers
to believe, that <hi>Nature abhors a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi>
is, that in some Cases, as the
Ascension of Water in Sucking-Pumps,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they observe, that there
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48184:159"/>
is an unusual endeavour, and perhaps
a forcible Motion in Water and other
Bodies, to oppose a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> But I,
that see nothing to be manifest here,
save that some Bodies, not devoid of
Weight, have a Motion upwards, or
otherwise differing from their usual
Motions, (as in Determination,
Swiftness, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> am not apt, without
absolute necessity, to ascribe to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
and Senseless Bodies, such as
Water, Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Appetites and
Hatreds that belong to Rational, or
or least to Sensitive, Beings; and
therefore, think it a sufficient Reason,
to decline imploying such improper
Causes, if without them, the Motions,
wont to be ascrib'd to Them, can be
accounted for.</p>
            <p>2. If the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Notion of the
Essence of a Body be admitted by us,
as 'tis by many Modern Philosophers
and Mathematicians, it can scarce be
deny'd, but that <hi>Nature</hi> does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these oftentimes Great, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Irregular, Efforts to hinder a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum;</hi>
since, it being impossible there
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48184:160"/>
should be any, 'twere a fond thing to
suppose that <hi>Nature,</hi> who is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us as a most wise Agent,
should bestir Herself, and do Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Feats, to prevent an impossible
Mischief.</p>
            <p>3. If the Atomical <hi>Hypothesis</hi> be
admitted, it must be granted, not
only that <hi>Nature</hi> does not abhor a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi>
but that a great Part of the
Things She does require it, since
they are brought to pass by Local
Motion; and yet there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cases, wherein, according to these
Philosophers, the necessary Motions
of Bodies cannot be perform'd,
unless the Corpuscles, that lie in
their way, have little empty Spaces
to retire, or be impell'd into, when
the Body, that pushes them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to displace them. So that the
<hi>Effatum,</hi> That <hi>Nature abhors a Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
agrees with neither of the two
great Sects of the Modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
            <p>But, without insisting on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of either of them, I consider,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48184:160"/>
that, for ought appears by the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
imploy'd to demonstrate <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's</hi>
abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> it may
be rational enough to think, either
that <hi>Nature</hi> does not abhor a <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
even when She seems solicitous
to hinder It; or, that She has but a
very moderate Hatred of It, in that
Sense wherein the Vulgar Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
take the Word <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if we consider, that, in almost
all visible Bodies here below, and
even in the Atmospherical Air Itself,
there is more or less of Gravity, or
Tendency towards the Centre of our
Terraqueous Globe, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that there is no need that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
should disquiet Herself, and act
irregularly, to hinder a <hi>Vacuum:</hi>
Since, without Her abhorrence of It,
it may be prevented or replenish'd,
by Her affecting to place all heavy
Bodies as near the Centre of the
Earth, as heavier than they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
And even without any Design
of Hers, not to say without Her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
a <hi>Vacuity</hi> will be as much
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48184:161"/>
oppos'd, as we really find it to be,
by the Gravity of most, if not of all,
Bodies here below, and the Conflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility
of Liquors, and other Fluids.
For, by vertue of their Gravity, and
the Minuteness of their Parts, they
will be determin'd to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into and fill all the Spaces,
that they do not find already pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
by other Bodies, either more
ponderous in <hi>Specie</hi> than themselves,
or, by reason of their firmness of Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
capable of resisting or hindring
their Descent. Agreeably to which
Notion we may observe, that, where
there is no danger of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may move, as they do, when
they are said to endeavour its Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As, if you would thrust your
Fist deep into a Pail full of Sand, and
afterwards draw it out again; there
will need nothing but the Gravity of
the Sand to make it fill up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Part of the space deserted by
your Fist. And if the Pail be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
instead of Sand, with an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
of Corpuscles more Minute
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48184:161"/>
and Glib than the Grains of Sand,
as for Instance, with Quicksilver or
with Water, then the Space, deserted
by your Hand, will be, at least as to
Sense, compleatly fill'd up by the
Corpuscles of the Liquor, which, by
their Gravity, Minuteness, and the
Fluidity of the Body, they compose,
are determin'd to replenish the Space
deserted by the Hand, that was
plung'd into either of those Liquors.
And I elsewhere shew, that, if you
take a Pipe of Glass, whose Cavity is
too narrow to let Water and Quick-silver
pass by one another in It; if, I
say, you take such a Pipe, and having
(by the help of Suction,) lodg'd a
small Cylinder of Mercury of about
half an Inch long in the lower Part
of It, you carefully stop the upper
Orifice with the Pulp of your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the Quick-silver will remain
suspended in the Pipe. And, if
then you thrust the Quick-silver di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
downwards into a somewhat
deep Glass, or other Vessel, full of
Water, till the Quick-silver be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48184:162"/>
about a Foot or more beneath
the Surface of the Water; if then
you take off your Finger from the
Orifice of the Pipe which it stopt
before, you shall immediately see
the Quick-silver ascend swiftly five
or six Inches, and remain suspended
at this new Station. Which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
seems manifestly to prove,
what I did long ago devise and do
now alledge it for: Since here we
have a sudden Ascent of so heavy a
Body as is Quick-silver, and a Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of It in the Glass, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to prevent or fill a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> for
the Pipe was open at both Ends, the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> being but genuine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of the Laws of the <hi>Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi>
of Liquors, as I elsewhere
clearly and particularly declare.</p>
            <p>When I consider, how great a
Power the School-Philosophers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
to <hi>Nature,</hi> I am the less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to think, that Her abhorrence
of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is so great, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
For I have shewn in the
Fifth Section, that Her aversion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48184:162"/>
from It, and Her watchfulness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
It, are not so great, but that,
<hi>in the sense of the Peripateticks,</hi> She
can quietly enough admit it in some
Cases, where, with a very small En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
She might prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
It, as I have particularly
manifested in the fore-cited Section.
I just now mention'd a <hi>Vacuum in
the Sense of the Peripateticks,</hi> because
when the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment is
made, <hi>though</hi> it cannot, perhaps, be
cogently prov'd, either against the
<hi>Cartesians,</hi> or some other <hi>Plenists,</hi>
that, in the upper Part of the Tube,
deserted by the Quick-Silver, there
is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the strict Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sense of the Word; <hi>yet,</hi> as the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> declare their Sense, by
divers of their Reasonings against a
<hi>Vacuum,</hi> mention'd in that Section,
'twill to a heedful Peruser appear
very hard for <hi>them</hi> to shew, that
there is not One in that Tube. And,
as by the School-mens Way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<hi>Nature</hi>'s hatred of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
from the Suspension of Water and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48184:163"/>
Liquors in Tubes and Conical
Watring-Pots, it appears, that they
thought that any Space here below,
deserted by a visible Body, not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by another Visible Body, or
at least by common Air, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Empty. <hi>So,</hi> by the Space de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by the Quick-silver at the top
of the Pipe of a Baroscope Thirty
One Inches long, One may be Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to doubt, Whether a <hi>Vacuum</hi>
ought to be thought so formidable a
Thing to <hi>Nature,</hi> as they imagine
She does, and ought to, think It?
For what Mischief do we see insue
to the Universe upon the producing
or continuance of such a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
though the deserted Space were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time greater than an Inch, and
continued many Years, as has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times happen'd in the taller sort
of Mercurial Baroscopes? And those
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> that tell us, that, if
there were a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> the Influences
of the Coelestial Bodies, that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sublunary Ones, would be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48184:163"/>
Intercepted, since Motion cannot be
made in <hi>Vacuo,</hi> would do well to
<hi>prove,</hi> not <hi>suppose,</hi> such a Necessity;
and also to consider, that in our
Case the top of the Quick-silver, to
which the <hi>Vacuum</hi> reaches, does u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
appear Protuberant; which
shews, that the Beams of Light
(which they think of great Affinity
to Influences, if not the Vehicle,)
are able to traverse that <hi>Vacuum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in spight of It reflected from the
Mercury to the Beholder's Eye. And
in such a <hi>Vacuum, as to common Air,</hi>
I have try'd that a Load-stone will
emit his <hi>Effluvia</hi> and move Iron or
Steel plac'd in It. In short, it is not
Evident, that here below <hi>Nature</hi> so
much strains Herself to hinder or
fill up a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as to manifest an
Abhorrence of It. And, without
much peculiar Solicitude, a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
at least a Philosophical One, is as
much provided against, as the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Universe requires, by
Gravity and Confluxibility of the
Liquors and other Bodies, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48184:164"/>
are placed here below. And as
for those that tell us, that <hi>Nature</hi>
abhors and prevents a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as
well in the Upper Part of the World
as the Lower, I think we need not
trouble ourselves to answer the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
till they have <hi>prov'd</hi> It. Which
I think will be very hard for Them to
do; not to mention, that a <hi>Cartesian</hi>
may tell Them, that 'twere as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
for <hi>Nature</hi> to oppose a <hi>Vacuum</hi>
in Heaven as in Earth, since the
Production of It is every where
alike Impossible.</p>
            <p>VI. I come now to the celebrated
Saying, that <hi>Natura est Morborum
Medicatrix,</hi> taken
from <hi>Hippocrat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hippocrat. <hi>Epidem.</hi> lib. 6. Â§. 5. t. 1.</note> who
<hi>expresses</hi> it in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>.
And because this Axiom is generally
Receiv'd among Physicians and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and seems to be one of the
principal Things, that has made
them introduce such a Being as they
call <hi>Nature,</hi> I think it may be Time
well employ'd, to consider some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48184:164"/>
attentively, in what Sense, and
how far, this famous Sentence, may,
or should not, be admitted.</p>
            <p>First then, I conceive it may be
taken in a Negative Sense, so as to
import, that Diseases cannot be
cur'd in such Persons, in whom
the Aggregate of the Vital Powers
or Faculties of the Body is so far
weaken'd or deprav'd, as to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unable to perform the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
necessary to Life, or at least to
actuate and assist the Remedies em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by the Physitian to preserve
or recover the Patient. This I take
to be the Meaning of such usual Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as, that <hi>Physick comes too late,</hi>
and, that <hi>Nature is quite spent.</hi> And
in this Sense I readily acknowledge
the Axiom to be true. For, where
the Engine has some necessary Parts,
whether Fluid or Solid, so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd
or weakn'd, as to render it
altogether unable to co-operate with
the Medicine, it cannot be rationally
expected, that the Administration
of that Medicine should be effectual.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48184:165"/>
But in this, I presume, there is no
Difficulty worthy to detain us. I
proceed therefore to the positive
Sense, whereof our Axiom is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and wherein it is the most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
imploy'd. For Men are wont
to believe, that there resides, in the
Body of a sick Person, a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
or Watchful Being, that
still industriously employs itself,
by its own Endeavours, as well
as by any occasional Assistence
that may be afforded it by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
to rectifie whatever is amiss,
and restore the distemper'd Body to
its Pristine state of Health. What
I think of this Doctrine, I shall leave
you to gather from the following
Discourse.</p>
            <p>I conceive then in the first Place,
that the Wise and Beneficent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the World and of Man, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that Men should, for the most
part, live a considerable number of
Years, in a Condition to act their
Parts on the Mundane Stage; He
was pleas'd to frame those Living
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48184:165"/>
               <hi>Automata, Human Bodies,</hi> that, with
the ordinary succours of Reason,
making use of their exquisite Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
fitted for Durableness, and of
the friendly, though undesign'd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the various Bodies among
which they are plac'd, they may
in many Cases recover a State of
Health, if they chance to be put
out of it by lesser Accidents than
those, that God, in compliance with
the great Ends of his General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
did not think fit to secure
them from, or enable them to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.
Many things therefore, that
are commonly ascrib'd to <hi>Nature,</hi> I
think, may be better ascrib'd to the
Mechanisms of the Macrocosm and
Microcosm, I mean, of the Universe
and the Human Body. And, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
a little my Meaning by a
gross Example or two, I desire you
will consider with me a Sea-compass,
wherein the excited Magnetick Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and the Box that holds It, are
duly pois'd by Means of a competent
number of opposite Pivats: For
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48184:166"/>
               <hi>though,</hi> if you give this Instrument
a somewhat rude Shake, you will
make the Box totter, and encline
this way and that way, and at the
same time drive the Points of the
Magnetick Needle many Degrees to
the East, or to the West; <hi>yet,</hi> the
Construction of the Instrument and
the Magnetism of one main Part of
It, are such, that, if the Force, that
first put it into a disorderly Motion,
cease from acting on It, the Box will,
after some Reciprocations, return to
its Horizontal Situation; and the
Needle, that was forc'd to deviate,
will, after a few irregular<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Motions
to this and to that side of the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Meridian, settle itself again in a
Position, wherein the <hi>Flower-de-Luce</hi>
stedfastly regards the North. And
yet this recovery to its former State
is effected in a factitious Body, by
the bare Mechanism of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
itself, and of the Earth, and
other Bodies, within whose Sphere
of Activity it is plac'd. But, because
Many have not seen a Mariner's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48184:166"/>
I will add a less apposite but
more obvious and familiar Example:
For, if when an empty Ballance is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
counterpois'd, you shall, by your
Breath or Hand, depress one of the
Scales, and thereby, for the time,
destroy the <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> yet, when
the Force is once remov'd, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
Ballance will presently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
and the Opposite will descend;
and, after a few Motions up and
down, they will both of them, of
their own accord, settle again in an
exact <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> without the help
of any such Provident Internal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nature:</hi> The absence of
whose Agency may be confirm'd by
This, that the depress'd Scale does
not at first stop at the Horizontal
Line, beneath which it was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
(as it ought to do, if it were
rais'd by an Intelligent Being,) but
rises far above It. If it be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that these Examples are
drawn from Factitious, not from
merely Physical, Bodies; I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
this brief Answer, and desire
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48184:167"/>
that it be apply'd not only to the
Two freshly mention'd Examples,
but to All of the like Kind, that may
be met with in this whole Treatise.
I say then, in short, that divers of
the Instances, we are speaking of,
are intended but for Illustrations;
and that Others may be useful Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if they should be no more than
Analogous Ones: Since Examples,
drawn from Artificial Bodies and
Things, may have both the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of being more clearly conceiv'd
by ordinary Understandings, and
That of being less obnox<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>s to be
question'd in that Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>ar in
which the Comparison or Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
consists. And I the less
scruple to employ such Examples,
because <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself and some
of his more learned Followers make
use of divers Comparisons drawn
from the Figures and other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Artificial Things, to give
an account of Physical Subjects, and
even of the Generation, Corruption
and Forms of Natural Bodies. This
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48184:167"/>
Advertisement premis'd, I persue
this Discourse, it interrupted, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
Thus in a human Body, the
Causes that disorder it are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
but Transient, whereas the
Structure of the Body itself and the
Causes that conduce to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Structure, are more sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and durable, and on that account
may enable the Engine to out-last
many Things, that are Hostile to It.
This may be somewhat illustrated,
by considering, that <hi>Sleep,</hi> though
it be not properly a Disease, easily
becomes One, when it frequently
transgresseth its due Bounds; and
even whilst it keeps within them,
it does, for the time it lasts, hinder
the exercise of many Functions of the
Body, more than several Diseases
do; and yet, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course of Things, the Matter
that lock't up the Senses being spent,
the Man of himself recovers that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and active State, on whose
score he is said to be <hi>awake.</hi> But to
come somewhat closer to the Point;
We see, that many Persons, who
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48184:168"/>
get a <hi>Praeter natural</hi> Thirst with
over-much Drinking, get rid of it
again in a few days by forbearing
such Excesses; and many, that by
too plentiful Meals are brought to a
want of Appetite, Recover, as it
were, of course, by a spare Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
in a few days; the renewed
Ferment, or <hi>Menstruum</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
being able in that time to
concoct by little and little, or expell
the indigested Aliments or peccant
Humours that offended the Stomach,
and caus'd the want of Appetite.</p>
            <p>And here I desire to have it taken
Notice of, as a thing that may be
considerable to our present Purpose,
that I look not on a Human Body, as
on a Watch or a Hand-mill, <hi>i. e.</hi> as
a Machine made up only of Solid, or
at least Consistent, Parts; but as an
Hydraulical, or rather Hydraulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumatical
Engine, that consists
not only of Solid and Stable Parts, but
of Fuids, and those in Organical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And not only so, but I consider,
that these Fluids, the Liquors and
Spirits, are in a living Man so consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48184:168"/>
that in eertain Circumstances
the Liquors are dispos'd to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Fermentation or Commotion,
whereby either some Depuration of
Themselves, or some Discharge of
hurtful Matter by Excretion, or both,
are produc'd, so as, for the most
part, to conduce to the Recovery or
Welfare of the Body.</p>
            <p>And, that even Consistent Parts
may be so fram'd, and so connected
with other Parts, as to act, as it
were, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> varying their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as differing Circumstances
make it convenient they should be
varied, I purposely shew in another
Paper. To this I might altogether
refer you; but, in regard the Thing
is a Paradox, and lays a Foundation
for Another not Inferior to itself, I
shall here borrow thence one Instance,
not mention'd that I know of by
Others to this purpose, that may
both declare my Meaning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Thing itself: I consider then,
that what is call'd the <hi>Pupil</hi> or <hi>Apple</hi>
of the <hi>Eye,</hi> is not (as 'tis known,)
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48184:169"/>
a substantial Part of the Organ, but
only a round Hole or Window made
in the <hi>Vvea,</hi> at which the Modify'd
Beams of Light enter, to fall upon
the Chrystalline Humour, and thence
be refracted to the bottom of the
Eye, or seat of Vision, to make
there an Impression, that is usually a
kind of Picture (for 'tis not always
a neat One,) of the Object. Now
the Wise and All-foreseeing Author
of Things has so admirably contriv'd
this Instrument of Sight, that, as it
happens to be employ'd in differing
Lights, so the Bigness or <hi>Area</hi> of
the Pupil varies. For when the
Light is vivid, and would be too
gteat if all the Beams were let in,
that might enter at an Aperture as
large as the usual, the Curtain is
every way drawn towards the
Middle, and thereby the round Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
made Narrower. And, on
the other side, when the Light is
but faint, and the Object but dimly
illustrated, there being more Light
requisite to make a sufficient Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48184:169"/>
at the bottom of the Eye, the
Curtain is every way drawn open, to
let in more Light: And when the
Eye is well constituted, this is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
done, according as the Organ
has need of more or less Light. Of
this, some late Masters of Opticks
have well Treated, and I have spoken
about it more fully in another place.
And the truth of the Observation
you may easily find, if you look upon
the Eyes of a Boy or a Girl, (for in
young Persons the change is the most
notable) when the Eyes are turn'd
from looking on dark Objects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
bright or more illuminated
Ones. And I have found the Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yet more conspicuous in the
Eyes of a young Cat, as I elsewhere
particularly relate. So that, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you to the Writings already
pointed at, I shall only add in this
place, that these various Motions in
the Eye are produc'd by mere Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
without the Direction, or so
much as Knowledg or Perception, of
the Rational Soul. And, upon the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48184:170"/>
like Account it is, that other Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in several Parts belonging to
the Eye, are produc'd, as 'twere
spontaneously, as occasion requires.
And so, as to the Fluid Parts of the
Body, we find, that, according to the
Institution of the Author of Things,
when healthy Women are of a fit
Age, there is a Monthly Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Commotion made in the Blood,
which usually produces a kind of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and then an Excretion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the Body.</p>
            <p>And, that you may the better
make out what I meant by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or Tendency, of the Parts,
to return to their former Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I shall desire you to consider,
with me, a thin and narrow Plate of
good Steel, or refined Silver; for, if
one End of it be forcibly drawn aside,
the changed Texture of the Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
such, or the Congruity and
Incongruity of the Pores, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the ambient <hi>Aether,</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to permeate them, is made
such, that, as soon as the Force that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48184:170"/>
bent it is remov'd, the Plate does, as
it were, spontaneously return to its
former Position. And yet here is no
internal watchful Principle, that is
solicitous to make this Restitution, for
otherwise it is indifferent to the Plate
what Figure it settle in; for, if the
Springy Body stand long Bent, then,
as if <hi>Nature</hi> forgot her Office, or
were unable to execute it, though
the Force that held the Spring bent
be remov'd, it will not endeavour to
regain its former streightness: And,
I have tryed, in a Silver Plate, that,
if you only heat it red-hot, and let it
cool, if you put it into a crooked Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
it will retain it; but barely
with two or three stroaks of a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which can only make an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
change of Texture, the Plate
will acquire a manifest and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Springyness, which you may
again deprive it of, by sufficiently
heating it in the Fire, without so
much as melting it.</p>
            <p>But, to return to the Discourse, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
begun, about Distempers wont
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48184:171"/>
to be harmless by being Transient,
we may observe, that the third or
fourth day after Women are brought
to Bed, there is commonly a kind of
Feaver produc'd, upon the plentiful
resort of the Milk to the Breasts; for
which cause, this Distemper is, by
many, call'd the <hi>Feaver of Milk.</hi> And
this is wont, in a short time, to pass
away of itself, as depending upon
Causes far less durable, than the
Oeconomy of the Womans Body.
And, if it be objected, that these are
not <hi>Diseases,</hi> because they happen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Instituted Course of
<hi>Nature;</hi> I will not now dispute the
validity of the Consequence, though
I could represent, that the Labour of
Teeming Woemen, and the breeding
of Teeth in Children, happen as
much according to the Institution of
<hi>Nature,</hi> and yet are usually very
painful, and oftentimes dangerous:
But I will rather answer, that, if the
troublesome Accidents, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
cannot serve to prove, they
may at least to illustrate, what I aim
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48184:171"/>
at. And I shall proceed to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a Distemper, that Physicians
generally reckon among <hi>Diseases,</hi> I
mean, the flowing of Blood at the
<hi>Haemorrhoidal Veins:</hi> For, <hi>though</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
this Flux of Blood is exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and so becomes very dangerous,
and therefore must be check'd by the
Physician, (which is no great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that a Being, wise and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
manages this Evacuation,) <hi>yet</hi>
frequently, if not for the most part,
the Constitution of the Body is such,
that the superfluous or vitiated
Blood goes off, before it has been
able to do any considerable mischief,
or perhaps any at all, to the Body.
And so we see, that many Coughs,
and Hoarsenesses, and <hi>Coryzas</hi> are
said to be cur'd, that is, do cease to
trouble Men, though no Medicine be
us'd against them, the Structure of
the Body being durable enough to
out-last the Peccant Matters, or the
Operation of those other Causes,
that pro-duce these Distempers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:48184:172"/>
It is a known thing, that most
Persons, the first time they go to Sea,
especially if the Weather be any
thing Stormy, are, by the unwonted
Agitations, which those of the Ship
produce in them, (assisted perhaps
by the Sea-Air, and Smells of the
Ship) cast into that Disease, that,
from the Cause of it, is call'd the
<hi>Sea-sickness,</hi> which is sometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and always very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
usually causing a loss of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and almost continual Faintness, a
pain in the Head, and almost constant
Nauseousness, accompany'd with
frequent, and oftentimes violent,
Vomitings; which Symptoms make
many complain, that, for the time,
they never felt so troublesome a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and yet usually, after not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
days, this Distemper, by degrees,
is master'd by the Powers of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
tending still to persevere in their
orderly and friendly Course, and
suppressing the adventitious Motions
that oppose it, and the sick Person
recovers without other help. And
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48184:172"/>
so, <hi>though</hi> Persons unaccustom'd to
the Sea, whether they be sick or no,
are, by the inconvenient Motions of
the Ship, usually brought to a kind
of habitual Giddiness, which dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
them to reel and falter, when they
walk upon firm ground: <hi>Yet,</hi> when
they come a Shore, they are wont
in no long time to be freed from this
uneasie Giddiness, without the help
of any Medicine: The usual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Motions of the Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
obliterating by degrees in a few
days (I us'd to be free from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
some hours,) that adventitious
Impression, that caus'd the Discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure.
To the same purpose, we may
take notice of that which happens
to many Persons, who riding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a Coach are not only much
distemper'd in their Heads, but are
made very sick in their Stomachs,
and forced to Vomit, as violently
and frequently, as if they had taken
an Emetick: And yet all this Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is wont quickly to cease, when
the Patient leaves the Coach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48184:173"/>
the continuance of whose Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(that continues a preposterous
One in some Parts of the Patient) the
Distemper will quickly yield to the
more ordinary and regular Motions
of the Blood, and other Fluids of the
Body. So, when in a Coach, or
elsewhere, a Man happens to be
brought to Faintness, or cast into a
Swoon, by the closeness of the Place,
or the over-charging of the Air with
the fuliginous Reeks of Mens Bodies;
tho' the Disease be formidable, yet, if
the Patient be seasonably brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the free Air, the friendly Operation
of That External Body, assisting the
usual Endeavours or Tendency of the
Parts of the Patients Body to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Life and Heath, is wont
quickly to restore him to the State
he was in, before this sudden Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
invaded him. Divers things,
that happen in some Diseases, may be
grosly illustrated, by supposing,
that into a Vial of fair Water some
Mud be put, and then the Vial be
well shaken, for the Water will be
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48184:173"/>
troubled and dirty, and will lose its
Transparency, upon a double Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<hi>that</hi> of the Mud, whose opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
Particles are confounded with
It; and <hi>that</hi> of the newly generated
Bubbles, that swim at the top of it;
and yet to clarifie this Water, and
and make it recover its former Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidness,
there needs no particular
Care or Design of <hi>Nature,</hi> but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common Course of
Things, after some time the Bubbles
will break and vanish at the top, and
the earthy Particles, that compose
the Mud, will, by their Gravity, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to the bottom, and settle there,
and so the Water will become clear
again. Thus also <hi>Must,</hi> which is the
lately express'd Juice of Grapes, will
for a good while continue a troubled
Liquor; but though there be no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Form to guide the Motions
of this factitious Body, yet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Course of Things, a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
is excited, and some Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles
are driven away, in the Form
of Exhalations or Vapours, others
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48184:174"/>
are thrown against the sides of the
Cask, and harden'd there into Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and others again subside to the
bottom, and settle there in the Form
of Lees; and by this means leave
the Liquor clear, and, as to Sense,
uniform. And why may not some
Depurations and Proscriptions of
Heterogeneous Parts be made in the
<hi>Blood,</hi> as well as they are usually in
<hi>Must,</hi> without any peculiar and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
Direction of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is indeed one Thing, to
which the Sentence of <hi>Nature's being
the Curer of Diseases</hi> may be very
speciously apply'd, and that is the
healing of Cuts and Wounds, which,
if they be but in the Flesh, may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
be cured without Plaisters,
Salves, or other Medicines; but,
not to mention Haemorrhagies and
some other Symptoms, wherein the
Chriurgeon is fain to curb or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
the Exorbitancies of <hi>Nature;</hi>
this Healing of the <hi>Solutio continui</hi>
seems to be but an Effect or Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of that Fabrick of the Body,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48184:174"/>
on which Nutrition depends. For
the Alimental Juice, being, by the
Circulation of the Blood and Chile,
carried to all Parts of the Body to be
nourish'd, if it meets any where,
either with preternatural Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or with a Gap made by a Cut or
Wound, its Particles do there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
into a kind of Bastard-flesh, or
some such other Body, which that
Juice, in the Place and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
'tis in, is fitted to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
Thus we see, that not only
Wens and Scrophulous Tumors are
nourish'd in the Body, but mis-sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<hi>Mola's</hi> do by Nutriment grow in
the Womb, as well as <hi>Embryo's</hi> feed
there. And, to come closer to the
present Argument, we see, that, in
Wounds, Proud-Flesh, and perhaps
<hi>Fungus's,</hi> are as well produc'd and
entertain'd by the Aliment brought
to the wounded Part, as the true and
genuine Flesh; so that either <hi>Nature</hi>
seems much mistaken, if She designs
the Production and Maintenance of
such superfluous and inconvenient
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48184:175"/>
Bodies; or the Chirurgeon is much
to blame, who is industrious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, though oftentimes he
cannot do it, without using painful
Corrosives. But, for ought appears,
<hi>Nature</hi> is not so shy and reserv'd in
Her Bounty, but that She sends Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
to repair <hi>as well</hi> Things
that do not belong to the Body, as
genuine Parts of It, <hi>as</hi> to restore
Flesh to wounded Parts, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by Warts and Corns, that grow
again after they are skilfully cut.
And, I remember, I have seen a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in whose Forehead <hi>Nature</hi> was
careful to nourish a Horn, about an
Inch and more in length, which I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examin'd, whilst it was yet grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Her Head, to avoid being
impos'd upon.</p>
            <p>But, besides the Diseases hither to
discours'd, there are many Others,
as well Acute as Chronical, wherein,
'tis confess'd, that <hi>Nature</hi> alone does
not work the Cure, so that as to
these, (which are more numerous,
than the former) I may well pretend,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48184:175"/>
that the Aphorism, that makes <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
the <hi>Curer of Diseases,</hi> is not true,
otherwise than in a limited Sense.
But, because I know 'tis pretended,
that even in these Diseases <hi>Nature</hi> is
the principal Agent, by whose Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the Physician acts in subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency
to her Designs; and Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
themselves (whether out of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
or Inadvertence, I now enquire
not,) are wont to acknowledg, that
they are but <hi>Nature's Ministers,</hi> I
think it necessary to consider briefly,
what Sense is fit, according to our
Doctrine, to be given to these Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to make them receivable by
us.</p>
            <p>But, to make way for what we
are to say on this Occasion, it may
be fit to observe, that one great
Cause of the common Mistakes about
this Matter, is, as hath been partly
intimated already, That the Body
of a Man is look'd upon, rather as a
System of Parts, whereof Most are
gross and consistent, and not a Few
hard and solid too, than as, what
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48184:176"/>
indeed it is, a very compounded
Engine; that, besides these Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
Parts, does consist of the Blood,
Chyle, Gall, and other Liquors;
also of more subtil Fluids, as Spirits
and Air; all which Liquors and
Fluids are almost incessantly and va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riously
moving, and thereby put di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Solid Parts, as the Heart
and Lungs, the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the
Hands, Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into frequent and
differing Motions. <hi>So</hi> that, <hi>as,</hi> when
the Constitution or the Motions, that
in a sound Body do regularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Fluid Parts, happens
the former to be Deprav'd, or the
later to grow Anomalous, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
is immediately out of Order,
though the gross solid Parts were not
primarily affected: <hi>So,</hi> when by
proper Remedies (whether Visible
or not,) the vitiated Texture or
<hi>Crasis</hi> of the Blood or other Juices is
corrected, and the inordinate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that They and the Spirits are
put into, or, that they also put the
consistent Parts into, are calm'd
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48184:176"/>
and rectify'd, the grosser and more
solid Parts of the Body, and so the
whole <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> if I may
so call It, will be restored to a more
convenient State. Thus we see, that
in many Hysterical Women, by the
fragrant <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Glove,
or some Other strong Perfume, the
Spirits and <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
several disorderly Symptoms
are produc'd, and oftentimes the
Motion of the Blood is so stopt or
abated, that any Pulse at all is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be felt, nor Respiration dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and the whole Engine, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to sustain itself, falls to the
Ground, and lies moveless on It;
and yet we have often, by barely
holding to the Patient's Nostrils a
Vial full of very strong Spirit, or
Volatile Salt, or <hi>Sal-armoniack,</hi> or
of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> in less than a quarter
of an Hour, sometimes in a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
restor'd Women in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to their Senses, Speech and
Motion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:48184:177"/>
We are also here to consider, what
I have formerly inculcated, that the
Oeconomy of the human Body is so
constituted by the Divine Author
of It, that it is usually fitted to last
many Years, if the more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Laws, setled by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Universe, will permit it.
And therefore 'tis not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at, that in many Cases, the
<hi>Automaton</hi> should be in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to concur, though not with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Design, to its own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
when, though it had been
put somewhat out of Order, 'tis as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by the Physicians Hands or
Medicines to recover a convenient
State.</p>
            <p>And if it be objected, that the
Examples, that have been in this past
Discourse frequently drawn from
<hi>Automata,</hi> are not adequate, and do
not fully reach the Difficulties we
have been speaking of, I shall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
grant it, provided it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that I avowedly and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
suppose the Bodies of living
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48184:177"/>
Animals to be, Originally, Engins
of God's own framing, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Effects of an Omniscient
and Almighty Artificer. So that,
'tis not Rational to expect, that in
the incomparably inferior Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of human Skill, there should be
found Engins fit to be compar'd with
These, which, in their Protoplasts,
had God for their Author. Not to
mention, (what yet may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in reference to the Lastingness
of human Life,) that a Man is not
a mere Mechanical Thing, where
nothing is perform'd for the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Engine, or its Recovery
to a good State, but by its own
Parts, or by other Agents, acting
according to Mechanical Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Counsel or Design; since, though
the Body of a Man be indeed an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
yet there is united to It an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Being, (the Rational Soul
or Mind,) which is capable, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if instructed by the Physitians
Art, to discern, in many Cases,
what may hurt It, and what may
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48184:178"/>
conduce to the Welfare of It, and
is also able (by the Power it has to
govern the Muscles and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of voluntary Motion,) to do
many of those Things it judges most
conducive to the Safety and the
Welfare of the Body, 'tis join'd with.
So that, a Man is not like a Watch,
or an <hi>Empty Boat,</hi> where there
is nothing but what is purely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical;
but like a <hi>Mann'd Boat,</hi>
where, besides the Machinal Part,
(if I may so speak) there is an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Being that takes Care of It, and
both steers It, or otherwise guides
It, and, when need requires, trimms
It; and, in a word, as Occasion
serves, does what he can to preserve
It, and keep It fit for the Purposes,
'tis design'd for.</p>
            <p>These Things being premis'd, I
think the Physitian (here suppos'd
to be free from Prejudices and
Mistakes,) is to look upon his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
Body, as an Engine that is out
of Order, but yet is so constituted,
that, by his Concurrence with the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48184:178"/>
Endeavours, or rather Tendencies,
of the Parts of the <hi>Automaton</hi> itself,
it may be brought to a better State.
If therefore he find, that, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Disposition of the Body, there is
a Propensity or Tendency to throw
off the Matter that offends It, and
(which ought to be some way or
other expell'd,) in a convenient
Way, and at commodious Places;
he will then act so, as to comply
with, and further, that Way of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
rather than Another. As,
if there be a great Appearance, that
a Disease will quickly have a <hi>Crisis</hi>
by Sweat; he will rather further It
by covering the Patient with warm
Cloaths and giving Sudorifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
than, by endeavouring to
carry off the peccant Matter by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or Vomiting, unseasonably hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Discharge, that probably will
be beneficial: And in this Sense
Men may say, if they please, that
the Physicians are Ministers or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of <hi>Nature;</hi> as Sea-Men, when
the Ship goes before a good Wind,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48184:179"/>
will not shift their Sails, nor alter
the Ships Motion, because they need
not. But to shew, that 'tis as 'twere
by Accident, that the Physitian does,
in the fore-mention'd Case, obey
<hi>Nature,</hi> (to speak in the Language
of the <hi>Naturists,</hi> I reason with,) I
need but represent, that there are
many other Cases, wherein the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
if he be skilful, will be so
far from taking <hi>Nature</hi> for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
to direct him by Her Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
what should be done; that a
great Part of his Care and Skill is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
<hi>to</hi> hinder Her from doing
what She seems to Design, and <hi>to</hi>
bring to pass Other Things very
differing from, if not contrary to,
what She Endeavours.</p>
            <p>Thus, though <hi>Nature</hi> in Dropsies
inportunately crave store of Drink,
the Physician thinks himself oblig'd
to deny It; as he does what they gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
desire, to his Patients of the
<hi>Green-Sickness,</hi> or that Distemper
they call <hi>Pica:</hi> Though the absurd
and hurtful Things, as very unripe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48184:179"/>
Fruit, Lime, Coals, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
Things, be earnestly long'd
for. Thus also the Chirurgeon does
often hinder <hi>Nature</hi> from closing
up the Lips of a Wound, as She
would unskilfully do, before it be
well and securely heal'd at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
So the Physician does often,
by Purging or Phlebotomy, carry off
that Matter, that <hi>Nature</hi> would more
dangerously throw into the Lungs,
and expel by frequent and violent
Coughs.</p>
            <p>And so, if a Nerve or Tendon be
prick'd, the Chirurgeon is fain, with
Anodynes, and other convenient
Medicines, to prevent or appease
the unreasonable Transports of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
when, being in a Fury, by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and threatning Convulsions, She
not only much disorders, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers,
the Patient. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
when in those Evacuations that
are peculiar to Women, <hi>Nature</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
in some Individuals, to make
them by undue and inconvenient
Places, as the Nipples, the Mouth,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48184:180"/>
or the Eyes, whereof we have divers
Instances, among the Observations
collected by <hi>Schenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Schenk. <hi>Obser.</hi> l. IV. pag. m. 633. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
               </note>
or related by
other good Authors.
The Physitian is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by Bleeding the Patient in the
Foot and by using other Means, to
oblige <hi>Nature</hi> to alter Her Purpose,
and make the intended Evacuations
by the proper Uterine Vessels. And,
<hi>tho'</hi> according to the Institution of
<hi>Nature,</hi> as they speak, there ought to
be a Monthly discharge of these Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
and therefore, whilst
this is moderately made, the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
does rather further than sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
It: <hi>Yet</hi> if, as it often happens
in other Patients, <hi>Nature</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lashes
in making those Evacuations,
to the great weakning or endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Sick Person, the Physitian
is careful by contemperating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and other Ways to correct <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s
exorbitancy and check Her
profuseness of so necessary a Liquor,
as the Blood. Other Instances, more
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48184:180"/>
considerable, than some of these hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
mention'd, might be given
to the same purpose; but I forbear
to do it, because, there being some,
though perhaps very needless, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
about Them, I could not
make out their fitness to be here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
without more Words, than I
am now willing to employ about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Proofs, fearing it might be
thought, I have dwelt too long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
upon the Explication of One
Aphorism. I shall therefore only
observe in short, that I look upon a
good Physician, not so properly as a
<hi>Servant</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> as One that is a
<hi>Counsellor</hi> and a Friendly <hi>Assistant,</hi>
who, in his Patient's Body, furthers
these Motions and other Things, that
he judges conducive to the Welfare
and Recovery of It; but as to Those,
that he perceives likely to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
either by encreasing the Disease,
or otherwise endangering the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
he think it is his Part to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or hinder, though <hi>Nature</hi> do
manifestly enough seem to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48184:181"/>
the exercising or carrying on
those hurtful Motions.</p>
            <p>On this occasion, I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Practice of the more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
among Physicians themselves,
who, being call'd to a Patient, subject
to the Flux of the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> if
they find the Evacuation to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
and likely either to benefit
the Patient on another account, (as
in some Cases 'tis,) or at least to end
well, they do, as some of them
speak, commit the whole business
to <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, to speak intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly,
they suffer It to take its Course,
being incouraged to do so, in some
Cases, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hippocrat. Lib. vi. Aphorism. xi.</note>
and in others by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
But, if the
Evacuation prove to be too lasting,
or too copious, they then are careful
to hinder <hi>Nature</hi> from proceeding in
it, and think themselves oblig'd to
imploy both inward and outward
Means, to put a stop to an Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may bring on a Dropsie,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48184:181"/>
or some other formidable Disease
And if it be said, that <hi>Nature</hi> makes
this Profusion of so necessary a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
as <hi>Blood,</hi> only because She is
irritated by the Acrimony of some
Humour mix'd with it; I say, that
this Answer, which, for Substance,
is the same that <hi>Naturists</hi> may be
compell'd to fly to, on many Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is in effect a Confession, that
<hi>Nature</hi> is no such wise Being as they
pretend; since She is so often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
to act, as it were, in a Fury,
and do those things in the Body, that
would be very mischievous to It, if
the Physitian, more calm and wise
than She, did not hinder Her. So
that, notwithstanding the reverence
I pay the great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it is not
without due Caution and some Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
that I admit that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sentence of his, where he thus
speaks;<note n="*" place="margin">Hippocrat. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi> l. 6. Â§ 5. text. 2. 4.</note>

Which, I fear, makes many Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
less couragious and careful
than they should, or perhaps would
be, to employ their own Skill on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Occasions, that much require
It.</p>
            <p>I shall now add, that, <hi>as</hi> in <hi>some
Cases,</hi> the Physitian relieves his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in a <hi>Negative</hi> Way, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Nature</hi> in her unseasonable or
disorderly Attempts: <hi>So</hi> in other
Cases, he may do it in a <hi>Positive</hi>
Way, by employing Medicines that
<hi>either</hi> strengthen the Parts, as well
Fluid as Stable, or make sensible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations
of Matters necessary to
be proscrib'd by Them; or (he may
do it,) by using Remedies, that by
their manifest Qualities oppugn
those of the Morbifick Matter or
Causes; as when by Alcaly's or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorbing
Medicaments he mortify's
<hi>Praeter-natural</hi> Acids, or disables
Them to do Mischief. And, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
One may venture to say, that,
in some Cases, the Physitian may<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:48184:182"/>
in a <hi>Positive</hi> Way, contribute more to
the Cure even of an inward Disease,
than <hi>Nature</hi> Herself seems able to
do: For, if there be any such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
preparable by Art, as <hi>Helmont</hi>
affirms may be made of <hi>Paracelsus's
Ludus,</hi> by the Liquor Alkahest; or,
as <hi>Cardan</hi> relates, that an <hi>Empirick</hi>
had in his Time, who, travell'd up
and down <hi>Italy,</hi> curing Those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he came, that were tormented
with the Stone of the Bladder; If, I
say, there be any such Medicines,
the Physitian may, by such Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
perform that, which, for
ought appears, is not to be done by
<hi>Nature</hi> Herself, since we never find,
that She dissolves a confirm'd Stone
in the Bladder. Nay, sometimes
the Physician does, even without
the help of a Medicine, controle and
over-rule <hi>Nature,</hi> to the great and
sudden Advantage of the Patient.
For, when a Person, otherwise not
very weak, happens by a Fright, or
some surprising ill News, to be so
discompos'd, that the Spirits hastily
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48184:183"/>
and disorderly thronging to some
inward Part, especially the Heart,
hinder the regular and wonted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of It, by which disorder the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Blood is hinder'd, or
made very imperfect: In this Case,
I say, the Patient is by <hi>Nature</hi>'s great
Care of the Heart, (as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppos'd even by Physitians,) cast
into a Swoon; whence the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
sometimes quickly frees him, by
rubbing and pinching the Limbs, the
Ears and the Nose, that the Spirits
may be speedily brought to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Parts of the Body; which
must be done by a Motion to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
(as they call It,) quite
opposite to That towards the Centre
or Heart, which <hi>Nature</hi> had given
Them before. But as to the Theory
of Swoonings, I shall not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
its Truth, it being sufficient
to warrant my drawing from thence
an Argument <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> that the
Theory is made Use of by Those I
reason with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:48184:183"/>
By what has been discours'd One
may perceive, that, as there are some
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that seem to favour the
Doctrine of the <hi>Naturists</hi> about the
Cure of Diseases, so there are Others,
that appear more manifestly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we propose.
And both these sorts of <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
being consider'd together, may well
suggest a Suspition, that the most
Wise and yet most Free Author of
Things, having fram'd the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
of Mankin'd, so as to be
fit to last many Years, and endow'd
those <hi>Protoplasts</hi> with the Power of
propagating their <hi>Species;</hi> it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
comes to pass, that in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<hi>Hydraulico-pneumatical</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
we call Human Bodies, when
neither particular Providence, nor
the Rational Soul, nor over-ruling
Impediments interpose, Things are
generally perform'd according to
Mechanical Laws and Courses;
whether the Effects and Events of
these prove to be conducive to the
welfare of the Engine itself, or else
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48184:184"/>
cherish and foment Extraneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
or Causes, whose Preservation
and Prospering are hurtful to It. On
which Supposition it may be said,
That the happy things, referr'd to
<hi>Nature</hi>'s prudent Care of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and Welfare of sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are usually genuine Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the Mechanism of the
World, and the Patients Body;
which Effects luckily happen to be
co-incident with his Recovery, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to have been purposely
and wisely produced in order to It;
since, I observe, that <hi>Nature</hi> seems
to be careful to produce, preserve,
and cherish Things hurtful to the
Body, as well as Things beneficial
to It. For we see in the Stone of
the Kidneys and Bladder, that out
of Vegetable or Animal Substances
of a slighter Texture, such as are
the Alimental Juices, which, in Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Children (who are observ'd to
be frequently subject to the Stone in
the Bladder) are afforded by so mild
a Liquor as Milk; <hi>Nature</hi> skilfully
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48184:184"/>
frames a hard Body of so firm a Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it puzzles Physicians and
<hi>Chymists</hi> to tell, how such a <hi>Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
can be made of such Substances:
And I have found more than one <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
to resist both Spirit of Salt, that
readily dissolves Iron and Steel, and
that highly Corrosive <hi>Menstruum,</hi>
Oyl of Vitriol itself. We see also,
that, divers times, the Seeds or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Principles of Worms, that lye
conceal'd in unwholesome Fruits, and
other ill-qualifi'd Aliments, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
and cherish'd in the Body, so,
as in spight of the <hi>Menstruum's</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they meet with there,
they grow to be perfect Worms, (of
their respective kinds) that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
very troublesome, and sometimes
very dangerous, to the Body that
harbours them: Producing, though
perhaps not immediately, both more
and more various Distempers (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
here in <hi>England)</hi> than every
Physician is aware of. This Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
may very well be applied to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48184:185"/>
those Instances we
meet with in good
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Schenck. Observ.</hi> Lib. 3. Pag. mihi 337. &amp; seq.</note> Authors, of Frogs,
and even Toads,
whose Spawn, being taken in with
corrupted Water, hath been cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Stomach 'till the Eggs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grown to be compleat Animals,
they produc'd horrid Symptoms in
the Body, that had lodg'd and fed
them. And if, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Opinion of Physicians, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Quartans are produc'd by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Humour seated in the
Spleen; it may be said, that <hi>Nature</hi>
seems to busie Herself to convert
some Parts of the Fluid Chile into
so tenacious and hardly dissipable a
Juice, that in many Patients, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Neighbourhood of
the Spleen and Stomach, neither
strong Emeticks, nor Purges, nor
other usual Remedies, are able, in a
long time, to dislodg it, or resolve it,
or correct it. But that is yet more
conducive to my present purpose,
that is afforded me by the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48184:185"/>
of the Poyson of a Mad-dog,
which <hi>Nature</hi> sometimes seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
and solicitously to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:
Since we have Instances, in
approved Authors, that a little Foam
convey'd into the Blood by a slight
hurt, (perhaps quickly heal'd up,)
is, notwithstanding the constant Heat
and perspirable Frame of the Human
Body, and the dissipable Texture of
the Foam, so preserved, and that
sometimes for many Years, that, at
the end of that long time, it breaks
out, and displays its fatal Efficacy
with as much vigour and fury, as if
it had but newly been receiv'd into
the Body.</p>
            <p>To this agrees That which is well
known in <hi>Italy,</hi> about the biting of
the <hi>Tarantula.</hi> For, though the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Poyson can scarce be visible,
since 'tis communicated by the
Tooth of so small an Animal as a
Spider, yet, in many Patients, 'tis
preserved during a great part of
of their Lives, and manifests its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in the Body by Annual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysms.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48184:186"/>
And, I know a Person of
great Quality, who complain'd to
me, that, being in the <hi>East,</hi> the biting
or stinging of a Creature, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Arms were so small, that the
Eye could very hardly discern the
Hurt, had so lasting an Effect upon
him, that, for about twelve Years
after, he was reminded of his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
by a Pain he felt in the hurt
Place, about the same time of the
Year that the Mischief was first
done him. And, in some Hereditary
Diseases, as the Gout, Falling-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and some kinds of Madness, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
seems to act as if She did, with
Care as well as Skill, transmit to the
unhappy Child such Morbifick Seeds
or Impressions of the Parents Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
that, in spight of all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Alterations the younger Body
passes through, during the Course
of many Years, this constantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
Enemy is able to exert its
Power and Malice, after forty, or
perhaps fifty, Years concealment.
Such Reflections as these, to which
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48184:186"/>
may be added, that the <hi>Naturists</hi>
make no scruple to style That Death,
which Men are brought to by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
a <hi>Natural</hi> Death, make me
backward to admit the fam'd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

of Things Corporeal: Yet I
shall have this Advantage in this
Case, that a less degree of Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
may serve, in Arguments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
but to justifie a Doubt, than
is requir'd in Those that are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
an Assertion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the <hi>Naturists</hi> tell
us, that the <hi>Nature</hi> they assert is
the <hi>Principle</hi> of all Motions and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in Bodies; which infers, that
in explicating Them, we must have
recourse to Her. But before we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in, or confidently employ,
this Principle, it were very fit we
knew <hi>what</hi> it is. This Question I
have discours'd of in the Section:
But having there intimated a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to another Place, the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48184:188"/>
as well as Difficulty of the
Subject, invites me to resume in this
Place the Consideration of It; and
both vary and add to what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted, that I may as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
as clear my T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>oughts about
It. I demand then o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> Those, that
assert such a <hi>Nature</hi> as is vulgarly
describ'd, whether it be a Substance
or an Accident? If it be the later,
it should be declar'd, <hi>what</hi> kind of
<hi>Accident</hi> it is; <hi>how</hi> a Solitary <hi>Accident</hi>
can have Right to all those Attributes,
and can produce those numerous,
manifold, and wonderful Effects,
that they ascribe to <hi>Nature;</hi> and <hi>why</hi>
a complex of such <hi>Accidents,</hi> as are
the Mechanical affections of Matter,
(as Figure, Bulk, Motion, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> may
not altogether, as probably as that
<hi>Accident</hi> they call <hi>Nature,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to have been Instituted by
the perfectly Wise Author of the
Universe, to produce those Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
among Bodies, which are (at
least for the most part,) intelligibly
referable to Them? And if Things be
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48184:188"/>
not brought to pass by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
'twere very fit, as well as
desirable, that we should be Inform'd,
by what other Particular and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
Means <hi>Nature</hi> can effect them
better, than they may be by that
Complex.</p>
            <p>But if it be said, as by Most it
is, that the Principle, call'd <hi>Nature,</hi>
is a Substance, I shall next demand,
Whether it be a Corporeal, or an
Immaterial One? If it be said to be an
Immaterial Substance, I shall further
ask, Whether it be a Created One, or
not? If it be not, then we have God
under another Name, and our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is at an End, by the removal
of its Object or Subject, which is
said by the Schools to be God's
Vicegerent, not God Himself. But
if <hi>Nature</hi> be affirm'd (as She is, at
least by all Christian Philosophers,)
to be a Created Being, I then demand,
Whether or no She be endowed with
<hi>understanding,</hi> so as to know what she
does, and for what Ends, and by what
Laws She ought to Act? If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48184:189"/>
be <hi>Negative,</hi> the Supposition
of <hi>Nature</hi> will be of very little Use
to afford an intelligible Account of
Things; an unintelligent <hi>Nature</hi>
being liable to the Objections, that
will a little below be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the usefulness of <hi>Nature,</hi> in
case She be suppos'd a Corporeal
Being. And though it should be said,
that <hi>Nature</hi> is endowed with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and performs such Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as divers of the Antients ascribe
to the Soul of the World; besides,
that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is near of kin to
Heathenism, I do not think, that
they who shall with many <hi>Grecian,</hi>
and other Philosophers, who prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Christianism, suppose a kind of
Soul of the Universe, will find this
Principle sufficient to explicate the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of It. For if we may
compare the Macrocosm and Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm
in This, as well as many are
wont to do in other Things; we may
conceive, that, though <hi>Nature</hi> be
admitted to be indowed with Reason,
yet a multitude of <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48184:189"/>
be Mechanically produc'd, winhout
Her immediate Intervention; as
we see that in Man, though the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Soul has so narrow a Province
to take care of, as the Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and is suppos'd to be intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united to all the Parts of It; <hi>yet,</hi>
abundance of things are done in the
Body by the Mechanism of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being produc'd by that Soul.
Of this we may alledge, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that, in Sleep, the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood, the regular Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Heart, Digestion, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
Respiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
without the immediate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
or so much as the actual
Knowledge, of the Mind. And,
when a Man is <hi>awake,</hi> many things
are done in his Body, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Direction, but against the
Bent of his Mind; as often happens
in Cramps and other Convulsions,
Coughing, Yawnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay,
<hi>though</hi> some Brutes, as particularly
Apes, have the Structure of many
Parts of their Bodies very like that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48184:190"/>
of the Analogous Ones of Human
Bodies: <hi>Yet,</hi> that admirable Work
of the Formation and Organization
of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> or little Animal, in
the Womb, is granted by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
to be made by the Soul of the
Brute (that is therefore said to be
the Architect of his own Mansion,)
which yet is neither an Incorporeal,
nor a Rational Substance. And, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a Human <hi>Foetus,</hi> if we will
admit the general Opinion of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Physitians, Divines and
Lawyers, I may be allowed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that the Human Body, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
an Engine as 'tis justly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd,
is form'd without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of the rational Soul, which
is not infus'd into the Body, 'till This
hath obtain'd an Organization, that
fits it to receive such a Guest; which
is commonly reputed to happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of the Sixth Week, or
before that of the Seventh. And
this Consideration leads me a little
further, and prompts me to ask,
How much, by the Supposition or
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48184:190"/>
Knowledge of the Mind, (at the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention'd time,) we are enabled
to explicate the Manner, How the
foremention'd Functions of an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo</hi>
are perform'd, when at the end
of six or seven Week the Rational
Soul supervenes and comes to be
united to this living Engine?</p>
            <p>And, if it be urg'd, that <hi>Nature</hi>
being the Principle of Motion in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
their various <hi>Motions,</hi> at least,
which amount to a considerable
Part of their <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> must be
explainid by having recourse to Her:
I answer, that 'tis very difficult to
conceive, how a Created Substance,
that is Immaterial, can by a Physical
Power or Action move a Body: The
Agent having no impenetrable Part,
wherewith to impell the Corporeal
<hi>Mobile.</hi> I know, that God, who is
an mmaterial Spirit, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
the Primary Cause of
Motion in Matter, because (as we
may justly with <hi>Monsieur Des Cartes</hi>
infer,) Motion not belonging to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Substance, as such; This
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48184:191"/>
must owe That to an Incorporeal
One. But then, I consider, that
there is that infinite Distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Incomprehensible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and the least imperfect Order of
his Creatures, that we ought to be
very Cautious, how we make Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
between Him and Them, and
draw Inferences from His Power &amp;
manner of Acting to Theirs. Since
He, for Instance, can immediately
act upon Human Souls, as having
Created Them, but they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
so to act upon one another. And
I think it the more difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and admit, that, if <hi>Nature</hi> be
an Incorporeal Substance, She should
be the greater Mover of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
Matter, because we see, that,
in a Human Body, the Rational Soul,
(which the School-Philosophers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
to be an Immaterial Spirit,)
tho' vitally united to it, can only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
the Motion of <hi>some</hi> of the
Parts, but not give Motion to <hi>any,</hi>
or so much as Regulate it in <hi>most.</hi>
And, if <hi>Nature</hi> be said to move Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48184:191"/>
in another than a Physical Way,
I doubt, whether the Supposition of
such a Principle will be of much Use
to Physiologers in explicating <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena;</hi>
since I shall scarce think
him an Inquisitive or a Judicious
Doctor, who should imagine, that
he explains, that it gives an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and particular Account of the
astonishing Symptoms of those
strange Diseases, that divers very
Learned and Sober Physitians impute
to Witchcraft, when he says, that
those strange Distortions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive
Motions, for Instance, and
other Prodigious Effects, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a wicked immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
call'd a Devil. But having to
this purpose said more in another
Paper, which you may command
the Sight of, I shall not trouble you
with it here.</p>
            <p>The past Discourse opposes their
Opinion, who assert <hi>Nature</hi> to be
an Immaterial Creature. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis thought, that a greater
Number of Philosophers, at least
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48184:192"/>
among the Moderns, take Her to
be Corporeal, I shall now address
my Discourse to their <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
And <hi>though</hi> I might object, that, if
<hi>Nature</hi> be a Body, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
How She can produce, in
Men, Rational Souls, that are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Beings, and not capable to
be produc'd by any Subtiliation or
other Change of Matter whatsoever?
<hi>Yet,</hi> waving this Objection, I shall
<hi>first</hi> demand, Whether Those, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with, believe <hi>Nature,</hi> though
Corporeal, to act Knowingly, <hi>i. e.</hi>
with Consciousness of what She
does, and for pre-designed Ends;
or else to be blindly and necessarily
moved and directed by a Superior
Agent, indow'd with (what She
wants,) an excellent Understanding;
and <hi>then</hi> I shall represent a few
things, appliable some to <hi>one</hi> or
the <hi>other</hi> of the two Answers, that
may be made, and some to <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Cartesians</hi> would ask,
How, if <hi>Nature</hi> be a Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
we can conceive Her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48184:192"/>
of Thinking; and, which is more,
of being a most Wise and Provident
Director of all the Motions that are
made in the Corporeal World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Philosophizer may
justly ask, How a Corporeal Being
can so pervade, and, as it were,
com-penetrate the Universe, as to
be intimately present with all its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
Parts, whereof yet 'tis said to
be the Principle of Motion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He may also demand,
Whence <hi>Nature,</hi> being a Material
Substance, comes itself to have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereof 'tis said to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?
Since Motion does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Matter in itself, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is as truly a Body when it rests,
as when it moves. And, if it be
answer'd, that the First Cause, that
is, God, did at first put it into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I reply, that the same Cause
may, at least as probably, be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have put the <hi>unquestion'd
Mundane Matter</hi> into Motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Intervention of another Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Being, in whose Conception,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48184:193"/>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> as 'tis Matter,) Motion is not
involv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may likewise be ask'd,
How the Laws of Motion come to
be observ'd or maintain'd by a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Being? which, as merely
such, is <hi>either</hi> uncapable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
them, or of acting with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to them, <hi>or</hi> at least is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
endow'd with any knowledge
of them, or power to conform to
them, &amp; to make all the Parts of the
<hi>unquestion'd Mundane Matter</hi> do so too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And I do not see, how the
taking in such an unintelligent &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>designing
Principle will free our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
from great Difficulties,
when we come to explicate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of Bodies. For, as is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
noted, if <hi>Nature</hi> be a Bodily
Creature, and acts necessarily, and
(if I may so speak,) fatally, I see
no Cause to look upon It but as a
kind of Engine; and the Difficulty
may be as <hi>great,</hi> to conceive how
all the several Parts of this supposed
Engine, call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48184:193"/>
fram'd and mov'd by the
Great Author of Things, and how
they act upon one another, as well
as upon the <hi>undoubted</hi> Mundane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
as 'tis to conceive how, in the
<hi>World</hi> itself, which is manifestly an
admirably contriv'd <hi>Automaton,</hi> the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> may, by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
(who was able to endow Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
themselves with Active Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as well as he could, on other
scores, make them Causes,) be
produc'd by Vertue, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Primitive Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Motions that He gave it (and
still maintains in it,) without the
Intervention of such a thing, as they
call <hi>Nature.</hi> For This, as well
as the World, being a Corporeal
Creature, we cannot conceive, that
either of them act otherwise than
Mechanically. And it seems very
suitable to the Divine Wisdom, that
is so excellently display'd in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
and Conduct of the Universe,
to imploy in the World, already
fram'd and compleated, the fewest
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48184:194"/>
and most simple Means, by which
the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> design'd to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in the World, could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.
Nor need we be much
mov'd by hearing some <hi>Naturists</hi>
say, that <hi>Nature,</hi> though not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal
Being, is of an Order Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to mere Matter; as divers of
the School-men teach the Things,
they call Material Forms to be. For,
who can clearly conceive an Order
or Kind of Beings, that shall be Real
Substances, and yet neither Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
nor Immaterial? Nor do I see,
how the Supposition of this Unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
or at least Unintelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though we should grant it to
have a kind of Life or Soul, will
much assist us to explicate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena;</hi>
as if a Man be acquainted
with the Construction of Mills, he
he may as well conceive, how Corn
is ground by a Mill, driven by the
Wind or by a Stream of Water,
which are Brute and Senseless Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as he can by knowing, that
'tis kept at Work by a Horse, who,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48184:194"/>
though an Animated Being, acts in
our Case but as a Part of an Engine
that is determin'd to go round, and
who does neither intend to grind
the Corn, nor know that he grinds
It.</p>
            <p>And in this Place (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not the very fittest,) I may
Question, With what Congruity to
their Master's Doctrine, the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Philosophers
teach, that <hi>Nature</hi> is
the Principle of Motion in all the
Bodies, they call <hi>Natural.</hi> For, not
to urge, that those great Masses of
Sublunary Matter, to which they
give the Name of <hi>Elements,</hi> and the
Mixt Bodies, that consist of them,
are, by divers learned Men, said to
be mov'd to or from the Centre of
the Earth, by distinct Internal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which they call <hi>Gravity</hi> in
the Earth and Water, and <hi>Levity</hi> in
the Fire and Air; and that there is
ascrib'd also to every compounded
Body, that Quality of the Two,
which belongs to the Element that
predominates in It. Not to urge
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48184:195"/>
this, I say, consider, that the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Part of the World does so far
exceed the Sub-Coelestial in Vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that there is scarce any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
between them; and yet the
Generality of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> after
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> tell us, that the Coelestial
Globes of Light, and the vast Orbs
they suppose them to be fix'd in,
are mov'd from West to East by
<hi>Intelligences,</hi> that is, Rational and
Separate Beings, without whose
Conduct they presume, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Heavens could not be
so Regular and Durable, as we see
they are. So that, in that Part of
the Universe, which is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
vaster than the Sublunary is,
Intelligences being the Causes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is no Recourse to be had
to <hi>Nature,</hi> as the true and internal
Principle of It.</p>
            <p>And here it may not, perhaps,
be improper to declare somewhat
more fully a Point already touch'd
upon, namely, that, if to know
what is the general Efficient Cause
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48184:195"/>
of Motion, can much contribute to
the Explication of particular <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena;</hi>
the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of those <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists</hi>
I now reason with, will have
no considerable Advantage, if any
at all of Ours; which derives them
from the Primitive Impulse given by
God to Matter, and from the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Affections of the greater and
lesser Portions of It. For 'tis all
one to Him, that would <hi>declare by
what particular Motion,</hi> as Swift,
Slow, Uniform, Accelerated, Direct,
Circular, Parabolical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this or
that <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is produc'd; to
know, whether the Motions of the
Parts of Matter were Originally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
on them by <hi>Nature,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by God; unless it be, that
He, being of infinitely Perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
may be, more probably than
a Creature, suppos'd to have at
first produc'd in Matter Motions
best accommodated to the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
that were to be exhibited in
the World. Nor do I see sufficient
Cause to grant, that <hi>Nature</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48184:196"/>
(whatever She be,) produces
any Motion <hi>de Novo,</hi> but only, that
She transfers and regulates That,
which was communicated to Matter
at the beginning of Things: (As
we formerly noted, that in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, the Rational Soul or
Mind has no Power to make new
Motions, but only to direct those
of the Spirits and of the grosser Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Instruments of voluntary
Motion.) For, besides that many
of the Modern <hi>Naturalists</hi> approve
of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Opinion, That the
same Quantity of Motion is always
preserv'd in the whole Mass of
of the Mundane Matter, that was
communicated to it at first, though
it be perpetually transferring it from
one Part to another: Besides this, I
say, I consider, that, if <hi>Nature</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in these &amp; those Bodies Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that were never before in Beings;
(unless much Motion be annihilated,
which is a thing as yet unprov'd,)
the Quantity of Motion in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
must have for some Thousands
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48184:196"/>
of Years perpetually increas'd, and
must continue to do so; which is a
Concession, that would much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
the whole Theory of Local
Motion, and much perplex Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
instead of assisting Them,
in explicating the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>And as for the Effects of Local
Motion in the Parts of the Universal
Matter, which Effects make a great
Part of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World:
After what I have formerly declar'd,
you will not wonder to hear me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that, to me, the Supposition of
<hi>Nature,</hi> whether Men will have Her
an Immaterial or Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and either without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or else indowed with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
doth not seem absolutely
Necessary, nor perhaps very Useful,
to make us comprehend, <hi>how</hi> they
are produc'd. The Bodies of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
are divers of them little less
curiously fram'd than Mens, and
most of them more exquisitely, than,
for ought we know, the great Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48184:197"/>
Mass of the Corporeal World
is: And yet, in the Judgment of no
mean <hi>Naturalists,</hi> some of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Philosophers, that deny Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
and even Sense properly so
call'd, to Beasts, do, at least as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
and Plausibly, as those
that ascribe to them Souls indow'd
with such Faculties as make them
scarce more than gradually diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from Human Ones, explicate
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that are observ'd in
them. And I know not, whether I
may not on this Occasion add, that
the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> themselves, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Moderns, teach some
things, whence One may argue, that
the Necessity of recurring to <hi>Nature</hi>
does not reach to so many things by
far, as is by them suppos'd. For
the Efformation (or Framing) of the
Bodies of Plants and Animals, which
are by great odds the finest pieces of
Workmanship to be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Bodies, is ascrib'd not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to <hi>Nature,</hi> but to the Soul it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which they will have to be
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48184:197"/>
the Author of the Organization of
the Body, and therefore call it the
<hi>Architect of its own Mansion;</hi> which,
they say, that it frames by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Power and Skill, that <hi>some</hi>
call Plastick, and to which <hi>others</hi>
give other Names. And unto the
same Soul, operating by Her several
Functions, they attribute the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of Aliments, the Expulsion
of Excrements, the Production of
Milk, Semen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Appetitive,
Loco-motive, and I know not how
many other Faculties, ascrib'd to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Bodies. And, even in many Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
Ones, the noblest Properties
and Operations are, by the same
School-Philosophers, attributed to
what they call their Substantial
Forms; since from These they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the wonderful Properties of
the Load-stone, the attractive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Amber and other Electricks,
and the Medical Vertues of Gems
and other Mineral Bodies, whether
Consistent or Fluid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:48184:198"/>
But not to insist on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because 'tis but <hi>ad Hominem,</hi>
(as they speak,) if we consider the
Thing itself, by a free Examen of
the pretended Explanations, that
the Vulgar Philosophers are wont,
by recurring to <hi>Nature,</hi> to give of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Universe; we
shall not easily look on those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
as meriting the Name of
Explications. For to explicate a
<hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> 'tis not enough to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
it to one general Efficient, but
we must intelligibly shew the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>manner,</hi> how that general Cause
produces the propos'd Effect. He
must be a very dull Enquirer, who,
demanding an Account of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of a Watch, shall rest satisfied
with being told, that <hi>'tis an Engine
made by a Watch-Maker;</hi> though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be thereby declar'd of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and Co-aptation of the Spring,
Wheels, Ballance, and other Parts
of the Engine; and the <hi>manner,</hi> how
they act on one another, so as to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
to make the Needle point
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48184:198"/>
out the true Hour of the Day. And
(to improve to my present purpose
an Example formerly touch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
<hi>as</hi> he that knows the Structure
and other Mechanical Affections of
a Watch, will be able by Them to
explicate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of It, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
supposing, that it has a Soul or
Life to be the internal Principle of
its Motions or Operations; so he,
that does not understand the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
of a Watch, will never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to give a rational Account of
the Operations of It, by supposing,
as those of <hi>Chiness</hi> did, when the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
first brought Watches thither,
that a Watch is an <hi>European</hi> Animal,
or Living Body, and indow'd with a
Soul. This Comparison seems not
ill to befit the Occasion of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
It; but to second It by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is more purely Physical;
when a Person, unacquainted with
the Mathematicks, admires to see,
That the Sun rises and sets in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in some Parts of the Horizon, and
in Summer in Others, distant enough
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48184:199"/>
from them; <hi>that</hi> the Day, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Season, is by great odds shorter
than in the Later, and sometimes (as
some days before the Middle of <hi>March</hi>
and of <hi>Sept.)</hi> the Days are equal to
the Night; <hi>that</hi> the Moon is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
seen in Conjunction with the
Sun, and sometimes in Opposition
to Him; and, between those two
States, is every Day variously illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;
and, <hi>that</hi> sometimes one
of those Planets, and sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
suffers an Eclipse; this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I say, will be much assisted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how these things are
brought to pass, if he be taught the
clear Mathematical Elements of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy.
But, if he be of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to reject these Explications, as
too defective, 'tis not like, that it
will satisfie him, to tell him after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
and the School-Men, That
the Orbs of the Sun and Moon, and
other Coelestial Spheres, are mov'd
by Angels or Intelligences; since
to refer him to such general and
undetermin'd Causes, will little, or
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48184:199"/>
not at all, assist him to understand,
<hi>how</hi> the recited <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected, That these
Examples are drawn from Factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not from merely Physical, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
I shall return this brief An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and desire that it be apply'd
not only to the Two freshly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Examples, but to All of the
like Kind, that may be met with in
this whole Treatise, (near the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of which, had I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
it, something to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
should have had Place.) I say
then in short, that divers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
we are speaking of are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but for Illustrations; and
that others may be useful Instances,
if they should be no more than Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
Ones: Since Examples, drawn
from Artificial Bodies and Things,
may have both the Advantage of
being more clearly conceiv'd by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Understandings, and That
of being less obnoxious to be Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd
in that Particular, in which
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48184:200"/>
the Comparison or Correspondence
consists. And I the less scruple to
imploy such Examples, because <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
himself, and some of his more
learned Followers, make Use of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Comparisons, drawn from the
Figures and other Accidents of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Things, to give an Account of
Physical Subjects, and even of the
Generation, Corruption and Forms
of Natural Bodies.</p>
            <p>This Advertisement premis'd, I
persue the Discourse it interrupted,
by adding, That thus we see That
confirm'd, which was formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
namely, that though Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Principles could not be <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily</hi>
imploy'd for explaining the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our World; we must
not therefore necessarily recur to,
and acquiesce in, that Principle, that
Men call <hi>Nature,</hi> since neither will
That intelligibly explain Them: But
in that Case, we should ingeniously
confess, That we are yet at a loss,
<hi>how</hi> they are perform'd; and that
this Ignorance proceeds, rather
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48184:200"/>
from the Natural Imperfection of
our Understandings, than from our
not preferring <hi>Nature</hi> (in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Notion of It,) to the Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles, in the Explication of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Universe. For
whereas <hi>Monsieur Des Cartes,</hi> and
other acute Men, confidently teach,
that there are scarce any of these
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that have been truly
and intelligibly deduc'd from the
Principles peculiar to the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
and <hi>School-Philosophers;</hi> it will
scarce be deny'd by any that is
acquainted with Physico-Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Disciplines, such as Opticks,
Astronomy, Hydrostaticks, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
more strictly so call'd,
but that very many Effects (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Some have been handled in this
present Tract,) are clearly explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by Mechanical Principles; which,
for that Reason, <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
often imploys in his <hi>Quaestiones Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicae</hi>
and elswhere. So that, if
because the Corpuscularian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
cannot be <hi>satisfactorily</hi> made
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48184:201"/>
Use of to account for all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
among Things Corporeal, we
must refuse to acquiesce in them:
It is but just, that, since a Recourse
to what is call'd <hi>Nature</hi> is yet more
dark and insufficient, at least, we
must reject as well the Later as the
Former <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and endeavour to
find some Other preferrable to Both.</p>
            <p>And now, if it be demanded,
what Benefit may redound to a
Reader from the Explications gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the foregoing Seventh Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and in general, from the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
as well as Free, <hi>Enquiry,</hi>
whereof they make a considerable
Part? I shall Answer, That I am
not quite out of Hope, that the
Things hitherto discours'd may do
some Services both to <hi>Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophy</hi>
and to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>first</hi> of these; this
Tract may be of Use to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that Science, by dissuading
them from employing often, and
without great need, in their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Discourses and Writings, a
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48184:201"/>
Term, (I mean <hi>Nature,)</hi> which,
by reason of its great Ambiguity,
and the little or no Care, which
Those that use It are wont to take,
to distinguish its different Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
occasions <hi>both</hi> a great deal of
Darkness and Confusedness in what
Men say and write about Things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal;
<hi>and</hi> a multitude of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
wherein really Men do but
wrangle about <hi>Words,</hi> whilst they
think they dispute of <hi>Things;</hi> and
perhaps would not differ at all, if
they had the Skill or Luck to express
themselves clearly. Besides which
Service, the past Discourse may do
this Other, to wean Many from
the fond Conceit they cherish, that
they understand or explicate a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Subject or a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi>
when they ascribe it to <hi>Nature.</hi> For
to do That, One needs not be a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
since a Country Swain
may easily do the same Thing.</p>
            <p>On this Occasion, I must not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to take notice, that the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Use of Terms of far less Extent
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48184:202"/>
and Importance, and also less Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
than the word <hi>Nature</hi> is,
has been, and still is, no small Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to the Progress of Sound
Philosophy. For not only the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Part both of Physitians (though
otherwise learned Men,) and of
Chymists; but the Generality of
Physiologers too, have thought, that
they have done their Part, though
not on all Occasions yet on very
Many, when they have referr'd an
Effect or a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> to some such
Things as those, that are presum'd to
be <hi>Real Qualities;</hi> or are by <hi>some</hi>
styl'd <hi>Natural Powers;</hi> or are by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
by a more comprehensive and
more usual Name, (which therefore
here chiefly imploy,) call'd <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
for each of which they are
wont to form a Name, fit for Their
purpose: Though they do not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
declare, <hi>what this Faculty is,</hi>
and in what <hi>manner</hi> the Operations
they ascribe to It, are perform'd by
It. Thus the attractive Faculty as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
to a Man, that is enabled by
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48184:202"/>
               <hi>Nature</hi>'s (presum'd) abhorrence of
a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> to suck up Drink through
a Straw or Pipe, has been for many
Ages acquiesced in, as the true
Cause of the Ascension of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in Suction; of which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
the Modern Philosophers,
that have slighted Explications de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
merely from Faculties, have
assign'd (as has been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,)
Intelligible, and even Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Causes. The Power that
a Load-stone has with one Pole to
attract (as they speak,) the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Point of the Mariner's Needle,
and with the Other to drive it away,
is look'd upon as one of the Noblest
and most proper <hi>Faculties</hi> of that
admirable Stone. And yet I else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
shew, how in a very small,
indeed, but true and natural Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
I have, by a bare, and sometimes
invisible, Change of Texture, given
that Extream of the Magnet, that
before drew the Southern Point of
the Needle, the Power to draw the
Northern, and to the opposite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48184:203"/>
the Power to drive it away:
So much does even this wonderful
<hi>attractive Faculty,</hi> as 'tis call'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Mechanical Structure
of the Mineral, and its Relation to
other Bodies, among which 'tis
plac'd, especially the Globe of the
Earth, and its Magnetical <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because in another Paper, I
purposely discourse of what <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists</hi>
call <hi>Faculties,</hi> I shall here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self to note in general, that
the Term <hi>Faculty</hi> may, indeed, be
allowed of, if. It be applied as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Form of Speech, but not
as denoting a real and distinct A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
since in reality the Power or
Faculty of a Thing is (at least) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
but the Matter of It, made
Operative by <hi>some</hi> of its Mechanical
Modifications; [I say, <hi>some,</hi> because
the Complex of <hi>all</hi> makes up its <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Nature.]</hi> And with how
little Scruple soever, Men commonly
speak of Faculties, as supposing
Them to be distinct and active
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48184:203"/>
Principles; yet this Condition does
not necessarily belong to them. For
sometimes, if not frequently, the
Effect, of what is reputed a Natural
Power of Faculty, is produc'd by the
Texture, Figure, and, in a word,
Mechanical Disposition of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
whereby it determines the
Action of a remoter Agent to the
produc'd Effect. Thus in a Clock,
<hi>to</hi> make the Ballance vibrate, <hi>to</hi>
point at the Hour, to make, at set
times, the Hammer strike upon the
Bell, are but different Effects of the
Weight or Spring, that sets and
keeps the Engine in Motion. And
so a Key may either acquire or
lose its Power of opening a Door
(which, perhaps, some School-Men
would call its <hi>aperitive Faculty,)</hi> by
a Change, not made in itself, but
in the Locks it is apply'd to, or in
the Motion of the Hand that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
It. And least it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that these Instances are taken
wholly from Artificial Bodies, I shall
add, that, when a clear Piece of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48184:204"/>
Native Chrystal has obtain'd, as it
often does, a good Prismatical Shape,
and is, in a due Position, expos'd to
the Sun-beams; its Figuration, by
inabling it to refract and reflect those
Beams after a certain Manner, gives
it a Colorifick Faculty, whereby it
is inabled to exhibit that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pleasing variety of Colours,
that emulate, if not surpass, those
of the Rain-bow. And so in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
Metalline Looking-glass, though
there seem to be many distinct Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
such as that of Reflecting,
Inverting, Magnifying divers Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Melting, Burning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Bodies; yet all these Powers
are but the genuine Consequences
of the Figure, Capacity and Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which are Mechanical Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Matter of the <hi>Speculum.</hi>
And, indeed, if I judge aright,
(though what I am going to say will
seem a Paradox,) <hi>yet</hi> many <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of very many Bodies are but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Dispositions to be thus or thus
wrought upon by the Action of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48184:204"/>
Agents,</hi> and also (perchance) to
modifie that Action; as we see,
that the Power of making an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,
that is observ'd in divers hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Places, is nothing but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Disposition, their Figure
and Resistence gives them to reflect
a Sound. And, to resume the lately
mention'd Instance of a Key, we
may add, that, by bare Position,
either End of it, especially if the
Key be long, may be made to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
or lose a <hi>Transient</hi> Magnetick
Faculty from the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of that
great Magnet, the <hi>Earth;</hi> and that
also the same Key may, in a few
Moments, acquire a <hi>durable</hi> Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
by a Mechanical Change re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the Load-stone, as is
known to Those, that are any thing
vers'd in the Philosophy of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Mineral.</p>
            <p>And to me it seems likely, that
one main Reason, why learned Men
have ascrib'd such inherent and
active Powers, as they call <hi>Faculties,</hi>
to so many Bodies, is, because that,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48184:205"/>
not being conversant enough with
Natural and Artificial Things, they
did not duly perpend, how great a
Difference there may be between
a Body consider'd absolutely, or by
itself, and the same Body consider'd
in such Circumstances, as it may be
found in. For in some Cases a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Body many have strange Things
justly ascrib'd to It, though not as
'tis such a Body consider'd simply,
or unassociated with other Bodies;
but as 'tis plac'd among congruous
Ones, and makes the Principal or
most Operative Part of a compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Body, or of the Complex of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
it is joyn'd with, and which
are of such determinate Structures,
as are convenient for the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
to be exhibited. This may be Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically
seen in what happens to a
Spring. For if, being bent, 'tis
held in Ones Hand, or crouded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Box, 'tis but a Simple thing, that
does only, by its Expansive Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
strive to remove the Bodies
that keep it compress'd. But in a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48184:205"/>
curious Watch, it may, by virtue
of the Structure of that Engine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Principle of I know not
how many differing, and perhaps
contrary, Motions, among the Parts
of It; and of many notable <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
and Effects exhibited or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
thereby. This Reflection
may, perhaps, be improv'd, if I
here add, that, in many Bodies, a
Fluid Substance, determin'd to conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Motions, may be equivalent
to an Internal Spring; especially if
it be assisted by friendly External
Agents. This may be illustrated by
considering, that if One that plays
skilfully on a Flute, blow out of
his Mouth into the open Air, he
will but turn it into a vapid Aereal
Stream: But if this Wind duly
pass into the Instrument, and be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd
there by the Musician's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Skill, the simple Stream of
Air may be form'd into very various
and melodious Tunes. Thus Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
artificially temper'd, tho', if
it be fir'd in the open Air, it will give
only a rude and sudden Flash, that
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48184:206"/>
presently vanishes; yet, if it be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dispos'd of in Rockets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
well-contriv'd Instruments, and
then kindled, it will exhibit a great
and pleasing variety of Shining Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that are justly
admir'd in the best sort of Artificial
Fire-works. A Physical Instance
also, in favour of our Analogical or
Vicarious Springs (if I may so call
them,) is afforded me by the Bulbs of
Onions, and the Roots of Aloes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd <hi>Semper-vive,</hi> and some
other Vegetables, which in the
Spring being expos'd to the Air, the
Juices and Spirits, contain'd in them,
will be so agitated by the Warmth of
that Season, and so modify'd by the
particular Structure of the more firm
Parts, that, though neither Earth
nor Rain co-operate, they will shoot
forth green Stalks or Leaves for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Weeks together, as if they were
planted in a good Soil; (though the
Matter of these green Productions
be furnish'd by the radical Parts
themselves, as may be argued both
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48184:206"/>
from the manifest Diminution of the
Bulb in Bigness, and the great and
gradual Decrement in Weight, that
I observ'd in making Experiments of
this King. And so also the Air,
which is an External Fluid, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with the Juices and Spirits of
divers Insects and other cold Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
may both be put into Motion,
and have that Motion so determin'd
by their Organization, as to recover
in the Spring or Summer, as it
were, a new Life, after they have
lain moveless and like dead Things,
all the Winter; as we see in Flies,
that, in a hot Air, quickly recover
Motion and Sense, after having lost
Both, for perhaps many Months.
And the like Change may be far
more suddenly observ'd in Them, in
the warmer Seasons of the Year,
when the Air is drawn from Them
by the Pneumatick Pump, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
permitted to enliven Them
again. And to give another Instance,
that may possibly please better, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as 'tis purely Physical, so 'tis
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48184:207"/>
Simple and very Conspicuous,) tho'
that which the Sun-beams are wont
primarily to produce be but Light
and, perhaps, Heat; yet falling in
a due Manner upon a rorid Cloud,
they form there the Figure of a vast
Bow, and, being variously reflected
and, refracted, adorn it with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Colours, Men admire in the
<hi>Rain-Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must not farther prosecute
an Observation, that I mention'd
but occasionally, as an Instance
whereby to shew, that the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of solid Philosophy may be
much hinder'd by Mens Custom of
assigning, as true causes of Physical
Effects, Imaginary Things or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Arbitrary Names; among
which none seems to have had a
more malevolent Influence upon
Physiology than the Term <hi>Nature,</hi>
none having been so frequently and
confidently us'd, or imploy'd to so
many differing Purposes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>though</hi> I would not totally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the Use of the word <hi>Nature,</hi> nor
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48184:207"/>
of Expressions of Kin to It, in <hi>Popular</hi>
Discourses or <hi>even</hi> in some <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Ones, where Accurateness is not
requir'd or Ambiguity is prevented
by the Context; nor (to dispatch)
whereit may be imploy'd as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<hi>form</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to Truth, or Prejudice to Sound
Philosophy, (in which Cases I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
forbear not the Use of It;) <hi>yet,</hi>
I hope, our <hi>Free Enquiry</hi> may (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
at least,) conduce to the more
skilful Indagation, and happy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
of Physical Truths, if it can
perswade Men <hi>to</hi> make Use less fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and with more Circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of so ambiguous, and so often
abus'd, a Term as <hi>Nature;</hi> and cease
to presume, that a Man has well
perform'd the part of a true Physio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,
till he have circumstantially
or particularly deduc'd the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
he considers, by Intelligible
Ways, from Intelligible Principles.
Which he will be constantly put in
Mind of doing, or discover that he
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48184:208"/>
hath not done it; if, by forbearing
general and ambiguous Terms and
Words, he endeavours to explain
Things by Expressions, that are
clear to all attentive Readers, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with an ordinary measure of
Understanding and Reason. And
this perspicuous Way of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing
should be not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to ingenious Men, by the
valuable Discoveries, which Those
that have imploy'd it, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches
and Explications of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Things, have in this Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Age happily made, not only
about the various <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
referr'd to the <hi>Fuga Vacui;</hi> but
in the Hydrostaticks, Opticks, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
Botanicks, and divers other
Parts of real Learning, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now stay to enumerate. And
thus much it may possibly be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to have said, about the Service
our Doctrine may do Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</p>
            <p>As for Religion, if what I have
formerly said in favour of it be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48184:208"/>
duly consider'd and apply'd, the
past Discourse will not appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly,
nor perhaps useless, to It.
And therefore, if I do here abridge
what I have there said, and add to it
some Considerations, that were fit
to be reserv'd for this Place; I hope
the Doctrine, we have propos'd, may
appear fit to do it a threefold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>I. And in the First Place, Our
Doctrine may keep Many, that were
wont, or are inclin'd, to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Veneration for what they
call <hi>Nature,</hi> from running, or being
seduc'd, into those Extravagant and
Sacrilegious Errors, that have been
upon plausible Pretences imbrac'd
not only by many of the old Heathen
Philosophers but, by divers Modern
Professors of Christianity, who have
of late reviv'd, under new Names
and Dresses, the impious Errors of
the Gentiles. This I venture to say,
because many of the Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as hath been shewn in the
Fourth Section, ackonwledg'd indeed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48184:209"/>
a God (as these also own they do,)
but meant such a God, as they often
too little discriminated from Matter,
and even from the

as, besides what <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi>

Incorporeal Substances, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<hi>Nature</hi>'s, to have fram'd the
World, but only the Sun, that is
discoverable to our Eyes. And this
Corporiety of God seems manifestly
to be the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and
his genuine Disciples, to divers of
whose Principles and Dogmas it is
as congruous, as 'tis repugnant to
Religion. But <hi>secondly,</hi> There are <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
that allow'd a Soul of the <hi>world,</hi>
which was a Rational and Provident

            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine, by us propos'd,
may ('tis hop'd,) much conduce
to justifie some Remarkable Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Divine Providence, against
those Cavillers, that boldly censure
It, upon the account of some Things,
that they judge to be <hi>Physical</hi> Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
(for <hi>Moral</hi> Ones concern
not this Discourse,) such as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Earth-quakes, Floods, Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Volcanos, Famines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
For, according to our Doctrine,â</p>
            <p>1. God is a most Free Agent, and
Created the World, not out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
but voluntarily, having fram'd
It, as he pleas'd and thought fit, at
the beginning of Things, when
there was no Substance but Himself,
and consequently no Creature, to
which He could be oblig'd, or by
which he could be limited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48184:212"/>
2. God having an Understanding
infinitely Superior to that of Man, in
Extent, Clearness, and other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
He may rationally be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have fram'd so Great and
Admirable an <hi>Automaton</hi> as the
<hi>World,</hi> and the subordinate Engines
compriz'd in it for several Ends and
Purposes, some of them relating
chiefly to His Corporeal, and others
to His Rational Creatures; of which
Ends, he hath vouchsafed to make
Some discoverable by our dim Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but Others are probably not to
be penetrated by it, but lye conceal'd
in the deep Abyss of His Unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Wisdom.</p>
            <p>3. It seems not Incongruous to
conceive, that this most Excellent
and Glorious Being thought fit to
order Things so, that both His <hi>Works</hi>
and <hi>Actions</hi> might bear some Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and as it were Badges of His
Attributes, and especially to stamp
upon His Corporeal Works some
Tokens or Impresses, discernable by
Human Intellects, of His Divine
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48184:212"/>
               <hi>Wisdom;</hi> an Attribute that may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously
disclose Itself to us Men,
by producing a vast Multitude of
Things, from as <hi>few,</hi> and as <hi>simple,
Principles,</hi> and in as <hi>Vniform a Way,</hi>
as, with Congruity to His other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
is possible.</p>
            <p>4. According to this Supposition,
it seems, that it became the Divine
Author of the <hi>Vniverse</hi> to give It
such a Structure, and such Powers,
and to establish among its Parts such
general and constant Laws, as best
suited with His purposes in Creating
the World; and, to give these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Laws, and particular Parts
or Bodies, such Subordinations to one
another, and such References to the
Original Fabrick of the <hi>Grand System
of the World,</hi> that, on all particular
occasions, the Welfare of inferior or
private Portions of It, should be only
so far provided for, as their Welfare
is consistent with the general Laws
setled by God in the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> and
with Such of those Ends, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to himself in framing It, as are
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48184:213"/>
more Considerable, than the Welfare
of those particular Creatures.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds, if we set
aside the Consideration of Miracles,
as Things supernatural, and of those
Instances, wherein the Providence of
the great Rector of the Universe, and
Human Affairs, is pleas'd peculiarly
to interpose; it may be rationally
said, <hi>That</hi> God having an Infinite
Understanding, to which all Things
are at once in a manner Present, did,
by vertue of it, clearly discern, what
would happen, in consequence of the
Laws by Him establish'd, in all the
possible Combinations of Them, and
in all the Junctures of Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wherein the Creatures concern'd
in Them may be found. And, <hi>that</hi>
having, when all these things were
in His Prospect, setled among His
Corporeal Works, general and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Laws of Motion suited to His
most Wise Ends, it seems very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to His Wisdom, to prefer
(unless in the newly excepted Cases)
Catholick Laws, and higher Ends,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48184:213"/>
before subordinate Ones, and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in His Conduct before making
changes in It according to every sort
of particular Emergencies: And
consequently, not to recede from the
general Laws He at first most Wisely
establish'd, to comply with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
or the Needs of particular
Creatures, or to prevent some <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Irregularities</hi> (such as Earth-quakes,
Floods, Famins, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
to Them, which are no
other than such as He <hi>fore saw would
happen</hi> (as the Eclipses of the Sun
and Moon from time to time, the
falling of Showers upon the Sea and
Sandy Desarts, and the like must do,
by vertue of the Original Disposition
of Things,) and <hi>thought fit to ordain,
or to permit,</hi> as not unsuitable to
some or other of those Wise Ends,
which He may have in His All-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
View, who either as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and Upholder of the Universe, or
as the Sovereign Rector of His Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creatures, may have Ends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Physical, Moral, or Political;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48184:214"/>
(if I may be allowed so to distinguish
and name Them,) divers of which,
for ought we can tell, or should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
are known only to Himself,
whence we may argue, that several
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which seem to us Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous,
may be very Congruous or
Conducive to those secret Ends, and
therefore are unfit to be censur'd by
us, dim-sighted Mortals.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the admirable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Skill, that, in some conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Instances, the Divine Opificer
has display'd in the fitting of Things
for such Ends and Uses, for which
(among other purposes) He may
rationally be suppos'd to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
Them, may justly persuade us,
that His Skill would not appear Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
in reference to the rest also of
His Corporeal Works, if we could
as well in These, as in Those, discern
their particular final Causes. As if
we suppose an excellent Letter about
several Subjects, and to different Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
whereof some Parts were
written in plain Characters, others
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48184:214"/>
in Cyphers, besides a third sort of
Clauses, wherein both Kinds of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
were variously mix'd, to be
heedfully perus'd by a very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Person, if he finds that those
Passages, that he <hi>can understand,</hi> are
excellently suited to the scopes that
appear to be intended in them, it is
Rational as well as Equitable in Him
to conclude, <hi>that</hi> the Passages or
Clauses of the third sort, if any of
them seem to be insignificant, or
even to make an Incongruous Sense,
do it but because of the illegible
Words; and that both these Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and Those written altogether in
Cyphers, would be found no less
worthy of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<note n="â " place="margin">See the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Final Causes.</note> Writer, than
the plainest Parts of
the Epistle, if the
particular purposes, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for, were as clearly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Reader. And perhaps
you will allow me to add, that <hi>by this
way</hi> of ordering Things so, that, in
<hi>some of God's Works,</hi> the Ends or
Uses may be manifest, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48184:215"/>
fitness of the Means may be
conspicuous; [as the Eye is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
made for seeing, and the Parts
it consists of admirably fitted to
make it an excellent Organ of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]
and in <hi>others,</hi> the ends design'd
seem to be beyond our reach: <hi>By this
way,</hi> (I say) of managing Things,
the most Wise Author of them does
both gratifie our Understandings, and
make us sensible of the Imperfection
of Them.</p>
            <p>If the Representation now made
of Providence serve (as I hope it
may,) to resolve some scruples about
it; I know you will not think it use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to Religion. And though I
should miss of my aim in it, yet since
I do not dogmatize in what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
about it, but freely submit my
thoughts to better Judgments; I
hope my well meant Endeavours will
be, as well as the unsuccessful ones
of abler Pens have been, excus'd by
the scarce superable difficulty of the
Subject. However, what I have
propos'd about Providence, being
written, rather to do a service to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48184:215"/>
Theology, than as necessary to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a dissatisfaction with the Receiv'd
Notion of <hi>Nature,</hi> that was grounded
mainly upon Philosophical Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I hope our <hi>Free Enquiry</hi> may,
though this <hi>Second</hi> Use of it should
be quite laid aside, be thought not
unserviceable to Religion, since the
<hi>First</hi> Use of it, (above deliver'd)
does not depend on my Notions
about Providence, no more than the
<hi>Third,</hi> which my Prolixity about the
former makes it fit I should in few
words dispatch.</p>
            <p>III. The last then, but not the
least, service, I hope our Doctrine
may do Religion, is, that it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Men to pay their Admiration,
their Praises, and their Thanks, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to God Himself; who is the
<hi>True</hi> and <hi>Only Creator</hi> of the Sun,
Moon, Earth, and those other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that Men are wont to call the
<hi>Works of Nature.</hi> And in this way
of expressing their <hi>Veneration</hi> of the
True God, (who, in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
styles Himself a <hi>Iealous
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48184:216"/>
God,</hi> Exod. xx. 5.) and their <hi>gratitude</hi>
to Him, they are warranted by the
Examples of the ancient People of
God, the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and not only by
the Inspir'd Persons of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
but by the Promulgators of
the New Testament, and even by
the Coelestial Spirits; who, in the
last Book of It, are
introduc'd,<note place="margin">Rev. iv. 2.</note> Praising
and Thanking <hi>God
himself</hi> for His Mundane Works,
without taking any notice of His

            <p>AND now, dear <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> you

<hi>Nature:</hi> At the Close of which Essay,
I must crave leave to represent two
or three things about It.</p>
            <p>1. Since this Treatise pretends to
be but an <hi>Enquiry,</hi> I hope that any
Discourses or Expressions that you
may have found Dogmatically deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
<hi>about Questions of great moment
or difficulty,</hi> will be interpretated
with congruity to the Title and
avow'd Scope of this Treatise; and
that so favourable a Reader, as <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi>
will consider, that 'twas very
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48184:217"/>
difficult in the heat of Discourse, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to forget the Reserves, that the
Title might suggest, especially since,
on divers occasions, I could not have
spoken, with those Reserves, without
much enervating my Discourse, and
being, by Restrictions and other
cautious Expressions, tedious or
troublesome to you. But this, as I
lately intimated, is to be understood
of <hi>Things of great moment or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
For otherwise, there are divers
Notions, Suppositions, and Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
in the Vulgarly Receiv'd
Doctrine of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Her <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena;</hi>
which I take to be either
so precarious, or so unintelligible,
or so incongruous, or so insufficient,
that I scruple not to own, that I am
dissatisfied with them, and reject
them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Though,</hi> upon a transient view
of these Papers, I find that several
Parcels, that came first into my
hands, having been laid and fasten'd
together, (to keep them from being
lost, as others had already been) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48184:217"/>
the others were lighted on,
some of them will not be met with
in Places that are not the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for them; <hi>yet</hi> Haste and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
made me rather venture on
your good Nature, for the Pardon
of a venial Fault, than put myself
to the trouble of altering the Order
of these Papers, and substituting new
Transitions and Connections, in the
room of those, with which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made up the <hi>Chasms</hi> and Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of the Tract, you now receive.
And if the Notions and Reasonings
be themselves solid, they will not
need the Assistence of an exact Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to obtain the Assent of so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Reader, as they are presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to: Upon the score of whose Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,
'tis hop'd, that the former
Advertisement may likewise pass
for an Excuse, if the same things, for
substance, be found more than once
in a Tract written at very distant
Times, and in differing Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For, <hi>besides</hi> that such seeming
Repetitions will not (if I be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken)
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48184:218"/>
frequently occur, and will,
for the most part, be found, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
variously express'd, to elucidate
or strengthen the Thought or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they belong to: And <hi>besides,</hi>
that the Novelty and Difficulty of
some Points may have made it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
not only to display, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
them; <hi>besides</hi> these things,
(I say) <hi>'tis</hi> very possible that the
<hi>same Notion</hi> may serve to explicate
or prove <hi>several Truths;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may, without <hi>Impertinency,</hi> be
made use of in <hi>more than one Part</hi> of
our Treatise. And if our <hi>Enquiry</hi>
shall be thought worthy to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
and presented to you a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, after I shall have review'd
it, and heard Objections against it,
and consider'd the Things, that either
you, or I myself, may find fault with
in it; 'tis very possible, that (if
God grant me Life and Leisure,) this
Tract, which, in its present Dress,
I desire you would look on but as an
<hi>Apparatus</hi> (towards a more full and
orderly Treatise,) may appear before
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48184:218"/>
you in a less unaccurate Method:
And that my <hi>Second Thoughts</hi> may
prove more <hi>Correct,</hi> more <hi>Mature,</hi>
or <hi>better Back'd</hi> and <hi>fortifi'd,</hi> than my
<hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Subject of my Enquiry
being of great <hi>Extent,</hi> as well as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi>
it oblig'd me to consider,
and treat of many Things, (as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical,
Medical, Theological, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
and, among them, of divers that are
not at all of easie Speculation. And
I found it the more difficult to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
them well, because the Attempt
I have ventur'd upon being new, and
to be prosecuted by Discourse, many
of them opposite to the general Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Mankind, I was not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
much Assistence from any thing,
but Truth and Reason. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as I cannot presume not to need
your Indulgence, so I cannot despair
of obtaining it, if in this my first
Essay, upon a variety of difficult
Points, I have not always hit the
Mark, and as happily found the
Truth as sincerely sought it. But if
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48184:219"/>
you shall (which 'tis very probable
you will) find that I have fallen into
some Errors, 'twill be but one Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for you, to make me <hi>discern</hi>
them, and <hi>forsake</hi> them, (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any, wherein Religion may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd)
which I have, by way of
Praevision, made it the more easie for
myself to do; because (if my Style
have not wrong'd my Intentions,)
I have written this Discourse, rather
like a doubting Seeker of Truth,
than a Man confident that he has
found It.</p>

            <p>THE Reader is here to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
of a great Oversight that
happen'd to be made by several Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of the loose Sheets, wherein
(and not in a Book,) the Copy was sent
to the Press. For the Discourse begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the sole Break that is to be met
with in the Hundred and Fiftieth Page,
and ending with another Break at the
second Line of the Hundred Fifty and
Sixth Page, ought to have been plac'd
at the sole Break that is to be met
with in the Hundred Sixty and Second
Page. And the Discourse that reaches
from the beginning of the Hundred Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
and Eighth Page, to the Close of
the <hi>V.</hi> Section, which ends in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Eighty and Second Page, ought to
have been Printed among the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that may be alledg'd by the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,</hi>
among which it should, if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember
<pb facs="tcp:48184:221"/>
not, have been brought in at
the Close of the Two Hundred Forty
and Eighth Page, and thence have
reach'd to the end of the Sixth Section.
These Transpositions are thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to have notice given of Them, to
avoid Confusion, since the Printed
Sheets did not come to Hand, 'till too
much of the Book was wrought off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Transpositions could be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
which makes it fit to give No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what 'tis too late to remedy.
And though also some Connections and
Transitions, relating to the Transpos'd
Papers, be not such as they should be,
yet 'tis not judg'd fit, that the Reader
be troubled with long Advertisements
about them; because his Discretion
may easily correct them, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities
are not of Moment enough to
spoil the Discourses they relate to.</p>
