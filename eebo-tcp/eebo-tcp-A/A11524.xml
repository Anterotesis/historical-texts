            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FAMOVS GAME OF Cheſſe-play.</head>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> Of the Antiquity, Profit and Pleaſure of the Game, and what it representeth.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the Antiquitie of this game, I finde vpon Record that it was deuiſed 614. yeares before the Natiuity of Chriſt, ſo that it is now 2227. yeeres ſince it hath beene firſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; and it is thought that <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who was a King, deuiſed this game. Secondly, there be ſome of opinion that it vvas made by learned and wiſe men, as may appeere by the wonderfull inuention of of the game, for it requireth the whole minde of man, during the time he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame, otherwiſe hee ſhall not diſcerne the purpoſe of his aduerſary, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb facs="tcp:17314:9"/>
it be too late. Thirdly, whoſoeuer he be that is deſirous to learne this game of Cheſſe-play, he ought to be of good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehention, and a great memory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which hee ſhall neuer play well. Fourthly, if thoſe which play be of equall iudgement, the ſtanders by ſhall take great delight and pleaſure in behoulding them, if they haue knowledge in the game, when they ſhal ſee one Kings forces incounter with the other, ſometime the blacke King aſſaulting the white King, who valiantly defendeth the aſſault, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture putteth him to the worſt vpon the leaſt neglect that may be. O that this game were rightly eſteemed of, according to his worth: It is many yeeres ſince I could play this game, and as yet I neuer knew any fall out at the ſame: for a man cannot be offended with him who he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth withall, but rather blame himſelfe for not gouerning his owne men better.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is apparant what quarrels and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtabbings happen at other games, with cheating and coſening one another, from all which enormities this is free, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:17314:9"/>
the glory aboue all other games, for a peaceable and a Princely exerciſe. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is to be vnderſtood that this game repreſenteth two Armies encountring each other: ſo that when the blacke King ſhall aſſault the white, the white King may preſently draw forth many of his men to make good the place aſſaulted. And for as much as the number of cheſſe-men are but few, you will ſay when an aſſault is made at any time there cannot many men be drawne forth to make good the place aſſaulted: for by bringing too much ayde to one place, you ſhall weaken another, ſo that thereby you may hazard all: to which I anſwere, that albeit the number of the men is ſmall, yet by the playing forth of one man you ſhall hinder the aſſault of two or three; as for example.</p>
               <p>Imagine that the blacke King for his firſt draught playeth his owne Pawne into the third houſe in his owne file, and that the white King entertaineth another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not comming into the field in ſuch manner as the blacke King doth, but play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Queenes Dukes pawne into the
<pb facs="tcp:17314:10"/>
third houſe in his owne file, then the black King for his ſecond draught brings forth his Queene, and placeth her in the third houſe, in the front of his Biſhops pawne, entending at his fourth draught to giue mate to the white King, al which the white King ſeeth, &amp; yet for his ſecond draught playeth careleſly ſomewhere els, and doth not ſeeme to take knowledge what the blacke King intendeth to doe: the blacke King for more aſſurance of preuayling bringeth forth his owne Biſhop into the fourth houſe, before his Queenes biſhop; all which is as much as nothing: for that the white King by playing his own pawne into the third houſe in his owne file, the blacke King by ſuch play ſhall fayle of his purpoſe: but if the white King ſhall forget to hinder the blacke Kings aſſault at his third draught, then the blacke King ſhall giue mate at his fourth draught to the white King by taking the white Kings bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops pawne with his Queene, who ſhal be guarded with his owne Biſhop, ſo that it is a ſchollers mate, but there is no man of iudgement in Cheſſe-play will take ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:17314:10"/>
mate; it may be called alſo a treacherous mate; for otherwiſe it were vnpoſſible a King ſhould be deliuered into the hands of his enemyes, without the loſſe of ſome men, vnleſſe the white Kings power would make ſleepe a defence for treaſon, and ſo ſuffer their King to be taken before they would take any knowledge thereof.</p>

               <p>THe boord ſtanding here as thou ſeeſt thou ſhalt place the blacke King in the fourth houſe being white, and the white King you ſhall place in a blacke houſe being the fourth houſe on the other ſide, iuſt oppoſite againſt the blacke King; then

place the white Queene next her King in a white houſe, which is the fourth houſe on that ſide of the field; Likewiſe you ſhall place the black Queene in a blacke houſe next to her king, which ſhall alſo be the fourth houſe on the blacke Kings ſide.</p>
               <p>Thus when you haue placed the Queenes next to their Kings, then ſhal you place on the other ſide of the Kings, firſt a Biſhop, then a Knight, and next to the Knight you ſhall place a Duke, whoſe place is in the firſt houſe of the field: the Queenes haue either of them likewiſe one Biſhop, one Knight, and one Duke; the Kings haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them foure Pawnes, and three No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men, and the Queenes haue the like, the Kings Pawnes are theſe: firſt, their owne Pawnes, next their Biſhops Pawnes, then their Knights Pawnes, and laſt of all their Dukes Pawnes: the Queenes they haue alſo three Noble-men and foure Pawnes, which are theſe: firſt, their owne Pawnes, then their Biſhops Pawnes, next their Knights Pawnes, and laſt of all their Dukes Pawnes. The Pawnes ſtand before the Noble-men from one corner of the

               <p>THe Kings haue either of them ſeauen men a piece, and the Queenes as many to attend them: The King, whether hee be blacke or white, giueth guard to fiue perſons before hee goeth forth, and being once aduanced forward into the
<pb facs="tcp:17314:14"/>
field, although it be but into the ſecond houſe, hee then, and ſtill after, in all his march giueth guard to eight houſes, till he come to one ſide or other of the field againe. Now thoſe fiue whom hee guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth before hee goeth forth are theſe: firſt of all hee guardeth his Queene, on whom his greateſt care dependeth: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly his owne Biſhop: thirdly his owne Pawne: fourthly his Queenes Pawne; and laſtly his Biſhops Pawne. The Queene protecteth her King, her Biſhop, her owne Pawne, her Kings Pawne, and her Biſhops Pawne: by this you ſee the Queene guardeth as many as the King, before ſhe goeth forth, and after till the field be wonne or loſt: the Kings Duke giueth guard to his owne Pawne, and the Kings Knight, and to no more, till hee be from the ſide of the field, and then hee giueth guard to foure houſes, and in like ſort is the power of the Queenes Duke: the Kings Biſhop giueth guard to the Kings Pawne, and the Kings Knights Pawne: the Queenes Biſhop giueth guard to the Queenes Pawne, and the Queenes knights
<pb facs="tcp:17314:15"/>
Pawne, the Knights giueth guard but to three houſes before they goe forth, and after they are from the ſide of the field, they giue guard to as many houſes as the King or the Queene doth. Now thoſe houſes whom the Knights guard ere they goe forth, are theſe, the Kings Knight giueth guard to the Kings Pawne, and to the third houſe in the front of the Kings Biſhops Pawne, and to the third houſe in the front of the Kings Dukes Pawne: the Queenes Knight giueth guard to her owne Pawne, and to the third houſe in the front of her Biſhops Pawne, as alſo to the third houſe in the front of her owne Duke: The Biſhops of either ſide are tyed to one onely colour, out of the vvhich they may not goe, the vvhite Biſhops haue the command of the white field, and the blacke Biſhops the command of the blacke field, and they martch ſloping forward or backward if way be made for them, and can indanger or giue checke from one corner of the field to the other: The Pawnes who ſtand in rancke before the King and the Nobility, I ſhal ſhew you
<pb facs="tcp:17314:15"/>
their manner of guard which they giue before they be aduanced or moued off their places: The Kings Pawne giueth guard to the third houſe before the Queene, and the third houſe before the Kings Biſhop: the Queenes Pawne giueth guard to the thrid houſe before the King, &amp; the third houſe before her owne Biſhop, the Kings Biſhops Pawne giueth guard to the third houſe before the King, and the third houſe before the Kings Knight: the Queenes Biſhops Pawne giueth guard to the third houſe before the Queene, and the third houſe before the Queenes Knight, the Kings Knights Pawne giueth guard to the third houſe before the Kings Biſhop, and to the third houſe before the Kings Duke: the Queenes Knights Pawne giueth guard to the third houſe before the Queenes Biſhop, and to the third houſe before the Queenes Duke: the Kings Dukes Pawnes, and the Queenes Dukes Pawnes giueth but one guard a peice, and that is to the third houſes before the Knights, by reaſon they ſtand on the ſide of the

               <p>FOr as much as many times there is queſtion made, whether a Pawne of the white Kings, may paſſe the guard of the blacke Kings, at his firſt going forth, if the blacke King haue aduanced a Pawne into the fift houſe, without leaue of the blacke King: whereunto I anſwere no, for this is a rule ſtrictly obſerued in martiall diſſipline, from whence this game had his firſt beginning, that no man ſhall be permitted to paſſe by any guard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue firſt obtained, yet at this game the Pawnes may paſſe the guard one of another, this houſe, or houſes, onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: for if a Pawne be aduanced into the fift houſe by the blacke King, and
<pb facs="tcp:17314:16"/>
that the white Kings Pawne might paſſe without leaue, it would many times be the ouer-throwing of the blacke Kings game: and further it is held fowle play, to play forth your Pawne by the guard of another Pawne ſo aduanced, vvithout crauing leaue: ſo then if the King, who hath aduanced a Pawne into the fift houſe, will ſuffer you to paſſe you may, becauſe there is power in him to deny you ſuch a fauour, as well as to grant you the priuiledge of ſuch a liberty: and thus much for the readers ſatisfaction, that you may not paſſe the guard of a Pawne that is aduanced into the fift houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue. Some therebe alſo that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded if the King be once checked, hee ſhall looſe the benefit of releeuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any of the Dukes quarters, what extremity ſoeuer he be driuen vnto, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the King checked doth couer the checke giuen him: ſuch as are of this opinion are in the wrong, for ſo long as the checked King can couer the checke giuen him, and not remoue to auoyd the checke, nor hath not moued before vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:17314:17"/>
no occaſion he hath ſtill the benefit of exchanging vvith any of his Dukes, but if hee be once remoued from his place, whither it be for the releeuing of one of his men, or vpon compulſion for the auoyding of a checke, he ſhall then after ſuch time looſe the benefit of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing with the Duke.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17314:18"/>
haue the command of the army, which generall ſhall haue vnder him Coronels, Captaines, and other inferiour officers for his aſſiſtance, for the better gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the army: Euen ſo at this game there is a generall, which is the Queene, for ſhee doth more ſeruice then any too Dukes can, and if it happen at any time that ſhee ſhould be loſt, the King, whoſe Queene is taken, muſt forſake the field of force, vnleſſe the aduerſe King, be a very ſilly King, and cannot make vſe of ſuch aduantage. And yet to make the Reader to vnderſtand this better, know this, if the white King ſhould in the taking the blacke Kings Queene loſe two of his Noble-men, as his two Dukes, or his two Biſhops, or his two Knights, yet the white King ſhall haue the better, for his loſſe is not ſo great as the blacke Kings, vvho hath loſt his Queene. Some that write of Cheſſe-play calleth the Queene the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazon,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Amazonites</hi> goe to warre as familiarly as the men. Next to the Queene for valew is a Duke, for by how much a Queene is more in worth
<pb facs="tcp:17314:18"/>
then a Duke, by ſo much a Duke is more in valew then a Biſhop or a Knight, for a Duke is vvorth two Biſhops or two Knights, by reaſon hee can giue a Mate himſelfe with the help of the King, which a Biſhop or a Knight cannot doe. Now you ſay two Biſhops can giue a Mate with the help of the King, it is true, but the Duke will doe it ſooner: alſo a Mate is to be giuen vvith a Biſhop and a Knight, and this is alſo true, but hee muſt play well that can giue a Mate with them, yet you ſee euery Scoller at Cheſſe-play can giue a Mate with a King and a Duke Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Dukes checke goeth from one ſide of the field to the other throughout all the colours, and a Biſhops checke ſerueth but for one colour in the field, therefore you muſt haue both the Biſhops to doe the ſeruice vvhich one Duke can diſcharge: and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a Duke is better then two Biſhops, and for the Biſhops they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Knights, by reaſon they can giue a Mate vvith the King, vvhen no other men are left to help them, which
<pb facs="tcp:17314:19"/>
the Knights cannot doe, and therefore they are counted better then the Knights; but I had rather looſe a Biſhop at any time then a Knight, for his checke is more dangerous then a Biſhops: the Biſhop is tyed to one colour in the field, out of the which hee may not paſſe, the Knight paſſeth into all the houſes in the field: the Biſhops checke may be couered, the Knights checke cannot: there is couer for all the checkes in the field that may be giuen, from the Queene to the Pawne, the Knights onely excepted, for whoſe checke there is no couer: and if it fall out at any time that a Knight giueth checke, and the King that is checked cannot take the Knight without great loſſe, he muſt needes flye of force, there is no couering for his checke, as I haue ſayd before. I could ſay more in the behalfe of the Knights; as thus, when the one King hath no other men left but his Biſhops, and the other King no help but his Knights, the King that hath the Knights, may happely in checking the King that hath the Biſhops, take one of the Biſhops,
<pb facs="tcp:17314:19"/>
and ſo after by another checke take the other, by reaſon the Biſhops cannot guard one another, which the Knights can doe, and at the beginning of the game, I had rather looſe my Biſhops for my aduerſaries Knights, then that I ſhould exchange my Knights for the gayning my aduerſaries Biſhops: and thus much ſhall ſerue for the explaining of the difference of the great men.</p>

               <p>ANd for the Pawnes, there is not ſo much to be ſaid of them, as there hath beene of the Noble-men, by reaſon there is not ſo much variety in their draughts, as there is in the great men: The Kings Biſhops Pawne is the beſt Pawne in the field, and therefore there ought more care to bee had ouer him, then any other Pawne in the field; for if it ſhould happen that the blacke King
<pb facs="tcp:17314:20"/>
ſhould looſe his Biſhops Pawne, for the gaining of the white Kings Pawne: yet the blacke Kings loſſe were the greater, for that hee after ſuch loſſe can neuer be able to make a rancke of Pawnes, with three in a rancke, no more on that ſide of the field, for his owne ſafty which is a great diſaduantage, vvherefore it vvere better for any of the Kings to looſe his owne Pawne, then to looſe his Biſhops Pawne. But you will ſay, if any of the Kings ſhould looſe his Biſhops Pawne, can he not releeue himſelfe on the other ſide of the field, by turning ouer into his Queenes Dukes quarter, where he ſhall haue Pawnes enough to ſuccor him: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he may doe ſo, but he will be longer ere he bring his purpoſe to effect, becauſe he hath more men betweene his Queenes Duke and him, then there is betweene him and his owne Duke by one draught, in the playing of which draught, ere hee can bring his King into ſafty, he ſhall be ſure to looſe the game, if hee play with one that can make vſe of any idle draught: thus much ſhall ſuffice for the
<pb facs="tcp:17314:20"/>
worth of the Kings Biſhops Pawne, the Kings Pawne is next vnto him in worth, then the Queenes Pawne after the Knights Pawne, and laſt of all the Dukes Pawnes, for they giue guard but to one houſe in the field: and thus I end with the Pawnes for their valew and worth.</p>

               <p>FOR as much as ſome are perſwaded there is a Rule for this game, I thought good to giue the Reader, as I may, ſome ſatisfaction to the contrary. If there were a Rule for this game euery Woodcocke would bee a Cheſſe-player; but indeede there is none: if there were a Rule for it, then there ſhould be but one manner of beginning, and one manner of ending, which cannot be; for hee that can play knoweth, ſometime the game is begunne with ſome of the Pawnes, another time with any of the Knights: againe, one while marching forth with ſome of the Pawnes, and ſome of the Noble-men; at
<pb facs="tcp:17314:21"/>
another time giuing an aſſault onely with Noble-men. Alſo if there were a Rule for the game how commeth it to paſſe that a Mate is to be giuen with any of the men in the field vpon guard, and ſome of the men will giue a Mate without a guard? and that is when the diſtreſſed King is driuen to the ſide of the field, or a corner of the field, the purſuing King lodging in the third houſe oppoſite againſt him: then the Queene aſſaylant, or one of the Dukes aſſailant, giueth the Mate to the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King, by falling into any of the houſes, in the ſame rancke where the diſtreſſed King ſtandeth; but vpon guard any of the Pawnes, or of the Biſhops, or any of the Knights can alſo giue a Mate: further, it is certaine, that a Mate may be giuen in any houſe in the field: now there are 64. houſes, then you will ſay there muſt be as many rules, to bring to paſſe that the King may be Mated in any of theſe houſes, and when you haue proued that, then you muſt bring forth ſo many ſeuerall rules as there are men in the field: for that they all can vpon guard
<pb facs="tcp:17314:22"/>
giue a Mate, after all this I will demand for rules how to giue a Mate vpon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and then you muſt finde as many more rules for that, by reaſon euery man can diſcouer whereby a Mate may bee giuen. Thus mayeſt thou ſee courteous reader that I haue ſhewed thee, if there be a rule, there muſt be more then one, or a hundreth: and from the firſt time I knew this game to this preſent day, I neuer could meete with any man, that could ſhew me one rule for this game, for indeed it is according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of them that play, and not by any rule: alſo I doe perſwade my ſelfe, if any man would play with me, and obſerue a rule in his play, and not regard my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth againſt him, I ſhall aſſuredly giue him a Mate, doe what he can.</p>

               <p>NOw for the Reader that is deſirous to practiſe this game, hee muſt obſerue one thing diligently, which is, if hee chance to haue the firſt draught, and find himſelfe able to aſſault, let him follow it well; if better able to defend, then giue the other leaue to aſſault; in both there is great pollicie to bee vſed: and firſt for him that aſſaulteth. Hee that aſſaulteth ought to hold his paſſages free, for him to retreat as occaſion ſhall ſerue; leaſt his negligence herein procure his ouerthrow when hee ſhall be conſtrayned to retreat. The defendant, if hee be excellent in the game, will not onely anſwere the aſſault ſufficiently, but hee will alſo deuiſe plots to grieue the aſſailant when he ſhall take occaſion to retreat. A pawne is ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped, becauſe hee cannot goe backe to relieue himſelfe: the Biſhops and the Dukes are more harder to be intrapped,
<pb facs="tcp:17314:23"/>
becauſe they can flye from one ſide of the field to the other, if they feare any euill; but the Knights, and the Queene is the hardeſt of all to be betrayed, by reaſon they haue ſo many places for to relieue themſelues in, and ſpecially the Queene.</p>

When two playeth earneſtly, and that one of them followeth the checke vpon the other, and if it fall out that one of the checkes be alſo a Mate, and hee that giueth it ſeeth it not, as I haue ſayd before, then is ſuch a Mate called a blind-Mate: and for as much as there are ſome vvhich ſtand vpon this, that a blind-Mate ſhould be a loſt game, know this, it may not be ſo; for if a man hath a horſe that falleth blind, the owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall haue his former right in him, which hee had before hee was blind, and ſhall be eſteemed for a horſe for all his blindneſſe, ſo hee which giueth a blind-Mate

               <p>SEcondly, imagine the white King for his firſt draught, playeth forth his owne Pawne into the fourth houſe before himſelfe, and that the blacke King doth the like for his firſt draught, then the white King commands his owne Knight into the third houſe before his owne Biſhop, then you ſhall play the blacke Kings Knight in the ſame order, then the white King with his Knight taketh away the blacke Kings Pawne, and the blacke King with his Knight at his third draught taketh away the white Kings Pawne, then the white King at his fourth draught aduanceth his Queenes Pawne into the third houſe before his Queene, whereby the blacke Kings Knight ſhall be forced to flye: after this the white King for his fift draught may couer his King,
<pb facs="tcp:17314:30"/>
as he will, for the game is equall, and this is alſo the ſecond defence for the play ſpoken of before.</p>

               <p>IMagine the blacke King for his firſt draught aduanceth his Pawne into the fourth houſe before himſelfe, then ſhall you play the white Kings Pawne for his firſt draught in the ſame order, then the blacke King for his ſecond draught playeth his owne Knight into the third houſe before his owne Biſhop, after this the white King ſhall place his Queene in the ſecond houſe before himſelfe, for his ſecond draught: So then the blacke King dares not medle vvith the vvhite Kings Pawne, for feare of looſing his Knight, by reaſon the white Queene
<pb facs="tcp:17314:30"/>
guardeth the Pawne, and this is done at two draughts: I could ſhew you alſo other playes for the ſame; but this ſhall ſuffice.</p>

               <p>IF a Pawne, or any other man in the field be ſo hardy, as to giue checke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of the Kings without a guard, and that his checke bee giuen the King in ſuch a houſe where the King may indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thoſe men may the King deſtroy himſelfe, but if they haue guard he may not medell vvith them for going into checke: yet the King that is ſo braued by his enemie, may cauſe any of his vnder-officers, that hath guard vpon that houſe wherein the King is checked, to kill any ſuch one which ſhall preſume to checke the King without guard.</p>

                  <p>The Kings, what danger ſoeuer they are in, may not preſſe one vpon another, for there muſt be alwayes one houſe free betweene them, neither can they checke one another: and when it ſhall happen that there is no place for the diſtreſſed King to flye vnto, but that hee muſt ſeeke for reliefe in his aduerſe Kings boſome, then is it Mate.</p>
