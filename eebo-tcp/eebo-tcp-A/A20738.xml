            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I called hym by the name of a kylled God. Theſe were my wordes and workes, whereby the people was ſo prouoked, as in ſtead of Obliuion, they tooke fire, and wente to the quellers houſes, and in the ende drone them out of the Citie. Howe thys was contrarye to the Senate, they béeyng gréeued wyth it, it was euidently ſéene. For they accuſed me firſt of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and appoynted prouinces to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whyche were full of greate armyes. And leaſt they ſhoulde ſéeme to make haſt before theyr tyme, they gaue them pretence to prouide grayne for the Citie. Wherefore a greater feare dyd yet trouble me, for lacke of an appoynted armye, as menne naked to ſyghte wyth ſo manye well armed, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe béeyng a man ſuſpected, and diſagréeyng from me, and one of the conſpirators agaynſte <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and appoynted to bée héere at the daye of hys deathe.

If he condemneth hym, hee condemneth them that made the lawe, whome hee ought by perſuaſion to pacific, and not to prouoke by contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie.

It is no good counſel to make diuiſion with the people, eſpecially in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous times, nor to forget, that this belongeth chiefly to the people, to iudge of friendes and foes: for by the auntient lawes, the people only is Lord of war and peace, in the whiche at this time notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they haue not appointed, nor commaunded, nor vſed their priuiledge ouer vs. But (he ſaith) <hi>Antony</hi> killed certain Souldiours, being general and appointed therevnto by you.

Whereof the twoo men our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do calumniate vs, you know throughly, and for that do you ſerue with vs willyngly. Therefore nowe it is fitte to declare the cauſe, whiche ſhall chiefly ſhew, that wée haue the beſte, and moſte iuſte pretence of this warre. We, that haue made <hi>Caeſar</hi> great, by folowyng hym and leading you in the warres, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue hys friendes to the ende, ſo as it ſhall not appeare, that he was entrapte of vs for any enimity. In maters of peace, he is to be blamed, not of vs his friendes, in the which we haue bene ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, but by lawes, and order of the common wealth, whereof now no law, no rule of the beſt, nor peoples power remayneth: all the which our fathers framed, when they expelled the kings, and by othe confirmed, neuer after to receyue other: to the which othe, their poſteritie, of the ſame minde, conſenting, and puttyng from them the execrations thereof, they could not longer endure to ſée one man, though he were a friende and beneficiall, that did conuert to himſelſe the publique treaſure, the armies, the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of officers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people, the gouernments of nations from the Senate.

The whiche peraduenture you doe not perfitely know, but only conſider his valiantneſſe in the warre. But now you may eaſily learne it, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things only that touched your ſelues.

And to ſpeake of the chief, no man gaue you thankes for any office, for authoritie, for iuſtice or correction. And that that was moſte to be lamented of all other, you could not helpe your Tribunes, when villanie was done them, that you ſhoulde not retayne your power continual, and make it ſure and inuiolable: but your ſelfe ſee them, that ought to haue bene vntouched, and their authoritie inuiolate, and their ornaments ſacred, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yet yée could not plainly accuſe that man, or bring him to iudgement, bycauſe of hys mightie armies, whiche belonging to the publique ſtate, he chalenged for hys priuate pleaſure: the whiche entendyng to be reuenged of the reſte of his Tyrannie, coniured agaynſt his body. The ſentence did neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede from the beſte, the ſeate was done of a fewe.

rather than by it, to helpe our countrey, this was ſtayed, bycauſe they would not any contumely ſhould be ſhewed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a releaſement of his Tyrannie, euery man decreeyng a for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, as a thing of moſte ſuretie, that no matter ſhoulde bee made of the murder. <hi>Antony</hi> by litle and litle withdrawing the people from vs, the Senate gaue vs great offices of prouinces and armies, commaunding all the lande betwéene <hi>Ionia &amp; Syria</hi> to obey vs: whether puniſhing as offendours, or honoring ve, with ſolemne purple, with maſes and Sergeants? by the whiche rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they called <hi>Pompey</hi> from baniſhment, beyng a yong man, and not acquaynted with the thing, but onely bicauſe he was Sonne to <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, who trauayled for the peoples rule: and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſecretely in <hi>Spaine</hi> to auoyde tyrannie, they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to the value of his fathers goodes, by the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and made him ruler of the ſea, that he mighte haue ſome authoritie, beyng of the peoples faction. What other acte or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Senate do yée require, than that all this was done by their ſentence? onleſſe it be not inough to confeſſe it by worde, but to do it &amp; ſay it, and togither with their ſayings to rewarde you with great gifts, bicauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay it, they can performe it.
