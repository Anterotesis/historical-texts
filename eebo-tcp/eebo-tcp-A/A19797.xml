            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which you

Banks &amp; his bay horse from Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauage
without Ludgate, which in our
conscience we must confesse is a kinde of
coosning, &amp; in a maner such a matter as
if we should haue gone into a Cooks shop
in Fleet lane, and with the smell of roast
meat filled our bellies, not emptying our
purses, a flat robberie, and by a figure
such a peece of filching as is punishable

corner, where a man of an ill minde may
breake his fast with the sent of a peece of
beefe puld piping hot out of the furnace.
Yet considering the case as it concernes
the commonwealth, and the nature of the

serue to driue away pastime &amp; good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,

bee couetous, and some bee lecherous, and hee

            <sp>
               <speaker>Banckes.</speaker>
               <p>Sayest mee so. Well then Marocco,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Horse.</speaker>
               <p>Tush master, that question is no question.
For though it bee a question betweene the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and the prodigall, yet is it no question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the couetous and the lecherous. The leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Landlord hath his wench at his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is content to take ware for his money,
his priuate scutcherie wounds not the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
farther than that his whoore shall haue a
house rent free, when his honest neighbours wife
and children shall neither haue a peece of a house
or householde loafe for him. Let him passe for a
farting churle, and weare his mistres fauors, viz.
rubies and precious stones on his nose, &amp;c. And
this <hi>Et caetera</hi> shall, if you will, bee the perfectest
poxe that euer grewe in Shordich or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bankes.</speaker>
               <p>And there haue beene bigge inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Fishstreet hill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Horse.</speaker>
               <p>But the couetous Landlord is the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller
of the common-wealth, hee neither feares
God nor the deuill, nor so hee maye racke it out,
cares not what Tenant he receiues: he is no wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
(praie God he be no bencher) hee fits warme
at home, and sets downe his accounts, and saies to
<pb facs="tcp:9715:11"/>
himselfe, my houses goe nowe but for twentie
poundes by the yeere, Ile make them all baudie
houses, and they will yeeld mee twice as much.
Vppon the Exchange comes to him one or two
honest men to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his hands, the poore arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
or his lyke, of what trade so euer, offers him
the rent it hath gone for, &amp; sureties perhaps. Yea,
saie so, good securitie, and foure pounds a yere for
a house, comes Pierce Pandor, and baudie Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice
his wife, two that I warrant you were know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
well inough what they were, I two that had
beene as well carted and whipt, and couerd with
durt ouer head and eares, and they forsooth will
begin the world anue again, hauing a fresh wench
or two that came but from the carryers that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
though shee had tapt many a canne in long
lane at Barthelmew tide. With this stocke of wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
will this Trustie Roger and his Bettrice set
vp forsooth with their pamphlet pots, and stewed
prunes, nine for a tester, in a sinfull saucer, and
they will offer this couetous and wretched land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorde
fiue poundes by the yeere, yea sixe pounds
to haue his house and his countenaunce wythall.
But hee that will go to the deuill for money, will
admit them with fauour, and so let them haue his
house, with promise of anie thing whatsoeuer in
his power, yea, and if occasion serue, will write,
and speak, and take paines and plaie the sutor, and
beare wyth them in anie thing, so there bee anie
meane to doo it, and hee to bee sure of his rent.
<pb facs="tcp:9715:12"/>
God is his iudge hee does it for no fleshly respect,
but euen of a mere worldly motion, to beare sinne
out with sinne, and lecherie with couetousnesse.
Let the Parish complaine, why (sayes hee) what
should I doo, I haue my rent paid mee at my day.
I must make money of my lande, and so let them
doo their heartes out, thinkes hee, <hi>I</hi> shall haue my
rent the readier. This cormorant is hee that cares
not how he get it so hee haue it. This Stymphalist
is he that with fiue or sixe Tenements, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
thereunto belonging, infectes the aire with
stench, and poisons that parish, yea and twentie
parishes off with the contagion of such carrion as
lies there in their bumble baths, and stinke at both

               <p>Marocco, Praie thy wish take effect, I wish
for euerie parish so pestered with such tenants and
tenements, God put into their mindes to be but at
cost and charges for the faggots, for ale and cakes
I were mearst, if it cost fiue markes. But how does
this landlord fall into this <hi>Praemunire?</hi> Why is thy
mallice so great against them, when tis the baude
and the whoore that make all this stirre?</p>

               <p>O master, miserable landlords are cause of
all this mischiefe. Tis he that because he will haue
an vnreasonable rent, will vpholde anie villanie in
his tenant: a slaue to monie, a pandor to the baud,
a piller, nay a pillow &amp; a bolster to all the roguerie
committed in his houses. And yet will this filthie
felow sit at his doore on a sonday in the high street
and my mistres his wife by him, &amp; there forsooth
talke so saint-like of the sermon that day, and what
a good peece of worke the young man made, and
what a goodly gift of vtterance he had, but not the
value of a pound of beefe wil a giue him, were his
gift of vtterance comparable to S. Augustines, or
Chrisostomes eloquence. Sweare a will and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fweare
vpon the worke day, as well as anie. And if
percase a sit in place of authoritie, O howe seuere
will he be in all his proceedings against a youg or
good fellow in anie trifling matter. Then a takes
vpon him not a little: Sir (sayes hee) what did you
in such an house? Wherefore came you the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And laie the lawe and the Prophetes too,
<pb facs="tcp:9715:13"/>
and so rate a Gentleman well descended, meerely
priuiledged with a furd gowne and a nightcap:
when in deede his bringing vp hath beene in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie
and slauerie illiberally, hauing spent his time
in conference with the water tankard at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit,
lying miserably, and for sparing of wood, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his gowne sleeue with fuell from the haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dashers,
and wearing his handes in a frostie morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the fugitiue flames of a few wast papers, a
naturall enemie to all learning and liberalitie. O
master, such a churle as you and <hi>I</hi> sawe heere last
daie talke with two souldiers in the yard, and put
his hand in his pouch, &amp; gaue them nere a penny.</p>

haue such golden mindes, I wish golden mines:
master, I protest to you I speake it not to flatter, but
in reproach of those money-mongers, those lease-mongers,
those caniballs, that dishonour the citie
wherein they dwell, but vprightly <hi>I</hi> speake it, that
you may not think <hi>I</hi> raile vpon mallice against any
priuate man for anie priuate quarrell: There are
many that beautifie London for their good parts,
who being ciuily and well brought vp, are affable
to straungers, charitable to the poore, liberall to
schollers, and such as Citizens should be, dutifull
to their prince, and deuout to their citie.</p>

better many, with as great shew of deuotion and
charitie as the best. From such dissembling holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

               <p>As you please master, and let this be our
first lecture of the Anatomie of the world. If the
Trance holde me but till the next Tearme, where
now I haue but with a drie foote ouerleapt these
matters, I may chance of these and more leaue a
deeper print, and hauing handled a case of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
will saie somewhat further of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
and differences, euen as the bit of
reason shall leade mee. And so I commit you to
your supper, and my selfe to my litter, for I
promise you <hi>I</hi> am not a little weary
with gambolling this
after noone.</p>
