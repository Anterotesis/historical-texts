         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>POOR <hi>Darius</hi> is decreed ro be unfortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where. His Stars purſue him two thouſand
years after his death, tear his Image, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his Friends againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am one of 'em. I find
him in <hi>Curtius,</hi> a Prince of Valour, Clemency, Juſtice,
and great moral Virtues, ſuffering under the heavieſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
that ever befel Man. And I have much pity
for him; and more abhorrence for the Villains that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him, than thoſe that cut off <hi>Aexander. Darius</hi> has
no ſucceſs, the greater ſtill the pity. If <hi>Alexander</hi> moves
my pity, 'tis when he has ſucceſs, becauſe 'tis the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of his great Virtues. <hi>Darius</hi> never parted with his;
nor good nor ill Fortune vanquiſh'd his Virtue, that
<hi>Darius,</hi> of the two, ſeems the greater Conqueror, and in
a common Waggon gor'd in his Blood, appears a more
Glorious Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Chariot trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
over the <hi>Indians.</hi> For <hi>Darius</hi> in all miſery tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over Fortune. Fortune moſt inſolently triumphs
<pb facs="tcp:48242:3"/>
over <hi>Alexander.</hi> The deſcription <hi>Curtius</hi> gives of him and
his Army, when they came from the Conqueſt of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> is a perfect picture of one of our lewd debauchees
of quality, coming in the head of drunken Ruffians
from beating a Watch. <hi>Curtius</hi> ſay<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, a thouſand ſober
Men might have taken 'em all priſoners. And no doubt,
cou'd a luſty whiggiſh <hi>London</hi> Watch have met with
'em, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had been carried to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
notwithſtanding his Royal Dignity, or perhaps the
ſooner for it. Therefore, if <hi>Darius</hi> moves no pity, I
am afraid it is not his fault, but mine; and he is once
more fallen into ill hands. I am apt to think I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a fault, in not taking the whole Story; but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out Queen <hi>Statira,</hi> and her two Daughters, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Princeſſes, well known to the World, whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
wou'd have probably mov'd more compaſſion,
than thoſe of a ſtrange Lady, obſcurely deſcended from
my Fancy, which I have introduc'd in their ſtead. But
when I firſt contriv'd and writ this Play, my Judgment
was overborn by ſome I much regard; who told me,
thoſe Princeſſes had been already ſeen very often, their
Beauties wou'd now ſeem ſtale, and a new Face be more
agreeable. My judgment at that time might be eaſily
born down, for it was weak, as I my Self was, by a
redious ſickneſs, elſe I had not medled with Tragedy;
for there is nothing more plain, than that the humor
of the preſent Age runs quite to another extreme,
too far. Nor do the preſent Company of Actors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with Tragedians enow, to maſter that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.
And they have no reaſon to contend with it,
ſince they can pleaſe at a much cheaper rate, by
<pb facs="tcp:48242:3"/>
Farce and Comedy; and truly ſo can I, they coſt me leſs
pains than Tragedy does. But when I firſt medled with
this Play, and long after, I was not in Humor for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
A Poet, like a Fiddle, will never ſound mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in wet weather. The Trebles, which are the ſtrings
for Jigs, will nor endure ſtretching. So I was forc'd on
grumbling Tragedy; and having done ſomthing in it,
was loth to loſe my labour. Thus much I am willing to
ſay againſt myſelf, becauſe it is Truth. But as I will not be
arrogant, ſo not over-fawning, becauſe there is Foppery
and Affectation in both. A misfortune fell upon this
Play, that might very well dizzy the Judgments of my
Audience. Juſt before the Play began, Mrs. <hi>Barry</hi> was
ſtruck with a very violent Fever, that took all Spirit from
her, by conſequence from the Play; the Scenes She acted
fell dead from her; and in the <hi>4th</hi> Act her diſtemper grew
ſo much upon her, She cou'd go on no farther, but all
her part in that Act was wholly cut out, and neither
Spoke nor Read; that the People went away without
knowing the contexture of the Play, yet thought they
knew all. Now we know, how hard it is to recover the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of one that's executed; it is almoſt as hard as
it is to recover his Life. The circulation of Blood is
ſtopt in the Strangled; and the circulation of Reaſon in
the Living, by violent prepoſſeſſions. And when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
are poſſeſt of any thing, it is not eaſy to get it from
'em. They have great Strength and Authority too. And
not alone in theſe trifles, but in things of the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
even in matters of Religion. As in theſe toyes,
People dare not be pleas'd, but as they find others are; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:48242:4"/>
in Religion, they dare not be ſav'd, but in the way they
find others go. Now though in matters of Religion, where
Truth is of great concernment, and to ſuffer for it, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Advantageous, a Man may boldly contend
with the whole World; but in ſo fooliſh a Cauſe, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fall of <hi>Darius</hi> be a good Story of a Play, and
whether I have manag'd it well, or no, to hector the
World, if it dares differ from me, wou'd be notorious
Arrogance and Folly; nay, Injuſtice too: for let Men
have what Opinions they will, of this Play, they
have paid me for 'em, and paid me handſomly, why
ſhou'd I ſeek to take it from 'em? I will then ſay no
more concerning the Play; if that be faulty, I muſt
take care to have the fewer faults in my ſelf. But
certainly I ſhall not be endur'd by any good Man,
nay, even by my ſelf, if I ſhou'd not here take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
to render, with all poſſible Humility and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs,
my Thanks to His Majeſty, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of his Preſence, on the Day which was to be
for my advantage; which He was pleaſed to Grant
me, out of a moſt Gracious and Royal regard to
what had formerly appear'd well in me, both as a
Poet and a Subject. I know not how the Minds of
others are wrought upon; but ſuch a piece of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Juſtice and Favour is to me more ſtrong than a
Law to bind me for ever to my good Behaviour. I
cannot alſo forbear to mention the many ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
I have receiv'd from the preſent Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain.
Obligations are Chains, but when they come
from Princes, and Men of worth, they are badges
<pb facs="tcp:48242:4"/>
of Honour, and a Man is tempted to ſhew 'em,
when he goes abroad, I confeſs, not only my
Gratitude, but my Vanity, makes me name him,
Paſt diſpute his excellent Underſtanding, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other great Qualities, are an Ornament to his
High Office; then well may His Favours be a
Grace to me.</p>
            <p>Now, SIR, I ſhall come to you, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſeveral kindneſſes from you, have found
in you at all times, an inclination and readineſs to
do me any friendly Office; all which have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
won upon me; and I am very uneaſy
under Obligations, till I have made ſome return.
But I can make no other, than of this kind, which
I therefore beg you to accept. It is true, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
Dedicators have brought this ſort of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
into as much contempt, as common Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
have done Swearing. The true and firſt
intent of 'em was Sacred. A Dedication ought
to be a little Chappel, Conſecrated to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of ſome Friend of Worth; and a Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of Holy Reliques. Now 'tis become like the
<hi>Temple Church,</hi> a place where Knights of the Poſt
ply; that are ready to ſay any thing for any one.
But I have kept a better Reputation in the World,
you will come amongſt good company. There
are few Names fixt before my Writings, but may
ſerve like the Phenix's, on the Front of our new
Buildings, for marks of Inſurance; and might
<pb facs="tcp:48242:5"/>
inſure 'em, were it poſſible. But I come to you
with no ſuch fooliſh deſign. For how ridiculous,
and unreaſonable is it, to deſire another to defend
my impertinence? An office no wiſe Man will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
and the greateſt Man that is cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
My Writings, when they are out of my
hand, are no longer mine; the World pays for
'em, and will manage 'em as they pleaſe. All
care of 'em is vain, therefore I take none. My
Honeſty no Man ſhall diſpoſe of but myſelf. 'Tis
to preſerve that, and not my Writings, I beg your
leave for this Addreſs; and I wou'd not accept
your leave, if it wou'd coſt me any flattery. You
have liv'd in the laſt Court, and this, with great
Reputation. Have approv'd yourſelf, to be a Man
of Honour, Loyalty, Courage, Generoſity, good
Senſe, good Nature, and good Morals; which
ought to be celebrated for the publick Good, which
too much wants ſuch examples. I know how ill
the ſick and corrupt World, digeſts the leaſt praiſe
of any but themſelves. How tyr'd even good
Men are, if you lead 'em far into the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of any Man; and the bad will not go along
with you, but on ſome ill deſign. Therefore I
ſhall keep where I am ſafe, where every Man will
be o' my ſide. No Man that knows you, but
confeſſes you to be one of the worthieſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
they know. I ſhou'd therefore ſhew very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:48242:5"/>
worth of myſelf, if I ſhou'd ſlight both your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Deſert. And, SIR, I hope you, who
have forgiven Writings of mine, that ſhew my Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
will not be diſpleas'd with this Dedication,
where I ſhew the few Virtues I have, my Juſtice,
and Integrity, which are the beſt claims I have to

               <l>To Heaven, by Ladders made o' Ropes o' Rhimes.</l>
               <l>Finds Heaven and Gold in Verſe, and while he pores,</l>
               <l>He pities Judges, Biſhops, Chancellors;</l>
               <l>They ne'r attain his Joys, they'r Rich, and Great,</l>
               <l>But he's above 'em all, for he's a Wit;</l>
               <l>A Prince in Verſe, and Princes Titles give.</l>
               <l>His Pen at will makes Honour dye, or live.</l>
               <l>He dubbs this Man a Knave, a Coxcomb that;</l>
               <l>Gives any Brow a horny Coronet.</l>
               <l>Orders ſome famous Beauty every hour</l>

               <l>Deſerv'd, or not, he does it all by Power.</l>
               <l>Thus like a Beau, and Bully o' the Town,</l>
               <l>He by debauching Beauties gets Renown:</l>
               <l>That is, their Names, for he enjoys not one,</l>
               <l>Thus was our Poet, by his Muſe drawn in;</l>
               <l>'Tis true, ſhe always innocent has been,</l>
               <l>Kept Shop, like a good creditable Cit,</l>
               <l>But traded in damn'd never thriving Wit.</l>
               <l>Lawyers have Fees, howe'r their Cauſes go,</l>
               <l>And Parſons with lean Sermons fat can grow,</l>
               <l>Of Lawyers your undoing you muſt buy;</l>
               <l>

               <l>The vileſt Quack by ignorance can get,</l>
               <l>More than the beſt of Poets by his Wit.</l>
               <l>Then you may ask, Why will the Poet Write?</l>
               <l>He ſays, his Genius bids, and Hours invite.</l>
               <l>No lumbring buſineſs in his way is laid,</l>
               <l>His Life's a private and a vacant Shade;</l>
               <l>And with deſign, both to inſtruct and pleaſe,</l>
               <l>He plants the Walks with various Images.</l>
               <l>And humbly prays you, if with Art he writes,</l>
               <l>You'l not take pains to damn your own Delights.</l>
               <l>Nay, do not damn him much, if he writes ill;</l>

                     <l>Nature indeed had given her charms for Love;</l>

               </l>
               <l>The Wretch into his Grave does living go.</l>
               <l>The Lord may have ſome Mercy on his Ghoſt,</l>
               <l>Bus as for his poor Body, that's quite loſt.</l>
               <l>Now our ſide Boxes are a <hi>Smithfield</hi> grown,</l>
               <l>Where Town and Country Nags for Sale are ſhown.</l>
               <l>Where any Lady may her humour fit,</l>
               <l>With a tall Palfry, or a little Tit.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48242:42"/>
And yet I do not hear the Ladies buy;</l>
               <l>Nay, Sirs, they towards you hardly caſt an Eye.</l>
               <l>The Ladies nobly pay the Houſe their due,</l>
               <l>Why ſhou'd they give four Shillings to ſee you?</l>
               <l>Not all your Faces are worth half the Sum,</l>
               <l>Get Flags and Trumpets, and try who will come.</l>
               <l>The Images of Virtue, we have ſhewn,</l>
               <l>We know will pleaſe you Hero's o' the Town,</l>
               <l>And Heroines, becauſe they are your own.</l>
               <l>In Gallant faithful <hi>Patron,</hi> and my dear</l>
               <l>Lov'd <hi>Memnon,</hi> you brave men of Arms appear.</l>
               <l>The Ladies in <hi>Barzana,</hi> ſee your Face,</l>
               <l>Of their fair minds, but in no flattering Glaſs.</l>
               <l>All love to ſee themſelves; the foul will ſtare</l>
               <l>In Glaſſes, though they meet with Goblings there.</l>
               <l>But all the little hopping fluttering Sparks,</l>
               <l>You catch with Glaſſes, as you do the Larks.</l>
               <l>Place a fair Glaſs directly in the eye</l>
               <l>Of a young <hi>Beau,</hi> he never can paſs by.</l>
               <l>Young Souldiers diſcipline their Graces there,</l>
               <l>Face to the right, the left, then as you were.</l>
               <stage>[She combs firſt o're the right Shoulder, then
o're the left, then ſets her Cravat Strings.</stage>
               <l>We pray all daily to this Glaſs repair.</l>
