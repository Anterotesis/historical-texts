            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Expoſtulatory APPEAL TO THE <hi>Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,</hi> Joyned in Community with SAMUEL ANSLEY.</head>
            <p>IT having pleaſed the Lord (whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve) to call me by his Grace, even in my tender Years; by which Grace he put me upon early ſeekings after himſelf, that ſo I might know him the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, whom ſavingly to know is Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>Many ſore and weary ſteps hath my Anxious Soul troad in finding out the Path that leadeth thereunto, that ſo I might come to a certain knowledge of what God is, and how he ought to be Worſhipped: and this made me go about from one Watch-man of the Night to another, inquiring after my Souls Beloved, to hear if they could tell where his dwelling was, and where he maketh his Flocks to lie down in Reſt.</p>
            <p>But oh the uncertain ſound which they gave! ſome ſaid <hi>Lo here,</hi> and others ſaid, <hi>Lo there is he whom thy Soul deſireth</hi>: but alas! when I went out to ſeek him there, I could neither ſee his Shape, nor hear his Voice; then uſed I to retire into my Chamber to ſuplicate him in ſecret, whoſe Preſence I could not meet with in thoſe Publick Aſſemblies; But yet ſtill I looked for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57535:2"/>
that at a diſtance (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Appearance of the Son of God, which was to have been had nearer at hand: ſometimes ſearching over the Records of Scripture, if there I could have found him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, whom my Soul greatly deſired to ſee: Oh but there I found him not, although I daily read the Reports which his Ancient Primitive Servants have left there upon record, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning how they witneſſed him, by vertue of the effectual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his mighty Power in them; but what was this to me? whilſt I knew him not my ſelf Experimentally working down Sin and Iniquity in me, and removing that that did let, and would let till it was taken out of the way, that ſo his own Righteous Scepter might bear rule over me.</p>
            <p>And thus as I ſought him ſorrowing, in an acceptable time was he pleaſed to appear unto me, (magnified be his Name forever) and to caſt up a living way for me; though much contrary to the way I walked in formerly; yet by his good Spirit he ſo inſtructed me, that I certainly knew this to be the way that leadeth to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Felicity: yet I muſt needs declare, 'tis a Croſs Way to the Carnal mind and ſtubborn will of the fallen Creature; where I now find that I as well others ſtood by Nature. But now the Lord having pulled my Soul as a Brand out of the Fire, and made me willing in the day of his Power: I can do no leſs then ſpeak to the praiſe of his Grace, whoſe own Arm hath wrought Salvation in and for me thus far.</p>
            <p>And now I ſay, this was the Grace by which I was called, and by which I am in meaſure ſaved; even that Grace of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared</hi> (mark) <hi>to all men, teaching us that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Righteouſly, and Godlily in this preſent World: looking for that bleſſed Hope and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us</hi> (mark) <hi>from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now being taught by this Grace, which is the only Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by which every one may learn to know God ſavingly, which principle God hath raiſed up in me to publiſh and declare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57535:2"/>
where they ſhould look for the appearance of this ſaving Arm and Grace of God, which alone can burſt the Bonds of Death and ſet the Soul at Liberty.</p>
            <p>And beſides the diſpoſition which this gracious Principle hath wrought in me towards all my Fellow-creatures, that they might partake with me, and with the Remnant whom the Lord hath called out of the World; I ſay that all might partake with us of the rich Love of God, with which my Soul is refreſhed at this very time, that now I am writing unto you, I found the God of all grace, laying a more ſpecial Injunction upon me to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit you particularly; to Proclaim his free Grace and rich Mercy, which he is pleaſed yet to extend towards you: And upon the twentieth day of the eight Moneth, this preſent Year, 1678. in Obedience to that God which made me, and formed my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me, and by the motion of his good Spirit, did I in fear and much trembling come with a Meſſage from the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you, which was this, <hi>viz.</hi> To make Proclamation of his univerſal Love towards you; that ſo all who had not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood the tenders of his Mercy and out-ſlipt the Day of your Viſitation (after which the Lord will tary for none of you) ye all might come and be converted from your Iniquities, and he would receive you graciouſly, ſo that none ſhould need to fear their Eternal Predeſtination or Reprobation to Everlaſting Miſery, as though God had fore ordained ſome for everlaſting Damnation; for God would have all men come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth and be ſaved, as ſaith the holy Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. and (ſaith God) <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the Earth, and be ye ſaved, Iſa.</hi> 45.22. Nor may any preſume (in hopes of Mercy) that they are in the eſtate of Election, while they are in the unbelief and diſobedience unto the Spirit of Truth, which Convinces the world of Sin, and leads the Saints into all Truth. for ſo came the Word of the Lord unto me, <hi>Go, invite them to the Feaſt of ingathering, that ſo they may be allured to turn in unto me, and be gathered by me, in this the Day of the ſtretchings forth of the Arms of my Mercy, before I come to ſift the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Sieve of Vanity, when ſuch as are found Chaffie ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57535:3"/>
be blown away with the Whirlwind of my Wrath, and there ſhall be none to deliver you,</hi> Iſa. 30.18.</p>
            <p>This Word (in the fear and love of God, which he hath ſhed abroad in my Heart by Jeſus Chriſt abundantly) did I come at that time to Proclaim unto you, with many more ſuch like inviting Expreſſions, would you have had Patience to hear me, I ſhould by divine Aſſiſtance have declared unto you, as I did to ſuch tender-hearted Ones without your Doors, whoſe Ears the Lord incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hearken unto me.</p>
            <p>And now I find it upon me to write a few words by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, and to expoſtulate the caſe a little with you: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no you will all juſtifie that Action of haling of me, (who came in the Name and Power of the Lord (and my Siſter who ſtood patiently by me) out from amongſt you. I confeſs I heard no publick Command for it given by any of you; but it was not done by a Perſon unknown to you, but one in Office amongſt you; ſo that had he not had private Commiſſion from ſome one or more of you, for the former knowledge that he had of our blameleſs deportment amongſt you, I dare believe he would not have uſed us ſo Uncharitably, without receiving Reproof from you: Why indeed ſhould he, ſince none of you can juſtly ſay that we gave any Interruption to you? ye are all my witneſſes I waited in ſilence whilſt there was a Voice heard amongſt you, taking that opportunity to open my Mouth unto you, when your Teacher was peruſing ſuch Petitions as uſed to divert him from ſo ſuddain a falling on to Prayers amongſt you: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though that time was not ſo long as ordinary, but Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers begun before I could ſo much as name my Meſſage to you, upon requeſt made me to be ſilent during Prayer time, and a promiſe of being heard afterwards, I tarried till your Worſhip was ended, &amp; then began my Mouth to open unto you; but no ſooner had I charged you with being out of the right way, but you made good that charge immediately, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perſecuting Spirit, which infallibly marks out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers the falſe Church; who hath ever violently handled and hardl<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uſed the Members of the true: And ſo it became my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57535:3"/>
lot at that time to bear a meaſure of Sufferings from you; but the Lord upheld me by the right Hand of his Power, ſo that I feared not the wrath of the Adverſary; though one more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſhewed himſelf mightily inraged againſt me.</p>
            <p>Oh! where was your patient Mind, that you could not hear what I had to ſay unto you, and have tryed what Spirit I had been of, that ſo, if in Error, by ſound Argument you might have convinced me.</p>
            <p>Oh! where was your <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Moderation that ought to be ſhewed towards all, whereby you ſhould have manifeſted the Lord to be at hand.</p>
            <p>Oh! where was your Lamb-like Meekneſs, by which you would have inſtructed ſuch as ſhould have oppoſed you, had you been in the Truth? But whilſt you profeſs the Name of Chriſt (who is Truth it ſelf) you are found in the Spirit of Antichriſt, otherwiſe you would not have ſo roughly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Guiltleſs; nay, if we had been guilty, we ought to have had a more fair Tryal and Examination before you, ere ſuch haſty Execution ſhould have proceeded from you.</p>
            <p>This therefore briefly is written in the Spirit of Love, and ſent to you, that all ſober Inquirers may have a true Accompt of the Occaſion of our coming amongſt you that day; And let none be offended that I take not in their Teacher with them, ſo as to appeal to him as well as them; for the Lord knoweth, 'tis not in any Enmity I bear towards him; but as I formerly have had an high Eſteem of him, ſo I ſtill do retain a kind and friendly Reſpect for him; but having privately addreſs'd my ſelf unto him, whereby to render the Reaſon of my turning from him, in anſwer to which (he himſelf knows) I received not ſo much as one word to give me any Satisfaction, but had a haſty Put-by from him, which may very well excuſe me in not making a ſecond Application unto him.</p>
            <p>However, my Soul deſires the real Welfare of all men, and have written this neither in Envy nor Oſtentation, but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Requirings of the Lord, before whom my Heart is broken at this time; and now in much godly Compaſſion have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57535:4"/>
I a Remembrance of ſuch as have ſincere Deſires amongſt you, and I doubt not but that the Lord in tender Mercy, and for his own Seed's ſake, that cryeth to him for Deliverance in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, will in due time reach forth his powerful ſaving Arm unto ſuch of you, whereby you ſhall be gathered into a place of Safety, before his Over-ſlowing Scourge be made to paſs over you.</p>
            <p>Let this therefore be a Provocation unto you ſpeedily to turn into the ſecret of your own Souls, to the Appearance of his Son, Chriſt Jeſus, who there ſpeaks from Heaven unto you, reproving you for your Sin and Iniquity, and exciting of you to Holineſs and Purity; who by his Heavenly Light in your Conſciences, if you give up to be led and guided by it, will bring ſuch of you as are now even as Loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> home to the Fold of Reſt.</p>
