            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wrytinge to your most redoubted maiestie,
the excellente clerke Philip Melanchthon in
his epystle before his common places, whose
iudgement this Sarcerius foloweth welnere
in all thinges. Onely in this they differ, that
Melanchthon dyrecteth his style to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng
onely of the lerned persons well
exercysed in scriptures. This tempereth his
penne also to the capacitie of yonge student<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of scripture and suche as haue not had moche

            <p>Nowe it hathe ben an olde prouerbe and

<pb facs="tcp:27071:5"/>
myttes, I graunte the godly and lerned men
in the pryncipall articles of our faythe do not
varye, but do constauntly synge all one note,
yet neuerthelesse in other dysputable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
(in whiche it is not mete for euery man
to wade) as predestynacyon, contyngencye,
frewyll, &amp; suche lyke, there hathe ben always,
and yet is some dissencion, so that what one
aloweth an other disprayseth, what one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ꝑueth,
an other approueth. And yet it can not
be denyed but there is one symple infallible
trouth who so can attayne it.</p>
            <p>The cause of this blindnes is, that sithens
the fall of Adam, at whiche tyme mankynde
was depryued of the similitude of god, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whiche he was fyrste create, mans wytte
hathe ben so darkened and his nature so spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and cankred with the originall vice, that
he can not but be wrapped in infinite errours.
Onely god hathe perfecte intellygence, and
is true in his wordes. Omnis autem homo
mendax. There is no man but he lyeth, but he
erreth, but he both disceyueth &amp; is disceyued.
Best is he that erreth leest. Saynt Augustyn
wrote very moche, but agayne he retracted
moche. It is not possyble for one man bothe
to wryte moche, aud to write al thynges true
that shall nede no reprehensyon. In a longe
worke (sayth the poete Horace) a man maye
other whyles lawfully slombre. Neyther do
I speake this bycause I knowe any notable
errour in Sarcerius.</p>
            <p>But forasmoche as the iudgementes of
men be variable, and namely in this kynde
<pb facs="tcp:27071:6"/>
of wrytynge, it is very harde to satisfye all
mens myndes: Therfore if either this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
clerke Erasmus Sarcerius in his writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or I in my translacion shall not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answere is your maiesties and other mens
expectacion: It shal apperteyne to a christian
modestie to interprete all thynges vnto the
best parte.</p>
            <p>As for exemple: It is not vnknowen what
great alteracion hathe lately ben amonges
lerned men concernynge frewyl. Some haue
put frewyll in no thynges, some on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
parte haue gone aboute to meyntayne
frewyll in all thynges. Agayne other goynge
in the meane betwen both these extremes, as
Melanchthou &amp; this Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cerius, with many
other excellent clerkes, haue denyed frewyl
onely in spiritual mocyons and that also in
such persons as be not yet regenerate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by the holy ghost, &amp; yet in the mean sea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
they take it not so awaye, but they leue
them also in spirituall mocions a certeyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
or willing, which indeuour neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
can fyni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>she nothinge, onles it be holpen
by the holy ghost. This (after my pore iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is the ryghtest and truest waye.</p>
            <p>But now, if accordynge to the varietie of
mans iudgement, the same shall not forthw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
appere to others, set them not incontinuently
damne and gyue sentence of other mens wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynges,
but diligently enserche the scripture,
which is the only rule &amp; touche stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we ought to trye the trouthe from the
vntrouth, the pure and syncere doctrine from
<pb facs="tcp:27071:6"/>
the corrupt &amp; hypocriticall. If they shall fynd
any thing ryghter or better then this doctrine
let them louyngly imparte and communicate
their waye vnto vs, yf not, let them vse this
waye with vs.</p>
            <p>But what so euer this boke is (for to your

as by the i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulsion &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of my said
