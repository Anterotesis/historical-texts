            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He night (saith <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>) was not therefore made, that either we should sleep it out, or passe it away idly; and Chiefly because we see many world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons to watch out whole nights for the Commodities of this life. In the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church also the <hi>Saints</hi> of God used to rise at midnight to praise the <hi>Rock of their salvation</hi> with <hi>Hymns and Spiritual Songs.</hi> In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shouldst thou do now, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the <hi>Order</hi> of the Stars, and how they all in their several stations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115882:14"/>
praise their Creator. When all the world is asleep, thou shouldst watch, weep and pray and propose unto thy self that <hi>Practise</hi> of the Psalmist, <hi>I am weary of my groaning, every night wash I my bed, and water my Couch with my tears</hi>; for as the <hi>Dew</hi> which falls by night is most fructifying, and tempers the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi>; so the tears we shed in the night, make the soul fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, quench all Concupiscence, and supple the hardnesse we got in the day. <hi>Christ</hi> himself in the day-time taught and preach'd, but continued all night in prayer, sometimes in a Mountain apart, sometimes amongst the wild beasts, and sometimes in solitary places.</p>
                  <p>They, whose Age or Infirmity will not give them way to do thus, should use all Convenient means to be up before the Sun-rising, for <hi>we must prevent the Sunne to give God thanks, and at the day-spring pray unto him.</hi> Wisd. 16. It was in the morning that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> gathered the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115882:14"/>
and of the Just man it is said, <hi>That He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray before the most high,</hi> Eccl. 39. So soon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as thou dost awake, shut thy door against all prophane and worldly thoughts, and before all things let thy God be first admitted, offer unto him thy first fruits for that day, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with him after this manner.</p>
                  <div type="prayer">
                     <head>When thou dost awake.</head>
                     <p>O God the Father! who saidst in the beginning, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and it was so; <hi>Inlighten my Eyes that I never sleepe in death:</hi> lest at any time my Enemy should say, <hi>I have prevailed against him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O God the Sonne! light of light; the most true and perfect light, from whom this light of the Sun, and the day had their beginning; thou, that art the light shining in darknesse, Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115882:15"/>
every one that cometh into this world, expell from me all Clouds of Ignorance, and give me true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that in thee, and by thee I may know the <hi>Father</hi>; whom to know is to live, and to serve is to reigne.</p>
                     <p>O God the Holy Ghost! the fire that inlightens, and warms our hearts, shed into me thy most sacred light, that I may know the true Joyes of Heaven, and see to escape the illusions of this world. Ray thy selfe into my soul that I may see what an Exceeding weight of glory my Enemy would bereave me of for the meer shadowes and painting of this world. Grant that I may know those things which belong unto thee, and nothing else; Inflame me with thy divine love that with a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Contempt I may tread upon all transitory Pleasures, and seek only those things which are eternal.</p>
                     <p>Most blessed Trinity! and one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God! as thou hast this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked me from this bodily sleep, so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115882:15"/>
awake my soule from the sleep of sin, and as thou hast given me strength af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sleep, now again to watch, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death give me life, for what is death to me, is but sleep with thee, to whom be ascribed all glory, wisdome, majesty, dominion and praise now and for Ever, Amen.</p>

and love of thee; grant also that my body may this day be a helper and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my soul in all good works, that both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of those Endlesse Joyes, where thou livest and reignest with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her and the Holy Ghost, one true God world without End, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>ALmighty, eternal God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> I blesse and praise thy holy name, and with my whole heart give thee all possible thanks, that out of thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodness thou wert pleased to watch over me this night, to resist my adversary, and to keep me from all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115882:16"/>
of body and soul; O thou! that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver slumbrest nor sleepest, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hast thou been of me! how hast thou protected me, and with thy holy angels, thy ministring spirits sent forth to minister for the heirs of salvation, incompast me about! yea, with what unmeasurable love hast thou restored unto me the light of the day, and rais'd me from sleep and the shadow of death, to look up to thy holy hill; Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mighst thou, O God, have shut the gates of death upon me, and laid me for ever under the barres of the Earth, but thou hast redeemed me from Corruption, and with thy <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting armes</hi> enlarged my time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                     <p>And now O Father of mercies, and God of all Consolation, hear the voyce of thy Supplicant, and let my cry be heard in thy highest heavens: As I do sincerely love thee, and beg for thy Protection, so receive thou me under the shadow of thy wings, watch

over me with the Eyes of thy mercy, direct me in the wayes of thy Law, and enrich me with the gifts of thy Spirit, that I may passe through this day, to the glory of thy great name, the good of others, and the comfort of my own soul. Keep me, O my God, from the great offence; quench in me all vain Imaginations, and sensual desires; sanctifie and supple my heart with the dew of thy divine Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh it with the streams of thy grace, that I may bring forth fruit in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not cumber the ground, nor be cut off in thy anger. And to this end I do here resigne my body and my soul, with all the faculties thou hast bestowed upon both, into thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hands; Guide thou them in the works of thy Law, turne my eyes from all transitory objects, to the things which are eternal, and from the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of this world to the <hi>fowles of the aire</hi>; and the <hi>Lillies of the field</hi> And now, O my God, seeing

I am but Dust and Ashes, and my Righteousnesse a filthy Rag, having no deserts in my self but what should draw Everlasting vengeance, and the Vials of thy bitter wrath upon my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soul; behold, I have brought with me thy first-born and onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, the propitiation for my sins, the <hi>Incense</hi> I offer up with my prayers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. my Redeemer and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in whom thou art well-pleased, hear thou him.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115882:18"/>
come forth into the <hi>World,</hi> and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with an Enemy; And what else is the World but a Wildernesse? A darksome, intricate wood full of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes</hi> and dangers; A Forrest where spiritual hunters, principalities and powers spread their nets, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it about; wouldst thou then escape these ghostly snares; this <hi>wickednes in high places,</hi> and return home if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and holier, yet not worse then at thy setting out? Wouldst thou with <hi>Iacob</hi> passe over these <hi>Waters</hi> with thy staffe onely, and in thy return become two bands? <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. Why then, do as he did, begin thy Journey with prayer, and say, <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eate, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house in peace: then shall the Lord be my God,</hi> Gen. 28.20, 21. This was his practise, and the practise of his fathers; <hi>The Lord God of heaven</hi> (saith <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>who took me from my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115882:18"/>
fathers house, and from the land of my kindred, &amp;c. he shall send his Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> Nor must thou pray only at thy setting forth, but all the way, and at all times; Thus <hi>Eliezer</hi> prayed at the Well, <hi>Isaac</hi> in the field, and <hi>Elias</hi> (in his journey to <hi>Mount Horeb</hi>) under a <hi>Iuniper</hi> tree in the Wildernesse. This also (if thou wilt imitate these holy men) thou may'st do, and for that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpose thou hast here these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prayers.

                  <p>ALl the Sacraments of the New Testament, in those that come to participate them, require a most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite and sincere preparation. But this Sacrament of the Lords Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> it is the highest of all, requires the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and purest Accomplishments. Our preparation to this Sacrament is not perfected by Contrition onely and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115882:31"/>
Confession of sins, (both which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably requisite) but if we will be worthy receivers and partake of those graces which are exhibited unto us in this heavenly banquet, there are many other duties we must necessarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, for this Sacrament is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite vertue, having in it the <hi>Wel-spring</hi> of all graces, even <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> with all the merits of his most bitter passion, which admit neither number nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Wherefore such as our pre-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is, such also shall our propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be of this spiritual <hi>Manna</hi>; for as he that cometh to a Well to draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, takes no more thence, then what his vessel contains; which yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impute unto the Well, but unto his Pitcher which could hold no more; so they that come unto this glorious Sacrament, receive onely so much grace as their preparation and holines makes them capable of. Now there are required of us, before we presume to lay hands upon this bread of life, three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115882:31"/>

                     <item>3. Fervent and effectual Devotion.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>We must (as far as it lies in us) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from all actual sins in thought, word, and deed. Secondly, We must do it to a good end, not for any private benefit; not by compulsion, or for fear of Censure, or any other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical correction; not out of Custome, nor for any sensual devotion or joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the confluence and company at these love-feasts. Thirdly and lastly, we must watch over our owne souls, and take heed that no wind blows upon our garden but the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eternal; we must labour for an heavenly setlednesse, sanctified affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, holy hopes, new garments, a clean heart, and a right spirit. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. The soul must be sick of love, she must long for the banqueting house, nothing now must appear but flowers, nothing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115882:32"/>
must be heard but the singing of birds, and the voice of the Turtle. Lord God (saith S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) with what contrition of heart, with what fountains of tears, with what reverence &amp; fear, with what chastity of body and purity of mind should this divin mystery be celebrated! where thy flesh is the meat, where thy blood is the drink, where the creature feeds upon the Creatour, and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour is united unto the creature, where Angels are spectators, and God himself both the Priest and the Sacrifice, what holinesse and humility should we bring thither?
<q>O what pure things,, most pure, must those hands be which bring my God to me!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As therefore some rich, odoriferous water is distill'd out of many and several sorts of fragrant herbs and flowers, so our devotion at this sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Sacrament should be composed of many spiritual, acceptable affections with God, as (amongst others) are profound humility, unmeasurable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115882:32"/>
ardent love, firme faith, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charity, impatient hunger, and an intollerable longing after this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquet.</p>
                  <p>And because we may not touch these white robes with dirty hands, nor come neer the Rose of <hi>Sharon</hi> with ill sents and offensive fumes, it hath been ever the Custom of Gods Church to injoyn and set apart a certain limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time of purification before this mysterious solemnity, wherein all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and worthy Communicants addressed and prepared themselves in some measure for this unmeasurable mercy. Such was in our Church, that more strict and holy season, called <hi>Lent,</hi> and such still are the preparation-dayes before this glorious Sabbath in all true Churches. Two dayes were given the <hi>Israelites</hi> to sanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to wash their clothes, that they might be ready against the third day, upon which the Lord was to come downe (in the sight of all the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115882:33"/>
people) upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; And this onely at the reception of the Law which was given by Angels; much more then ought we to wash and cleanse our vessels from all vaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, idle words and actions, and to separate our selves from the world for three dayes at least, that we may be ready against that great and blessed day, wherein we are to come, not to a mountain that might not be touched, nor to the sound of a Trumpet, nor to the voice of words spoken to us out of the midst of fire, but to the general as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and Church of the first-borne, which are written in heaven, and to <hi>Iesus the Mediatour of the new Covenant, and to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

drink this cup of the Lord unworth<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

These are the words of a faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and thou maiest beleeve them.</p>
                  <p>When therefore thou doest intend to be a partaker of this merciful and mysterious Sacrament, be sure for three daies at least not to intermeddle with any worldly businesse, but all that time redeeme those many daies which were vainly spent by thee; enter into thine owne bosome, examine what thou hast there, and if thou findest any sons of darknesse lurking under those fig-leaves, conceal them not, but turne them out of doors, and wash their Couch with thy teares; have a care that in the Bridegroomes bed, instead of myrrhe and flowers, thou strowest not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115882:34"/>
thornes and thistles. The Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art to communicate, feed but moderately, and after supper use no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication, but converse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with thine own heart, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate what an Almighty guest thou art to entertaine there next day. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider seriously thine own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and desire of him that he would sanctifie and furnish the roome where he is to eate the Passeover with thee. Intreat him to defend thee that night from all sinful Illusions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to keep the house cleane and garnished for himself. When thou hast thus commended thy self into his hands, let thy sleep that night be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then usual, be up with the day, or rather with thy Saviour, who rose up early, while it was yet dark. Meditate with thy self what miracles of mercy he hath done for thee. Consider how he left his Fathers bosome to be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manger, and laid by his robes of glory to take upon him the seed of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115882:34"/>
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might cloath thee with Immortality. Call to minde his wearisome journeys, continual afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the malice and scorne he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, the persecutions and reproaches laid upon him, his strong cries and teares in the days of his flesh, his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual agony and sweating of blood, with the Implacable fury of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and his own unspeakable humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, humbling himself to the death of the Crosse, a death accursed by Gods own mouth. Consider againe (if thou canst) of what unmeasurable love was he possessed, who having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and spent his time of life here for thy salvation, did not onely leave thee those divine Oracles and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be guided by, but to seale up the summe and make heaven sure unto thee, did by his last Testament give himself with all the merits of his life and death to be wholly thine, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of them took upon him all thy transgressions, bore all thine iniquities,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115882:35"/>
and to appease the anger, and satisfie the Justice of his Father, became the holy, harmlesse, and undefiled sacrifice and perfect satisfaction for the sins of the world, reconciling all things unto his Father, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
                  <p>When thou hast thus considered him in his acts of love and humility, consider him again in his glory, take thine Eyes off from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha,</hi> and look up to the mount of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> yea, to heaven where he sits now upon the right hand of his Father, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, principalities and powers being made subject unto him. Call to minde his Joyful resurrection, his most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished conquest, and triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world, death and hell; his most gracious and familiar conversation with his Apostles before his Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with his most loving and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able carriage towards them at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <hi>leading them out as farre as</hi> Bethanie, <hi>and lifting up his hands, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115882:35"/>
blessing them.</hi> Lastly, close up these thoughts with a serious and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meditation of that great and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though dreadful day of his second coming to judg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ment, promised by himself, and affirmed at the time of his Ascension by the two men in white apparel. <hi>Yemen of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Iesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold! he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall waile because of him. Amen! even so, come quickly, Lord Iesus!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶ These are the duties req<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ired of thee, and which thou must faithfully and punctually performe, if thou wouldst be a worthy Communicant, and receive those sacred and mystical Elements to that blessed end for which they were ordained. But when I speak
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115882:36"/>
of three dayes preparation, I do not impose that proportion of time, nor conclude it sufficient, as if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for thee to recede from thy corrupt inclinations, and the myre of thy sins for such a terme, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to returne and wallow in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when that holy season is over, for our whole life (had we the purity of Angels, and the innocence of infants,) bears no proportion at all, nor can it (without an immediate sanctification from God himself) any way qualifie, or make us fit for the reception of this unmeasurable mercy. But when I spoke of such a proportion of time, I did onely propose it to my Readers for the performing of those holy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duties, which have particular relation to this solemne Feast, and which (indeed) are required then from every Christian. And as for a regular, sober, and holy life; we should in all places, and at all times labour for it, for <hi>without holinesse no man shall see the face

But O my dear Creatour, for Christ Jesus his sake have mercy upon me! look not on my deserts, but on thy glory; O Lord do not refuse me, but reforme and restore me! O Lord hearken, and do, and deferre not, but speak peace to my troubled soul, and send thy loving spirit to strengthen and confirme me in the way of holinesse, bring me home, O Lord, and leade me now unto these living waters, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate me into the saving vine, and purge me, that I may bear more fruit.

                        <hi>HOly, holy, holy,</hi> is the Lord God of Hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory! Behold to the Moone, and it shineth not, and the Starres are darknesse in his sight. The Pillars of heaven do tremble, and are astonished at his reproof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O who then am I, that I should appear before thee, or <hi>what is man that thou shouldest regard him?</hi> O light of light, the all-seeing light that shineth in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehendeth it not, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, when I shall appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy glorious and searching Eye! What an habitation of darknesse and death wilt thou finde within me? What abominable desolations and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? What barrenesse and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wilt thou see there? Many a time hast thou knockt, and I have shut the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115882:39"/>
doors against thee, thou hast often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and I would not answer. Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking, early and late, day and night have I refused instruction, and would not be healed. And now, O my God, after all this rebellion and uncleannesse, wilt thou come and lodge with me? O Lord, where shall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and make ready for thee? <hi>What communion can there be betwixt light and darknesse,</hi> purity and pollution, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and deformity? O Rose of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron!</hi> thou undefiled and everlasting flower, the glory of the fields, and the first fruits of the dead, shall the wilde Asses and the beasts of the wildernesse feed now upon thee? Wilt thou give the bread of life unto dogs, and cast thy pearls before swine? O <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the lover and the redeemer of all humble and penitent souls! Thou that feedest among the Lilies untill the day breaks and the shadows flee, what is there in my heart where onely tares and thistles grow, that thou canst feed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115882:39"/>
upon? Thy blessed body was wrapt in fine and white linen, (which is the righteousnesse of the Saints.) It was laid in a new and undefiled grave, hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of a rock, wherein never man was laid before. But all my righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is a filthy rag, my heart neither new nor undefiled, but a nest of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean birds, where they have not onely laine, but hatched and brought forth their viperous young ones.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, dear God, I confesse with all my heart mine own extrem unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyness, my most shameful and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition. But with thee, O Lord, there is mercy and plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thou dost not use to reject and cast off those that unfeignedly repent and return unto thee; the great design and end of thine Incarnation was to save sinners: Thou hadst never come into this world, but for thy love to thy lost sheep, and those thou didst then love, thou dost love still unto the end. Thou didst not come unto the whole,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115882:40"/>
but to the sick. The first (had there been any such,) had no need of a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> and the last (hadst not thou come to restore them,) had perished for ever. It was thy gracious pleasure (while thou wert here in the world) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Publicans and sinners, and though thou art now ascended to thy Father, yet hast not thou changed thy nature. Thou art the same yesterday, to day, and for evermore. Thy life here was nothing else but a pilgrimage and laborious search after sinners, that thou mightst finde them out and make them whole. And how willingly (O blessed Jesus!) didst thou lay down thy robes of glory, and cloath thy self with flesh, that thou mightst after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lay down thy life a propitiation for our sins! How many scorching and wearisome journeys didst thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go for our sakes! How many cold and tedious nights didst thou watch and spend abroad in prayer, when the birds of the aire lay warme in their nests,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115882:40"/>
and thou hadst not a place to put thy head in! In the day time I finde thee preaching in the Temple, and all night praying in the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi>; a little after on thine own Sabbath travelling for me in the corne-field; Another time (wearied with thy journey) sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Well of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and begging a draught of that cold water from the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>; Now again I meet thee on the Asse, made infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by so glorious a rider, by <hi>the God of Ieshurun who rideth on the heavens, and in his excellencie on the skies.</hi> Sure, it was his simplicity and ordinary contempt with man, that made him so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thy sight. But (Oh!) with what language shall I attempt thy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? thy bloody sweat, thy deep and bitter agony, thy lingring peece-meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, with all the lively anguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and afflictions of thy martyr'd Spirit? O my most loving and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saviour! It is onely thy own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that can fully character thy own sufferings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115882:41"/>These miracles of love and most comfortable circumstances encourage me (O my God) to draw neer unto thee: for it is not probable that thou wouldst have subjected thy self to such bitter reproaches, blasphemies, and torments, had not thy love to man (for whose redemption thou didst suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them,) been as infinite as thy self; <hi>And greater love then this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> And lay it down thou didst, for <hi>no man could take it from thee.</hi> Thou couldst have commanded twelve legions of Angels from thy Father, and when thou wentest forth to meet thy murtherers, they went backwards and fell to the ground, and without thy permission (in whose hand their breath was) they could have done nothing. These mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful passages, together with thy own voice and frequent invitation much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to draw neer unto thee.

                  <p>WHen you have received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Elements, you should not presently after spit, nor eate and drink, but refraine untill they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly digested and resolved. You must lay aside all worldly communication, and humane discourses, though never so serious; for judge of your self, what an uncivil part it will be in you, when you have received so great a guest as <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> with all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to turne your back upon him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and neither to meditate of him, nor to discourse with him, and keep him company. Wherefore you should all that day be instant in prayer, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, thanksgiving, and good works;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115882:44"/>
you should consider and think upon the love of God, who so loved the world, that he gave his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son to redeeme it. You should me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon his birth, life, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and passion, his death and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, resurrection and ascension, and his second coming to judgement. You should pray, that you may be found blamelesse and without spot of him, and so much the more, because you see the day approaching. Tread not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood wherewith you are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and saved, by returning again to your former sins, like the dog to his vomit, but be sure that you walk wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fall not willfully into the myre. Be not regular and holy for a day or two, but all the dayes of thy life, and number thy dayes, that thou mayst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy heart unto wisdome. Cast thy bread upon the waters, (be merciful to the poor) and remember thy Creator, for the dayes of darknesse are many,

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115882:67"/>
the treasure of Christ laid up in earthen vessels; for amongst those Christians in <hi>Egypt</hi> I have seen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fathers who had here upon earth already begun the heavenly life; and regenerate Prophets who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued not onely with holy habits, but had received therewith the Spirit of promise: for I have known many of them that were so free from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, perverse thoughtfulnesse and suspition, as if they had never known that there were such evill wayes to be followed in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such a great tranquillity of mind, and such a powerful love or longing after goodnesse had wholly possessed them. They lived dispersed up and down the wildernesse, and separated from one another in several Cells or Cots, but knit all together in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bond of Charity. The reason of their distinct and distant habitations, was, because they would not have the silence of their retirements disturbed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115882:67"/>
nor their minds diverted from the contemplation of heavenly things by any noyse, sudden occurrence, or idle discourse; for this cause they have every one their particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, where with intentive or earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est minds they do (like faithful servants) expect and look for the coming of their Master. They take no thought for meat and drink and cloathing, nor for any such accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations; they seek onely the Kingdome of God and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse thereof, they fight with the weapons of prayer, &amp; being guarded with the shield of faith from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their spiritual enemies, so travel on towards their heavenly countrey.</q>
This was the <hi>old way,</hi> and whether we are <hi>in it,</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of it, is not hard to be decided.

we are within full of <hi>subtilty, malice, oppression, lewd opinions,</hi> and <hi>diverse lusts,</hi> is (I am sure) a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we are not onely <hi>out</hi> of it, but that we have no mind to returne <hi>into</hi> it. The <hi>way</hi> to heaven is <hi>wet</hi> and <hi>slippery,</hi> but it is made so with <hi>teares</hi> and not with <hi>blood</hi>; it is through the <hi>vale of miseries, and the raine filleth the pooles,</hi> Psal. 85.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any men, when a holy conversation and good works are proposed unto them, and when they are advised to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not to follow after the vanities of this world, are wont to question for what end, reward, or retribution shall they do so? The answer to these men must be this: Because it is written, <hi>that Eye hath not seen, not eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. Which words, because they cannot plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is meant by them, must be expounded to them by other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and it must be told them, that the reward which in the life to come shall be given unto those that serve God in this life, is, everlasting life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happinesse, never-ending plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and a fulnesse and sufficiency of all accommodations to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115882:84"/>
without any scarcity, or want at all. When these things are thus told them, they seeme to be (as they are indeed) very great, and very good. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that neither by this expression they do perfectly apprehend, what those things are which they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the life to come; nor can they of a sudden rightly perceive what is meant by a sufficiency of all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations without any want at all, they continue still in a doubtful minde, and are not effectually drawn to take any relish or delight in the things so told them. What course then shall we take to render these eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more relishing and delightful to them? I hold that the best way is, to feed them as Nurses feed their little children; who, (if at any time they give them a large faire apple, which for the tendernesse of their teeth, and the narrownesse of their mouths they cannot feed upon) cut it (according to the capacity of the child) into several
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115882:84"/>
bits or parts, and so give it them to eate by peece-meales.</p>
                  <p>We shall therefore divide this great sufficiencie of all accommodations in the life to come, into several parts or portions, that (by so doing) they may with those things we shall deliver be fed to eternal life. And because they may appear more plainly to them, we shall consider what those things are, which the minde of man most affects in this life; and by those, (as farre as we may) we shall make it evident that they shall enjoy them after a more excellent manner in the life to come: if being placed here in the midst of dangers and worldly temptations, they stick fast to the precepts of Christ; and when they have kept them, they will of themselves quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, that by no meanes they shall lose, nor be deceived of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their desires. This Course we shall take in the Explication of this Doctrine, and beginning with the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115882:85"/>
least, passe on to our desired end.</p>
                  <p>That we may then in the first place briefly summe up all those things which have reference to the body, I suppose them to be such things as are (indeed) desirable of themselves, and for whose service or use all other things are desired of men, and those are Beauty, Activity, Strength, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Health, Pleasure, &amp; Long Life. But if amongst these we have reckoned, there are some things, which the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have no respect to, but take special care to neglect and avoid them, as (for instance sake) beauty and pleasure are; yet do they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore despise them, because that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they affect them not, but because they would not offend God in them; for if they certainly knew that by caring for such things, they could not offend God, nor have their affections with-drawn from heavenly things, without doubt they would take more delight in the fruition of them, then in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115882:85"/>
a contrary state. These things being now thus premised, I shall as briefly as I may treat of every one of them distinctly, or by it self, and labour to demonstrate unto you (as God shall enable me) after what manner they shall be enjoyed by us after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body.</p>
                  <p>To begin then, <hi>Beauty</hi> is a certaine good, which all men naturally desire to have. But in the life to come the beauty of the righteous shall shine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with the Sunne, this the sacred Scripture testifies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father.</hi> Adde to this, that the body of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ (which none I hope will deny) shall out-shine the brightnesse of the Sun. But by the testimony of the Apostle <hi>we shall be made like unto him,</hi> for he saith, <hi>He shall change our vile bodies, that they may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,</hi> and this is the confession of that authority,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115882:86"/>
which to contradict, is blasphemy. Now if any man would have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to him by reason, I beleeve it ought not to seeme incredible to any, that the righteous in that life which is to come, <hi>when this mortality shall be swallowed up of life,</hi> shall shine as bright as the Sun, seeing they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>called,</hi> and truly <hi>are</hi> the temple and the seat of God himself, which (as I remember) is no where in sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture spoken of this visible Sun.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Activity,</hi> which is every way as desirable as <hi>Beauty,</hi> we shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with such a measure of it, as shall render us equall for swiftnesse to the very Angels of God, which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passe from the highest heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, and from the earth again into heaven; which swiftnesse, if it were necessary to prove it so in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, we might for instance produce that place of Scripture, where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the Angel of the Lord took <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the Prophet by the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115882:86"/>
haire of the head, and carried him through the vehemency of his spirit (when he was yet in the flesh) from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and having delivered the dinner unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> brought him again immediately to his own place. Therefore I say again, that a swiftnesse every way equal to that which is in them, shall be given to those, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in their lives here to be like unto them. The Apostle also, who affirms that our bodies shall in the twinkling of an eye be perfectly raised, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that our limbs be separated or dispersed one from another, and the distance of place never so great, hath thereby sufficiently proved, that our very bodies which in that day shall be raised incorruptible, shall be gifted with the very lame swiftnesse; for he testifies that <hi>this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. An instance or demonstration of this swiftnesse we have in the beams of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115882:87"/>
Sunne, which as soone as ever the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that Planet appears above the earth in the East, passe in a moment to the utmost West. By this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may conclude that what hath been spoken touching our velocity in the life to come, is not impossible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially because that animated bodies have in them a greater agility, then those which are inanimate. To this instance of the Sun-beams we may adde another of the like nature, which we have in our selves; for the beams or ray of the Eye, when we open our eye-lids passeth immediately to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most point of the Horizon or visible part of the sky, and when we shut them returnes wholly and unimpaired into it self. Again, it is a thing certainly known, that the souls of the Elect which are in the hand of the Lord, have not yet enjoyed the fulnesse of felicity, untill their bodies shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto them incorruptible; which when they shall enjoy, there will be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115882:87"/>
nothing more left for them to wait for and desire. But these bodies whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption they long and grone for if they would retard of hinder their swiftnesse, they would rather abhorre their fellowship, then long for it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain that such a swiftnesse or agility as we have spoken of shall be given us of God in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>The next thing we are to treat of: is <hi>Fortitude</hi> or <hi>Strength,</hi> which most men affect, as it is opposite to imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and faint-heartednesse. But they who shall be worthy to walk with the Citizens of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> shall excell so much in strength, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can have power to resist them: whether their desire be to remove, or over-turn any thing out of its station, or by any other way to divert it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder them; nor shall they in compassing their desire be put to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more trouble or pains, then we are put to at present when we move an Eye, or turne it towards any object we
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115882:88"/>
desire to look upon. But let us not in this place forget to instance in the Angels, to whom we labour in this life to assimilate our selves; for if in this branch, or in any of the rest which we are to handle, we can finde no other example or demonstration, we must apply to them. I suppose there is none will deny, but that the Angels excel so much in strength, as to be able to effect whatsoever shall be enjoyned them. But here some body may ask, of what use shall this fortitude or strength be unto us in that life; when all things shall be put in such perfect order, that there cannot be a better; when there shall be no need of mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eversions, or reformation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this fortitude or strength may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed? Whoever shall ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, let him attend a little to me, and consider what use we make at present of the faculties given us in this life; and he shall finde that we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes imploy some of those abilities
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115882:88"/>
with which we are now gifted in the body; as the faculty of seeing, our utmost strength, and our knowledge of some select things, with many more; In the like manner shall it be then with this fortitude we are now speaking of, for the onely possession of it will be an incredible pleasure and joy unto us, though we shall have no use for it, all things being (as it is said before) in the state of perfection. If this <hi>objection</hi> be made concerning <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,</hi> or any of the other <hi>branches</hi> which are to follow in this discourse; I hold this <hi>solution</hi> (if we finde not a better) satisfactory enough.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the fourth branch, which is <hi>Liberty,</hi> and is no lesse desired then any of the former. Whoever then shall leade and Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life here upon earth, shall without doubt be admitted into an equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Angels in heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as nothing can resist, hinder, or confine the Angels, but that they may
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115882:89"/>
passe freely through all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own desires; so shall there be no obstacle or restraint of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects: there shall be no inclosure that can hold us, nor any Element which shall not be pervious or passable for us, when, and how we please. An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and most certain example of this we have left us in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, to which blessed body (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirms) <hi>that our vile bodies shall be fashioned and made like, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.</hi> Now the Scripture beares record that he rose from the dead after the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre was made sure and sealed, and that he came in to his Disciples, the doors being shut upon them, and at the same time caused <hi>Thomas</hi> to thrust his hand into his side; all which (without doubt) was laid down for a strong and comfortable demonstration to us <hi>of the glorious liberty of the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:115882:89"/>In this fifth place comes <hi>Health,</hi> which of all temporal blessings is the principal, and the most to be desired. And of this what can be better said, then that which hath been already spoken by the Psalmist, <hi>The salvation of the righteous cometh from the Lord,</hi> Psal. 37. What infirmity then can lay hold upon those, whose health or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is from the Lord? But what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or similitude to introduce, whereby you may perceive what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of health that shall be which we are to enjoy in the world to come, I do not know; for neither I in my own body, nor the holiest man that ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the flesh, can finde in himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny state of health which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or liken'd to this eternal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible health. For in this life (when we finde our bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any paine or disturbance) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we are in health, and yet are we therein oftentimes deceived. For it happens very frequently that we are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115882:90"/>
infirme or sickly in some particular member, which yet we can by no means discover, but by motion of the said member, or by touching the place affected. But to come to those that are not thus affected, but seeme to themselves to be in perfect health, what shall we judge of them, that they are in health, or that they are not? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to thy self some one of a most healthful constitution, and that thou shouldst enquire of him concerning the state of his body: he will tell thee, that in his own judgement he finds himself in perfect health. But let his body be examined and felt with a little rigidnesse more then ordinary, or wring him hard in any part of it, he will presently cry out, forbeare, you hurt me. What is this? Did not he a little before affirme himself found, and being now but moderately touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth he cry out of paine? Is this man thinkst thou in health? Truly I think not. It is not then such a health
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115882:90"/>
as this (which is but a meere remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that they shall receive in the life to come, whose salvation is expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to proceed from the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>For God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there shall he no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more paine, for the former things are past away,</hi> Rev. 7. <hi>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, nor shall the Sun light on them, nor any heate, for God shall cover them with his right hand, and with his holy arme shall be defend them.</hi> What then shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hurt them whose covering and inclosure shall be the arme of God? But what manner of health that shall be, I know for a certain, that neither I, nor any man else, (either by my owne or anothers apprehension or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) can possibly expresse. If any man desires to know the qualities of Feavers and diverse other diseases, I can quickly satisfie him, as well by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115882:91"/>
experience I have had of them in my own body, as by relation from others; but that which neither by my own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding nor sensation I have never perceived, nor received any knowledge of it from another, how can I say any thing of it? Onely this I shall absolutely assert (and I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it) that this health of the life to come shall fill the whole man with such an immutable, inviolable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible sweetnesse and solace, as shall utterly repel and for ever drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all thoughts of infirmities, their accessions, or revolutions. And let this suffice to have been spoken of our health in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>The next branch that comes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be now spoken of, is <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which by another name, or definition rather, we shall call the <hi>Delectation</hi> of the corporeal senses. And this (truly) most men are very much taken with, because the corporeal senses in every man delight in those things which are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115882:91"/>
adjudged proper or peculiar to them, and withal beneficial or helpful. For (to instance in a few) the sense of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is much recreated or pleased with the variety of sweet and comfortable odours; the sense of tasting with the different relishes or gust of several meats, confections, and drinks. And all the rest (as every mans natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite carries him) have their several and different delights. But these dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations are not alwayes pleasing; na<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, they prove oftentimes distastful and troublesome to their greatest lovers, for they are (indeed) but transitory and bestial. But those delectations or pleasures which in the world to come shall be poured out upon the righteous are everlasting and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. And for this cause I do not see how it is possible to expresse them so, as to make them intelligible, or subject to our understanding in this life, especially because we cannot find in the pleasures of this life; any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115882:92"/>
or similitude which hath in it any collation with them, or can give us the least light or manifestation of them; for those heavenly delights, the more we enjoy them, will be the more deare and acceptable to us, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those joyes breeds no surfeit. And such delights as these are, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve no man ever in this world did so far perceive or taste, as to be able to describe unto others the true state or favour of them. Two blessed and two miserable states of man we know to be, the greater and the lesser. His great or perfect state of blisse is in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; his lesser is that which <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited, the joy of Paradise. As for his states of misery, his great and endlesse one is in the lake of fire and brimstone; and his lesser in the continual travels and afflictions of this present life. Now it is clear, that no man in this life (after <hi>Adam</hi>) did ever taste of either of those two states of blisse. But if we had tried or tasted
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115882:92"/>
of (onely) that lesser state of blisse which <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed in Paradise, we might then perhaps by the mediation or means of the lesser conjucture or guesse at the greater. As now being borne and bred up in the lesser state of misery, we can give many plain and convincing demonstrations of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition in the greater. Wherefore seeing the pleasure we speak of, is a branch or portion of that greater state of blisse, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of any possibility to expresse it, unlesse we may do it by some simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that are quite contrary to the greater state of misery, and drawne from the lesser. For example, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, let us suppose that there stood before us a naked man with hot and flaming irons thrust into the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his eyes, and into every part and member of his body, his veines, nerves and muscles, so that neither his marrow, nor his entrails, nor any the most inward and tender parts were
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115882:93"/>
free from the anguish and immanity of the torment, and that he were as sensible of the paine in every member, as he must needs be in the very balls of his eyes. What shall I say now of this man? is he not miserably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented? And who amongst these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed and ubiquitary paines thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted will be so irrational as to think that he can have any ease or pleasure? In the same manner, but by a quite contrary consideration may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture or guesse at the delectations and pleasures of the life to come; for as this man is filled and pained all over with torments, so shall ineffable and endlesse pleasures be poured upon, and over-flow the righteous. Their eyes, their eares, and their hearts, yea their very bones (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith) <hi>shall be glad and rejoyce</hi>; every part and every member of them shall be crowned and replenished with the fulnesse and the life of pleasures. Yea their whole man shall be truly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115882:93"/>
satisfied with the fatnesse of Gods house, and he shall make them drink of the river of his pleasures; <hi>for with him is the fountain of life, and in his light shall we see light.</hi> Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then is the happy man that shall be counted worthy to enjoy these heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, I cannot see (as to the comforts of the body) what more he can desire. The onely thing that (in order to what we are to treat of) shall be added to him, is long life. And this shall not be wanting there, for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour testifies, that the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Having done now with these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings bestowed upon the body, there remaine other more excellent gifts, which are every way as desirable, but these belong to the soul as the former did to the body. We shall reduce them all into seven principal heads, and here they follow, 1. <hi>Wisdome.</hi> 2. <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> 3. <hi>Peace.</hi> 4. <hi>Power.</hi> 5. <hi>Honour.</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:115882:94"/>
6. <hi>Security,</hi> and 7. <hi>Ioy.</hi> Our wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then, which in this life all men desire, and worthily too, shall be so great in the life to come, that nothing shall be hidden from us, that we have a minde to know; for we shall know all things, which God ordained to be known of man, as well those things which are past, as those which (in this world) are yet to come. There all men shall be known by every man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man shall be known by all men. Neither shall any one there be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what Countrey, Nation, stock or linage every one is descended; nay, he shall know all that ever we did in our life-time. Here some body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may say, how is this? shall all men know the secret sins that I have committed? Is my confession of them come to this? Is it thus that they are blotted out, forgotten, and never more discovered? Well, this is thy obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But when thou in that state of glory shalt stand in the presence of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115882:94"/>
God, purged from all thy sins, canst thou be unthankful to him for that great mercy shewed thee in the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all thy offences? And how canst thou be thankful, if none of those sins for whose forgivenesse thou doest owe those thanks unto him, will be left in thy memory? That therefore thou mayest for ever take delight in the singing of his prayses, thou wilt (I beleeve) have alwayes in thy mind those great transgressions and eternal miseries from which he delivered thee. Seeing then that the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all men shall (in that state) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine entire to them, I dare affirme that those sinnes for whose remission thou doest then give thanks, shall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be openly known, not to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but to the glory of God, and the mutual rejoycing of the Saints, for thou shalt be no more troubled then with the remembrance of thy sins, nor be any more ashamed of thy most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret transgressions, then any one is in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115882:95"/>
this life with the memory of some dangerous wounds or loathsome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease that he is perfectly cured of; or then we are in the state of men of those inconveniences we were subject to when we were little infants in our cradles and swadling-bands; for in that life when we shall be blessed with inviolable health, perfect purity, a full remission and most certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of all our sins, why should the memory or publike knowledge of them be any more grievous to us then his denying of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is now to <hi>Peter,</hi> or his persecution of him to <hi>Paul,</hi> or her sins which were many to that blessed Convert <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> with diverse others whose sins and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities are already in this world pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely known of all men? And besides all this, by this publike manifestation of sins, as of thy enormous and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some infirmities, the power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the great Physician will by all the Elect be so much the more admired,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115882:95"/>
praised and magnified; and the praise and magnificence of the divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (if rightly considered by thee) is thy glory. But thou wilt say, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent indeed that the praise of God is my glory, but when from all parts of the earth such an exceeding num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of innocent and righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (if compared to me) shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare there, who considering the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obscenity of my life, will (as it is most fit) abhorre me as a most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable creature, what shall I say then, seeing there is a reward as well for unrighteousnesse as for righteousnesse? Thy feare in these circumstances is needlesse, for it will be otherwise there with thee then thou dost suppose; for thou shalt finde, that those Elects which (in comparison of thee) thou dost hold righteous and innocent, will have no such thoughts of thee, as thou at present dost suspect. For they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first sight of thee, will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and consider, that by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115882:96"/>
those obscenities thou didst not sin against them, but against God. And when they see that God hath freely and fully forgiven thee, they will not so much as have a thought of abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or judging thee in the smallest matter; for they know, that if they should any way contemne or censure thee in that state,<note place="margin">What God hath cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, call not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.15.</note> wherein thou shalt be perfectly reconciled to the Father and all thy transgressions blotted out, they would thereby sin grievously against the Lord. They will therefore be the more thankful, and have in greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration the infinite mercy of God both towards thee, and towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Towards thee, because he brought thee up out of hell, and saved thee from thy greivous and crying sins. Towards themselves, because it was his free grace that saved and held them up from falling into the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities. By praysing God thus they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115882:96"/>
will magnifie and admire in thee after Gods goodnesse, his power and <note n="*" place="margin">Constantiam.</note> sure mercies by relying on which thou didst escape and get out of the pit of perdition; into which pit (had they been left to themselves) they would have fallen as well as thou didst; and here they will consider, that had they been in that dangerous state, they should (perhaps) have been utterly cast away, and not break the snare as thou didst. Thou seest now that a publike manifestation of thy sins will in the state of glory be no disgrace nor prejudice at all to thee, and how great a furtherance of divine praise and thanksgiving the knowne remission of them will prove. Yea, if the very Angels should reprove and censure thee (for the heynousnesse of thy sins) to be altogether unworthy of their society, yet hast thou left thee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry just reasons wherewith to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and defend thy self. And here
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115882:97"/>
perhaps thou wilt aske me, how this may be done? do but give attention, and I will tell thee. Suppose that any one of the Angels should rebuke, or upbraid thee in these words: <note n="*" place="margin">This is onely propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not asserted, nor (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) can it be, for our Saviour himself tels us, That there is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. and their song is, <hi>good will towards men.</hi>
                     </note> dost thou a fraile and mortal creature, made of the dust of the earth, and whose doome was to returne into dust again, after thou hast rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy Maker, and wallowed in all manner of sins and pollutions, seek now to be like one of us, who never in any thing resisted the divine will? To this Charge thou mayst answer thus. If I (as you say) have been formed out of the dust, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that (being driven up and down by every wind of temptation) I fell at last into the mire of sin; but afterwards (having first acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then believed in the mercies of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115882:97"/>
                     <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>) I did renounce and cast off all those courses which I knew to be contrary to his will, and exercised my self in all those wayes which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be well-pleasing unto him. I fainted not, nor refused to under-go and suffer for his glory diverse tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and distresses, in hunger, in thirst, in watchings, persecutions, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and manifold afflictions; And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utterly cast off and contemned all the pleasures of the world, I strongly endeavoured, and earnestly desired to be perfectly reconciled unto my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. But you never suffered any of these things for his sake, you dwelt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in glory, and the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; The arme of God alwayes sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended you from being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by any sinne, so that you were never stained with the least spot of it. Wherefore it is his owne free gift, whose hand with-held you from it, that hath kept you from falling away from his will. But because this way
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115882:98"/>
of reasoning may be onely used by those who have forcibly resisted their owne damnation, and taken the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven by violence; they that shall enter into it upon other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, must finde another reason by which they may claime a parity, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree of glory with the Angels: And if they desire to know what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reason that is, it may be this which followes: They may tell them that the ground upon which they lay their just claime to an equality of blisse with them in the kingdome of God, is the free mercy and donation of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; who for that very end vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to be made man, and to suffer death upon the Crosse, that being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our sins, and justified through his blood, we might be with him where he is, and be partakers of his kingdome; consider you therefore, if the blood of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which was shed for us is not a sufficient price for our salvation, and for an equality of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115882:98"/>
glory with you. What reply now can the Angels (who because they are good of themselves, will be therefore the sooner won with reason) make unto this? truly none at all, unlesse by way of Confession, that men redeemed with so high a price may justly claime and partake with them an equal glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When therefore both Angels and men, whom thou didst judge more righteous then thy self shall consent unto thy glory, and hold thee worthy in all things of those true and eternal honours conferred upon thee, consider (if thou canst) how acceptable and pleasing such a knowledge will be to thee, which shall make thee known to all men, and all men to be known of thee.</p>
                  <p>And shall not consequently out of that mutual and perfect knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise a certaine inestimable and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable friendship? which shall so warm the hearts of every one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the love which every one
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115882:99"/>
shall have for another, shall be evie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent and convincing in the knowledge of all. Neither do I see how it can be otherwise, seeing that all in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are but one body, and Christ himself (who is very peace,) the head thereof; neither will they with lesse affection imbrace one anothtr, then the members of one natural body are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one another. Thou wilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that state love all men as thy self, and every one will love thee as dearly as himself. O (now, thinkest thou,) how full of love shall I be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, if I were in that happy state? But passe by that Meditation, and consider him, by whose mediation and grievous sufferings all these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings were purchased for thee; and thou wilt then perceive that he will love thee incomparably more then any others; yea, more then thou canst love thy self; and so wilt thou with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inward, inexpressible delight come to love him more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115882:99"/>
yea infinitely more then thou canst love thy self.</p>
                  <p>But seeing it fals out very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst men, that those persons who continue in a reciprocal and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous love, do not in all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accord and consist, but differ in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and sometimes also in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, while that which seems right to the one, appears clean contrary to the other, and the one may affect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the other hath no appetite at all unto; It follows of necessity that to this perfect friendship in the state of glory, we must adde perfect concord or agreement. There will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such perfect agreement and unity there betwixt all, that none shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from that which another desires. As many as shall be counted worthy of that kingdome, shall be one body, one Church, and one Spouse of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and there shall be no more discord betwixt them, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the members now in the natural
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115882:100"/>
body. But as you see in the motion of the Eyes, that which way soever the one is turned, the other immediately followes, so whatsoever any one in that state shall delight in, he shall finde all the rest to consent to it. <note n="*" place="margin">Here the Translatour omitted some passages which he conceived not necessary, and perhaps they might be spurious.</note> Seeing then that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with all the Angels and Saints will be propitious and favourable to thy desires, it is cleare that thou wilt desire nothing which thou mayst not obtaine. So that in a modest sense it may be said, thou shalt be Almighty in respect of thy will, because the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God will in all things consent to it, for thy will shall be then his will, and his will shall be thine.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that they shall excell so much in power, there is no doubt to be made, but that an honour propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to that power shall be given unto them. Now what manner of honour that shall be, we shall labour
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115882:100"/>
to demonstrate by this following si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. Let us suppose there were laid before our eyes, some poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger destitute of all comfort, and smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in every part with ulcerous biles, corrupt sores, and all manner of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and having not so much as a rag to cover or defend him from the cold: If some mighty and mercifull King passing by, should look upon this begger lying in so miserable a condition, and having compassion on him, should give command to heale his infirmities, and being afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, should give order to have him cloathed with his own royal apparel, and being brought before him in that habit, should adopt him for his son, and give strict command that he should be received and acknowledged by all men for his son, and that he should be contradicted in nothing by any of his subjects, he having adopted him for his son, and made him coheire with his onely begotten, and calling
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115882:101"/>
him after his own name: You would easily grant that this were a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be conferr'd upon so despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and loathsome a begger. But all this and more will the merciful God most certainly confer upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servants; for of his own free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will he receive us, who being born of the corruption of the flesh are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with many miseries; in which we are estated as it were, and destitute of all comforts, but alwayes subject to, &amp; overcome by many noxious pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which fill us up with foule and ulcerous sins, and most odious corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from all which he will purge and heale us, and being restored to perfect health, he will cloath us with the ornaments of true righteousnesse and incorruption, and adopt us for his sons, making us his Consorts in his own kingdome, and coheires with his only begotten Son who is in every thing coequal with himself, <hi>changing our vile bodies, that they may be like unto his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115882:101"/>
glorious body,</hi> and commanding every creature to be subject unto us in all things, calling us also by his own name, and making us gods; for he saith in the Scripture, <hi>I have said you are all gods, and the sons of the most high.</hi> But he himself is the <hi>God deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and we are but <hi>deified,</hi> or <hi>gods</hi> made by him. But perhaps thou wilt say, This reason of mine may stand good in the Apostles and other holy Martyrs, but with thee who art a wretched sinner, and desirest onely to be the least in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou canst not see how it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. Give eare and understand, for God in that recited Scripture, <hi>I have said you are all gods, &amp;c.</hi> excepts none. But that thou mayst more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, Consider the nature of fire and of all things that are put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; if happily thou canst imagine with thy self after what manner, (in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree appointed for thee) thou shalt be glorified. The fire (thou seest) is but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115882:102"/>
one, and of nature hot; put into it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wood, or lead, or iron, or all these together; when the wood is turn'd into embers, so that nothing appears unto thee but fire, &amp; the lead so melted, that it cannot admit of a greater degree of heat, yet can neither of them be equall to Iron for an intense burning heat, which perhaps hath not yet grown red with the fire. Now although every one of these doth exceed the other, &amp; is of a more suparlative heat, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them (as we commonly say) is fire. So shall it be in that glorious society of the Elect, which we now speak of; For as those, who are neerer to the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> and therefore better then others, shall be called <hi>gods:</hi> So even those, who are inferiour to them, because they participate according to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the same <hi>Deity</hi> with those that are superiour, shall be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise honoured with the same title of <hi>gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:115882:102"/>When therefore together with so much happinesse, thou hast attained to so much honour, I do not see with what reason thou canst desire a greater Preferment. Whiles then thou art blessed with the possession of those high Benefits, which we have mentioned, wilt thou not think thy selfe sufficiently happy? Yes verily, thou wilt say, well then! but if thou couldst really injoy all those things as we have described them, but for one short <hi>day,</hi> wouldst thou not rejoyce? No question, but thou wouldst. But if thou shouldst injoy them for a <hi>moneth,</hi> or one whole <hi>yeare</hi> thou wouldst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce exceedingly: neither indeed do I thinke it possible to expresse thy manner of joy. Suppose then if thou shouldst possesse this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all thy <hi>life-time,</hi> what thou wouldst do. What price wouldst thou give for so great a Blessing? Even willingly all that ever thou
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115882:103"/>
hadst: nay, thy very owne selfe, if thou couldst purchase it at no other Rate.</p>
                  <p>But if besides all this Fruition, thou wert certaine also of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall security, and that all thy life long no accident whatsoever could rob thee of thy happinesse, I will not determine, whether it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for thee to imagine, how great thy joy would be. Seeing then that in the life to come, thou shalt live for ever, and together with the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all these things, thou shalt also be eternally secured from all danger of losing them, I beseech thee, how dost thou thinke it will go with thee? I beleeve truly, that at the very name of security, there springs in thee a certaine joy of heart, and thou dost greedily desire to know, whether thou mayst with safety, and for ever injoy such great and extraordinary Blessings? I tell thee then, if thou art like to lose
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115882:103"/>
these things, thou must either vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of thy owne accord relinquish them, or God must take them from thee whether thou wilt or no; or else another, who is more powerful then God, must rob thee of them in spite of God, and thy selfe. But certainly, neither wilt thou reject so great a Blessing, and relapse into those miseries from which thou hast beene graciously deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; neither will God at any time take that away which his large and mercifull goodnesse hath bestowed upon thee; nor is there any strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then God, who should be able to make thee miserablee against thy will, as long as God is thy Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Thou shalt therefore secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for ever injoy all these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, nor shalt thou feare the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of any, who would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprive thee of them.</p>
                  <p>What dost thou thinke then will thy condition be, when thou shalt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115882:104"/>
eternally injoy all these things; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Beauty, Strength, Swiftnesse of motion, Liberty, Health, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Length of life, Wisedome, Love, Peace, Power, Honour, and a Security of all, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed them: nay, above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Description or Conception, in a more glorious, and a more stately manner, then we can possibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. Will not thy condition be all Joy, which is the End and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of these Blessings? Verily I cannot see how that man should not abound with inestimable Joy, who is compast about with all the riches of eternall happinesse. Thou shalt therefore most certainly attaine to such a Joy, because nothing can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thee, that should minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Grief. For if thou hadst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friend, whom thou didst love as well as thy selfe, and in whose good thou wouldst rejoyce as in thy owne, and shouldst see this friend
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115882:104"/>
admitted to the same Heaven, and happinesse with thy selfe; wouldst thou not extremely rejoyce in his Felicity? But if thou hadst two or three, or more such friends, and shouldest see them all glorified with a state equal to thy own, would not thy joyes also exceed, and increase together with their number? And as formerly, when we discoursed of Love, we did there shew how all the Inhabitants of the world to come, should love thee as well as themselves, and thou on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shouldst love them as thy owne soul: How is it therefore possible for any man to apprehend the manner of that <hi>mutual Ioy,</hi> seeing there are there above a thousand thousands and ten thousand times hundreds of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands: nay, an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and all of them injoying the same Beatitude; nor is there any one of them, who doth not as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the happinesse of another,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115882:105"/>
as he doth in his owne. Moreover, they seeing God love them in a more excellent way then they love themselves, and againe perceiving themselves (after some inexpressible manner) to love God better then themselves, they do infinitly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in his Glory, and in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and inexpressible Joyes. They have Joy therefore within, and Joy without: Joy from above, and Joy beneath: In the Compasse, and Circuit of them there is Joy, and in a word every where.</p>
                  <p>And this (as we think, and as we have exprest our selves in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Book) is that thing which God hath prepared for those that love him, namely <hi>Ioy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my opinion, eternal Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or eternal felicity is nothing else but a sufficiency, or fulnesse of all good things, according to our own desire, and without any indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which felicity all the friends
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115882:105"/>
of God shall fully injoy in the life which is to come. For when we speake of good things, we do not say but that life eternal is farre more great and glorious then this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, which we have mentioned onely by way of Manuduction. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that the Just shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with so great a Felicity, it remaines on the contrary, that the unjust shall be visited with some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Infelicity. For as we have described the Elect according to those abilities which God gave us: namely that their Beauty, Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Strength, their Liberty, Health and Pleasure should render them Cheerful and Triumphant: So on the other side a certaine horrible, inestimable deformity, a dulnesse of motion and spirit, together with their Impotencie, and Captivity in Chaines of Darknesse, as also their Melancholy, and paine shall make the Reprobate to mourne and howle.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115882:106"/>
Verily that <hi>Length</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which the just shall most joyfully embrace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it conduceth to their fruition of eternal happinesse, will be very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a meere Curse to the unjust, because it exposeth them to an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse sense of ever-lasting tortures. If I look on their <hi>Wisdome,</hi> I know not what to speak of it, unlesse I say, that as to the just it will be great joy and honour, so in the unjust knowledge shall be turned into sadnesse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of spirit. As for Love, whereby the Saints of God shall be link'd together with joy unspeakable: It shall be a meer Affliction to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, for by how much the more they love one another, by so much will they be the more troubled one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers punishment. If it be question'd whether they may injoy any peace or concord? It is answered, they will be at discord with every creature, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature with them. Hence in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the power of the Saints,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115882:106"/>
the wicked shall be deprived of all power: They shall never be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any thing they would have, and what they can have, even that is it which they would not have. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked then instead of the honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happinesse of the Saints shall receive to their portion eternal shame, and now what more shall we say for a Conclusion to these things? Truly, that as the friends of God shall alwayes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the security of their everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beatitude, so the Enemies and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of God shall utterly despaire of any redemption from their endlesse Miseries: But in lieu of the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable joyes of the Blessed, they shall inherit unspeakable everlasting woes; especially such, who because of their impenitency for their sinnes, shall be condemned to passe into the society of Devils.</p>
