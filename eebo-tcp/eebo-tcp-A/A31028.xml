         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT this hath been all along, and ſtill continues, an Age of <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> as to the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Subjects mens Minds are converſant about, is too manifeſt to be diſown'd: Our <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new, that it bids defiance to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever helps the <hi>Ancients</hi> might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to aſſiſt us withall; ſcorns to ſtand upon their <hi>Shoulders,</hi> to take the better <hi>Proſpect</hi> of the <hi>Natural World,</hi> which our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> prudently did, and gratefully acknowledg'd; but, on the contrary, if we now ſtand ſo in any ſence, 'tis to trample upon, and contemn them.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48374:3"/>
and true apprehenſion of things they moſtly had before thoſe many fatal <hi>Joggs,</hi> and <hi>National Convulſions,</hi> that theſe bold Undertakers have the confidence of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet up their <hi>Stage</hi> again, make a <hi>Cant,</hi> and a <hi>Noiſe,</hi> with thoſe many <hi>Old Compoſitions,</hi> which from our former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience have prov'd moſt deſtructive both to Health and Life: And 'tis of moſt unhappy conſideration, that in this particular alone they ſhould have reaſon, take us in ſuch a careleſs indifferency as to thoſe former <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and <hi>Confuſions</hi> ſo long groan'd under, that we ſeem to have forgot, according to our aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd charge, not only <hi>God's Mercies,</hi> but our own <hi>Miſeries</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And from hence alone it muſt be, that the <hi>Prefacers</hi> to <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s Third <hi>Volume,</hi> boaſt ſo much of that reception the two former had met with.

the nauſeouſneſs of what was ſo earneſtly deſir'd, how loathſome and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious it prov'd, they will not be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by caution'd from fanſying ſomething elſe altogether as prejudicial: would any <hi>Phyſician</hi> of Reputation comply with a Patient in ſuch <hi>froppiſh</hi> Extravagancies; or wiſe, good man oblige a <hi>Friend,</hi> a <hi>Relation</hi> in the like unkind Conceſſions?

            <p>And really when I firſt undertook to defend our <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> wipe off that <hi>dirt,</hi> and <hi>obloquy,</hi> wherewith this <hi>Author,</hi> and his Friends deſign'd afreſh to bedaub the <hi>Sacred Memory</hi> of that <hi>excellent Prince,</hi> it could not enter into my thoughts, that they would venture further, at leaſtwiſe ſo far, as to write a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon his <hi>Murtherers,</hi> preſume or imagine it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet them in a <hi>true Light,</hi> who thorough all their actions, and enterpriſes whatſoever, were as <hi>black</hi> and <hi>dark</hi> as <hi>Hell;</hi> a <hi>Generation</hi> of ſuch profligate wretches, both in <hi>Morals,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> as no Age, or <hi>Government</hi> can parallel; ſo inſolently baſe, as neither <hi>Law,</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon</hi> could limit their <hi>Arbitrary Wills;</hi> and yet withall ſo deſpicably vile, as their own <hi>Creatures</hi> had them in equal contempt with all good men, and kick'd them down with an anſwerable Scorn.

               </p>
               <p>To come to their <hi>Preface,</hi> which good <hi>Books</hi> as little want, as good <hi>Wine</hi> a <hi>Buſh,</hi> they begin with a ſtale Common-place flouriſh <hi>of the Reception the other Volumes have found in moſt Parts of</hi> Europe, <hi>and the inceſſant Inquiries of divers Perſons of Worth and Honour concerning theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> &amp;c. What reception they met A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad I have not heard, to be ſure they are not yet tranſlated into any Foreign <hi>Language,</hi> and dare engage they never will: But that the <hi>Publiſher</hi> hath had a very good <hi>Market</hi> at home ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted, as well for what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerv'd, that this Age's vitiated <hi>Palate</hi> reliſh nothing more than ſuch crude unhealthy ſtuff, as feed the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> rather than nouriſh the <hi>Body;</hi> as likewiſe all Men of ſence, and ſober un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding were oblig'd to look into them, the better to refell thoſe many Cavills and Conceits wherewith every <hi>ſuperficial Reader</hi> is not more eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, than forward to impoſe upon others.

it may awaken ſuch as apprehend much better, would they exert their Parts, into a due conſideration of the <hi>Inſolence</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſs</hi> of this Faction when in Power, and that the ſame <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> poſſeſſing us once again, it would be <hi>more than ſeven times worſe than at firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing I muſt take notice of by way of <hi>Preliminary,</hi> as very artfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, by all the Modern <hi>Writers</hi> upon this Subject, they bend their whole force againſt Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> who writing at the beginning, or beſore the <hi>Wars,</hi> for ſo his <hi>Patriarcha</hi> was, proceeded upon one grand <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> which the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſimplicity of thoſe quiet times aſſented to for undoubted truth, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the acknowledgment of <hi>Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> with the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> only from thence diſcover'd may indeed be cavill'd at, but not diſprov'd; the <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> is this, That as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord</hi> of the <hi>V;niverſe,</hi> ſo here upon our little Spot, (this <hi>Ant-hill,</hi> as <hi>Lucian</hi> terms it, where Men creep up and down, and quarrel each other for every deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable clod) he delegated to Mankind a <hi>Superiority</hi> over all deſcended from him; by which means as they are not free to chooſe whatever <hi>Governors,</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> they pleaſe, ſo is there not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48374:7"/>
the leaſt danger of <hi>thraldom,</hi> or <hi>ill uſage,</hi> under ſo <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> an <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy;</hi> for the treatment of <hi>Children</hi> is quite different from that of <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Slaves;</hi> which our <hi>Republicans</hi> would moſt illogically inferr, and make much clamour about, vet nevertheleſs if the former the <hi>Children</hi> be untractable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in their duty, and bounden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; 'tis moſt incongruous to ſuppoſe, even from the dictates of <hi>common reaſon,</hi> they that gave them <hi>Being,</hi> ſhould be without a Power of Reſtraint, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll. This Sir <hi>Robert</hi> lays down as the <hi>Baſis,</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Regiment,</hi> from whence, as Mankind multiply'd, it grew up from <hi>Paternal,</hi> to <hi>Monarchical,</hi> where the People too much reſembling <hi>Children,</hi> of a <hi>froppiſh,</hi> unmanageable <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> 'tis equally reaſonable their Common <hi>Parent</hi> ſhould here likewiſe have a judgment of diſcretion, to <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> or <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent deportments: Now as this is the <hi>Origin</hi> from whence that worthy <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> deduceth all <hi>Government,</hi> ſo is it leſs liable to <hi>Exception, Oppreſſion,</hi> &amp;c. than any of thoſe popular <hi>Models</hi> this uneaſie Age is ſo fruitful of, and troubleſom with; but how readily any one may pervert anothers meaning, the common
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48374:8"/>
courſe of <hi>Controverſie</hi> unhappily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, where each one dreſſes up his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians,</hi> in the Skins of <hi>Wild Beaſts,</hi> or ſome ſuch like terrible ſhape, and then loo the <hi>Reader</hi> to fall upon, and devour them: whereas the foremention'd <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> taken in a candid and true ſence, as it gives no more Power to the <hi>Prince,</hi> than a <hi>Father</hi> hath over his <hi>Children,</hi> ſo is it moſt forward to grant all thoſe <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> theſe buſy Men make ſuch a noiſe and clamour about; only deſigns to give them a true Notion of the thing according to its <hi>Original,</hi> its <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> that ſo they might thankfully, and reſpectively enjoy them, without offending <hi>God,</hi> and diſturbing, or ſubverting the <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> of that <hi>Community</hi> wherein they live. Yet at the foremention'd ſevere rate is Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> treated, in the former of thoſe <hi>Two Treatiſes of Government;</hi> as if he deſign'd nothing but <hi>Slavery,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> to all Mankind, and that nothing leſs could be deduc'd from the <hi>Principles</hi> upon which he proceeds. And that <hi>Folio</hi> of <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> written upon the ſame Subject, By the <hi>Honourable Embaſſador of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of</hi> England, (a commendable <hi>Character</hi> for a Perſon of an <hi>Ancient,</hi> and

               <p>And here I cannot but propound one thing which muſt be acknowledged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that ſince there are a new Set of Men ſo earneſt to revive that old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of <hi>Commonwealthiſm,</hi> they would act ſo ſquarely, be ſo ingenuous, as to make an Univerſal Search into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conſider thoſe many <hi>Enlargements</hi> others have made upon the foremention'd <hi>Premiſſes;</hi> for Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> only brake the ice, was indeed the firſt who dar'd to <hi>Remonſtrate</hi> the curſed Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and horrid Impieties of that <hi>Rebellion</hi> they were run into; but, as already mention'd, writ only in general, according to the univerſally received <hi>Maxims</hi> of precedent Times, till the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> ſet up, the one for the <hi>Pope,</hi> the other for the <hi>People;</hi> and ſo turn'd all things topſy turvy.

                  </hi>quarrel went on with that of the <hi>Sword,</hi> and was much more ſucceſsful in every <hi>Engagement;</hi> it would be therefore no

What Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> hath likewiſe written of the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in his <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> is too clearly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them ever to meddle with. And to come to what hath paſs'd ſince the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> in 60; when <hi>Charles the Second</hi>'s unaccountable <hi>Remiſsneſs</hi> gave their <hi>Demagogueſhips</hi> an opportunity of

fermenting the People, to very nigh their 41 <hi>infatuations;</hi> among others, a very learned, and moſt accompliſh'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> writ a little Tract, call'd, <hi>Jus Regium,</hi> or the <hi>Juſt and Solid Foundations of Monarchy in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> &amp;c. which tho' calculated more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of his own <hi>Country,</hi> yet may it indifferently ſerve for the whole <hi>Iſland,</hi> with any other Part of the <hi>Civiliz'd</hi> World; this Piece more eſpecially is what I would provoke the whole Set of our reviv'd <hi>Rota Club</hi> to take notice of, and reply to, if they can; for 'tis writ both like a <hi>Divine,</hi> and a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> ſo conciſe, and yet withall ſo full upon each account, as nothing can be more exactly or clearly expreſs'd: He there makes it appear how impoſſible it is, that all the People in any Nation ſhould be brought to <hi>Conſult</hi> of their <hi>Publick</hi> concerns; yet every private <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> according to theſe pretended <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> this <hi>Popular Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>right,</hi> have an equal claim with the moſt Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical <hi>Pretender,</hi> and <hi>potior eſt conditio negantis:</hi> Obſerving further, that ſuch plauſible Intrigues have been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>wheadle</hi> of <hi>inſolent, factious Spirits,</hi> to delude, and engage the <hi>Rabbles</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſubverting the preſent <hi>Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

a clear Proof; the hot <hi>Lord Hollis,</hi> from the beginning a moſt violent <hi>Biggot</hi> in that <hi>Cauſe,</hi> would, to his dying day, among his Confidents, with great earneſtneſs of Paſſion, call <hi>Monk</hi> that <hi>Rogue,</hi> becauſe giving him and his Party a meeting at the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s, he promis'd to bring in the <hi>King</hi> upon the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> terms, and baſely fail'd them: Now as I believe on the one hand he never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to gratify them, if ſuch a Promiſe was made, ſo could he not, tho' really intended, have brought it about; for whatever his deſign was at firſt, and his cloſe deportment conduc'd not a little to what he accompliſh'd, the inceſſant <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> he met with from every corner of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> for a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> gave him full information, how the <hi>Nations</hi> Pulſe beat, and what alone would ſatisfie them, that is without regarding <hi>Parties,</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> to be as we were before fallen in pieces; and therefore to ſet the <hi>Saddle</hi> upon the right <hi>Horſe,</hi> the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Severity theſe Men charge the <hi>King</hi> withall, was really in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Majority</hi> whereof were a Set of as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy underſtanding <hi>Gentlemen</hi> as ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled upon that account, who reſolv'd to go upon the <hi>old Principle,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Nation</hi> upon thoſe well-pois'd, long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd

                  <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> which <hi>faction</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> had ſo fatally perverted: 'twas they were uneaſie at ſo general an <hi>Indemnity,</hi> thinking ſuch as had been accuſtomed ſo long in Miſchief, could not leave off play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>old game,</hi> without ſome further Security; 'twas they preſs'd, and brought on the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>

               <p>Thus have I run over and made ſome <hi>Remarks</hi> upon ſuch <hi>Inſtructions</hi> as our <hi>Prefacers</hi> thought fit to obſerve from this third <hi>Volume;</hi> not but they grant <hi>it doth afford many other more uſeful Reflections,</hi> which is the trueſt word hath come from them, and therefore having their leave, or at leaſt acknowledgment, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to cull out two or three, perhaps as <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to this World of ours, as any we have had from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Fanatick,</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> Party, were never without ſome <hi>Plot</hi> or

other, both at home and abroad againſt the <hi>Ancient Eſtabliſh'd Government,</hi> this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> this <hi>Tyranny</hi> of ours, as upon all occaſions they term it, ſince the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration.</hi> And this I fanſie hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a very blind ſide in the <hi>Author's</hi> Friends to make ſo Publick a Declaration, of what hitherto was kept a Secret: for till now all <hi>Plots</hi> were laid at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> door, they alone muſt be thought the continu'd Underminers of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> and accordingly we have had ſeveral <hi>Proſecutions</hi> againſt them, ay, and <hi>Executions</hi> too, upon the Evidence and Oaths of ſuch profligate Wretches, as ought not to have paſs'd for the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Dog:</hi> but ſuch a thing as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Plot,</hi> was not to be thought of among the holy <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> and <hi>Godly Party;</hi> they Diffented indeed as to <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> and tho' a <hi>King in our Iſrael, muſt have Liberty to do what ſeemeth right in their own eyes,</hi> and this is the utmoſt of their demand, a little <hi>Schiſm</hi> they muſt have, but for <hi>Sedition,</hi> being diſſatisfy'd with the <hi>Government,</hi> giving any diſturbance to the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> was never admitted into their thoughts, they were as innocent, as free from that, as ſo many <hi>two year old Devils:</hi> and tho' the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the very <hi>Partiſans</hi> engag'd, and their many <hi>Conſults</hi> in order to other <hi>Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances</hi> fully made appear, yet not taking effect, muſt not be believ'd, ſuch good People cannot be ſuſpected of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Deſign, unleſs accompliſh'd, and then 'tis <hi>God's cauſe</hi> and their <hi>glory:</hi> whereas this <hi>Author</hi> is very frank, and deals plainly in the matter; for tho' he had not fix'd his correſpondence in <hi>Sixty One,</hi> and will ſcarce credit that for which <hi>Overton, Desborough,</hi> &amp;c. were ſecur'd, becauſe his <hi>Excellency</hi> was not conſulted in the Matter. Neither doth he mention what <hi>Blood</hi> told him was deſign'd in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe that Fellow's reaching head diſcover'd how little he had of what his Party cry'd him up for; altho' it was about that time he tells, <hi>p.</hi> 118. <hi>

all which fair Proffers, this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>old Fox</hi> would not ſtir out of his <hi>Swiſs Den;</hi> and had reaſon, for tho' we grant his <hi>Brutiſh</hi> Courage fear'd a <hi>Sword</hi> as little as his Fellows, yet a <hi>Gibbet</hi> he could not digeſt: And further to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Prudence, in this his cautious deportment, he tells us, <hi>as the War was ended without the leaſt advantage to his Friends, or Cauſe; ſo he foreſaw it all along, that the Dutch were a mercenary People, and having ſecured their Trade, and other Advantages, made a Peace, ſo far from doing them any good, as on the contrary they promis'd to deliver up thoſe call'd Regicides into the hands of the King's Miniſters; and deal with all Perſons, who ſhould be declared Fugitives, or Rebels, in the ſame manner.</hi> A ſad Diſappointment this: may ſuch ever attend them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My next obſervation is an <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> of very nigh affinity to the former, viz. <hi>That men of Fanatick Commonwealth Principles, will never live quietly under any Monarchy whatſoever;</hi> let it be of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> nay, from their very ſelves, 'tis all one, they will ſubmit no longer than needs muſt, and be very uneaſie whilſt compell'd thereto; of all which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Characters,</hi> as well as <hi>Practices,</hi> which <hi>Ludlow</hi> and his <hi>Prefacers</hi> beſtows

upon it, are an abundant confirmation, for they vouchfafe it no other appellation than <hi>Tyranny,</hi> perfect <hi>Tyranny,</hi> in the harſheſt ſence the word is now taken, and that which all <hi>Free People</hi> ought to extirpate with the utmoſt abhorrency, and deteſtation: directly according with what I have already mention'd of their admired <hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Maxim,</hi> that the <hi>People are ſole Judges of their Superiors actions;</hi> and foreſeeing a very weighty Objection to lie in the way, <hi>ſuch a courſe would make the Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe, give occaſion of continual Tumults and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars;</hi> he very ſlightly replies, <hi>Civil War,</hi> in <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s <hi>account, is a Diſeaſe, Tyranny the Death of a State.</hi> Some other <hi>Authorities</hi> might have paſs'd better than <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s, but for want of better, his muſt ſerve the turn; had that unhappy <hi>Gentleman</hi> conſider'd his fate, it might have prevented his own, which tho' for nothing elſe, this dangerous Poſition moſt juſtly deſerves: that any man of ſence ſhould ſay <hi>Civil War</hi> is but a <hi>Diſeaſe!</hi> can any thing be more <hi>Mortal</hi> to a <hi>State?</hi> have not all <hi>Tyrannies</hi> commenc'd from thence? with unavoidable <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> to whatever People fall under that worſt of curſes: yet how far our <hi>Publiſhers</hi> have taken this infection, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48374:26"/>
in that they preſume ſo boldly to uſe the ſame <hi>Epithet, Tyranny,</hi> all is <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> with them, tho' never more was known, than from the no Conduct of ſuch raſh unexperienc'd <hi>Phaetons;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſſwade them from any future attempts, 'tis my deſire they would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr that <hi>Admonition,</hi> in their <hi>Cloſe</hi> given the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and apply it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (ſince altogether as agreeable) <hi>A Revenge taken againſt thoſe who will not let us poſſeſs all, is a ſlender Satisfaction for the hazard of utter Ruine.</hi>

His firſt entrance into the World, if common report may be credited, was as Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi>'s Man, for that I find his Appellation in all the Prints of thoſe times: and 'tis further ſaid, that by his inducement Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> engag'd on the <hi>Rebel ſide;</hi> but his grand advance was by marrying <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s <hi>Siſter,</hi> who finding him withall a <hi>Zealous Brother,</hi> made up of <hi>Faction, Sedition,</hi> and <hi>Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> countenanc'd him accordingly in all his Deſigns; for he was not only <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> of <hi>Angleſy,</hi> but <hi>Controller-General</hi> of all the Honeſt <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in <hi>North-Wales.</hi> Afterwards he was remov'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he behav'd himſelf as <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> uſe to do when got into <hi>Dominion,</hi> with a moſt <hi>Tyrannical Arbitrarineſs,</hi> no leſs <hi>moroſe,</hi> and <hi>ſevere</hi> than <hi>Ludlow</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who otherwiſe would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, a <hi>Relation,</hi> and <hi>Creature</hi> of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s.</p>

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48374:39"/>
and for his incouragement lent him 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon his ſingle <hi>Bond;</hi> perhaps he might have ſomething more of his own, but that was ſaid to be his principal <hi>Fund,</hi> which he ſo well manag'd, as to return about the beginning of our <hi>Troubles</hi> with an Advance of 8 or 9000 <hi>l.</hi> which made him, not only conſiderable upon the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> but a <hi>Recruiter</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> when moſt honeſt men were gone, or forc'd away.

I have been the more particular in this relation upon a double account; the one is to clear that great Man the <hi>Earl of Strafford,</hi> whom I have frequently found cenſur'd, by many otherwiſe his <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> for taking the Title of <hi>Raby</hi> to his <hi>Barony,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be old <hi>Vane</hi>'s <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Eſtate,</hi> whereas if taken when firſt made a <hi>Peer,</hi> it was not in his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; if otherwiſe, when <hi>Earl,</hi> the original Right continu'd in the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> might diſpoſe of the <hi>Honor</hi> to whom he pleas'd, as he had done before of the Eſtate; yet 'tis thought the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh old <hi>Secretary,</hi> for this reaſon, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ruine of that incomparable <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> as both he and his Son, conduc'd in many other things to that of their <hi>Maſter;</hi> may ſuch ingratitude in due time meet with an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Reſumption.</hi> The other thing I deſign'd to obſerve from the foremention'd relation is, that men of <hi>Commonwealth Principles,</hi> whatever noiſe they make of the <hi>Peoples Right, Liberty, Property,</hi> &amp;c. where-ever they get into Power, and Authority are more inſolent and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> than any ſort of Mankind; uneaſie <hi>Neighbours,</hi> griping <hi>Landlords,</hi> froward <hi>Maſters, exact</hi> from, and <hi>impoſe</hi> upon all they have to do with.

               <p>THE little now remaining of my promis'd Undertaking, relates to that Bulk of <hi>Letters and other Papers,</hi> which ſwell up this <hi>Third Volume</hi> to very nigh one half; and would they be ſincere, the true reaſon is, that this might bear proportion with the other <hi>Two,</hi> and keep up the <hi>Crown Price,</hi> although the freſh

how grofly His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was abus'd by that forg'd <hi>Commiſſion</hi> the <hi>Iriſh Rebels</hi> produc'd, and how villainouſly their <hi>Lieutenant-General Ludlow</hi> would have had Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> redeem his <hi>Life</hi> by charging it upon him; which that Man, as bad as he had been, had more Honour and Conſcience than to do; yet a <hi>Copy</hi> of this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is printed in the Collection, as undoubtedly ſo, though even their <hi>Memoir</hi> doth but ſay, the <hi>Iriſh pretended a Commiſſion from the King,</hi> pag. 19. Vol. I. and they knew it as certainly falſe, as we may them <hi>Lyars:</hi> but it helps on a Deſign, and that is enough.</p>
               <p>As for this laſt <hi>Volume,</hi> I find but one Paſſage wherein our <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, that is <hi>aſpers'd,</hi> for they never mention him but to that purpoſe, and this rais'd from his Correſpondence with the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Antrim,</hi> who, our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, was an <hi>Iriſh Prieſt, among the first in Rebellion there, ſeiz'd upon in</hi> London, <hi>upon</hi> Charles the Second's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, ſent Priſoner to the</hi> Tower, <hi>from thence to</hi> Ireland, <hi>and there ſet at Liberty by a Letter under the King's Hand, charging the Guilt of that Rebellion upon his Father, in that he affirms, the Earl of</hi> Antrim <hi>did nothing without Warrant and</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48374:57"/>
                  <hi>Authority from his Father.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Memoir,</hi> pag. 115. with ſome truth, but very little; for firſt, he was not ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> by the <hi>King's Letter,</hi> but they who charg'd, and caus'd him to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, not able to make good their <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> he became <hi>freed</hi> in courſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> is it ſaid he did nothing without <hi>Warrant</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>King his Father;</hi> the expreſs words of the <hi>Letter</hi> are, <hi>That what he did by way of Correſpondence or Compliance with the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebels, was in order to the Service of Our Royal Father, warranted by his Inſtructions, and that the benefit thereof accrued to the Crown.</hi> Col. p. 357. which how baſely our Author would pervert, as if his firſt engagement in the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued going along with them, were by the <hi>King</hi>'s Allowance, every eye may diſcover; whereas the words can be no further ſtretch'd, than that in proceſs of time, he was ſo ſenſible of his Folly, not to term it worſe, as he thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate for the ſame, by bringing over his <hi>Confederates,</hi> as many as he could, to their due <hi>Allegiance,</hi> together with <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And that this he endeavour'd, and was all the <hi>Good King</hi> encourag'd him in, or Authoriz'd him to do, will appear from theſe few Particulars I meet with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48374:57"/>
of his Undertakings. When the <hi>Scotch Covenanters</hi> firſt began their <hi>Stirs,</hi> I find this <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Antrim</hi> making a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal to the <hi>King,</hi> of a Deſcent from his County of that Name, or ſome other of the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and his ſeveral <hi>Dependents</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Deep-ſighted <hi>Strafford</hi> finding him unable to accompliſh what he promis'd upon<note place="margin">Nalſ.

                  </note> that account, it came to nothing; tho' doubtleſs he might produce ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>King,</hi> not without Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and kind Acknowledgements for his good intentions. The next thing I find him engag'd in, was more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, though not full up to what he promis'd. When the <hi>Soots</hi> came in 43. to the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> of their Fellow-<hi>Rebels</hi> here, the <hi>Noble Montroſs,</hi> then at <hi>Oxon</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> laid a Deſign of giving them a Diverſion in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> in order whereunto this Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> promis'd to ſend him Ten Thouſand Men out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and return'd thither to that purpoſe, as the other with great difficulty got into the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and there abſconded a conſiderable time in expectation of the fore-mention'd Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, wherein at length there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done, that is, Fourteen or Fifteen

Hundred Men, ſent under the Command of that Brave Fellow <hi>Mac Donald,</hi> which <hi>Montroſs</hi> augmenting with his ſeveral <hi>Clans</hi> there, perform'd thoſe many <hi>Noble</hi> Exploits recorded to his <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> And this <hi>Charles the Second</hi>'s <hi>Letter</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly related to, <hi>That he drew ſome Forces from</hi> Ireland <hi>for the Service of</hi> Scotland, <hi>pag.</hi> 355. 'Tis likewiſe ſaid in the ſame <hi>Letter, That he join'd with the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>in order to reduce them to their Obedience:</hi> And though it doth not expreſly appear as to any ſingle Circumſtances, for want of the <hi>Old King</hi>'s Letters to him, yet in general it may be concluded he was not ſo hot as the <hi>Prieſt-ridden Party</hi> there, but willing to comply with ſuch Conceſſions as the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> might grant.

abominable <hi>Aſſumings,</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious Rigours;</hi> all which appears from his Son <hi>Charles the Second</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> the only <hi>Authority</hi> they have for this wreſted <hi>Calumny;</hi> for 'tis there expreſly declar'd, <hi>That his Compliance with the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebels, was in order to the Service of his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the Benefit thereof accrued to the Crown.</hi> And upon a full, impartial Conſideration of that <hi>Letter,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> 
                  <q>will be found to have had very hard meaſure; for at his coming over, after the <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> upon Complaint of the <hi>Iriſh Deputies</hi> here at <hi>Court,</hi> that he was not worthy the leaſt Countenance from His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and that they had manifeſt, unqueſtionable <hi>Evidence</hi> of his <hi>Guilt,</hi> he was forbid the <hi>Royal Preſence,</hi> committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into <hi>Ireland</hi> for his <hi>Tryal</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> where, after many Months <hi>Attendance,</hi> and preſum'd <hi>Examination,</hi> he was diſmiſs'd without Cenſure; and without any <hi>Tranſmiſſion</hi> of Charge to us, was Licenſed to <hi>Tranſport</hi> himſelf into <hi>England:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>King</hi> thought in <hi>Juſtice</hi> he ought to be Heard by his <hi>Councel</hi> here, and producing the foremention'd <hi>Teſtimony</hi> under his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s own Hand, recommended him to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Claims,</hi> in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd

And here I had finiſh'd my own, and <hi>Readers</hi> trouble, but that a ſpiteful young Fellow, whom I took notice of in the end of my <hi>Defence,</hi> for defaming the Memory of our <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> in his <hi>Life of Milton,</hi> hath continu'd the like inveterate humour in another Piece which he terms <hi>Amyntor;</hi> where he ſo baſely catches at, and perverts every thing which in the moſt forc'd ſence that can be put upon <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Things,</hi> tends to diſorder, or otherwiſe diſturb thoſe <hi>Sacred Aſhes</hi> of his; an Action which among all the ſober <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> was look'd upon as the greateſt defection from <hi>Humanity,</hi> and what the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations were ſeldom guilty of. As to the Controverſie about his <hi>Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> it ſhall be wholly left to his worthy <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> who hath abundantly ſatisfy'd all Men that will be ſo.

               <p>My <hi>Exceptions</hi> ſhall commence at that which he takes againſt Mr. <hi>Blackall,</hi> for calling him the <hi>Beſt of Kings, and the Beſt of Men;</hi> which, he ſaith, Some, <hi>who otherwiſe honour the Memory of</hi> King Charles, <hi>are angry to hear.</hi> It ſeems this Gentleman is none of thoſe <hi>Some,</hi> and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48374:62"/>
if he had been pleas'd to tell us who they were, we might have been better able to judge of what degree their <hi>Honour</hi> was, real or pretended; for ſome may alledge a Reſpect to the <hi>Prince,</hi> on purpoſe to aggravate the Miſtake in the <hi>Preacher,</hi> or otherwiſe humour him who firſt found fault.

and <hi>Degrees,</hi> for an exact parallel; and comes to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans, many of whom,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>did infinitely excell him in all Moral and Heroick Vertues.</hi> A bold ſtroke this, and therefore he goes no further than the firſt daſh, tho' he could not but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we ſhould be deſirous to know who thoſe Perſons were, and wherein they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did him: Would he have had him imitate <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in their <hi>Self-homicide?</hi> or <hi>Naſcia,</hi> or <hi>Opinius,</hi> in cutting off the <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Gracchi?</hi> That indeed had not been amiſs; but neither our <hi>Laws</hi> nor our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> will admit of ſuch <hi>Heroicks;</hi> ſo that it had been properer to have continued in the <hi>Chriſtian Oeconomy,</hi> where, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him either as a <hi>private Perſon,</hi> or a <hi>Prince,</hi> few will be found to have come up to him, none out-done him, as ſeveral have made appear, who knew him better, and were much more competent Judges than this unthinking <hi>Prate-a-pace.</hi>

               <p>The Advantage likewiſe he thinks to take of Mr. <hi>Blackall,</hi> by fawning upon His preſent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> will return upon himſelf, in a <hi>grand defect both of that Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>manners and Juſtice</hi> he ſo falſly chargeth the other withal. <hi>Compariſons</hi> have been ever look'd upon as an odious way of arguing, at leaſtwiſe ought to be ſo manag'd, as the <hi>Diſparity</hi> may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48374:63"/>
upon the Perſon whom they would ſeem to advance. Now this bold Man need not be told, that <hi>Charles</hi> I. was His preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Grand-father;</hi> by which Relation, that of <hi>Royal</hi> was added to the Ancient <hi>Princely</hi> Blood of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;</hi> that he muſt needs be ſenſible what cruel meaſures he met with from a moſt <hi>perfidious</hi> Race of <hi>Rebels,</hi> who regarded nothing which their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> had eſteem'd moſt <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Religious;</hi> that the Principles upon which they acted, ſtrike at all <hi>Monarchy</hi> whatſoever; and that this Fellow includes a tacit Threat, in mentioning thoſe Defects wherewith the <hi>Grand-father</hi> was ſo falſly charg'd; as if, when they thought fit, or rather, could find a ſit opportunity, they would act over the ſame Part again: For 'tis all <hi>Tyranny</hi> with them; and whenever they promiſe any one to make him a <hi>Glorious Prince,</hi> 'twill be, as in the ſad Subject we are upon, by <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>

               <p>And this is what I am farther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, That all his Allegations are abſolutely falſe.

                  <hi>protected any of his Chaplains againſt the Parliament for Preaching up Arbitrary Power,</hi> nor was in the leaſt degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to any of thoſe reproachful Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions this <hi>Son of a Potato</hi> ſo impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runs on with, as the <hi>Juſt Defence,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in, makes appear at large, and thereto he is remitted: where likewiſe he may find Satisfaction in reference to the <hi>Letter</hi> ſent <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> XV. the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he was then in conſider'd, and with how great Prudence it was penn'd; which that vile <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in <hi>Defence of the Parliament</hi> 40, doth therefore add to, and alter moſt abominably.

               <p>The one indeed relates in general to all our <hi>Kings,</hi> from <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> downward, and perhaps in its <hi>Original</hi> Purport reaches as high as the <hi>King of Heaven,</hi> in this Man's bold Reflections upon that <hi>Divine Miraculous Gift</hi> which in the foreſaid <hi>Edward</hi>'s time was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and hath ever ſince accompany'd

Yet ſince he hath given me this Occaſion, I ſhall mention a <hi>Cure</hi> or two of our <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> which may not a little ſhock his <hi>Iriſh Infidelity.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48374:65"/>
eſpecially when brought nigher <hi>London;</hi> for during his Confinement at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> there were ſeveral <hi>Healings,</hi> where, his <hi>Chaplains</hi> not ſuffer'd to attend him, he perform'd the <hi>Prieſt's Office</hi> too: The whole was in this manner: The People kneeling down in two Rows, he went between them, and <hi>ſtroaking</hi> every one, us'd this expreſſion, <hi>I touch, God heal.</hi> A Perſon now living in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> by Name <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> was then touch'd by him, and gives this Account of himſelf, That he had been ſeveral Months, more than a Year, under the <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> hands with a ſore <hi>Arm,</hi> wherein were many <hi>Holes,</hi> and other ſad <hi>Breaches,</hi> ſo far from any thing of <hi>Cure,</hi> as he every day grew worſe, till having obtain'd the <hi>Royal Touch,</hi> his <hi>Sores</hi> dried up in a ſhort time, and he hath ever ſince, which is more than fifty Years, continu'd in a vigorous ſtate of Health, and freely ſhews the <hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Cavities</hi> in his <hi>Arm,</hi> to <hi>God's Glory,</hi> by the <hi>King's Means,</hi> when all others were ineffectual. What follows, is yet more remarkable: As they hurry'd His <hi>Majeſty</hi> from <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> in order to his <hi>Murder,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> a poor Man ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably over-grown with that Diſtemper, as his <hi>Face</hi> was all run over with <hi>Scabs</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48374:65"/>
and <hi>Blotches,</hi> preſs'd earneſtly to be <hi>Touch'd;</hi> but the cruel <hi>Soldiers</hi> not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him, and the <hi>King</hi> perceiving it, us'd this expreſſion, <hi>May God do for thee, though they will not let me uſe the Means.</hi> The poor Fellow went away without any hope of Redreſs, but coming at night to waſh his Face with a Water which ſome body had preſcrib'd him, he found none in the <hi>Bottle;</hi> and what was ſtranger, it ſeem'd to have been dry'd up by the <hi>Stone-Bottle,</hi> for that it was broke out into <hi>Scales</hi> and <hi>Blotches</hi> in every part, whilſt the Man's <hi>Face</hi> in a few Days <hi>dry'd up,</hi> and was perfectly well. Now before our daring <hi>Amyntor</hi> explode this, according to his no laudable Practice, let him ſend or go to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where, I preſume, the <hi>Bottle</hi> is ſtill in being, for the <hi>Wife</hi> is ſaid to be yet living, to be ſure all the ancient People in the <hi>City</hi> will witneſs it, and ſcarce a Perſon of any <hi>Quality</hi> in the whole <hi>Country</hi> but had the Curioſity to ſee it: Which brings on one Circumſtance more; A <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> among ſome other Strangers, having the <hi>Bottle</hi> in her Hand, broke off with her Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger one of the looſe <hi>Scales;</hi> the Man had immediately a little <hi>Scab</hi> roſe on his <hi>Lip,</hi> and not knowing what was done, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated with his Wife whether no body
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48374:66"/>
had hurt the <hi>Bottle?</hi> which ſhe thereupon was oblig'd to acknowledge. Dr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill,</hi> the famous <hi>Oculiſt</hi> at <hi>Sarum,</hi> did uſe to declare among his Friends, that he had often met with that Diſtemper in the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and was ſeldom able to maſter it; but finding the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Touch</hi> as ſeldom fail'd, advis'd all <hi>Patients</hi> which came to him in that Condition, to take that courſe of <hi>Cure.</hi> This I have mention'd, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the following Paſſage: Going, nigh Forty Years ſince, (for it was the Winter after the <hi>Reſtauration)</hi> from <hi>Deptford</hi> to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the <hi>Coach-man,</hi> upon ſome little concern of his own, ſtay'd at an <hi>Inn</hi> or <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> on the Way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in our Company ſaid there was a <hi>Woman</hi> in that Houſe well worth our taking notice of, for that ſhe was cur'd of a <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> by wiping her <hi>Eyes</hi> with a <hi>Handkerchief</hi> dipp'd in the <hi>Blood of the Old King.</hi> Being call'd, ſhe own'd the thing, which two or three more in the Family teſtify'd.

going through the tedious <hi>Forms of Law,</hi> in ſo clear a <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ſuch a <hi>Bill</hi> had been ever proper, 'twas here: but the generality of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were then grown ſo <hi>experimentally Wiſe,</hi> and thereupon <hi>Conſiderate,</hi> as to abhorr what they had ſeen ſo fatal in the Caſe of <hi>Laud,</hi> and <hi>Strafford,</hi> with number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs other <hi>Arbitrary Exorbitances,</hi> which many of themſelves had moſt ſadly felt from every prevailing <hi>Junto.</hi> Upon which account, great care was taken that the whole <hi>Current of Affairs</hi> ſhould be brought into the old <hi>Channel;</hi> no Man queſtion'd either for <hi>Eſtate</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> but according to the <hi>immemorial <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages</hi> of our <hi>Anceſtors;</hi> and this was done with all Exactneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, againſt ſo horrid, and withal ſo ſo <hi>unprecedented</hi> a Fact, as the like was never ſeen nor heard of among the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men.</hi> And that now, after nigh <hi>Forty Years,</hi> this <hi>Regular Procedure</hi> ſhould be arraign'd, baſely repreſented, and the <hi>worthy Judges</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> impudently <hi>ſlander'd,</hi> in the <hi>Remains,</hi> forſooth, of a <hi>Party</hi> ſo deſperately engag'd, as, had he not fled from <hi>Juſtice,</hi> would have been one of the firſt brought under its moſt deſerved Severity, is not a little ſurpriſing; and yet to make it more, all this is made <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> by a <hi>Cabal of Men,</hi> with ſuch high <hi>Elogium's</hi> upon their <hi>Perſons,</hi> and tacit
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48374:73"/>
                  <hi>Juſtifications</hi> of their <hi>Treaſons,</hi> as if none but <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Regicides</hi> were worthy to Govern the <hi>Nation:</hi> And this may add a further Surprize yet, that ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Inſolencies ſhould be ſo tamely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, as if we had a mind once more to come under their <hi>cruel Clutches;</hi> which, could the Innocent eſcape, ſhould never be my concern, to ſee befall ſuch as might prevent it if they pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The only thing therefore I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recommend, is a <hi>cautious Diſtruſt</hi> of whatever theſe <hi>Part-taking Hiſtorians</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the World; that we would <hi>Try their Spirits</hi> in a <hi>Civil</hi> as well as <hi>Religious</hi> ſence, by which means it will ſoon appear how much they have, in each reſpect, of the <hi>Old Phariſee,</hi> the <hi>painted Sepulchre,</hi> with a great deal of <hi>flouriſh</hi> and <hi>poſitive Oſtentation</hi> to ſet themſelves of; whereas, upon a thorough Search, there is nothing to be found underneath but the <hi>rotten Bones</hi> of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> of <hi>Fraud,</hi> and <hi>Factious Deſigns,</hi> a reviving <hi>ſtale Lyes</hi> to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>freſh Miſchiefs.</hi> And were this Courſe truly taken, would our <hi>Politico's,</hi> now-a-days ſo numerous, go to the <hi>bottom</hi> of Things, not content themſelves with a <hi>ſuperficial View,</hi> it would much abate their <hi>Critical Severities</hi> upon the <hi>Royal Cauſe,</hi> the Management of <hi>Affairs</hi> during thoſe miſerable Diſtractions of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48374:74"/>
                  <hi>Anarchy.</hi> When the <hi>Battle</hi> is fought, and <hi>Day</hi> loſt, every Pretender to the <hi>Blade</hi> will be forward to tell, at leaſt gueſs where the <hi>Courage</hi> or <hi>Conduct</hi> fail'd; who, had they been in <hi>Command,</hi> might have ſhown greater Defects upon each account. With as little regard to <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are the foremention'd <hi>Tranſactions</hi> moſt raſhly run down; ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſum'd to conſider either, on the one hand, how difficult the <hi>Steerage</hi> was in thoſe <hi>rough Seas;</hi> nor, on the other, how much they expoſe themſelves to the next <hi>Generation</hi> for greater <hi>Defects</hi> in much calmer <hi>Weather,</hi> when all thoſe violent <hi>Storms</hi> of <hi>Popular Rage</hi> and <hi>Zealous Frenzy</hi> are much abated, and with due Application might have been quite <hi>down;</hi> neither can it be otherwiſe expected, but that <hi>After-days</hi> ſhould be as forward as ours, and perhaps with more Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect what <hi>no Advances</hi> we have made upon many <hi>great Advantages:</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Religion</hi> hath been ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to run <hi>a-float,</hi> as 'tis now ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to retrieve her from being <hi>loſt;</hi> and in what Poſture our <hi>Civil-Adminiſtrations</hi> ſtand, we may not, but they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to <hi>judge.</hi>
