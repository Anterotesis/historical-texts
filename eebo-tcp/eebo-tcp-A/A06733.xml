            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For I doo not vvell knovve, yf any thing may any vvhere be found, meete to beautifie a common vveale, that iustly may be counted to lacke in you, so plentifully hath GOD poured his blessinges vpon you. VVho is able to expresse, vvhat a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornamente, precious ievvell, and noble ouche, Christian doctrine is, to a Christian common vveale? The sage and prudent Philosophers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvyse and expert men of this vvorlde, iudged these common vveales most blessed, happy, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, most noble, beautifull, and florishing, vvhere the Princes and Rulers thereof, vvere eyther Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, or studious of Philosophie. But hovv much is that common vveale to be counted happy and blessed, vvhere not humaine Philosophie, vvhether
<pb facs="tcp:11125:3"/>
vve respect naturall, or morall, but diuine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, brought from the hie Heauens, by him vvhich is the vvysdome of the father, prospereth, florisheth, triumpheth: vvhere also not vaine and curious Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, but true, faithfull, and godly Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers raigne, and beare rule? VVhatsoeuer the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers taught, although neuer so much enforced vvith sugred eloquence, probable reasons, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent argumentes, it vvas the fruite of the earth, and of mans braine: but that vvhiche Christe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs, came out of the bosome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that looke hovve much the noble Heauens surmount &amp; passe the vile &amp; base Earth in higth, &amp; indignitie: so much, and incomparable vvyse more, doth the heauenly Philosophie, vvhereof the holy Ghost alone is the aucthour, exceedeth the earthy Philosophie, vvhereof man is the deuiser. He that cometh from an high, sayth that blessed Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, is aboue all.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> He that is of the earth, is earthy, &amp; speaketh of the earth.

He that hath receiued his testimonie, hath set to his seale, that GOD is true. For he vvhom GOD hath sent, speaketh the vvoordes of God. VVhat other thing is this diuine Philosophie, vvher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of vve novve speake, then the holy vvoord of God? And vvhat other are these faithfull and godly Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, then the true preachers and professours of the sacred Scriptures? All these are to be founde among you plentifully. The Christian Philosophie, I meane the vvoord of GOD, raigneth, ruleth, and triumpheth among you, so that according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:11125:3"/>
to it, all things are ordered among you in that your Tovvne. In other places, this diuine and Christian Philosophie, is counted heresie, nevve learnyng, straunge doctrine, the mother of errours, the cause of rebellion, sedition, insurrection, &amp;c. and the plaine subuertion of common vveales: but vvith you, &amp; that most iustly it is reperted &amp; taken for the alone trueth, for the ancient doctrine of the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, Prophets, and Apostles, for the mother of all godlynes and vertue, for the onely &amp; alone cause of vnitie, concord, quietnesse, amitie, obedience, and for the alone stay, vpholding, and maintenance of all Christean, and vvell ordred common vveales, so that vvhere this is not, there is a Chaos, and plaine confusion of thinges. This holy vvoord of GOD among you, svvimmeth not in your lippes only, but it also shineth in your lyfe and conuersation, vnto the good example of all them that are conuersant vvith you. By this vvoord, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of GOD geuen to Iosua, ye do not only frame your ovvne life, but ye also gouerne your Tovvne, and iudge al causes that come before you, as a rule, from the vvhich it is not lavvfull for you by any meanes to depart. Of this vvoord ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently talke, commune, conferre, sing, and haue continuall meditation, as your chiefe ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> This vvoord is vnto you, that noble treasure hydde in the Feelde, the vvhiche a man found and hydde, and for ioy thereof, goeth and selleth al that he hath, and byeth the Feelde. This vvoord is to you more svveete, then the Hony, or the Hony Combe, and more precious then Gold, or Precious stone. And as this most blessed and holy vvoorde
<pb facs="tcp:11125:4"/>
dooth occupie the principall and highest place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you: so haue you both godly professors, and faithfull preachers of the same, vnto the great ioy aud singular comfort of all the inhabitauntes of your Tovvne. For as there can not be a greater ievvell in a Christian common vveale, then an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest faythfull, and constant preacher of the Lordes vvorde: so can there not be a greater plague among any people, then vvhen they haue raigning ouer them blind guides, dumme dogges, vvicked vvolues hypocriticall hyrelinges, popishe Prophetes, vvhich feede them not vvith the pure VVheate of Gods vvoord, but vvith the VVoormevvod of mens try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling traditions, and vvith the sovvre leauen of the Papisticall Pharisees, as Salomon sayth: VVhen the preaching of Gods vvoord fayleth, the people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, and come to nought. Veryly as there is not a greater blessing geuen of GOD to any nacion, then the gift of his vvoord: so I knovve, not yf a greater cursse from GOD can be cast vppon any people, then vvhen the vvoord of GOD, and the true preaching thereof is taken avvay from them, as these vvoordes of GOD spoken by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,<note place="margin">Amos. 8.</note> doo manifestly declare. Beholde, the tyme commeth (sayth the Lorde GOD) that I shall send an hunger into the earth, not the hunger of bread, nor the thyrst of vvater, but an hunger to heare the vvoord of the LORD: so that they shal goe from the one sea to the other, yea from the North, to the East, runnyng about to seeke the vvoord of the Lorde, and shall not finde it. In this behalfe therfore, are ye the inhabitauntes of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviche greatly blessed of the Lord our God, vvhich
<pb facs="tcp:11125:4"/>
hath not onely very richelv geuen you his vvoorde to be preached, taught, and read among you, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hartes to receaue and beleeue the same, as yf vve reade of Lydia,<note place="margin">Actes. 16.</note> vvhose hart (sayth blessed Luke, the Lorde opened, that shee attended to the thinges vvhich Paul spake. Out of this your feruent zeale and burnyng loue tovvard this diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philosophie, many godly and Christen fruites of Gods spirite, haue issued and plentifully come foorth, as brotherly concord, and vnfained ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among your selues, not your selues onely, but also among all the inhabitauntes of your Tovvne, so that all contention, strife, debate, discord, emni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, variaunce, tumultes, quarelles, lavvynges. &amp;c. banished, and auoyded: beneuolence, loue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, agreement, vnitie, amitie, freendship, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, humanitie, and vvhatsoeuer maketh vnto the bond of peace, ruleth and raigneth among you, vvhich godly vnitie and concord dooth so euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare you to be of God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.</note> as nothing more. In this shall all men knovve, that ye are my Disciples (sayth Christe) yf one of you loue an other. As dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord bringeth al thinges to hauocke: so dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord conserue, keepe in good order, and make to increase vvhat so euer is good and profitable to a common vveale, or to any part thereof. As Salusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us sayth: By concord, small thinges encrease and grovve: but by discorde, mighty and great thinges decay, and come to nought. It vvas very vvittely and learnedly ansvyeared of Terence, vvhen the noble Senate of the most noble Romanes demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him after the destruction of Carthage, vvhat he thought to be the cause of the subuertion if so

ample, populus, and florishing citie, vvhether the puissaunce of the Romans, vvhose force seemed to be incomparable, or the feeblenesse of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenses not being able to resist, No, sayth he, neyther your valiance, nor our vvant of puissance, vvas the subuersion of our citie, but the discorde of the Citizens. The mightiest fortresse, and strongest Bulvvarcke, that eyther Citie or Tovvne can haue, is the concord of Citizens, vvithout the vvhich, all puissaunce, all force, all vvytte, al pollicie, all castels, all martiall armonies are vayne, and vnprofitable, verely in this behalfe, are ye also greatly blessed of God, vvhich both in godly &amp; vvorldly affaires, are of one mind, &amp; of one meaning, vvithout al diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion among you. O blessed fruite of Gods spirite. Moreouer, hovve idlenesse that chiefe maistres of vices all, vtterly exiled, and banished out of your Tovvne? No man liueth there idlely.

And he that hath meate, let him doo likevvise. Certes diligent, and vertuous trauaile, vpholdeth the Citie: but idle and sluggysh hands, roote vp the foundacions thereof.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, vvho can yenough prayse and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

commende your studious, carefulnesse, and painefull trauaile, in making prouision for the poore members of Christe, vvhich haue not of them selues, vvhereof to liue?

He that hath the substance of this vvoorld, and seeth his brother haue neede, anb shutteth vp his compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, hovv dvvelleth the loue of God in him? Vnmercifulnesse tovvard the poore, vvas one of the chiefe causes, vvhy that florishing and to much vvealthy Citie Sodome (as the Prophet tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) vvas destroyed vvith fire, an brimstone from heauen.<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> Verely euen so contraryvvise, vvhere the vvorkes of mercie are diligently practised vpon the poore, there is the blessing of God, conseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tovvne, or Citie, encrease of goodes, and fortunate successe in all honest and godly trauayles, as Salomon sayth: He that geueth to the poore, shall not vvant. He that lendeth to the Lorde, that shevveth mercie to the poore, and it be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to the vttermost, as our Sauiour Christe sayth: Geue, and it shalbe geuen vnto you: good measure, and pressed dovvne, and shaken togeather, and runnyng ouer, shall men geue into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes: For he that geueth but a cuppe of cold vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Christes sake,<note place="margin">Luke. .6.</note> shall not loose his revvard. Yf thou vvylt breake thy bread to the hungry, sayth GOD by the Prophete,<note place="margin">Esay. 58.</note> and leade the needy vvay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man into thy house, &amp; couer the naked man,
<pb facs="tcp:11125:6"/>
and not turne avvay thy face from the poore: thy lyght shall breake foorth as the mornyng, and thy health florishe right shortly: yea, thy righteousnesse shal goe before thee, and the glory of the Lord shal embrace thee. Then yf thou callest, the Lord shall aunsvvere thee: yf thon cryest, he shall say: Here I am. O blessed is the man, sayth the Psalmographe, that considereth the poore and needy: the Lorde shall deliuer him in the time of trouble. The Lorde shall preserue him and keepe him aliue, that he may be blessed vpon earth, and not be deliuered into the vvyll of his enimies. The Lorde shall comfort him, vvhen he lyeth sicke vpon his bedde, yea and make his bedde in his sieknesse.</p>
            <p>Agayne, vvhat shall I speake of your gentle and louyng enterteynement of strangers and forreners, vvhich for the testemony of Christes most glorious Gospell, and for the quietnesse of theyr conscience, that they may the more freely serue GOD vvith a pure mind, are not only content to suffer vnvvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy banishment vvith the losse of their goodes, but also day and nyght to labour vvith their ovvne handes for their liuing, that they may be no burden to any man. These most vvyllyngly and gladly ye admit, receaue, and embrace, cherishe, entertayne, and comfort. These ye lodge &amp; place among you, not as strangers, but as Citizens, not as forreners, but as your dearely beloued Christian brothers: for vvhom also ye are no lesse carefull then for your selues, that nothing be lacking vnto them, but that they may haue sufficiently of all good and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thinges. This is the true hospitalitie, I meane, the gentle enterteynement of godly straungers, vviche
<pb facs="tcp:11125:6"/>
are afflicted for the vvordes sake. Of these speaketh GOD on this manner:<note place="margin">Exod. 22. Leuit. 19.</note> Yf a straunger soiourne vvith thee in your land, ye shall not vexe him. But the stranger that dvvelleth vvith you, shalbe as one of your selues, and thou shalt loue him as thy selfe. Of these speaketh Christ on this vvyse:<note place="margin">Matth. 25. Romans. 12.</note> I vvas har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourlesse, and ye tooke me in. Of these speaketh Saint Paul thus: Distribute to the necessitie of the Saintes.<note place="margin">Hebru. 13. Gene. 19. 1. Peter. 4.</note> Be redy to harbour. Agayne, Be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull to lodge straungers: for there by haue diuers men lodged. Angels vnvvares Of these speaketh S. Peter on this sort: Be ye harberors one to another vvithout grudging.<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. and. 23. Deut. 24. 1. Tim. 4. Titus. 1.</note> Of these speaketh Saint Iohn on this manner. Thou dooest faythfully, vvhatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou dooest to the brethren, and to the straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Of these, GOD in his lavves geueth a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charge both to the riche men, and also to the Byshoppes and spirituall Pastors of his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they should see to them, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for them, that they lacke nothing. Highly in Gods fauour must the godly straungers be, seeing GOD geueth to his people so great charge ouer them. VVho therefore can othervvyse, then highly commend the louing gentlenesse, and gentle loue, the bounteous liberalitie, and liberall bountie, vvhich ye shevve to the poore scattered members of Christe? These be vvoorthy fruites of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. These vvoorkes shevve, that ye haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the grace of God in vayne: and that ye be not of the company of those Gospellers, vvhiche vvith their mouth professe GOD, but vvith their deedes deny him, being abominable, and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and vnapt vnto euery good vvoorke. Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
<pb facs="tcp:11125:7"/>
or rather peruersers of the Gospell, are like to that Sonne, vvhich promised his father to vvork in his Vineyard, and vvrought nothing at all. Yea they are,<note place="margin">Iude. Epist.</note> as Saint Iude termeth them in his Epistle, cloudes vvithout vvater, trees vvithout fruite, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vvaues of the sea, foming out their ovvne shame, vvandring starres, to vvhome is reserued the mist of darknesse for euer, fleshely, hauing no spirit. &amp;c. and in deede like to those fiue foolish Virgins, vvhich had Lampes,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> but in theyr Lampes no Oyle, and not vnlike to the Figge tree vvithout fruite, vvhich Christ cursed for her barrennesse.</p>
            <p>But God (right vvorshipful and dearely beloued) hath geuen you an other minde, and grafted in you a better spirite, that yee do not only knovve God, but also earnestly labour to do his holy and blessed vvill, that by this meanes, yee may be founde not only fauorers, but also follovvers, not only talkers, but also vvalkers, not only louers, but also liuers, not only professoures, but also practisers, not only vvorders, but also vvorkers of the holy scripture, and so become blessed, as our Sauiour Christ saith. If yee knovve these thinges, and doo them, blessed are yee. For not euery one that saith vnto me Lord, Lorde, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the vvill of the father, vvhich is in heauen, he shal enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Yee are my freendes, yf you doo those thinges that I commaunde you. He that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and keepeth them, he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me.<note place="margin">Romans. .2.</note> For in the sight of god, as The apostle saith they are not righteous, vvhich heare the lavve, but the doers of the lavve shall be iustified. If any man
<pb facs="tcp:11125:7"/>
be in Christ,<note place="margin">Galat. 5. Ephe. 2.</note> he is a nevve creature. They truly that are Christes, haue crucified the flesh, vvith the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and lustes. VVe are the vvorkmanship of God, created in Christ Iesu vnto good vvorkes, vvhich God hath ordayned, that vve should vvalke in them.<note place="margin">Tit. .3.</note> Let our eares learne saith Saint Paul, to excell in good vvorkes, as farre foorth as neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that they be not vnfruitefull.<note place="margin">Ioan. .15.</note> Herein is my father glorified (saieth our Sauiour Christ) that ye beare much fruite, and become my Disciples. Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordayned you to goe and bring foorth fruite, and that your fruite should remaine.</p>
            <p>Goe therefore foorth (right vvorshipfull and dearely beloued) as ye haue begun, in the vvay of righteousnesse. Receaue the Gospell of Christe, vvhich is the vvorde of your saluacion, and bread of life, vvith greedy, and desirous mindes. Call on God dayly (as ye doo) vvith feruent prayer, and cease not to be thankfull vnto him, for his benefits. Be an example in life and conuersacion, to them that are vnder you. Seke the quietness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of your Tovvne, and of the inhabitauntes of the same, rather then your ovvne gaine, and profite: study rather to be loued, then feared. To the vvicked and sinfull, be seuere and sharpe: but to the good and godly, be gentle and louing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your goodnesses and liberalitie to the poore strangers vvhich are exiled for the testimony of the Lorde Iesus, and tender them, as your selues. Suffer not idlenesse to creepe vvithin the bounds of your tovvne, but rather prouide that al be vvell &amp; vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously occupied. Of the poore, haue diligent consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:11125:8"/>
but as for the sturdy &amp; lasie lubbers, vvhich gladly lyue of the labour of other mens handes, and hate to be vvell occupied them selues: eyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to vvoorke, or els banishe them your tovvne. Looke diligently to the bringing vp of your youth, eyther in good letters, or els in some vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercices, that in time to come, they be not vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members of the common vveale. But aboue all thinges, see that they be brought vp in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and feare of the Lorde, and in the knovvledge of his holy vvoord, that they may learne euen from their Cradles to serue their Lorde GOD in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of the Lorde. And that this thing may the more conueniently be brought to passe, as ye haue earnestly entended, and to that end haue prouided large summes of money among your selues: so vvith al expedition prouide, that your Schoole may be erected and set vp, for the godly and vertuous education of your youth. So shall you both doo a noble sacrifyce vnto God, deserue vvell of many, and also leaue to your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie a vvoorthy monument of a most vvoorthy enterprise. And to helpe forvvarde some poynt of godly doctrine to be taught in your nevve erected Schoole. After I had finished this little treatise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, The Demaundes of holy Scripture, I thought it not vnsitting, nor vnvvorthy our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to dedicate the same to your vvoorships, and so by you, to commend it to the Christian youth of your Schoole. In it they shall learne to knovve and vnderstand, the principall and cheefe poyntes of Gods doctrine: so that by this meanes they shal be able to render a reason both of theyr fayth, and
<pb facs="tcp:11125:8"/>
doctrine, vvhich they professe, and not be like Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; Mules that haue no vnderstanding. The book is little, yf the number of the leaues be considered: but yf the matter therof be diligently pondered, it shalbe found both great, &amp; profitable. Thus for this present, taking my leaue of you, I vvysh to you, and to the vvhole Tovvne, all good and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous things, both for your bodyes &amp; soules, most humbly beseeching God, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe that good vvoorke, vvhich he hath begun in you, vnto the glory of his name, &amp; vnto the profite of his holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.

That God punisheth sinne with losse and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both of body &amp; goodes, with sicknesse, pestilence, and such other (none I thinke doubteth) but that he punisheth sinne by sinne, and sinne by errours and heresies: the worlde can not so clerely perceiue. Howe be it Paul,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> doth playnly declare it, where he sayth: because the Gentils tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the glory of God, and worshiped the creature more then the maker, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith he) God gaue them vp vnto shameful lustes, &amp;c. Which iustes be there straight after expressed. And this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I meane to punish sinne by sinne) is a very sore punishment.</p>
            <p>He punisheth sinne by errours and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies thus. When the word of God is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously and sincerely preached (as it is nowe) and yet men still kicke against it, or in case many receiue it, yet fewe or non regard it, or liue according to it, but with their wordes make on it only for a fleshly libertie: then (I say) God taketh his word away from thence (as who be not worthy of it) and letteth the worlde preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his preachers, and suffreth Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe
<pb facs="tcp:11125:17"/>
(who must nedes succeede Christ) to kill them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> so that Antichriste peaceably enioyeth his kingdome (as he hath doone all ready this great while) and he must needes haue like doctrine to him selfe. So did he punishe the Iewes his owne elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people at sundry times more then .ii. M. yeere,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note wel.</hi>
               </note> and suffered them to worship false Gods, or els to set vp their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions, Gods preceptes neglected. So also hath he punished our fore fathers these viii. or ix. C. yeeres. And now except we thankefully receyue his woord, and liue thereafter in the newnesse of life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we are called (no doubt of it) he wyll, not only revolue and cast vs downe againe to our old ignoraunce, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie and bondage: but also shortly take such vengeaunce on vs, as he threatened Bethsaida, Corazin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nowe God remitteth the crime, gylte, and trespace to his electe through faith in Christe: but he reserueth (after a certayne manner) a little porcion of the paine (not to counterpeise therewith, or satisfy his iustice for the crime, as the Byshop of Rome with his complices hath taught vs
<pb facs="tcp:11125:18"/>
this great while) but to chastise their flesh with all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth sinne in this worlde, not after thys life in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, as the Papis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes faine.</hi>

               <hi>What is the Supper of the Lord, or the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ?</hi> Bread and Wine consecrated, that is to say, made and appoynted of God to bee a Sacrament to put vs in rememberance, that as the bread is broken, and the wine powred out: so Christes body was broken, and his blood shed for our redemption. And as the bread receaued through our mouth, and digested in our stomacke, driueth away our hunger, and norysheth our body: the wine likewise receiued and digested quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth our thirst, and quickeneth our bloud: so Christes bodie and bloude receyued by fayth, digested with worthie continuaunce therein, not disagreeing from the right
<pb facs="tcp:11125:40"/>
receyuing thereof, slaketh our hunger and thirst, that is to saye, our emptynesse of grace, and drynesse of fayth, nourysheth and quickeneth both our bodye and soule, making vs partakers of the whole merites and dignitie of the bodie and bloude of Christ. And as the bread of many granes is made one loafe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> and the wyne pressed togither of sundry grapes: so wee being many, are one body in Christ: And bicause we are of his body, we must needes also be quickened by his bloude, and lyue of hys spirite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remayneth there the substance of breade and wine after the wordes of consecration (as they terme them) or but the accidentes of them onely, as the authors of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation haue heretofore taught?</hi> If the substaunce of breade and wyne shoulde bee denied to remayne in the Sacrament of the bodie and bloude of Christ: so shoulde it cease to be a Sacrament.

To declare that bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth after the wordes of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Saint Paule calleth it breade di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times, as we may see in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.20.</note> S.

Therefore as for the rest, they be not aptly called Sacraments.

               <hi>What is humilitie?</hi> A subiection of the proud hauty courage of our mind, shewing our selues inferior to all men, presuming in nothing, esteming our selues worse then all men in our owne conceates. And this is that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note> which the apostle saith. In gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing honor goe one before an other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, be not hye minded, but make your selues equall to them of the lower sorte. Be not wyse in your owne conceates. Hereto agreeth the saying of S. Peter: submit your selues euery man one to an other. Knit your selues togeather in lowlynesse of mind.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> For God resisteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble. Submit your selues therefore vnder the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you when the time is come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is pacience?</hi> Willingly without resistance eyther in thought word or deede to suffer vndeserued punishment after the example of Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.</note> which prayed for them that persecuted and moste cruelly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. This pacience is described of S.
<pb facs="tcp:11125:47"/>
Peter in his first Epistle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> where he sayth: seruauntes, obey your maisters with feare, not only yf they be good and courteous, but also though they be froward. For this is thanke worthy, yf a man for conscience toward God endure griefe, and suffer wrong vndeserued. For what prayse is it, yf when ye be buffeted for your faultes, ye take it paciently. But and yf when ye doo well, ye suffer wrong, and take it pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then is there thanke with God. For hereunto verely were ye called: for Christe also suffered for vs, leauing vs an example, that we should follow his steppes, whiche did no sinne, neyther was there guile found in his mouth: which when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe: when he suffred, he threatned not, but committed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vengeance to him that iudgeth righteously &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the olde man, that we must put of?</hi> The naughty, corrupt, and rotten nature, which sithens the fall of Adam we haue lineally at our first generation recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of our parentes through the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first roote Adam. Or thus: the noughty concupiscence, lust to sinne, and affection of our fleshe, without faith, of this
<pb facs="tcp:11125:47"/>
olde man speaketh our Sauiour Christ on this maner:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.</note> That which is borne of flesh is fleshe. And except a man be borne from aboue, he cannot see the kingdome of god. Also the Apostle:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.</note> Laye from you the olde man, which is corrupt according to the deceauable lustes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.</note> Againe, put of the olde man with his workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the newe man, that we must doo on?</hi> The renewyng of man by fayth and the word of God: the spirite of God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Christ our spirituall and second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: Agayne, to tame the old man our fleshely and first Father Adam: to beget vs agayne and adopte vs to God, whiche Spirite we receaue by Christ at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Of this newe man speaketh our Sauiour Christe thus:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.</note> That whiche is borne of the spirite, is spirite. Also S. Paule: Be renued in the spirit of your minde, and put on the newe man, whiche after God is shapen in righteousnesse and true holynesse.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.</note> Againe: put on the newe man, which is renued in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and image of him that made him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is it to denye our selues?</hi> Playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to professe, that all our laboures and
<pb facs="tcp:11125:48"/>
works profit nothing vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to slea the old Adam with al his lusts &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is it to forsake all that we haue for Christes sake?</hi> To esteeme al that we haue not to be ours for his sake, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly (if neede so require) for the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his name to depart from wyfe, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, parentes, freendes, countrey, house, landes, and all thinges els that we doo or may enioye, yea and to put our selues in danger of all perill for the name of Christ, and profession of the Gospell. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth father or mother more then me (saith Christ) is not worthy of me. And he that loueth sonne or daughter more then mee,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 10.</note> is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his crosse and followeth me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life, shall lose it:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.</note> and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall finde it. Agayne, if a man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wyfe and children, and bretheren or sisters, yea &amp; his owne life also: he cannot be my disciple. And whosoeuer doth not beare his crosse, and come after me he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my disciple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the crosse, that we must take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:11125:48"/>
on vs?</hi> Any sorow or payne that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to any vocation or trade of life for the tryall and profe of our faith and pacience. Also it is the correction, chastening rodde and staffe of the Lord, wherewith he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth them, whome he loueth, not to theyr damnation or vtter casting away from his fauour, but to saluation, and to teach vs to flye vnto him in our trouble &amp; aduersity, as children to our most deare &amp; louing father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is ment by the name of the Lorde whose glory we must set forth?</hi> The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, prayse, wysedome, might, power, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, honor and maiestie of the Lorde. Or the knowledg, preaching and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his holy worde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the temple of the holy Ghost?</hi> An honest, godly, and faithfull christian hart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4.</note> in the which God is rightly worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in spirite and truth: wherein are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red spirituall sacrifices of prayse, innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thankes geuing, of an humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hart, whose chiefe corner stone is Christ. Knowe ye not, saith Saint Paule, that ye are the temple of God, and howe the spirite of God dwelleth in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man defile the temple of God, him shall

God destroye. For the temple of God is holy,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> which temple ye are. Saint Peter also sayth: Ye as liuing stones are made a spirituall house, an holy Priesthode, for to offer vp spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the kingdome of heauen?</hi> The kingdome of heauen is diuerslye taken in the Scriptures. First, for the holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and worde of God, bicause that is the scepter and yron rodde, whereby God ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, reygneth, and dwelleth in the hearts of the faythfull. Of this kingdome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Christ in the Gospell on this wise: I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 16.</note> that is to saye: I will commit vnto thee the office to preache the Gospell of saluation, which openeth and vnlocketh vnto men the waye and doore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</note> by the whiche they may be saued, and enter into the kingdome of heauen. Item, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is lyke vnto leauen, which a woman tooke and hydde in three peckes of meale, tyll it were all leauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note>Secondlye, the kingdome of heauen is taken for fayth it selfe, as Saint Paule
<pb facs="tcp:11125:49"/>
sayeth: The kingdome of heauen is not meate and drinke, but righteousnesse, and peace, and ioye in the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>Thirdlye, the kingdome of heauen is expounded the whole congregation of the faythfull abyding in this lyfe, in whome the Lorde by his worde and spirite, doth inuisibly dwell and reygne. Of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome speaketh Christ in the Gospell on this maner:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</note> The kingdome of heauen is lyke to ten virgines, whiche tooke their lampes and went to meete the Bryde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome. Fyue of them were wyse, and fiue were foolishe. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthlye, the kingdome of heauen is taken for the ioye, felicitie, and pleasure, which the soules of the beleeuers enioye, when they are departed out of this world: and their bodies also ioyned with the soules at the day of Iudgement shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, euen in that place, which Christ hath prepared for them to possesse: where they shall bee comforted with the sight of his Maiestie and Godheade, and with the fruition of his perpetuall felicitie with him. Of this kingdome speaketh Christ in the Gospell: When ye shall see Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb facs="tcp:11125:50"/>
Isaac,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.</note> and Iacob, and the Prophets, in the kingdome of God, and you to bee driuen out of the dores.</p>
            <p>Finallye, the kingdome of heauen is wheresoeuer Gods worde is preached: from which kingdome they onely are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 8. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 10. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 19.</note> whiche beleeue not the worde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this saying of Christ: He that is of God, heareth the wordes of God. But yee heare not, bicause yee are not of God. Agayne, My sheepe heare my voyce. Item, Euerye one that is of the truth, heareth my voyce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What meanest thou, by a lande that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with milke and honie?</hi> Pleasaunt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things, both sweete and profitable. By the honie is vnderstoode sweetenesse, ioy, gladnesse, and pleasure. By the milke, pure nourishment, whereby we still continue, growe, and increase in fayth and godlynesse vnto the measure of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When shall we enter vppon, and enioye this kingdome, this promised lande, that floweth with milke and honie?</hi> The church militant in this worlde, gouerned by the spirite of their most mightie, valiant, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
<pb facs="tcp:11125:50"/>
and triumphant Captayne Christ already enioyeth after a certayne maner in spirite, thorowe fayth in this kingdome and blessed lande, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: He that beleeueth on the Sonne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.</note> hath euerlasting life: Hee that beleeueth not on the Sonne, shall not see lyfe, but the wrath of God abydeth vpon him. But when they are ioyned togither both bodie and soule with the reast of the faithfull congregation, which are departed out of this world in the faith of Christ, to make one whole tryumphant congregation, when they haue by the power of Christe conquered the malignant church of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which shall be at the last day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we doo dayly looke for nowe in these latter times: then shall they true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly enioye and possesse all the ioyes and pleasures of that most ioiful and pleasant lande:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm.</hi> 17.</note> whereof Dauid speaketh on this manner: I beleeue to see the good things of the Lorde in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Nowe we see in a glasse, sayth the Apostle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> euen in a darke speaking: but then shall we see face to face. And as S. Iohn saith: It dooth not yet appeare
<pb facs="tcp:11125:51"/>
what we shall be. But we knowe, that when it shall appeare,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3.</note> we shall be like him. For we shall see him, as he is. The eye hath not seene,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>What callest thou the latter times?</hi> The first times were vnder the lawe of nature, till the lawe of Moyses. The seconde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe of Moses, till (the kingdome thereof abolished) Christ entred into this worlde. Nowe the thirde and last time is, and hath bene, sithence the entring of Christ into this worlde, to take out fleshe vpon him, by ioyning in him togither both Godheade and Manheade with an vnseparable knotte to reconcile and knitte togeather God and man, nowe that all the prophecies &amp; figures of Christ be brought to an ende. The last times also are the times, that goe immediatly before the day of the Lord, and ende of the world.

Notwithstanding although the holy Scriptures doe passe ouer with silence the certaintie of the time when

Christ shall come to iudge the worlde, as a thing more curious than profitable for our saluation, that by this meanes wee might set our selues in the more readinesse against his comming,<note place="margin">

For in whatsoeuer true religion, christian example, godly inuention, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enterprise coulde be beneficiall, in that haue they all ioyntly, and seuerally eche, by doctrine, practise, wit, with paynfull and no lesse chargeable endeuour, serued, if not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied thy godly contentation. And for that in doctrine, all thinges are written for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, rightly to vnderstande, faithfully to beleeue, and readily to confesse that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of hope which we haue, demaunde who will frende or aduersarie, aunswere who shall skilfull or vnlearned: to eche of these Christian dueties, with respect of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

But I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with alas. What is it to talke rightly or smothly, and to walke crookedly? Is not the sweete Christian harmonie in consent of saying and doing? For what discorde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth eyther of these by it selfe, or what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement? To apply or pleade very olde and almost deade example, hath some force to vice or vertue, in priuate talke, or publike sermon. And the late allegations of Fraunce or Flaunders, purporting noueltie, doe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily quicken our dull sense of hearing: but the home made mention of our familiars, whose affection doth it not moue to eyther side? What can you more greedily heare, or I long, as with child, to tel. The great grace and gift of God on Sandwich towne, by the sound of the Gospel, hath it wrought in vain with the townesmen? are they taught wel, &amp; not wel gouerned? shew thei forth gods prais with mouth, and plucke it down with hand? or rather they expresse their fayth by their works, and their works by faith, in brotherly
