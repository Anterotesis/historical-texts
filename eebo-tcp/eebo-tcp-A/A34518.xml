            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Complaint being made to the Common Council, of ſeveral Enormities committed by the Farmers of the City Markets, the ſaid Court did then appoint a Committee of Four Aldermen and Eight Commoners, or any One of the ſaid Aldermen and Two of the ſaid Commonets, to be a Committee to conſider of the Abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and of Methods to Redreſs the ſame, and to Report the ſame to the ſaid Court; which ſaid Committee did often meet, and made ſtrict Enquiry into the Abuſes committed by the ſaid Farmers, and did on the 29th of <hi>July</hi> following, make a Report to the Common Council, which followeth in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in Common Council Aſſembled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Obedience to an Order of this Honourable Court, bearing Date the 29th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, We whoſe Names are hereunto Subſcribed, being of the Committee appointed to Conſider of the ſeveral Abuſes committed by the Farmers of the Markets, and of the Methods for the Redreſs thereof, have ſeveral Times met and conſider'd of the ſame; and have Examined the preſent Rates received by the Farmers of the ſeveral Markets, <hi>(viz.) Newgate, Honey-Lane, Stocks</hi> and <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Markets; and do find, as they ſtand now Lett by the ſaid Farmers, to amount to 6379 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> and for Proviſions, Fruits, and other Wares brought to and ſold in the ſaid Markets, and in the Streets 4516 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> in all 10896 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> which ſaid Sum of 10896 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> we are o<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>  Opinion, they do Yearly receive: Beſides which, we alſo find, that the ſaid Farmers have recived of the preſent Tenants 2194 <hi>l.</hi> 01 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> by way of Fines for Admittances.</p>
            <p>We have alſo Conſidered and Examined the Leaſe Granted to the Farmers, and likewiſe the Act of Common Council made in the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>William Hooker,</hi> and do find, that they have exacted greater Rents than in the ſaid Act is mentioned.</p>
            <p>We have alſo ſeveral Times heard the Complaints of the Market People, Inhabitants and others, and do find, That the ſaid Farmers have taken from them greater Rates than they ought to have done, Extorting the ſame by all the ill Uſages imaginable, as by putting them to vexatious Suits, Arreſting, Impriſoning, and Ruining many of them, and thereby have forced them from the ſaid Markets, which have very much Inhanced the Rates of Proviſions, and made them the more ſcarce.</p>
            <p>And alſo find, That the ſaid Farmers have turned, and allowed others to turn, the Market-Houſes, and a great number of Stalls and Standings into incloſed Shops, many of which are Lett to ſeveral Traders, to the great Prejudice of the Houſe-Keepers and Freemen of this City, which might be much better Employed in the Sale of Proviſions; others of the ſaid Shops are Lett to Butchers and Huckſters, which very much encourage Regrating and Foreſtalling of Proviſions, and the Advancement of the Prices thereof.</p>
            <p>We humbly conceive, That great Sums are Exacted by way of Rents and Fines, and are yet undiſcovered, through the Dread many of the Market People were under, of being farther Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Farmers, in Caſe the City did not give them Relief.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, We are of Opinion, That the preſent Farmers have Forfeited their Leaſe by Non-Payment of their Rent, and by Converting the Markets to other Uſes than ought to be by the Covenants contained therein; and that, according to a Proviſo in the ſaid Leaſe, Five Shillings may be tender'd to avoid the ſame accordingly, and that the ſaid Markets may be managed by a Committee, according to the aforementioned Act, which We humbly conceive will tend much to the Advantage of the City, and the Eaſe of the People concerned; All which we humbly ſubmit to the Wiſdom of this Honourable Court.</p>

            <p>And likewiſe, That the Farmers of the ſaid Markets have Covenanted in their Leaſe, That in caſe they or any of them ſhall at any time (during the Term thereby demiſed) Exact or Take any greater Rates or Duties than are limited and appointed by the aforeſaid Act of Common-Council, they or ſome of them ſhall pay to the City, for every time they ſhall fo Exact or Take, the Penalty of <hi>Ten Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that if the ſaid Farmers, or their Aſſigns, ſhall Require and Receive more than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aforeſaid Rates, or Diſturb the <hi>Market-People,</hi> who have paid or tender'd the ſaid Legal Rates, in the quiet Selling or Expoſing to Sale, according to Law, their Commodities; It is Recommended to the Parties grieved, to apply themſelves to the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> of this City, for Redreſs; And to give Notice thereof to this <hi>Committee,</hi> that they may be proceeded againſt according to Law, and the Covenants and Conditions of their Leaſe.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Committee</hi> being determined, and no Regard had to the Proſecuting of their begun Reformation of the <hi>Abuſes</hi> then complained of, the greateſt part of them are ſtill continued, to the very great Oppreſſion of the Poor <hi>Market-People,</hi> and Inhancing of the Prices of Victuals Sold in the ſaid Markets.</p>

And if it be anothers Town, and the ſame be done by the Lord of the Town, the King ſhall do in like manner. And if it be done by a Bailiff or any mean Officer, without the commandment of his Lord, be ſhall reſtore to the Plantiff as much more for the outragious taking, as he had of him if he hath carried away his Toll, and ſhall have forty days Impriſonment.</q>
