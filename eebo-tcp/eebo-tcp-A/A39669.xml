            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I will not be tiresom, but conclude all in few requests to you, and to God for you both. That which I request of you is,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That you will search and try your own hearts by these truths, especially now when so great tryals are like to be made of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans root and foundation in Religion. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that your first work, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls the first error of <hi>Protestants,</hi> to make sure your interest in Christ; <note n="u" place="margin">Primus haereticorun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="2">(2.) That you be humble under all that dignity and honour which God hath put upon you: be ye cloathed with humility. It was the glory of the Primitive Christians, that they <note n="*" place="margin">Non elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur magna, fed vivimus. <hi>Tertul. Apolog.</hi>
               </note> did not speak but live great things.
<pb facs="tcp:54344:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Humility will be the luster of your other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies: Estates and Honours are but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants and fine trappings which add not any real worth, yet <note n="x" place="margin">Narrant <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> quoties nudus esset, equisonem admittere in tergum voluisse: sed regiis phaleris &amp; bullis decoratum, neminem praeter regem ipsum tulisse: ita sanè-fit in novis hisce optimatibus, &amp;c.</note> how are some vain minds puffed up with these things! but ye have not so learned Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That you steddily persevere in those good wayes of God in which you have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and beware of heart or life apostasie. You expect happiness whilst God is in Heaven, and God expects holiness from you whilst you are on earth. It was an excellent truth which <hi>Tossanus</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Obtestor etiam vos liberos, &amp; generos cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissimos ne illius verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae unquam vos pudeat: potest enim laborare, sed non vinci veritas: &amp; non semel expertus sum Dominum Deum mirabiliter adesse iis qui coram ipso ambulant, &amp; in sua vocatione sedulò &amp; integrè versantur; licet ad tempus, odiis, aut simultatibus, aut calumniis agitentur. <hi>Melch.

               </note> recommended to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity in his last Will and Testament from his own experience. I beseech you, saith he, my dear Children and Kindred, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ashamed of the truths of the Gospel, either by reason of scandals in the Church, or persecutions upon it; truth may labour for a time but cannot be conquered, and I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found God to be wonderfully present with them that walk before him in truth, though
<pb facs="tcp:54344:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for a time they may be opprest with troubles and calumnies.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Lastly, That you keep a strict and constant watch over your own hearts, lest they be ensnared by the tempting, charming and dangerous snares attending a full and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie condition in the world. There are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations suited to all conditions: those that are poor and low in estate and reputation, are tempted to cozen, cheat, lie and flatter; and all to get up to the mount of Riches and honours: but those that were born upon that mount, though they be more free from those temptations, yet lie exposed to others no less dangerous, and therefore we find, <hi>not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. Many great and stately Ships, which spread much sail, and draw much water perish in the storms, when small Barks creep along the shore under the wind, and get safe into their Port. Never aim-at an higher station in this world than that you are in: <note n="z" place="margin">Lugebat moribundus Hermannus plus temporis operaeque se palatio quàm Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo impendisse; luxum &amp; vitiae Aulae, quae corrigere debuisset, adjuvasse, atque ita multo peccati dolore, trepidâ spe divinae clementiae, plurimo astantium horro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, anceps sui, anima aeternitatem ingressa est. <hi>Hist.

               <pb facs="tcp:54344:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will conclude all with this hearty wish for you, that as God hath set you in a capacity of much service for him in your generation, so your hearts may be enlarged for God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; that you may be very instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for his glory on earth, and may go safe, but late to Heaven.

               <hi>If thou be one that hast sincerely</hi> applied <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Jesus Christ by faith, this discourse through the blessing of the Spirit may be useful to thee, to clear and confirm thy evidences, to melt thy heart in the sense of thy mercies, and to ingage and quicken thee in the way of thy duties. Here thou wilt see what great things the Lord hath done for thy soul, and how these dignities as thou art his Son or Daughter by the double title of</hi> regeneration <hi>and</hi> adoption, <hi>do oblige thee to yield up thy self to God intirely, and to say from thy heart, Lord whatever I am, I am for thee, whatever I can do, I will do for thee, and whatever I can suffer, I will suffer for thee; and all that I</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54344:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>am or have, all that I can do or suffer, is nothing to what thou hast done for my soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be a stranger to regeneration and faith; a person that makest a powerless profession of Christ; that hast a name to live but art dead: here it's pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible thou maist meet something that will convince thee, how dangerous a thing it is to be an old creature in the new creatures dress and habit: and what it is that blinds thy judgement, and is likeliest to prove thyruine: a seasonable and full conviction whereof will be the greatest mercy that can befall thee in this world; if thereby at last God may help thee-to put on Christ as well as the name-of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thow be in darkness about the state of thy own soul, and willing to have it faithfully and impartially tried by the rule of the word, which will not warp to any mans humour or interest: here thou wilt find some weak assistance offered thee, to clear and disintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle thy doubting thoughts, which through thy prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, may lead thee to a comfortable settlement, and inward peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be a proud, conceited, presumptuous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oul, who hast too little knowledge, and too much pride and self-love to admit any doubts or scruples of thy state towards God; there are many things in this</hi> Treatise <hi>proper for thy conviction and better information: for woe to thee, if thou shouldest not</hi> fear, <hi>till thou</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54344:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>begin to</hi> feel <hi>thy misery; if thy troubles do not</hi> come on, <hi>till all thy hopes are</hi> gone off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know all these things are performed by me with much infirmity: and that the whole management is quite below the dignity of the subject. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the success of Sermons and Books in the world, hath but little relation to the elegancy of Language or accuracy of method; and that many may be</hi> useful, <hi>who cannot be</hi> excellent: <hi>I am willing in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and sincerity to commit it to the direction of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the blessing of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One thing I shall earnestly request of all the people of God, into whose hands this shall fall; that now at last, they will be perswaded to end all their unbrother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quarrels and strifes among themselves; which have wasted so much precious time, and decayed the vital spirits of Religion; hindred the conversion of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and increased and confirmed the Atheism of the times: and now at last opened a breach at which the common enemy is ready to enter, and end the quarrel to our cost. O put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy, and a spirit of charity and forbearance; if not for your own sakes, yet for the Churches sake;</hi> Si non vis tibi parcere, parce Carthagini.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I remember it is noted in our</hi> English History <hi>as a very remarkable thing, that when the</hi> Severn <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed part of</hi> Somersetshire, <hi>it was observed that</hi> Dogs <hi>and</hi> Hares, <hi>Cats and Rats, to avoid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54344:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>destruction, would swim to the next rising ground, and abide quietly together in that common danger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least discovery of their natural antipathy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The story applies it self, and O that Christians would every where depose their animosities; that the hearts of the Fathers might be turned to the children, and the children to the Fathers; lest God come and smite the earth with a curse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that you would dwell more in your Closets, and be more frequently and fervently upon your knees. O that you would search your hearts more narrowly, and sift them more throughly than ever; before the day pass as the chaff, and the Lords fierce anger come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: look into your <hi>Bibles, then into your</hi> hearts, <hi>and then to</hi> Heaven <hi>for a true discovery of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and if this poor mite may contribute any thing to that end, it will be a great reward of the unworthy labours of</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>viz. Ignorance, guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pollution,</hi> and the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of miserable consequences and effects let in upon the nature of men, yea the best and holiest of men by sin.</p>
            <p>Lapsed man is not only in deep misery, but grossly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant both that he is so, and how to recover himself from it: Sin hath left him at once senseless of his state, and at a perfect loss about the true remedy.</p>
            <p>To cure this, Christ is made to him <hi>Wisdome,</hi> not only by <hi>improvement</hi> of those treasures of wisdome that are in himself for the benefit of such souls as are united to him, as an head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the good of his own members; but also by <hi>imparting</hi> his wisdome to them by the Spirit of illumination, whereby they come to discern both their sin and danger; as also the true way of their recovery from both, through the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ to their souls by faith.</p>
            <p>But alas! Simple illumination doth but increase our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and exasperate our misery; as long as sin in the guilt of it is either imputed to our persons unto condemnation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected by our consciences in a way of accusation.</p>
            <p>With design therefore to remedy and heal this sore evil, <hi>Christ</hi> is made of God unto us <hi>righteousness,</hi> compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousness, whereby our obligation to punishment is dissolved, and thereby a solid foundation for a well settled peace of conscience firmly established.</p>
            <p>Yea, but although the removing of guilt from our persons and consciences be an inestimable mercy, yet alone it cannot make us compleatly happy: for though a man should never be damned for sin, yet what is it less than an hell upon earth to be under the dominion and pollution of every base lust? it's misery enough to be daily defiled by sin, though a man should never be damned for it.</p>
            <p>To compleat therefore the happiness of the redeemed; Christ is not only made of God unto them <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> the one curing our ignorance, the other our guilt; but he is made <hi>Sanctification</hi> also, to relieve us against the dominion and pollution of our corruptions: <hi>he comes both by water and by blood, not by blood only, but by water also:</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>purging</hi> as well as <hi>pardoning:</hi> how compleat and perfect a cure is Christ!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54344:19"/>
But yet something is required beyond all this to make our happiness perfect and entire wanting nothing; and that is the removal of those doleful effects and consequents of sin, which notwithstanding all the forementioned priviledges and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies still lye upon the souls and bodies of illuminated, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sanctified persons. For even upon the best and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of men, what swarms of vanity, loads of deadness, and fits of unbelief do daily appear in and oppress their souls! to the imbittering of all the comforts of life to them. And how many diseases, deformities, pains oppress their bodies, which daily moulders away by them, till they fall into the grave by death, even as the bodies of other men do, who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such priviledges from Christ as they do. For if <hi>Christ be in us</hi> (as the Apostle speaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.) <hi>the body is dead because of sin:</hi> Sanctification exempts us not from mortality.</p>
            <p>But from all these and whatsoever else the fruits and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of sin, Christ is <hi>Redemption</hi> to his people also: this seals up the sum of mercies: this so compleats the happiness of the Saints that it leaves nothing to desire.</p>
            <p>These four, wisdome, righteousness, sanctification and redemption take up amongst them all that is necessary or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable to make a soul truly and perfectly blessed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we have here the method and way by which the Elect come to be invested with these excellent priviledges: <note place="margin">2.</note> the account whereof the Apostle gives us in these words <hi>[Who of God is made unto us]</hi> in which expression four things are remarkable.</p>
            <p>First, That Christ and his benefits go inseparably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividedly together: 'tis Christ himself is made all this unto us: we can have no saving benefit separate and apart from the person of Christ: many would willingly receive his <hi>priviledges,</hi> who will not receive his person; but it cannot be; if we will have one, we must take the other too: yea, we must accept his person first and then his benefits: as it is in the marriage Covenant, so 'tis here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Christ with his benefits must be personally and particularly applied to us before we can receive any actual saving priviledge by him: he must be <hi>[made unto us] (i. e.)</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied to us: as a sum of money becomes or is made the ransome and liberty of a Captive when it is not only promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54344:19"/>
but paid down in his name, and legally applied for that use and end: when Christ dyed, the ransome was prepared, the sum laid down; but yet the elect continue still in sin and misery notwithstanding, till by <hi>effectual calling</hi> it be actually <hi>applied</hi> to their persons, and then they are made free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10, 11. reconciled by Christs death by whom <hi>we have now received the attonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That this application of Christ is the work of God, and not of man: <hi>Of God he is made unto us:</hi> the same hand that prepared it, must also apply it, or else we perish not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that the father hath done in contriving and appointing, and all that the son hath done in executing and accomplishing the design thus far.

In a word, God prepared and furnished him on purpose to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all our wants, which fully hits the Apostles sense, when he saith, <hi>Who of God is made unto us wisdome and righteousness, sanctification and redemption.</hi> The sum of all is</p>

What was done upon the person of Christ, was not only virtually done upon us, considered in him as a

common publick representative person, in which sense we are said to dye with him and live with him, to be crucified with him and buryed with him: but it was also intended for a platform or Idea of what is to be done by the Spirit actually upon our souls and bodies in our single persons. As he dyed for sin, so the Spirit applying his death to us in the work of <hi>mortification</hi> causes us to dye to sin, by the vertue of his death: and as he was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit and raised unto life, so the Spirit applying unto us the life of Christ causeth us to live, by spiritual <hi>vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Now this personal, secondary and <hi>actual application of redemption</hi> to us by the Spirit in his sanctifying work is that which I am engaged here to discuss and open: Which I shall do in these following Propositions.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is confessedly true, that Gods good pleasure appointing us from eternity to Salvation, is in its kind a most full and sufficient <hi>Impulsive</hi> cause of our Salvation, and every way able (for so much as it is concerned) to produce its effect.

                  <p>Christ hath indeed a fulness of saving power, but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation thereof is limited by the Fathers will: therefore he tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>it is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father:</hi> in which words he no way denies his authority to give glory as well as grace; only shews that in the dispensation proper to him as mediator, he was limited by his Fathers will and counsel.</p>
                  <p>And thus also are the dispensations of grace by the Spirit in like manner limited, both by the counsel and will of the Father and Son. For as he proceeds from them, so he acts in the administration proper to him, by commission from both.

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name:</hi> and as he comes forth into the world by this joynt Commission, so his dispensations are limited in his Commission: for it's said <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: (i. e.)</hi> he shall in all things act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Commission which the Father and I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him.</p>
                  <p>The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.

                  <p>It is very true, that in respect of Gods fore-knowledge and purpose there was a distinction betwixt one man and another, before any, man had a being, one was taken, another left: and with respect to the death of Christ, there is a great difference betwixt one and another: he laid down his life for the sheep, he pray'd for them and not for the world; but all this while as to any <hi>relative change</hi> of state, or <hi>real change</hi> of temper, they are upon a level with the rest of the miserable world.

                  <p>But in conveying and communicating his <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> he takes another method, for this is not <hi>imputed,</hi> but really <hi>imparted</hi> to us, by the illuminating, and regenerating work of the Spirit: these are graces really inherent in us: our righteousness comes from Christ as a <hi>Surety,</hi> but our holiness comes from him as a quickening <hi>head,</hi> sending vital influences into all his members.</p>
                  <p>Now these gracious habits being subjected and seated in the souls of poor imperfect creatures, whose corruptions abide and work in the very same faculties where grace hath its resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it cannot be, that our Sanctification should be so perfect and compleat, as our Justification is, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres only in Christ. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. thus are righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sanctification communicated and made ours: but then</p>

                  <p>How do men act therefore as if they were in love with their own ruin? many poor wretches now in the way to Hell, what an hard shift do they make to cast themselves away!

                     <note place="margin">Infer. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>preparatory work of the spirit, and are come nigh to Christ and all his benefits; to stretch out their hands with vehement desire to Christ, and give him the most importunate invitation into their Souls!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole world is distinguishable into three classes or sorts of persons, such as are <hi>far from Christ,</hi> such as are <hi>not far from Christ,</hi> and such as are <hi>in Christ:</hi> they that are in Christ have heartily received him: such as are far from Christ will not open to him; their hearts are fast barred by ignorance, prejudice and unbelief against him; but those that arecome under the preparatory workings of the spirit nigh to Christ, who see their own indispensable necessity of him, and his suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to their necessities, in whom also encouraging hopes begin to dawn, and their souls are waiting at the foot of God for power to receive him, for an heart to close sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and universally with him; oh what vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires! what strong pleas! what moving arguments should such persons urge and plead to win Christ, and get posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of him! they are in sight of their only remedy: Christ and Salvation are come to their very doors: there wants but a few things to make them blessed for ever: this is the day in which their souls are exercised greatly betwixt hopes and fears: now they are much alone, and deep in thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, they weep andmake supplication for an heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and that against the great discouragements with which they encounter.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if this be the case of thy soul; it will not be the least piece of service I can do for thee, to suggest such pleas as in this case are proper to be urged for the attainment of thy desires, and the closing of the match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and thee.</p>
                  <p>First, Plead the absolute necessity which now drives thee to Christ: tell him thy hope is utterly perished in all other refuges: thou art come like a starving beggar to the last door of hope: tell him thou now beginnest to see the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity of Christ: thy body hath not so much need
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54344:28"/>
of bread, water, or air, as thy soul hath of Christ, and that wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption that are in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Plead the Fathers gracious design in furnishing and sending him into the world, and his own design in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Fathers call. Lord Jesus, wast thou not <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach good tydings to the meek, to bind up the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 16. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>prison to them that are bound?</hi> behold an <hi>Object</hi> suitable to thine <hi>Office:</hi> whilest I was ignorant of my condition, I had a proud rebellious heart, but conviction and self-acquaintance have now meekned it: my heart was harder than the nether mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and it was as easie to dissolve the obdurate rocks into syrrup, as to thaw and melt my heart for sin; but now God hath made my heart soft, I sensibly feel the misery of my condition. I once thought my self at perfect liberty, but now I see what I conceited to be perfect liberty, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bondage; and never did a poor prisoner sigh for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance more than I. Since then thou hast given me a soul thus qualified (though still unworthy) for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of thine office, and execution of thy commission: Lord Jesus, be according to thy name a <hi>Jesus</hi> unto me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Plead the unlimited and general invitations made to such souls as you are, to come to Christ freely. Lord, thou hast made open Proclamation; <hi>Ho every one that thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth come ye to the waters, Isai.</hi> 55. 1. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>him that is athirst come:</hi> in obedience to thy call Lo I come, had I not been invited, my coming to thee (dear Lord Jesus) had been an act of presumption, but this makes it an act of duty and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Plead the unprofitableness of thy blood to God. Lord there is no profit in my blood, it will turn to no more advantage to thee to destroy than it will to save me: if thou send me to hell (as the merit of my sin calls upon thy Justice to do) I shall be there dishonouring thee to all eternity, and the debt I owe thee never pay'd: but if thou apply thy Christ to me for righteousness; satisfaction for all that I have done will be laid down in one full round sum: indeed if the honour of thy Justice lay as a bar to my pardon, it would stop my mouth; but when thy Justice as well as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54344:28"/>
mercy shall both rejoyce together, and be glorified and pleased in the same act, what hinders but that Christ be apply'd to my soul: since in so doing God can be no loser by it?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Lastly, Plead thy complyance with the terms of the Gospel: tell him Lord, my will complys fully and heartily to all thy gracious terms. I can now subscribe a blank: let God offer his Christ on what terms he will, my heart is ready to comply. I have no exception against any Article of the Gospel: and now Lord I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer my self to thy pleasure: do with me what seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in thine eyes: only give me an interest in Jesus Christ: as to all other concerns I lye at thy feet in full resignation of all to thy pleasure. Never yet did any perish in that posture and frame: and I hope I shall not be made the first instance and example.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>If Christ with all his benefits, be made ours by special application; how contented, thankful, comfortable and hopeful should believers be in every condition which God casts them into in this world!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After such a mercy as this, let them never open their mouths any more to repine and grudge at the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of their condition in this world: what are the things you want, compared with the things you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? what is a little money, health or liberty, to wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption? all the Crowns and Scepters in the world sold to their full value, are no price for the least of these mercies: but I will not insist here, your duty lyes much higher than content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Be thankful as well as content in every state: <hi>blessed be God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all [spiritual blessings] in heavenly places in Christ:</hi> O think what are men to Angels; that Christ should pass by them to become a Saviour to men! and what art thou among men, that thou shouldst be taken, and others left! and among all the mercies of God, what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54344:29"/>
mercies are comparable to these confer'd upon thee? O bless God in the lowest ebb of outward comforts, for such priviledges as these.</p>
                  <p>And yet you will not come up to your Duty in all this, except you be joyful in the Lord, and rejoyce evermore after the receipt of such mercies as these: <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord ye righteous, and again I say rejoyce:</hi> for hath not the poor Captive reason to rejoyce, when he hath recovered his liberty: the Debtor to rejoyce, when all scores are cleared and he owes nothing: the weary traveller to rejoyce, though he be not owner of a shilling, when he is come almost home where all his wants shall be supplied? Why this is your case, when Christ once becomes yours: you are the Lords freemen: your debts to Justice are all satisfied by Christ: and you are within a little of compleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from all the troubles and inconveniencies of your present state.</p>

            <p>THE design and end of the Application of Christ to Sinners, is the Communication of his benefits to them: but seeing all Communications of benefits necessarily imply <hi>Communion,</hi> and all Communion as necessarily presupposes <hi>Union</hi> with his person: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place, and from this Scripture treat of the <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union</hi> betwixt Christ and believers: this Union being the principal act wherein the Spirits <hi>application</hi> of Christ consists; of which I spake (as to its general nature) in the former Sermon.</p>
            <p>In this Verse (omitting the Contexture) we find a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Union. One betwixt the Father and Christ, a second betwixt Christ and believers: a third betwixt believers themselves.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Thou in me:</hi> this is a glorious ineffable Union, and is fundamental to the other two: the Father is not only in Christ, in respect of <hi>dear affection,</hi> as one friend is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is as his own soul: nor only <hi>essentially,</hi> in respect of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54344:30"/>
the <hi>identity</hi> and sameness of nature and attributes; in which respect Christ is the <hi>express Image of his person, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. but he is in Christ also as <hi>Mediator,</hi> by communicating the fulness of the godhead which dwells in him as <hi>God-man,</hi> in a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and singular manner; so as it never dwelt, nor can dwell in any other, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I in them,</hi> here is the <hi>Mystical Union</hi> betwixt Christ and the Saints: <hi>q. d.</hi> thou and I are one <hi>essentially,</hi> they and I are one <hi>mystically:</hi> thou and I are one by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Godhead, and singular fulness of the Spirit to me as Mediator; and they and I are one, by my communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit to them in measure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From hence results a third Union betwixt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers themselves: <hi>that they may be made perfect in one:</hi> the same Spirit dwelling in them all, and equally uniting them all to me, as living members to their head of influence, there must needs be a dear and intimate Union betwixt themselves as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members of the same body.</p>
            <p>Now, my business at this time lying in the second branch, namely the Union betwixt Christ and believers, I shall gather up the substance of it into this Doctrinal proposition, to which I shall apply this discourse.</p>

               <p>The Scriptures have borrowed from the book of Nature four elegant and lively <hi>Metaphors</hi> to help the Nature of this Mystical Union with Christ into our understandings; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of two pieces of <hi>timber,</hi> united by glew: that of a <hi>graff</hi> taking hold of its stock; and making one tree: that of the <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>wife,</hi> by the marriage Covenant beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one flesh: and that of the <hi>members</hi> and head animated by one soul, and so becoming one Natural body.

               <p>Nor yet that <hi>Conjugal Union</hi> by marriage Covenant betwixt <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 32.</note> a man and his wife; for though this be exceeding dear and intimate, so that a man leaves father and mother, and cleaves to his wife, and they two become one flesh: yet this Union is not <hi>indissolvable,</hi> but may and must be broken by death; and then the <hi>relict</hi> lives alone without any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, or relation to the person that was once so dear: but this betwixt Christ and the soul can never be dissolved by death, it abides to eternity.</p>
               <p>Nor Lastly, That of the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>members</hi> united by one <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15, 16.</note> vital Spirit and so making one <hi>Physical body,</hi> mentioned <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16. for though one soul actuates every member, yet it doth not knit every member alike near to the head, but some are nearer, and others removed farther from it; but here every member is alike nearly united with Christ the head, the weak are as near to him as the strong.</p>

               <p>First, For the reality of it, I shall make it appear that there is such a Union betwixt Christ and believers: it is no <hi>Ens ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>

empty notion, or cunningly devised fable; but a most certain demonstrable truth, which appears,</p>
               <p>First, From the <hi>Communion</hi> which is betwixt Christ and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: in this the Apostle is express, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his son Jesus Christ:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here the Saints are called the companions, consorts, or fellows of Christ: and that not only in respect of his assumption of our mortality, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting us with his immortality; but it hath a special reference and respect to the Unction of the Holy Ghost, or graces of the Spirit of which believers are partakers with him and through him. Now this Communion of the Saints with Christ is entirely and necessarily dependant upon their Union with him, even as much as the branches participation of the sap and juice, depends upon its Union and coalition with the stock: take away Union, and there can be no communion, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, which is clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>All is yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods:</hi> where you see how all our participation of Christs benefits, is built upon our Union with Christs person.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The reality of the believers <hi>Union</hi> with Christ is evident from the <hi>Imputation</hi> of Christs righteousness to him for his Justification. That a believer is justified before God by a righteousness without himself is undeniable from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</hi> and that Christs righteousness becomes ours by <hi>Imputation,</hi> is as clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24. but it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be imputed to us, except we be united to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him: which is also plainly asserted in 1 <hi>Con.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>But of him are ye (in Christ Jesus) who of God is made unto us wisdome, and righteousness, sanctification and redemption:</hi> he communicates his merits unto none but those that are in him: hence all those vain cavils of the Papists disputing against our Justification by the righteousness of Christ, and asserting it to be by inherent righteousness, are solidly answered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54344:31"/>
When they demand, how can we be justified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of another? can I be rich with another mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or preferr'd by anothers honours? Our answer is, Yes, if that other be my surety or husband: indeed <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be justified by the righteousness of <hi>Paul:</hi> but both may be justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them; they being members joyntly knit to one common head: <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> and <hi>surety</hi> are one in obligation, and construction of Law: head and members are one body, branch and stock are one tree, and it's no strange thing to see a graff live by the sap of another stock, when once it is ingraffed into it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Sympathy</hi> that is betwixt Christ and believers proves a Union betwixt them: Christ and the Saints smile and sigh together. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 2, 4. tells us that he did fill up that which is behind, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>sufferings of Christ in his Flesh:</hi> not as if Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were imperfect, <hi>(for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified, Heb.</hi> 10. 14.) but in these two Scriptures Christ is consider'd in a twofold capacity: he suffered once in <hi>Corpore proprio,</hi> in his own person as mediator; these sufferings are compleat and full, and in that sense he suffers no more: he suffers also in <hi>Corpore m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tico,</hi> in his Church and members, thus he still suffers in the sufferings of every Saint for his sake: and though these sufferings in his Mystical body, are not equal to the other, either <hi>pondere &amp; mensura,</hi> in their weight and value, nor yet designed <hi>ex officio,</hi> for the same use and purpose, to satisfie by their proper merit offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Justice; nevertheless they are truly reckoned the sufferings of Christ, because the head suffers when the members do: and without this supposition, that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 5. is never to be understood, when Christ the head in Heaven crys out, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> when the toe was trod upon on earth: how doth Christ sensibly feel our sufferings or we his, if there be not a Mystical Union betwixt him and us?</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, The way and manner in which the Saints shall be raised at the last day, proves this <hi>Mystical Union</hi> betwixt Christ and them: for they are not to be raised as others, by the naked power of God without them, but by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54344:32"/>
the vertue of Christs resurrection as their head, sending forth vital quickening influences into their dead bodies, which are united to him as well as their souls. For so we find it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you: he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you:</hi> even as it is in our awakening out of natural sleep, first the <hi>animal spirits</hi> in the head begin to rouze and play there, and then the senses and members are loosed throughout the whole body.</p>
               <p>Now it's impossible the Saints should be raised in the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them; if that Spirit did not knit and unite them to him, as members to their head. So then, by all this it is proved that there is a real Union of the Saints with Christ.</p>
               <p>Next I shall endeavour to open the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of this Union: and shew you what it is, according to the weak <note place="margin">2.</note> apprehensions we have of so sublime a Mystery: and this I shall do in a

               </p>
               <p>First, More <hi>generally,</hi> it is an intimate conjunction of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to Christ by the imparting of his Spirit to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">1.</note> they are enabled to believe and live in him.</p>
               <p>All divine Spiritual life is <hi>originally</hi> in the Father, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to us but by, and through the son; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 26. to him hath the Father given to have an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, enlivening power in himself: but the Son communicates this life which is in him to none but by and through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of sin and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit must therefore first take hold of us, before we can live in Christ; and when he doth so, then we are enabled to exert that vital act of faith, whereby we receive Christ: all this lyes plain in that one Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 57. <hi>As the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that cateth me</hi> (that is by faith applys me) <hi>even he shall live by me.</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54344:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So that these two, namely the <hi>Spirit</hi> on Christs part, and <hi>Faith</hi> his work, on our part, are the two ligaments by which we are knit to Christ.</p>
               <p>So that the Spirits work in uniting or engrassing a soul into Christ is like the cutting off the graff from its native stock (which he doth by his illuminations and convictions) and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it with the living stock when it is thus prepared, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling it (by the infusion of faith) to suck and draw the vital sap, and thus it becomes one with it. Or as the many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the natural body, being all quickened and animated by the same vital Spirit, become one body with the head which is the principal member: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>there is one body, and one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More <hi>particularly,</hi> we shall consider the properties of this <note place="margin">2.</note> Union, that so we may the better understand the nature of it. And here I shall open the nature of it both <hi>negatively,</hi> and <hi>affirmatively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Negatively, by removing all false notions and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions <note place="margin">1. Negatively.</note> of it. And we say,</p>
               <p>First, The Saints Union with Christ is not a <hi>meer mental</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>Union,</hi> only in conceit and notion, but really exists <hi>extra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> whether we conceit it or not. I know the atheistical world censures all these things as fancies, and idle imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but believers know the reality of them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>At that day you shall know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> This doctrine is not <hi>phantastical,</hi> but <hi>scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Saints Union with Christ is not a <hi>Physical Union,</hi> such as is betwixt the members of a natural body and <note place="margin">2.</note> the head: our Nature indeed is assumed into Union with the person of Christ, but it is the singular honour of that blessed and holy flesh of Christ, to be so united, as to make one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with him: that Union is <hi>hypostatical,</hi> this only <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor is it an <hi>Essential Union,</hi> or Union with the divine nature, so as our beings are thereby swallowed up and <note place="margin">3.</note> lost in the divine being.</p>
               <p>Some there be indeed that talk at that wild rate, of being Godded into God, and Christed into Christ: and those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary expressions of <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, do
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54344:33"/>
but too much countenance those daring Spirits: but oh there is an infinite distance betwixt us and Christ in respect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and excellency notwithstanding this Union.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Union I here speak of, is not a <hi>foederal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> or an Union by Covenant only: such a Union indeed <note place="margin">4.</note> there is betwixt Christ and believers, but that is consequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to and wholly dependent upon this.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, It is not a <hi>meer Moral Union</hi> by love and affection: thus we say, one soul is in two bodies, a friend <note place="margin">5.</note> is another self: the lover is in the person beloved: such a Union of hearts and affections there is also betwixt Christ and the Saints, but this is of another nature: that we call a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> this a <hi>Mystical</hi> Union: that only knits our <hi>affections,</hi> but this knits our <hi>persons</hi> to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Positively, and First, though this Union neither <note place="margin">2. Positively.</note> makes us one person, or essence with Christ, yet it knits our persons most <hi>intimately</hi> and nearly to the person of Christ: <note place="margin">1.</note> the Church is Christs body, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1. 24. not his <hi>Natural,</hi> but his <hi>Mystical</hi> body: that is to say, his body in a Mystery: because it is to him as his natural body: the Saints stand to Christ in the same relation that the natural members of the body stand to the head, and he stands in the same relation to them, that the head stands in to the natural mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and consequently they stand related to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the members of a natural body do to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Christ and the Saints are not one as the <hi>Oak</hi> and the <hi>Ivy</hi> that clasps it are one; but as the graff and stock are one: it is not a Union by <hi>adhesion,</hi> but <hi>incorporation.</hi> Husband and Wife are not so near, soul and body are not so near as Christ and the believing soul are near to each other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Mystical Union is wholly supernatural: wrought by the alone power of God. So it's said 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>but of him are ye in Christ Jesus:</hi> we can no more unite our selves to Christ, than a branch can incorporate it self into another stock: it is of him <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of God, his proper and alone work.</p>
               <p>There are only two ligaments or bands of Union betwixt Christ and the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> on his part, and <hi>Faith</hi> on ours: but when we say faith is the band of Union on our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54344:33"/>
part, the meaning is not, that it's so our own act, as that it springs naturally from us, or is educed from the power of our own wills; no, for the Apostle expressly contradicts it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>it is not of your selves, it is the gift of God:</hi> but we are the subjects of it, and though the act on that account be ours, yet the power enabling us to believe is God's. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Mystical Union is an <hi>immediate Union:</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate I say, not as excluding means and instruments, for <note place="margin">3.</note> several means and many instruments are employ'd for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of it: but immediate as excluding degrees of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among the members of Christs mystical body.</p>
               <p>Every member in the Natural body stands not as near to the head as another: but so do all the mystical members of Christs body to him; every member, the smallest, as well as the greatest hath an immediate coalition with Christ. 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>To the Church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus; called to be Saints: with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs, and ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <hi>factious</hi> in this Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> those that said <hi>I am of Christ;</hi> as arrogating Christ to themselves; were as much a <hi>faction,</hi> as those that said <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. to cure this he tells them, he is <hi>both theirs and ours.</hi> Such inclosures are against law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Saints Mystical Union with Christ is a <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>fundamental Union:</hi> it's fundamental by way of <hi>Sustentation:</hi> all our fruits of obedience depend upon it. <hi>John</hi> 15. 4. <hi>As the branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> except ye abide in me.</hi> It's fundamental to all our priviledges and comfortable claims, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. ult. <hi>all is yours for ye are Christs.</hi> And it is fundamental to all our hopes, and expectations of glory; for it is <hi>Christ in you the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1. 27. So then destroy this Union, and with it you destroy all our fruits, priviledges and eternal hopes at one stroke.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Mystical Union is a most <hi>Efficacious Union,</hi> for through this Union the divine power flows into our <note place="margin">5.</note> souls; both to quicken us with the life of Christ, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and secure that life in us after it is so infused.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54344:34"/>
Without the <hi>Unition</hi> of the soul to Christ, which is to be conceived <hi>efficiently</hi> as the Spirits act, there can be no <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on formally</hi> considered; and without these, no communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life from Christ to us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. And when there is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or effectual working of the spirit of life in every part, which he there speaks of, (as who should say, the first bublings up of the new life, a spiritual vitality diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the soul which ere while was dead in sin) yet still this Union with Christ is as necessary to the <hi>maintaining,</hi> as before it was to the <hi>producing</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>For why is it that this life is not again extinguished and wholly suffocated in us by so many deadly wounds as are given it by temptations and corruptions? surely no reason can be assigned more satisfying than that which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gives us in <hi>John</hi> 14. 19. <hi>because I live, ye shall live also.</hi> q. d. whilst there is vital sap in me the root, you that are branches in me, cannot wither and dye.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Mystical Union is an <hi>indissoluble Union:</hi> there is an everlasting tye betwixt Christ and the believer: and herein also it is beyond all other Unions in the world: death dissolves the dear Union betwixt the husband and wife, friend and friend, yea betwixt soul and body; but not betwixt Christ and the soul: the bands of this Union rot not in the grave: <hi>what shall separate us from the love of Christ?</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 38, 39. he bids defiance to all enemies, and triumphs in the firmness of this Union over all hazards that seem to threaten it. It is with Christ and us in respect of the <hi>Mystical Union,</hi> as it was with Christ himself in respect of the <hi>hypostatical Union:</hi> that was not dissolved by his death when the <hi>Natural Union</hi> betwixt his soul and body was; nor can this mystical Union of our souls and bodies with Christ be dissolved when the Unions betwixt us and our dearest relations, yea betwixt the soul and body are dissolved by death. God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calls himself the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> long after his body was turned into dust.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is an <hi>honourable Union,</hi>

was ever done to our common nature, was by its assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption into Unity with the second person <hi>hypostatically,</hi> and the highest honour that was ever done to our single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons was their Union with Christ <hi>mystically.</hi> To be a servant of Christ is a dignity transcendent to the highest advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among men; but to be a member of Christ, how matchless and singular is the glory thereof! and yet such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour have all the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, It is a most <hi>Comfortable Union:</hi> yea, the ground <note place="margin">8.</note> of all solid comfort both in life and death: whatever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wants, or distresses befal such, in this is abundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and support. Christ is mine, and I am his; what may not a soul make out of that! If I am Christs, then let him take care for me, and indeed in so doing, he doth but care for his own: he is my head, and to him it belongs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the safety and welfare of his own members: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. he is not only an head to his own by way of <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but to all things else by way of <hi>dominion,</hi> for their good: how comfortably may we repose our selves under that cheering consideration upon him at all times, and in all difficult cases!</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It is a <hi>fruitful Union:</hi> the immediate end of it is <note place="margin">9.</note> fruit: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>we are married to Christ, that we should bring forth fruit to God:</hi> all the fruit we bear before our ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into Christ, is worse than none: till the person be in Christ, the work cannot be Evangelically good, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: <hi>we are made accepted in the beloved, Eph.</hi> 1. 6. Christ is a fruitful root, and makes all the branches that live in him so too, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and Lastly, It is an <hi>enriching Union:</hi> for by our <note place="margin">10.</note> Union with his person we are immediately interessed in all his riches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. how rich and great a person do the little arms of Faith clasp and embrace! <hi>All is yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. all that Christ hath, becomes ours, either by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication to us, or improvement for us: his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. his promises, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. his providences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. his glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. it's all ours by vertue of our Union with him.</p>
               <p>Thus you see briefly what the Mystical Union is. Next we shall improve it.</p>

                  <p>Great is the dignity of the Angelical nature, they are the highest and most honourable species of creatures: they also have the honour continually to behold the face of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet in this one respect the Saints are preferr'd to them, they have a Mystical Union with Christ as their head of influence, by whom they are quickned with spiritual life, which the Angels have not.</p>

And as the Nobles of the Kingdome think it a preferment and honour to serve the <hi>Queen,</hi> so the glorious <hi>Angels</hi> think it no degradation or dishonour to them to serve the Saints: for to this honourable office they are appointed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. to be ministring or serviceable spirits for the good of them that shall be heirs of salvation: the chiefest servant disdains not to honour and serve the heir.</p>

Whilst the sap of life is in the root, the branches live by it: thus it is betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>because I live, ye shall live also:</hi> see how Christ binds up their life in one bundle with his own, plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating it is as impossible for them to dye, as it is for himself, he cannot live without them.</p>
                  <p>True it is, the spiritual life of believers is encountred by many strong and fierce oppositions: it is also brought to a low ebb in some, but we are always to remember there are some things which pertain to the essence of that life, in which the very being of it lyes, and some things that pertain only to its <hi>well-being:</hi> all those things which belong to the <hi>well-being</hi> of the new creature, as manifestations, joys, spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may for a time fail, yea and grace it self may suffer great losses and remissions in its degrees notwithstanding our Union with Christ; but still the essence of it is immortal, which is no small relief to gracious souls: when the means of grace fail, as is threatned <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11. whem temporary formal professors drop away from Christ like withered leaves from the trees in a windy day, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. and when the natural Union of their souls and bodies are suffering a dissolution from each other by death, when that <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cord</hi> is loosed, this <hi>Golden chain</hi> holds firm: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 23.</p>

A Text believed and understood by very few, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Then shall the righteous answer, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the saying of a great Divine, that he thought scarce any man on earth did fully understand and believe this truth, and he conceives so much hinted in the very Text where the righteous themselves reply, <hi>Lord when saw we thee sick,</hi> &amp;c. intimating in the question, that they did not throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the nearness, yea, <hi>oneness</hi> of those persons with Christ, for whom they did these things. And indeed, it is incredible that a Christian can be hard hearted, and close handed, to that necessitous Christian, in refreshing and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of whom he verily believes that he ministers refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Christ himself.</p>
                  <p>O think again and again upon this Scripture, consider what forcible and mighty Arguments are here laid together to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage relief to the wants of Christians.</p>
                  <p>Here you see their near relation to Christ: they are Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally one person: what you did to them, you did to me. Here you see also how kindly Christ takes it at our hands: acknowledging all those kindnesses that were bestowed upon him, even to a bit of bread: he is you see content to take it as a courtesy, who might demand it by authority, and bereave you of all immediately upon refusal.</p>
                  <p>Yea, here you see this one single branch or act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (our charity to the Saints) is singled out from among all the duties of obedience, and made the test and evidence of our sincerity in that great day, and men blessed or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

according to the love they have manifested this way to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>O then henceforth let none that understand the relation the Saints have to Christ, as the members to the head, or the relation they have to each other thereby as fellow members of the same body, from henceforth suffer Christ to hunger, if they have bread to relieve him, or Christ to be thirsty, if they have to refresh him; this Union betwixt Christ and the Saints affords an Argument beyond all other arguments in the world to prevail with us: methinks a little <hi>Rhetorick</hi> might perswade a Christian to part with any thing he hath to Christ, who parted with the glory of heaven, yea, and his heart blood to boot for his sake.</p>

                     <hi>Do Christ and believers make but one Mystical person? how unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Infer. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and absurd then are all those acts of unkindness whereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers wound and grieve Jesus Christ! this is as if the hand should wound its own head, from which it receives life, sense, motion, and strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Satan smites Christ by a wicked man, he then wounds him with the hand of an enemy; but when his temptations prevail upon the Saints to sin, he wounds him as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with his own hand: as the <hi>Eagle</hi> and <hi>Tree</hi> in the <hi>Fable</hi> complain'd, the one that he was wounded by an Arrow winged with his own Feathers, the other, that it was rived asunder by a wedge hewen out of its own limbs.</p>
                  <p>Now the evil and disingenuity of such sins, is to be measured not only by the near relation Christ sustains to believers as their head, but more particularly, from the several benefits they receive from him as such: for in wounding Christ by their sins,</p>
                  <p>First, They wound their <hi>head of influence,</hi> through whom they live, and without whom they had still remain'd in the state of sin and death. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. Shall Christ send life to us, and we return that which is as death to him? O how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, how disingenuous is this!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54344:37"/>
Secondly, They wound their <hi>head of government.</hi> Christ is a <hi>guiding</hi> as well as a <hi>quickening</hi> head, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. the is your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he guides you by his counsels to glory; but must he be thus requited for all his faithful conduct! what do you when you sin against him, but rebel against his government, refusing to sollow his counsels, and obeying in the mean time a deceiver rather than him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They wound their <hi>consulting head</hi> who cares, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, and projects for the welfare and safety of the body. Christians, you know your affairs below have not been steered and managed by your own wisdome, but that orders have been given from heaven for your security and supply from day to day. <hi>I know O Lord</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>that the way of man is not in himself, neither is it in him that walks to direct his own steps. Jer.</hi> 10. 23.</p>
                  <p>It's true, Christ is out of your sight, and you see him not; but he sees you, and orders every thing that concerns you. And is this a due requital of all that care he hath taken for you? Do ye thus requite the Lord, for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? what! recompence evil for good! O let shame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and Lastly, They wound <hi>their head of honour.</hi> Christ your head, is the fountain of honour to you: this is your glory that you relate to him as your head: you are on this account (as before was noted) exalted above Angels.</p>
                  <p>Now then consider how vile a thing it is to reflect the least dishonour upon him from whom you derive all your glory. O consider and bewail it.</p>

                  <p>Every one naturally cares and provides for his own, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for his own body; yet we can more easily violate the law of nature and be cruel to our own flesh, than Christ can
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54344:37"/>
be so to his Mystical body. I know it's hard to rest upon and rejoyce in a promise, when necessities pinch, and we see not from whence relief should arise: but oh what sweet satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comfort might a necessitous believer find in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, would he but keep them upon his heart in such a day of straits!</p>
                  <p>First, Whatever my distresses are for quality, number, or degree, they are all <hi>known</hi> even to the least circumstance by Christ my head: he looks down from heaven upon all my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and understands them more fully than I that feel them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 9. <hi>Lord all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He not only knows them, but <hi>feels</hi> them, as well as knows them: <hi>we have not an high priest that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb.</hi> 4. 15. in all your afflictions he is afflicted: tender Sympathy cannot but flow from such intimate Union: therefore in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35. he saith, I was an hungred, and I was a thirst, and I was naked. For indeed his Sympathy and tender compassion gave him as quick a resentment, and as tender a sense of their wants, as if they had been his own: yea,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He not only knows and feels my wants, but hath enough in his hand, and much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> enough to supply them all: for all things are delivered to him by the Father, <hi>Luk:</hi> 10. 22. all the storehouses in heaven and earth are his, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He bestows all earthly good things even to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and redundance upon his enemies, <hi>they have more than heart can wish, Psal.</hi> 73. 7. he is bountiful to strangers: he loads his very enemies with these things, and can it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed he will in the mean while starve his own, and neglect those whom he loves as his own flesh? it cannot be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hitherto he hath not suffered me to perish in any former straits: when and where was it that he forsook me? this is not the first plunge of trouble I have been in: have I not found him a God at a pinch? how oft have I seen him in the Mount of difficulties!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54344:38"/>
Sixthly, and Lastly, I have his promise and engagement that he will never leave me nor forsake me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18. a promise never crackt since the hour it was first made. If then, the Lord Jesus knows and feels all my wants, hath enough and more than enough to supply them, if he gives even to redundance unto his enemies, hath not hitherto forsaken me, and hath promised he never will: why then is my soul thus disquieted in me? surely there is no cause it should be so.</p>

                     <hi>whether he be really united with Christ or not; by the natural and proper effects which alwayes flow from this Union?</hi> As</p>
                  <p>First, The real Communication of Christs holiness to the soul: we cannot be United with this root, and not partake of the vital sap of sanctification from him: all that are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him, are planted into the likeness of his death and of his resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 6. viz. by mortification, and vivification.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They that are so nearly united to him as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the head cannot but love him and value him above their own lives: as we see in nature, the hand and arm will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose to save the head: the nearer the Union, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er always is the affection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The members are subject to the head: Dominion in the head must needs infer subjection in the members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 24. in vain do we claim Union with Christ as our head,

                  <p>First, How <hi>contented</hi> and well pleased should we be with our outward lot, however providence hath cast it for us in this world.

IF God be upon a design of marrying poor sinners to his Son, there must be a treaty in order to it: that treaty requires interlocution betwixt both the parties concerned in it: but such is our frailty, that should God speak immediately to us himself, it would confound and overwhelm us: God therefore graciously condescends and accommodates himself to our infirmity, in treating with us in order to our Union with Christ by his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and these not <hi>Angels</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses we cannot bear, but men like our selves who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated for the effecting of this great business betwixt Christ and us. <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for God,</hi> &amp;c. In which words you have</p>
            <p>First, Christs Ambassadors commissionated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Commission opened.</p>
            <p>First, Christs Ambassadors commissionated. <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ.</hi> The Lord Jesus thought it not sufficient to print the law of grace, and blessed terms of our Union with him in the scriptures, where men may read his willingness to receive them, and see the just and gracious terms and conditions upon which he offers to become theirs; but hath also set up and established a standing office in the Church to expound that Law, inculcate the precepts, and urge the promises thereof: to wooe and espouse souls to Christ, <hi>I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chast virgin to Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. and this not simply from their own affections and compassions to miserable sinners, but also by vertue of their office and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission whereby they are authorized and appointed to that work. <hi>We then are Ambassadors for Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Commission opened: wherein we find</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Their <hi>work</hi> appointed.</item>
               <item>2. Their <hi>Capacity</hi> described.</item>
               <item>3. And the <hi>manner</hi> of their acting in that Capacity <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First; The work whereunto the Ministers of the Gospel are appointed, is to <hi>reconcile the world to God:</hi> to work these sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, vain, rebellious hearts which have a strong aversation from God naturally in them; to close with him according to the Articles of peace contained in the Gospel; that thereby
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54344:40"/>
they may be capable to receive the mercies and benefits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the death of Christ, which they cannot receive in the state of enmity and alienation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Capacity described, they act <hi>in Christs stead</hi> as his <hi>Vicegerents.</hi> He is no more in this world to treat personally with sinners as once he did in the dayes of n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s flesh: but yet he still continues the treaty with this lower world by his officers, requiring men to look upon them, and obey them as they would himself if he were Corporally present, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner of their acting in that Capacity prescribed: and that is by humble, sweet, and condescending intreaties and beseechings: this best suits that meek and Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Saviour whom they represent. Thus he dealt with poor sinners himself when he conversed among them; he would not break a bruised reed nor quench smoaking flax, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 3. This is the way to allure and win the souls of sinners to Christ.</p>
            <p>From hence the Note is:</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Doct.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the preaching of the Gospel by Christs Ambassadors is the <note place="margin">Doct.</note> means appointed for the reconciling and bringing home of sinners to Christ.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>This is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. and many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Here we shall take into Consideration these three things.</p>
               <p>First, what is implyed in Christs treating with sinners by his Ambassadors or Ministers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What the great Concernment they are to treat with sinners about is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What and when is the Efficacy of preaching to bring sinners to Christ.</p>
               <p>First, We will open what is implyed and imported in Christs treaty with sinners by his Ambassadors or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>And here we find these six things implied.</p>
               <p>First, it necessarily implies the defection and fall of man
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54344:41"/>
from his estate of favour and friendship with God: if no war with heaven, what need of <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of peace? the very office of the Ministry, is an argument of the fall. Gospel Ordinances and Officers came in upon the fall, and expire with the Mediators dispensatory Kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25. <hi>Then shall he deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father:</hi> thenceforth no more Ordinances, no more Ministers; what use can there be of them, when the treaty is ended? They have done and accomplished all they were ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and designed for, when they shall have reconciled to God all the number of his Elect that lay dispersed among the lost and miserable posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and have brought them home to Christ in a perfect state, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It implies the singular grace and admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension of God to sinful man. That God will admit any treaty with him at all is wonderful mercy, it's more than he would do for the Angles that fell, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. they are <hi>reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgement of the great day.</hi> Christ took not on him their nature, but suffered Myriads of them to perish, and fills up their vacant places in glory with a number of sinful men and women to whom the Law a warded the same punishment.</p>
               <p>But that God will not only treat but entreat and beseech sinful men to be reconciled is yet more wonderful. Barely to propound the terms of peace had been an astonishing mercy, but to wooe and beseech stubborn enemies to be at peace and accept their pardon, Oh how unparallell'd as this condescension!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It implyes the great dignity and honour of the <note place="margin">Inter illos qui regi regum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviunt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> Gospel ministry. <hi>We are Ambassadors for Christ,</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors represent and personate the Prince that sends them: and the honours or contempts done to them reflect upon, and are reckon'd to the person of their Master, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. he that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you, despiseth me.</p>
               <p>Neither their persons, nor parts are the proper ground and reason of our respects to them; but their office and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54344:41"/>
We are fallen into the dreggs of time, wherein a vile contempt is poured not only upon the <hi>persons</hi> but the very <hi>Office</hi> of the Ministry: and I could heartily wish that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9. were throughly considered by us, possibly it might inform us of the true cause and reason of this sore judgement: but surely Christs faithful Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a better entertainment than they ordinarily find in the world: and if we did but seriously bethink our selves, in whose name they come, and in whose stead they stand, we should receive them as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4. 14. as Angels of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christs treating with sinners by his Ministers, who are his Ambassadors, implies the strict obligation they are under to be faithful in their Ministerial imployment. Christ counts upon their faithfulness whom he puts into the Ministry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. They are accountable to him for all acts of their office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. If they be silent, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be innocent: <hi>necessity is laid upon them, and wo to them if they preach not the Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 16.</p>
               <p>Yea, necessity is not only laid upon them to preach, but to keep close to their Commission in preaching the Gospel, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Our Exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile, but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts:</hi> the word is not to be corrupted to please men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. their business is not to make them their disciples, but Christs, not to seek theirs but them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. to keep close to their instructions, both in the matter, manner, &amp; end of their Ministry. So did Christ himself the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, yet being sent by God, he saith, <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</hi> And so he expects and requires that his <hi>Ambassadors</hi> keep close to the Commission he hath given them; and be (according to their measure) faithful to their trust, as he was to his. <hi>Paul</hi> is to deliver to the people, that which he also received from the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And <hi>Timothy</hi> must keep that which was committed to him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It implies the removal of the Gospel ministry to be a very great judgment to the people. The remanding of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> presages an ensuing War. If the reconciling of souls to God be the greatest work, then the removal of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54344:42"/>
the means and instruments thereof must be the forest Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some account <hi>the falling of the Salt upon the Table omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi> but surely the falling of them whom Christ calls <hi>the Salt of the earth</hi> is so indeed.</p>
               <p>What are those once famous and renowned places from whence Christ (as he threatned) hath removed the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, but <hi>magna latrocinia</hi> dens of Robbers, and mountains of prey?</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Lastly, It implyes both the wisdome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension of God to sinful men in carrying on a treaty of peace with them by such <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> negotiating betwixt him and them: without a treaty there would be no reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and no method to carry on such a treaty like this: for had the Lord treated with sinners personally, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had been overwhelmed with such an awful Majesty. The app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ces of God confound the creature, <hi>Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God</hi> (saith Israel) <hi>neither let me see this great fire any more, that I dye not: yea so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible was that sight, that</hi> Moses <hi>said, I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Deut. 18. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21.</p>
               <p>Or had he Commissionated <hi>Angels</hi> for this imployment, though they stand not at such an infinite distance from us as God doth, yet such is the excellence of their glory (being the highest <hi>Species</hi> and order of creatures) that their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances would be more apt to astonish than persuade us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they being creatures of another rank and kinde, and not partaking with us either in the misery of the fall, or benefit of the recovery by Christ, 'tis not to be supposed they should speak to us so feelingly, and experimentally, as these his Ministers do: they can open to you the mysteries of sin, feeling the workings thereof daily in their own hearts: they can discover to you the conflicts of the flesh and spirit, as being daily exercised in that warfare; and then being men of the same mould and temper they can say to you as <hi>Elihu</hi> did to <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 33. 6, 7. <hi>Behold, I am according to thy wish, in Gods stead, I also am formed out of the clay: behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in this appointment much of the Divine wisdom and condescension to sinners is manifested: <hi>we have this treasure in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>arthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54344:42"/>
                  <hi>and not of us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Gods glory and mans advantage are both promoted in this dispensation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next we are to consider that great Concernment <note place="margin">2.</note> about which these <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of Christ are to treat with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and that (as the Text informs us) is their reconciliation to God.</p>
               <p>Now reconciliation with God, is the restoring of men to <note place="margin">Reconciliareni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud est quam amiciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am offensione aliquagravi diremptam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarcire, &amp; sic inimicos in pristinam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. <hi>Daven. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Col.</hi> 20.</note> that former frindship they had with God, which was broken by the fall, and is still continued by our Enmity and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, whilst we continue in our Natural, and unregenerate Estate. Now this is the greatest and most blessed design that ever God had in the world: an astonishing and invaluable mercy to men, as will clearly appear by considering these particulars following.</p>
               <p>First, That God should be reconciled after such a dreadful breach as the fall of man made, is wonderful: No sin, all things considered, was ever like to this sin: other sins like a single bullet kill particular persons, but this like a chain-shot cuts off multitudes, multitudes as the sand upon the sea shore which no man can number.</p>
               <p>If all the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> in their several generations should do nothing else but bewail and lament this sin of his whilst this world continues, yet would it not be enough lamented: for a man so newly Created out of nothing, and admitted the first moment into the highest order, Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a King over the works of Gods hands, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 5. a man perfect and upright, without the least inordinate motion, or sinful inclination: A man whose minde was most clear, bright and apprehensive of the will of God, whose will was free, and able to have easily put by the strongest temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: A man in a paradise of delights, where nothing was left to desire for advancing the happiness of soul or body: A man understanding himself to be a publick complexive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, carrying not only his own, but the happiness of the whole world in his hand: so soon, upon so slight a temptation, to violate the Law of his God, and involve himself and all his posterity with him in such a gulph of guilt and misery: all which he might so easily have prevented! O wonderful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing mercy, that ever God should think of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or have any purposes of peace towards so vile an Apostate creature as man!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54344:43"/>
Secondly, That God should be reconciled to <hi>men</hi> and not to <hi>Angels,</hi> a more high and excellent order of creatures, is yet more astonishing: when the Angels fell they were lost irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: no hand of mercy was stretched out to save one of those <hi>Myriads</hi> of excellent beings, but chains of darkness were immediately clapt on them, to reserve them to the judgment of the great day, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>That the milder attribute should be exercised to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and the severer attribute to the more excellent Creature, is just matter for eternal admiration: who would cast away vessels of gold, and save earthen potsherds! Some indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to shew us the reasons why the wisdom of God made no provision for the recovery of <hi>Angels</hi> by a <hi>Mediator</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: partly from the high degree of the malignity of their sin, who sinned in the light of heaven, partly because it was decent that the first breach of the Divine Law should be punished, to secure obedience for the future. And besides, the Angelical nature was not entirely lost, <hi>Myriads</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> still continuing in their innocency and glory: whenas all mankind was lost in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must remember still the Law made no distinction, but awarded the same punishment, and therefore it was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy alone that made the difference, and mercy for ever to be admired by men: how astonishing is the grace of God, that moves in a way of reconciliation to us, out of design to fill up the vacant places in heaven from which Angels fell, with such poor worms as we are! Angels excluded, and men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. O stupendious mercy!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That God should be <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to men, so that no fury remains in him against us; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Scripture <hi>Isai.</hi> 27. 4. is still matter of farther wonder.</p>
               <p>The design he sends his <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to you about is not the allaying, and mitigating of his wrath, (which yet would be matter of great joy to the damned) but throughly to quench all his wrath, so that no degree thereof shall ever be felt by you. O blessed Embassy! <hi>Beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that bring such tydings.</hi> God offers you a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, a plenary remission.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That God should be <hi>freely</hi> reconciled to sinners and discharge them without any the least satisfaction to his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54344:43"/>
justice from them; is and for ever will be marvellous in their eyes.</p>
               <p>Oh what mercy would the damned account it if after a thousand years torments in hell God would at last be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, and put an end to their misery! But believers are discharged without bearing any part of the curse, not one farthing of that debt is levied upon them.</p>
               <p>If you say, how can this be, when God stands upon full <note place="margin">Object.</note> satisfaction to his Justice before any soul be discharged, and restored to savour? freely reconciled, and yet fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, how can this be?</p>
               <p>Very well, for this mercy comes freely to your hands, how <note place="margin">Solut.</note> costly soever it proved to Christ: and that free remission, and full satisfaction are not contradictory and inconsistent things, is plain enough from that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</hi> freely and yet in the way of redemption.</p>
               <p>For though Christ your surety have made satisfaction in your name and stead, yet it was his life, his blood, and not yours, that went for it, and this surety was of Gods own appointment and providing without your contrivement or thoughts. O blessed reconciliation, happy is the people that hear the joyful sound of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, That God should be finally reconciled to sinners, so that never any new breach shall happen betwixt him and them any more, so as to dissolve the League of friendship; is a most ravishing and transporting message.</p>
               <p>Two things give Confirmation and full security to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled ones, <hi>viz.</hi> The terms of the Covenant, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Mediator.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace gives great security to believers against new breaches betwixt God and them. It's said <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me.</hi> The fear of God is a choice preservative against second revolts, and therefore taken into the Covenant. It is no <hi>hindrance,</hi> but a special <hi>guard</hi> to assurance.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt of Gods faithfulness, that part of the promise is easily believed, that he will not turn away from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54344:44"/>
us to do us good, all the doubt is of the inconstancy of our hearts with God, and against that danger this promise makes provision.</p>
               <p>Moreover the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ in heaven secures the Saints in their reconciled state. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is the propitiation:</hi> he continually appears in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Father, <hi>as a Lamb that had been slain, Rev.</hi> 5. 6. And as the <hi>bow</hi> in the clouds, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 3. So that as long as Christ thus appears in the presence of God for us, it is not possible our state of Justification and reconciliation can be again dissolved.</p>
               <p>And this is that blessed <hi>Embassy</hi> Gospel Ministers are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about: he hath committed to them the word of this reconciliation.</p>
               <p>In the last place we are to enquire what and whence is this efficacy of preaching, to reconcile and bring home sinners to <note place="margin">3.</note> Christ.</p>
               <p>That its efficacy is great in convincing, humbling, and changing the hearts of men is past all debate and question. <hi>The weapons of our warfare</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. No heart so hard, no conscience so stupid, but this sword can pierce and wound: in an instant it can cast down all those vain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, and fond imaginations which the Carnal heart hath been building all its life long, and open a fair passage for Convictions of sin, and the fears and terrors of wrath to come into that heart that was never afraid of these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>When they heard this they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What shall we do?</hi> is the doleful cry of men at their wits end: the voice of one in deepest distress, and such outcries have been no rarities under the preaching of the word: its power hath been felt by persons of all orders and conditions: the great and honourable of the earth, as well as the poor and despicable. The learned and the ignorant, the civil and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54344:44"/>
the young and the old, all have felt the heart-piercing efficacy of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>If you ask whence hath the word preached this mighty power? The answer must be, Neither from it self, nor him that preaches it, but from the spirit of God whose instrument it is, by whose blessing and concurrence with it, it produceth its blessed effects upon the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>First, This Efficacy and wonderful power is not from the <note place="margin">1.</note> word it self: take it in an abstract notion, separated from the spirit, it can do nothing: it is called <hi>the foolishness of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. foolishness not only because the world so accounts it, but because in it self it is a weak and unsuitable, and therefore a very improbable way to reconcile the world to God: that the stony heart of one man should be broken by the words of another man, that one poor sinful Creature should be used to breath spiritual life into another, this could never be if this sword were not managed by an omnipotent hand.</p>
               <p>And besides, we know what works Naturally, works necessarily: if this Efficacy were inherent in the word, so that we should suppose it to work as other Natural agents do, then it must need convert all to whom it is at any time preached, except its effect were miraculously hindered, as the fire when it could not burn the three Children: but alas thousands hear it, that never feel the saving power of it, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It derives not this Efficacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the <hi>Instrument</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> by which it is ministred: let their gifts and abilities be what they will, it's impossible that ever such effects should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the strength of their Natural or gracious abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>We have this treasure</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This treasure of Gospel light is carried <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54344:45"/>
us of the truth I am here to prove, That the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the power is of God, and not of us: as it follows in the next words. To the same purpose speaks the same Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not any thing! what can be more diminutively spoken of the Gospel preachers? but we must not understand these words in a simple and <hi>absolute,</hi> but in a <hi>comparative</hi> and relative sence: not as if they were not necessary and useful in their place, but that how necessary soever they be, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts soever God hath furnished them with; yet it is neither in their power, nor choice to make the word they preach effectual to men: if it were, then the damnation of all that hear us must needs lye at our door: then also, many thousands would have been reconciled to God, which are yet in the state of enmity, but the effect of the Gospel is not in our power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But whatever efficacy it hath to reconcile men to God, it derives from the spirit of God, whose Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">3.</note> and blessing (which is arbitrarily dispensed) gives it all the fruit it hath.</p>
               <p>Ministers, saith one <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Anthony Burges.</note>, are like Trumpets which make no sound, if breath be not breathed into them. Or like <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> wheels, which move not, unless the spirit move them: or like <hi>Elisha's</hi> servant, whose presence doth no good except <hi>Elisha's</hi> spirit be there also: for want of the spirit of God, how many thousands of souls do find the Ministry to be nothing to them? If it be <hi>something</hi> to the purpose to any soul, it is the Lord that makes it so. This spirit is not limited by mens gifts or parts: he concurrs not only with their labours who have excellent gifts, but ostentimes blesses mean despicable gifts, with far greater success: beautiful <hi>Rachel</hi> is barren, and blear-ey'd <hi>Leah</hi> bears children. <note place="margin">Ex duobus aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te jam grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus impiis; cur iste ita vocetu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Is the Preaching of the Gospel by Christs <hi>Ambassadors</hi> the way which God takes to reconcile sinners to himself? <hi>Then how inexcusable are all those that continue in their state of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, though the Ambassadors of peace have been with them all their lives long, wooing and beseeching them to be reconciled to God?</hi>

                     <p>Well, be you assured, that God hath both the glass of your time, and the vials of his wrath by him: and so much of his abused patience as runs out of one, so much of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed wrath runs into the other: there is a time when this Treaty of peace will end, when the Master of the house will rise up, and the doors be shut, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25.

                  <head>3. Use of Exhortation.</head>
                  <p>Lastly, This point deserves a close vigorous applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3. Use.</note> in a threefold exhortation.</p>
                  <p>First, To Christs Ambassadors who treat with Souls in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their reconciliation with God</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To those that are yet in their enmity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled state.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to those that have embraced the terms of peace, and submitted to the Gospel overtures.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>To the Ambassadors of reconciliation.</hi> God hath put a <note place="margin">1.</note> great deal of honour upon you in this high and noble imployment: great is the dignity of your office, to some you are <hi>the savour of death unto death, and to others the savour of life unto life; and who is sufficient for these things?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. But yet the <hi>Duty</hi> is no less than the dignity. O what manner of men should we be for judgement, seriousness, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, patience, and exemplary holiness to whom the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of so great a Concern betwixt God and man is committed!</p>
                  <p>First, for <hi>Judgment</hi> and prudence, how necessary is it in so weighty and difficult a business as this! He had need be a man of wisdom that is to inform the ignorant of the nature and necessity of this great work, and win over their hearts to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54344:49"/>
consent to the Articles of peace propounded in the Gospel: that hath so many subtil temptations to answer, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intricate cases of conscience to resolve: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strong holds of Satan to be battered, and many stout and obstinate resistances made by the hearts of sinners which must be overcome; and he had need be no <hi>Novice</hi> in religion to whom so difficult a province is committed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us be <hi>Serious</hi> in our work as well as judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Remember O ye <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of Christ, you bring a message from the God of heaven of everlasting consequence to the souls of men. The eternal decrees are executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in your Ministry: to some you are the <hi>savour of life unto life, and to some the savour of death unto death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. Heaven and hell are matters of most awful and solemn Consideration. O what an account have we also shortly to give unto him that sent us!</p>
                  <p>These are matters of such deep Concernment as should swallow up our very spirits, the least they can do is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our hearts unto seriousness in the management of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be filled with tender affections toward the souls <note place="margin">Vide Bowles pastor Evang. p. 136.</note> of men with whom you treat for reconciliation: you had need be men of <hi>bowels</hi> as well as men of <hi>brains:</hi> you see a multitude of poor souls upon the brink of eternal misery, and they know it not, but promise themselves peace, and fill themselves with vain hopes of heaven: and is there a more moving, melting spectacle in the world than this! O think with what bowels of Commiseration <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were filled, when the one desired rather to be blotted out of Gods Book, and the other to be accursed from Christ, than that <hi>Israel</hi> should not be saved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 33. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. Think how the Bowels of Christ yearned over <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Matth.</hi> 23. 37. and over the multitude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 36. Let the same mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be <hi>patient</hi> and long-suffering towards sinners: such is the value of one soul, that it's worth waiting all our days to save it at last: <hi>the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. The Lord waits with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54344:49"/>
patience upon sinners, and well may you. Consider your selves, how long was God treating with you, ere you were won to him? Be not discouraged if success present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer not expectation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, be sure to back your Exhortations with drawing <hi>examples,</hi> else you may preach out your last breath before you gain one soul to God. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the Carnal hearts of your hearers will put hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances enough in the way of your labours, don't you put the greatest of all your selves. O study not only to preach exactly, but to live exactly, let the misplacing of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in your lives trouble you more, than the misplacing of words in your discourses: this is the way to succeed in your Embassy, and give up your account with joy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The exhortation speaks to all those that are <note place="margin">2.</note> yet in a state of enmity and unreconciled to God unto this day. O that may words might prevail, and that you would now be intreated to be reconciled to God! The <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of peace are yet with you, the <hi>treaty</hi> is not yet ended, the Master of the house is not yet risen up, nor the door of mercy and hope finally shut: hitherto God hath waited to be gracious, O that the long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God might be your salvation: a day is hasting when God will treat with you no more, when <hi>a gulph shall be fixed</hi> betwixt him and you for ever, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 25. O what will you do when the season of mercy and all hopes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shall end together! When God shall become inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible, inexorable and unreconcilable to you for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>O what wilt thou do when thou shalt find thy self shut up under eternal wrath: when thou shalt feel that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thou art now warned of! is this the place where I must be, are these the torments I must endure, what for ever! Yea, for ever: will not God be satisfied with the sufferings of a thousand years? No, nor of Millions of years! Ah sinners, did you but clearly see the present and future misery of unreconciled ones, and what that wrath of the great and terrible God is which is coming as fast as the wings of time can bring it upon you; it would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drive you to Christ, or drive you out of your wits.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54344:50"/>
O 'tis a dreadful thing to have God for your eternal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: to have the great and terrible God setting on work his infinite power to avenge the abuse of his grace and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Believe it friends, it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: knowing the terrors of the Lord we perswade men: an eternal weight hangs upon an inch of time. O that you did know the time of your visitation! That you would not dare to adventure, and run the hazard of one day more in an unreconciled state.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and Lastly, This point speaks to those who <note place="margin">3.</note> have believed our report, who have taken hold of Gods strength, and made peace with him: who had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, but now have obtained mercy: who once were afar off, but now are made nigh by the blood of Christ: with you I would leave a few words of exhortation, and I have done.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Admire and stand amaz'd at this mercy. I will praise thee O Lord,</hi> (saith the Church <hi>Isai.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me.</hi> O how overwhelming a mercy is here before you! God is at peace, at peace with you that were <hi>enemies in your minds by wicked works, Colos.</hi> 1. 21. at peace with you, and at enmity with Millions as good by nature as you: at peace with you that sought it not: at peace for ever, no dissolving this friendship for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. O let this Consideration thaw your hearts before the Lord and make you cry, What am I Lord that mercy should take in me, and shut out fallen Angels, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men and women as capable of mercy as my self! O the riches! O the depths of the mercy and goodness of God!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Beware of New breaches with God:</hi> God will speak <hi>peace to his people and to his Saints, but let not them return any more to folly, Psal.</hi> 85. 8. What if this state of friendship can never be <hi>dissolved,</hi> yet it is a dreadful thing to have it <hi>clouded:</hi> you may lose the sense of peace, and with it all the joy of your hearts and comforts of your lives in this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54344:50"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Labour to reconcile others to God,</hi> Especially those that are endeared to you by the bonds of Natural rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: When <hi>Paul</hi> was reconciled to God himself, his heart was full of heaviness for others that were not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, for his brethren and kinsinen according to the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 2, 3. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was become Gods friend himself, then, O <hi>that Ishmael might live before thee! Gen.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and Lastly, <hi>let your reconciliation with God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you under all burdens of affliction you shall meet with in your way to heaven:</hi> let them that are at enmity with God droop under Crosses and afflictions, but don't you do so. <hi>Tranquillus deus tranquillat omnia. Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. Let the peace of God keep your hearts and minds. As nothing can comfort a man that must to Hell at last, so nothing should deject a man that shall through many troubles win heaven at last.</p>

               <q>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR last discourse informed you of the usefulness &amp; influence of the preaching of the Gospel in order to the <hi>Application</hi> of Christ to the souls of men: there must be (in Gods Ordinary way) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ministerial offer of Christ, before men can have Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</p>
            <p>But yet all the preaching in the world can never effect this Union with Christ, in it self, and in its own vertue, except a supernatural and mighty power go forth with it for that end and purpose. Let <hi>Boanerges</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> try their strength, let the <hi>Angels</hi> of heaven be the preachers; till God draw, the soul cannot come to Christ.</p>
            <p>No saving benefit is to be had by Christ without Union with his person, no Union with his person without faith, no faith ordinarily wrought without the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by Christs <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> their preaching hath no saving efficacy without Gods drawings; as will evidently appear
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54344:51"/>
by considering these words and the occasion of them.</p>
            <p>The occasion of these words is found (as Learned <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> well observes) in the 42. <hi>verse. And they said, Is not this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cameronis My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothes. <hi>p.</hi> 139.</note> 
               <hi>the son of Joseph, whose Father and Mother we know?</hi> Christ had been pressing upon them in his ministry the great and necessary duty of faith, but notwithstanding the <hi>Authority</hi> of the preacher, the <hi>holiness</hi> of his life, the <hi>miracles</hi> by which he confirmed his <hi>doctrine,</hi> they still objected against him, <hi>is not this the Carpenters. Son?</hi> from whence Christ takes the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of these words: <hi>No man can come unto me except my Father which hath sent me draw him:</hi> q. d. In vain is the Authority of my person urged, in vain are all the miracles wrought in your sight to confirm the doctrine preached to you, till that secret almighty power of the Spirit be put forth upon your hearts, you will not, you cannot come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
            <p>The words are a Negative proposition.</p>
            <p>In which the Author and powerful manner of divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in working faith are contained: there must be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before believing, and that drawing must be the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God: every word hath its weight, we will consider them in the order they lye in the Text.</p>

                     <item>5. Finally.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, This blessed work is carried on by the Spirit <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually,</hi> bringing the soul step by step in the due method and order of the Gospel to Christ: illumination, conviction, compunction prepare the way to Christ; and then faith unites the soul to him: without humiliation there can be no faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 32. <hi>ye repented not, that ye might believe:</hi> 'tis the burdensome sense of sin that brings the soul to Christ for rest, Mat. 11. 28. <hi>come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden:</hi> but without Conviction there can be no Compunction, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; he that is not convinced of his sin and misery, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bewails it nor mourns for it: never was there one tear of true repentance seen to drop from the eye of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced sinner.</p>
               <p>And without <hi>illumination</hi> there can be no Conviction, for what is Conviction but the application of the light which is in the understanding or mind of a man to his heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. In this order therefore the Spirit (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) draws souls to Christ, he shines into their minds by illumination, applys that light to their Consciences by effectual Conviction, breaks and wounds their hearts for sin in Compunction, and then moves the will to embrace and close with Christ in the way of Faith for life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>These several steps are more distinctly discerned in some Christians than in others; they are more clearly to be seen in the <hi>Adult Convert,</hi> than those that were drawn to Christ in their youth; in such as were drawn to him out of a state of prophaneness, than those that had the advantage of a pious education; but in this order the work is carried on ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all, however it differ in point of clearness in the one, and in the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He draws sinners to Christ <hi>Congruously,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeably to the nature and way of man. So he speaks,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54344:54"/>

                  <hi>of love:</hi> not as beasts are drawn, but as men are inclined and wrought to complyance by rational Conviction of their Judgements, and powerful perswasion of their wills; the minds of sinners are naturally blinded by ignorance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and their affections bewitched to their Lusts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. and whilst it is thus, no arguments of intreaties can possibly prevail to bring them off from the ways of sin to Christ.</p>
               <p>The way therefore which the Lord takes to win and draw them to Christ, is by rectifying their false apprehensions, and shewing them infinitely more good in Christ than in the Creature, and in their Lusts, yea, by satisfying their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings that there is goodness enough in Jesus Christ, to whom he is drawing them,</p>
               <p>First, To outbid all temporal good, which is to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his sake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To preponderate all temporal evils which are to be suffered for his sake.</p>
               <p>First, That there is more good in Christ than in all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things, which we are to deny or forsake upon his account: this being once clearly and convincingly discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the understanding, the will is thereby prepared to quit all that which entangles and with holds it from coming to Christ: there is no man that loves money so much, but he will willingly part with it for that which is more worth to him than the sum he parts with to purchase it: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 45, 46. <hi>The Kingdome of heaven is like to a Merchant man, seeking goodly Pearls, who when he hath found one Pearl of great price, goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such an invaluable <hi>Pearl</hi> is Jesus Christ, infinitely more worth than all that a poor sinner hath to part with for him, and is a more <hi>real</hi> good than the creature. These are but vain shadows, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5. Christ is a solid substantial good: yea, he is, and by Conviction appears to be a more <hi>suitable</hi> good than the creature: the world cannot justifie and save, but Christ can. Christ is a more <hi>necessary</hi> good than the creature, this is for our temporal <hi>Conveniency,</hi> but he of eternal <hi>necessity.</hi> He is a more <hi>Durable</hi> good than any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54344:54"/>
comfort is or can be: <hi>the fashion of this world passeth away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. but durable riches and righteousness are in him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. Thus Christ appears in the day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction infinitely more excellent than the world, he out-bids all the offers that the world can make, and this gives the main stroke to this work, of drawing a Soul to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And then (to remove every block out of the way to Christ) God discovers to the Soul enough in him to preponderate and much more than recompence all the evils and sufferings it can endure for his sake.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they that close with Christ, close with his <hi>cross</hi> also: they must expect to save no more but their souls by him: he tells us what we must trust to, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26, 27. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters; yea, and his own life also; he cannot be my disciple: and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To read such a Text as this with such a Comment upon it as Satan and our own flesh can make, is enough to scare a man from Christ for ever: nor is it possible by all the arguments in the world to draw any soul to Christ upon such terms as these, till the Lord convince it, that there is enough, and much more than enough in Jesus Christ to recompence all these sufferings and losses we endure for him.</p>
               <p>But when the soul is satisfied that these sufferings are but <hi>external</hi> upon the vile <hi>body,</hi> but the benefit that comes by Christ is <hi>internal</hi> in a mans-own <hi>soul,</hi> These afflictions are but <hi>temporal, Rom.</hi> 8. 18. but Christ and his benefits are <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> this must need prevail with the <hi>will</hi> to come over to Christ notwithstanding all the evils of suffering that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, when the reality of all this is discovered by the Lord, and the power of God goes along with these discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Thus the Lord draws in our own way, by rational Convictions of the understanding and allurements of the will.</p>
               <p>And it's possible this may be the reason why some poor souls mis-judge the workings of the Spirit of God upon them selves, thinking they never had that wonderful and mighty power of God in conversion acting upon their hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54344:55"/>
they find all that is done upon their hearts that way, is done in the ordinary course and method of Nature: they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, compare, are convinced, and then resolve to choose Christ and his ways; whereas they expect to feel some strange opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that shall have the visible Characters of the immediate power of God upon them, and such a power they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, if they would consider it as working in this way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: but they cannot distinguish Gods acts from their own, and that puzzles them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The drawings of the Father are very <hi>powerful. The arm of the Lord is revealed in this work, Isa.</hi> 53. 1. It was a powerful word indeed that made the light at first shine out of darkness, and no less power is required to make it shine into our hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. That day in which the soul is made willing to come to Christ, is call'd <hi>the day of his power, Psal.</hi> 110. 3. The Scripture expresseth the work of conversion by a threefold <hi>Metaphor.</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>That of a <hi>resurrection</hi> from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Creation, Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. And</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Victory</hi> or Conquest, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. All these set forth the infinite power of God in this work, for no less than almighty power is required to each of them; and if you strictly examine the distinct notions, you shall find the power of God more and more illustriously display'd in each of them.</p>
               <p>To raise the dead is the effect of almighty power, but then there surrection suppseth pre-existent matter. In the work of <hi>creation,</hi> there is no pre-existent matter, but then there is no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: that which is not, rebels not against the power that gives it being. But <hi>Victory</hi> and Conquest supposes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, all the power of corrupt Nature arming it self and fighting against God, but yet not able to frustrate his design.</p>

And certainly if we consider how deep the soul is rooted by natural inclination, and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed custome in sin, how extreamly averse it is to the ways of strict godliness and mortification, how Satan that invidious enemy, that strong man armed fortifies the soul to defend his possession against Christ, and intrenches himself in the understanding, will, and affections; by deep rooted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices against Christ and holiness, it is the wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to see a soul quitting all its beloved lusts and fleshly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and endearments, and coming willingly under Christs yoak.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The drawings of God are very <hi>effectual:</hi> there is indeed a Common and <hi>ineffectual</hi> work upon hypocrites and <hi>Apostates,</hi> call'd in Scripture <hi>a morning cloud,</hi> an <hi>early dew, Hosea</hi> 6. 4. these may believe for a time, and fall away at last, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. their wills may be half won, they may be drawn half way to Christ, and return again. So it was with <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26. 28. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> thou perswadest me to be a Christian: but in Gods elected ones it is effectual: their wills are not only <hi>almost,</hi> but <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> perswaded to embrace Christ, and quit the ways of sin, how pleasant, gainful and dear soever they have been to them: the Lord not only draws, but draws home those souls to Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>all that the Father hath given me, shall come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is confessed, that in the drawing home of the very elect to Christ, there may be and frequently are many pauses, stands, and demurrs, they have convictions, affections and resolutions stirring in them, which like early blossoms seem to be nipt and dye away again. There is frequently (in young ones especially) an hopeful appearance of grace, they make conscience of sins, and duties: they have sometimes notable rouzings and awakenings under the word, they are observed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54344:56"/>
to affect retirements for meditation and prayer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be in the company of Christians, and after all this, youthful lusts and vanities are found to stifle and choak these hopeful beginnings, and the work seems to stand (it may be some years) at a pause, however at last the Lord makes it victorious over all opposition, and sets it home with power upon their hearts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To conclude, Those whom the Father draws to Christ he draws to him <hi>finally</hi> and for ever. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11. 29. They are so as to God the giver, he never repents that he hath called his people into the fellowship of his Son Christ Jesus: and they are so on the believers part, he is never sorry, whatever he afterwards meets with, that he is come to Christ.</p>
               <p>There is a time when Christians are drawn to Christ, but there shall never be a time in which they shall be drawn away from Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 29. there's no plucking them out of the Fathers hand. It was common to a Proverb in the Primitive times; when they would express an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>you may as soon draw a Christian from Christ, as do it:</hi> when Christ asked that question of the disciples, <hi>Will ye also go away? Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of them all) <hi>to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life; Joh.</hi> 6. 68. They that are thus drawn do with full purpose of heart cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. And thus of the manner and quality of effectual drawing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the last place, I am to evince the impossibility of coming to Christ without the Fathers drawings: and this <note place="margin">

               <p>First, If all the power of nature were imploy'd in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, yet such are the difficulties of this work, that it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts all the abilities of nature: this the Scripture roundly and plainly affirms, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>by grace are ye saved through</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1.</note> which is naturally as indisposed to this work as the wood which <hi>Elijah</hi> laid in order upon the <hi>Altar</hi> was to catch fire, when he had poured so much water upon it as did not only wet the wood, but also fill'd up the trench round about it, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 33. For it's naturally a dark, blind, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant heart, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. and such an heart can never believe, till he that commanded the light to shine out of darkness, do shine into it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>Nor will it avail any thing to say, though man be born in darkness and ignorance, yet afterwards he may acquire knowledge in the use of means, as we see many natural men do in a very high degree: for this is not that light that brings the soul to Christ, yea, this natural unsanctified light blinds the soul and prejudices it more against Christ than ever it was before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 26.</p>
               <p>As it is a blind and ignorant heart, so it's a <hi>selfish heart</hi> by nature: all its designs and aims terminate in Self: this is the <hi>Centre</hi> and weight of the soul, no righteousness but its own is sought after, that, or none, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. now for a soul to renounce and deny Self in all its forms, modes, and interests, as every one doth that cometh to Christ; To disclaim and deny natural, moral, and religious Self and come to Christ, as a poor, miserable, wretched, empty creature; to live upon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54344:57"/>
his righteousness for ever, is as supernatural and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to see the hills and mountains start from their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Centres, and flye like wandering Atomes in the Air.</p>
               <p>Nay this heart which is to come to Christ is not only dark and selfish, but full of pride. O'tis a desperate proud heart by nature, it cannot submit to come to Christ as <hi>Benhadads</hi> servants came to the <hi>King of Israel</hi> with sackcloath on their loyns, and ropes upon their heads. To take guilt, shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of face to our selves, and acknowledge the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in our eternal damnation; to come to Christ naked and empty as one that justifies the ungodly; I say na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture left to it self, would as soon be damned as do this: the proud heart can never come to this, till the Lord have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and broken it by his power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us take the <hi>Act</hi> of faith into consideration also, as it is here described, by the souls <hi>coming to Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> and you will find a necessity of the Fathers drawings, for this evidently implies that which is <hi>against the stream</hi> and current of corrupt nature, and that which is <hi>above the Sphere</hi> and capacity of the most refined and accomplished nature.</p>
               <p>First, It's against the Stream and Current of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come to Christ. For let us but consider the <hi>Term from which</hi> the soul departs when it comes to Christ. In that day it leaves all its lusts and ways of sin, how pleasant, sweet and profitable soever they have been unto it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord: way</hi> and <hi>thoughts, (i. e.)</hi> both the practice and delight of sin, must be forsaken, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward man must be cleansed from it. Now there are in the bosomes of unregenerate men such darling Lusts, that have given them so much <hi>practical,</hi> and <hi>speculative</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which have brought so much profit to them, which have been born and bred up with them, and which upon all these accounts are endeared to their souls to that degree; that it's easier for them to dye, than to forsake them: yea, nothing is more common among such men, than to venture eternal damnation, rather than suffer a separation from their sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54344:57"/>
And which is yet much more difficult in coming to Christ, the soul forsakes not only its <hi>sinful self,</hi> but its <hi>righteous self: (i. e.)</hi> not only its worst sins, but its best performances, accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and excellencies. Now this is one of the greatest straits that Nature can be put to: righteousness by works was the first liquor that ever was put into the vessel, and it still retains the tang and savour of it, and will to the end of the world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>For they being ignorant os Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they have not <hi>submitted:</hi> to come naked and empty to Christ and receive all from him as a free gift, is to proud corrupt nature, the greatest abasement and submission in the world.</p>
               <p>Let the gospel furnish its Table with the richest and costliest dainties that ever the blood of Christ purchased, such is the pride of nature, that it disdains to tast them; except it may also pay the reckoning. If the old <hi>Hive</hi> be removed from the place where it was wont to stand, the <hi>Bees</hi> will come home to the old place, yea, and many of them you shall find will dye there, rather than go to the <hi>Hive</hi> though it stand in a far better place than it did before. Just so stands the case with men. The <hi>Hive</hi> is removed, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we are no more to expect righteousness as <hi>Adam</hi> did, by obeying and working, but by believing, and coming to Christ; but nature had as lieve be damned as do this: it still goes about to establish its own righteousness.</p>
               <p>Vertues, Duties, and Moral excellencies these are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of nature, here is Nature set off in its sumptuous attire and rich embellishments, and now to renounce it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and contemn it as dross and dung in comparison of Christ as believers do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. this I say is against the grain of nature. We reckon it the strange effect of self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal in <hi>Mahomet the Great,</hi> who being so enamoured with his beautiful <hi>Irene,</hi> would be perswaded upon reasons of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Knowles</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Turks.</note> State with his own hand to strike off her head, and that when she appeared in all her rich ornaments before him, rather like such a <hi>Goddess</hi> as the Poets in their ecstasies use to feign, than a mortal creature: and yet certainly this nothing is to that self denyal which is exercised in our coming to Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54344:58"/>
Secondly, And if we look to the other <hi>Term</hi> to which the soul moves, we shall find it acting as much above the <hi>Sphere</hi> and ability of improved Nature as here it acts and moves against the stream and current of corrupted nature: for how wonderful and supernatural an adventure is that which the soul makes in the day that it comes to Jesus Christ!</p>
               <p>Surely for any poor soul to venture it self for ever upon Jesus Christ whom it never saw, nay, upon Christ whose very existence its own unbelief calls into question whether he be, or no: and that when it's even weighed down to the dust with the burdensome sense of its own vileness and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal unworthiness, feeling nothing in it self but sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the workings of death and fears of wrath: to go to Christ of whose pardoning grace and mercy it never had any the least experience, nor can find any ground of hope in it self that it shall be accepted; this is as much above the power of nature, as it is for a stone to rise from the earth and fix it self among the Stars: well might the <hi>Apostle</hi> ascribe it to that almighty power which raised up Christ from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. if the Lord draw not the Soul, and that with an omnipotent pull, it can never come from it self to Christ. And yet farther,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Natural impossibility of coming to Christ will more clearly appear, if we consider the <hi>enemies</hi> to faith, or what blocks are roll'd by Satan and his instruments into the way to Christ: to mention (in this place) no more, but our own carnal reason as it's armed and managed by the subtilty of <hi>Satan;</hi> what a wonder is it that any soul should come to Christ?</p>
               <p>These are the strong holds (mentioned 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.) out of which those objections, fears and discouragements sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by which the soul is fiercely assaulted in the way to Christ.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou forsake all thy pleasures, merry company, and sensible comforts to live a sad, retired, pensive life? wilt thou begger and undo thy self, let go thy comforts in hand for an hope of that which thine eyes never saw, nor hast thou any certainty that it's any more than a fancy? wilt thou that hast lived in reputation and credit all thy life, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54344:58"/>
the scorn and contempt of the world? thinkest thou thy self able to live such a strict, severe, mortified and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying a life, as the word of God requires? and what if persecution should arise, (as thou must expect it will) canst thou forsake father and mother, wife and children, yea, and give up thine own life too to a cruel and bloody death? be advised better before thou resolve in so important a matter: what thinkest thou of thy fore-fathers, that lived and dyed in that way thou art now leaving? art thou wiser than they? do not the generality of men walk in the same paths thou hast hitherto walked in? if this way lead to hell as thou fearest it may; think then how many millions of men must perish as well as thy self, and is such a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consistent with the gracious and merciful nature of God? Besides, think what sort of people those are unto whom thou art about to joyn thy self in this new way? are there not to be found among them many things to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thee and cool thy zeal? they are generally of the lower and baser sort of men, poor and despicable: seest thou not though their profession be holy, how earthly, carnal, proud, factious, and hypocritical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are found to be! and doubtless the rest are like them, though their hypocrisie be not yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>O what stands, and demurrs! what hesitations, and doubts is the soul clog'd with in its way to Christ! but yet none of these can with-hold and detain the soul; when the Father draws: greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world: and thus you see the nature, manner, and efficacy of divine drawings, and how impossible it is for any Soul to come to Christ without them.</p>

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54344:59"/>
Life is desirable in every mans eyes, and eternal is the most excellent life; yet in this the world is agreed rather to dye and perish for ever than come to Christ for life. Had Christ told us of Fields and Vineyards, Sheep and Oxen, Gold and Silver, honours and sensual pleasures, who would not have come to him for these? but to tell them of mortification, self-denyal, strictness of life, and sufferings for his sake, and all this for an happiness to be enjoyed in the world to come, nature will never like such a proposition as this.</p>
                  <p>You see where it sticks, not in a simple inability to believe, but in an inability complicated with enmity, they neither can come, nor will come to Christ: 'tis true, all that do come to Christ come willingly, but thanks to the grace of God that hath freed and perswaded the will, else they had never been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come: who ever found his own heart first stir and move towards Christ? how long may we wait and expect before we shall feel our hearts naturally burn with desires after, and love to Jesus Christ?</p>
                  <p>This aversation of the will and affections from God is one of the master roots of original sin. No argument can prevail to bring the soul to Christ, till this be master'd and overpowred by the Fathers drawings. In our motions to sin we need <hi>trig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:</hi> but in all our motions to Christ we as much need <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He that comes to heaven may say, Lord if I had had my own way and will I had never come here: if thou hadst not drawn me I should never have come to thee. O the riches of the grace of God! oh unparallel'd mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! not only to prepare such a glory as this for an <hi>unworthy</hi> soul, but to put forth the exceeding greatness of thy power afterwards to draw an <hi>unwilling</hi> soul to the enjoyment of it!</p>

O how many have been thus discouraged in their way to Christ, by their carnal relations, I cannot say friends! their greatest enemies have been the men of their own house: these have pleaded (as if the Devil had hired and fee'd them) against the everlasting welfare of their own flesh. O cruel parents, brethren, and sisters; that jeer, frown, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; where they should encourage, assist and rejoyce! such <hi>parents</hi> are the Devils <hi>children. Satan</hi> chuses such instruments as you are above all others for this work: he knows that influence and authority you have upon them, and over them: and what fear, love, and dependance they have for you, and upon you: so that none in all the world are like to manage the design of their damnation so effectually as you are like to do it.</p>
                  <p>Will you neither come to Christ your selves, nor suffer your dear relations that would? had you rather find them in the <hi>Ale-house,</hi> than in the Closet? did you instrumentally give them their being, and will you now be the instruments of ruining for ever those beings they had from you? did you so earnestly desire children, so tenderly nurse and provide for them, take such delight in them, and after all this do what in you lies to damn and destroy them? if these lines shall fall into any such hands, O that God would set home the conviction and sense of this horrid evil upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>And no less guilty of this sin are scandalous and Ioose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors who serve to furnish the Devil with the greatest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath to dissuade men from coming to Christ: 'tis your looseness and hypocrisie by which he hopes to scare others from Christ.

First, We will enquire into the nature and properties of <note place="margin">1.</note> this life, and discover (as we are able) what it is. And we find it to consist in that <hi>wonderful change which the Spirit of God makes upon the frame and temper of the soul, by his infusing or implanting the principles of grace in all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A change it makes upon the soul, and that a marvellous one, no less than from death to life, for though a man be <hi>physically</hi> a living man, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his natural soul hath Union with his body, yet his soul having no Union with Christ, he is <hi>Theologically</hi> a dead man, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. alas it deserves not the name of life, to have a soul serving only to season and preserve the body a little while from stinking: to carry it up and down the world, and only enable it to eat and drink and talk and laugh, and then dye: then do we begin to live, when we begin to have Union with Christ the fountain of life by his Spirit communicated to us: from this time we are to reckon our life <note n="*" place="margin">Hic jacet Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis cujus ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas multorum annorum fuit, ipse septem dum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taxat annos vixit.</note> as some have done: there be many changes made upon men besides this, many are changed from prophaneness to Civility, and from meer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility to formality and a shadow of Religion, who still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the state and power of spiritual death notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when the Spirit of the Lord is poured out upon us to quicken us with the new spiritual life, this is a wonderful change indeed: it gives us an <hi>Esse supernaturale,</hi> a new super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural being, which is therefore call'd <hi>a new creature, the new man, the hidden man of the heart:</hi> the natural essence and faculties of the soul remain still, but it is devested of the old qualities, and endowed with new ones, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>old things are past away, behold all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this change is not made by altering and rectifying the disorders of the life only, leaving the temper and frame of the heart still carnal; but by the infusion of a supernatural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent principle into the soul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>it shall be in him a well of water:</hi> principles are to a course of actions as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or springs are to the streams and rivers that flow from them, and are maintain'd by them: and hence is the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and constancy of renewed souls in the course of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:54344:65"/>
Nor is this principle or habit <hi>acquired</hi> by accustoming our selves to holy actions, as natural habits are acquired by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts, which beget a <hi>disposition,</hi> and thence grow up to an <hi>habit</hi> or second nature; but it is infused or implanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soul by the Spirit of God. So we read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26. <hi>a new heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you:</hi> it grows not up out of our Natures, but is put, or infused into us: as it's said of the two witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. who lay dead in a <hi>Civil sense</hi> three days and an half, that <hi>the Spirit of life from God entered into them;</hi> so it is here in a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual sense,</hi> the spirit of life from God enters into the dead, carnal heart: it's all by way of supernatural infusion.</p>
               <p>Nor is it limited to this or that faculty of the soul, but grace or life is poured into all the faculties: <hi>behold all things are become new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. The understanding, will, thoughts, and affections are all renewed by it: the whole inner man is changed, yea, the tongue and hand, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and actions, even all the ways and courses of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man are renewed by it.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, we shall discern the nature of this spiritual life, by considering the properties of it, among which these are very remarkable.</p>
               <p>First, The soul that is joyned to Christ, is quickened with a <hi>divine life,</hi> so we read in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. where believers are said to be partakers or consorts of the <hi>divine nature:</hi> a very high expression, and warily to be understood. <hi>Partakers of the divine nature,</hi> not <hi>essentially,</hi> so it's wholly incommunicable to the Creature, nor yet <hi>Hypostatically</hi> and personally, so Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was a partaker of it, but our participation of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must be understood in a way proper to believers, that is to say, we partake of it by the inhabitation of the Spirit of God in us: according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> the Spirit who is God by nature, dwells in and actuates the soul whom he regenerates, and by sanctifying causes it to live a <hi>divine life:</hi> from this life of God the unsanctified are said to be alienated, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. but believers are partakers of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And being divine, it must needs be the most <hi>excellent</hi> and transcendent life that any creature doth or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54344:65"/>
can live in this world: it surmounts the natural, rational, and moral life of the unsanctified, as much as the Angelical life excels the life that flyes and worms of the earth do live.</p>
               <p>Some think it a rare life to live in sensual pleasures, but the Scripture will not allow so much as the name of life to them; but tells us <hi>they are dead whilest they live,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. certainly it is a wonderful elevation of the nature of man, to be quickened with such a life as this. There are two ways wherein the blessed God hath honoured poor man above the very Angels of heaven. One was by the Hypostatical Union of our nature in Christ, with the divine nature; the other is by uniting our persons mystically to Christ, and thereby communicating spiritual life to us: this later is a most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priviledge, and in one respect a more singular mercy than the former; for that honour which is done to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Hypostatical Union, is common to all good and bad, even they that perish have yet that honour; but to be implanted into Christ by regeneration, and live upon him as the branch doth upon the Vine, this is a peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, a mercy hedg'd in from the world that is to perish, and only communicated to Gods elect, who are to live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with him in heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This life infused by the regenerating Spirit, is a most <hi>pleasant life.</hi> All delights, all pleasures, all joys, which are not phantastick and delusive, have their spring and origin here. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>to be spiritually minded is life and peace, (i. e.)</hi> a most serene placid life, such a soul becomes, so far as it is influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and sanctified by the Spirit, the very region of life and peace: when one thing is thus predicated of another <hi>in casu recto</hi> (saith a learned man) it speaks their intimate Connexion: peace is so connatural to this life, that you may either call it a life that hath peace in it, or a peace that hath life in it: yea it hath its enclosed pleasures in it, <hi>Such as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger intermeddles not with, Prov.</hi> 14. 10. Regeneration is the term from which all true pleasure commences, you never live a merry day, till you begin to live to God: therefore it's said <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24. when the <hi>prodigal son</hi> was returned to his Father and reconciled, then <hi>they began to be merry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:54344:66"/>
None can make another by any words to understand what that pleasure is which the renewed soul feels diffused through all its faculties and affections in its communion with the Lord, and in the sealings and witnessings of his Spirit. That is a very apt and well known similitude which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> used, and the Lord blessed to the conversion of that Noble Marquess <hi>Galeacius:</hi> If, said he, a man should see a company of people dancing upon the top of a remote hill, he would be apt to conclude they were a company of wild distracted people; but if he draw nearer and behold the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, and hear the ravishing sweet Musick that is among them, he will quickly alter his opinion of them, and fall a dancing himself with them.</p>
               <p>All the delights in the sensual-life, all the pleasure that ever your lusts gave you, are but as the putrid stinking waters of a corrupt pond, where Toads lye croaking and spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the Crystal streams of the most pure and pleasant fountain.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This life of God with which the regenerate are quickened in their Union with Christ as it is <hi>a pleasant,</hi> so it is also <hi>a growing increasing life. Joh.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>It shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not in our Sanctification, as it is in our Justification, our Justification is compleat and perfect, no defect is found there, but the new Creature labours under many defects: all believers are equally Justified, but not equally Sanctified: therefore you read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. that the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day: and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. Christians are exhorted to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: if this work were perfect and finished at once as Justification is, there could be no renewing day by day, nor growth in grace, <hi>perfectum est cui nihil deest, &amp; cui nihil addi potest:</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> indeed prays for the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that God would sanctifie them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—wholly, perfectly, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. and this is matter of prayer and hope, for at last it will grow up to perfection; but this perfect holiness is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the perfect state in the world to come, and none but <note n="*" place="margin">Perfectio Sanctificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in istha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </note> deluded proud spirits boast of it here: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10. and upon the imperfection of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54344:66"/>
new Creature in every faculty, that warfare and dayly conflict spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and experienced by every Christian is grounded: grace rises gradually in the soul as the Sun doth in the heavens, <hi>which shineth more and more unto a perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To Conclude, this life with which the regenerate are quickened, is an <hi>everlasting life. This is the record, that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his son,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11. this principle of life, is the seed of God, and that remains in the soul for ever, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. it is no transient vanishing thing, but a fixed permanent principle, which abides in the soul for ever; a man may lose his <hi>gifts,</hi> but grace abides: the soul may and must be separated from the body, but grace cannot be separated from the soul: when all forsake us, this sticks by us.</p>
               <p>This infused principle is therefore vastly different both from the extraordinary gifts of prophecie wherein the Spirit sometimes was said to come upon men, under the <hi>old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6, 10. and from the common vanishing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects he sometimes produceth in the unregenerate, of which we have frequent accounts in the <hi>new Testament, Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. it's one thing for the Spirit to come upon a man in the way of present influence and assistance, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to dwell in a man as his Temple.</p>
               <p>And thus of the nature and quality of this blessed work of the Spirit in quickening us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Having seen the nature and properties of the spiritual life, we are concerned in the next place to enquire <note place="margin">2.</note> into the way and manner in which it is wrought, and infused by the Spirit: and here we must say,</p>
               <p>First of all, That the work is wrought in the soul very <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriously,</hi> so Christ tells <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit:</hi> there be many opinions among <hi>Philosophers</hi> about the original of winds, but we have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it: we deseribe it by its effects and properties, but know little of its original: and if the works of God in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be so abstruse and unsearchable, how much more are these sublime and supernatural works of the Spirit so?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:54344:67"/>
We are not able to solve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of nature, we can give no account of our own formation in the womb, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 5. who can exactly describe how the parts of the body are formed and the soul infused? <hi>it's curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth,</hi> as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 16. but how we know not. <hi>Basil</hi> saith divers questions may be moved about a <hi>Fly,</hi> which may pose the greatest <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher:</hi> we know little of the forms and essences of natural things, much less of these profound, and abstruse spiritual things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But though we cannot pry into these secrets by the eye of reason, yet God hath revealed this to us in his word, that it is wrought by his own almighty power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. The <hi>Apostle</hi> ascribes this work to the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the power of God: and this must needs be, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how the Spirit of God expresses it in Scripture by a new Creation: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a giving being to something out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. In this it differs from all the effects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, for man always works upon some pre-existent matter, but here is no such matter: all that is in man, the <note place="margin">Ab uno desuper principio quod convenienter voluntati ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prima, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. Quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma pars ferri lapidis magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis spiritu mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur, per mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos annulos fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reos extensi: ita etiam qui sunt virtute praediti, divino spiritu attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, cum prima mansione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungantur, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inceps autem alii usque ad postremam. <hi>Glem. Alexan. Strom. lib.</hi> 7.</note> subject of this work, is only a passive capacity or receptivity, but nothing is found in him to contribute towards this work: this supernatural life is not, nor can it be educed out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles: this wholly transcends the Sphere of all natural power: but of this more anon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This also we may affirm of it, that this divine life is infused into all the natural faculties and powers of the soul, not one exempted. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. The whole soul and spirit is the recipient subject of it: and with respect to this general infusion into all the faculties and powers of the soul, it's call'd a new creature, a new man, having an integral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fullness of all its parts and members: it becomes light in the mind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. obedience in the will, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. in the affections an heavenly temper and tenderness, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and so is variously denominated, even as the Sea is from the several shores it washes, though it be one and the same Sea. And here we must observe lyes one main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a regenerate soul, and an hypocrite; the one is all of a piece, as I may say, the principle of spiritual life runs into all and every faculty and affection; and sanctifies or renews the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54344:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole man: whereas the change upon hypocrites is but partial and particular, he may have new light, but no new love, a new tongue, but not a new heart: this or that vice may be reformed, but the whole course of his life is not altered.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and lastly, This infusion of spiritual life is done <hi>instantaneously,</hi> as all <hi>Creation</hi> work is: hence it is resembled to that <hi>plastick power,</hi> which in a moment made the light to shine out of darkness, just so doth God shine into our hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, a soul may be a long time under the preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry works of the Spirit, he may be under Convictions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, purposes and resolutions a long time, he may be waiting at the pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> attending the means and ordinances, but when the Spirit comes once to quicken the soul, it's done in a moment: even as it is in the infusion of the rational soul, the body is long ere it be prepared and moulded, but when once the <hi>Embryo</hi> or matter is ready, it's quickned with the Spirit of life in an instant: so it is here: but O what a blessed moment is this! upon which the whole weight of our eternal happiness depends; for it is Christ in us, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Christ formed in us, who is the hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. and our Lord expressly tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be regenerate and born again, we cannot see the Kingdome of God. And thus of the way and manner of its infusion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let the design and end of God in this his <hi>quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work</hi> be next considered: for what end, and with what <note place="margin">3.</note> design and aim this work is wrought. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Scriptures in this matter, we shall find this principle of life is infused in order to our glorifying God in this world by <hi>a life of obedience,</hi> and our enjoying of God in the world to come.</p>
               <p>First, Spiritual life is infused in Order to a course of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this world, whereby God is glorified: so we read in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. Created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are to actions, as the root is to the fruit, it is for fruit sake that we plant the roots, and ingraff the branches. So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>a new spirit also will I put within you, and cause</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54344:68"/>
                  <hi>you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements and do them.</hi> This is the next or immediate design and end not only of the first infusion of the principle of life into the Soul, but of all the exciting, actuating and assisting works of the Spirit afterwards. Now this principle of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life infused hath a twofold influence into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>First, This makes it sincere and true obedience, when it flows from an inward vital principle of grace. The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is moved by something <hi>ab extra,</hi> from without, as the applause of men, the accommodation of fleshly interests, the force of education, or if there be any thing from within that moves him, it is but a self-interest, to quiet a grumbling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and support his vain hopes of heaven: but he never acts from a new principle, a new nature inclining him to holy actions. Sincerity mainly lyes in the harmony and correspondency of actions to their principles: from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused principle it is, that men hunger and thirst for God, and go to their Duties, as men do to their meals, when they find an empty craving stomach.</p>
               <p>O Reader, pause a little upon this ere thou pass on, ask thy heart whether it be so with thee: are holy duties connatural to thee? doth thy soul move and work after God by a kind of supernatural instinct? this then will be to thee a good evidence of thy integrity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From this infused principle of life, results the <hi>Excellency of our obedience,</hi> as well as the sincerity of it: for by vertue and reason thereof, it becomes <hi>free</hi> and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not forced and constrained, it drops like honey of its own accord out of the Comb, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 11. without squeezing: or as waters from the fountain without forcing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. An unprincipled professor must be squeez'd by some weight of affliction, ere he will yield one tear, or pour out a prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34. <hi>when he slew them, then they sought him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the freedome of obedience is the excellency of it, Gods eye is much upon that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17. yea, and the <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of our obedience, which is also a special part of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, results from hence: he that acts from a principle acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uently and uniformly, there is a proportion betwixt the parts
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54344:68"/>
of his Conversation: this is it which makes us holy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in all manner of Conversation, or in every creek and turning of our Conversations, as that word imports, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. whereas, he that is moved by this or that external-accidental motive must needs be up and down, off and on, very uneven, <hi>like the legs of a lame man,</hi> as the expression is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 7. <hi>which are not equal:</hi> now a word of God, and then the discourse runs muddy and prophane, or carnal again: all that evenness and uniformity that is in the several parts of a Christians life, is the effect of this infused principle of spiritual life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another aim and design of God in the infusion of this principle of life, is thereby to prepare and qualifie the soul for the enjoyment of himself in heaven: <hi>except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God, Joh.</hi> 3. 3. all that shall possess that inheritance must be begotten again to it, as the Apostle speaks 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. this principle of grace is the very seed of that glory, it's eternal life in the root and principle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. by this the soul is attempered and qualified for that state and imployment: what is the life of glory, but the vision of God, and the souls assimilation to God by that vision? from both which results that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy and delight which passeth understanding: but what vision of God, assimilation to God; or delight in God can that soul have, which was never quickened with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle of grace? The temper of such souls is expressed in that sad Character, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me:</hi> for want of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle it is that the very same duties and ordinances which are the delights and highest pleasures of the Saints, are no better than a meer drudgery and bondage to others, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 1. 13. heaven would be no heaven to a dead soul; this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life in its daily growth and improvement is our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as well as our evidence for heaven: these are the main ends of its infusion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the next place according to the method pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed I am obliged to shew you, <hi>that this quickening work is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>wholly supernatural,</hi> it is the sole and proper work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. So Christ himself expressly asserts it in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6, 8. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54344:69"/>
                  <hi>is born of the Spirit is Spirit: the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nor whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Believers are the birth or off-spring of the Spirit, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the new creature in them in an unintelligible manner even to themselves. So far it is above their own ability to produce, that it is above their capacity to understand the way of its production: as if you should ask, do you know from whence the wind comes? no: do you know whither it goes? no, but you hear and feel it when it blows? yes, why so is every one that is born of the Spirit: he feels the efficacy and discerns the effects of the Spirit on his own soul, but cannot understand or describe the manner of its production: this is not only above the carnal, but above the renewed mind to comprehend; we can contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I mean <hi>actively,</hi> to the production of this principle of life: we may indeed be said to concur <hi>passively</hi> with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in it: that is, there is found in us a capacity, aptness, or receptiveness of this principle of life: our nature is endowed with such faculties and powers as are meet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to receive, and instruments to act this spiritual life: God only quickens the rational nature with spiritual life.</p>
               <p>It is true also, that in the <hi>progress of Sanctification</hi> a man doth actively concurr with the Spirit, but in the first producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this spiritual principle he can do nothing: he can indeed perform those external duties that have a remote tendency to it, but he cannot by the power of nature perform any saving act, or contribute any thing more than a passive capacity to the implantation of a new principle: as will appear by the following Arguments.</p>

                  <p>That to which the Scripture ascribes both <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> with respect to grace, cannot actively and of it self concurr to the production of it: But the Scripture ascribes both impotency and enmity to Nature with respect to grace. It denyes to it a power to do anything of it self, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. and which is less, it denies to it power to speak a good word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. and which is least of all, it denies it power to think a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. This impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency if there were no more, cuts off all pretence of our active concurrence, but then if we consider that it ascribes <hi>enmity</hi> to our natures as well as <hi>impotency,</hi> how clear is the case! see <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. the carnal mind is enmity against God: and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. and you that were enemies in your minds by wicked works.

                  <p>If nature could produce, or but actively concurr to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this spiritual life, then the best natures would be soonest quickened with it; and the worst natures not at all, or last and least of all: but contrarily we find the worst na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures often regenerated, and the best left in the state of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death: with how many sweet <hi>homilitical</hi> vertues was the young man adorned? <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 21. yet graceless: and what a sink of sin was <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luke</hi> 7. 37. yet sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: thus beautiful <hi>Rachel</hi> is barren, whilst blear-ey'd <hi>Leah</hi> bears children.

                  <p>Fifthly, and lastly, I shall briefly represent the necessary antecedency of this quickening work of the Spirit to our first closing with Christ by faith: and this will easily let it self into your understandings if you but consider the nature of the vital act of faith: which is the souls receiving of Christ and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him for pardon and salvation, in which two things are necessarily included, <hi>viz.</hi>

First, The renouncing of all other hopes and dependencies whatsoever. Self in all its acceptations, natural, sinful, and moral, is now to be denyed and renounced for ever, else Christ can never be received, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. not only self in its vilest <hi>pollutions,</hi> but self in its richest ornaments, and <hi>endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> but this is as impossible to the unrenewed natural man, as it is for rocks or mountains to start from their <hi>Centre,</hi> and fly like wandering <hi>Atomes</hi> in the air: nature will rather choose to run the hazard of everlasting damnation, than escape it by a total renunciation of its beloved lusts, or self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness: this supernatural work necessarily requires a supernatural principle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The opening the heart fully to Jesus Christ, without which Christ can never be received, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. but <note place="margin">2.</note> this also is the effect of the quickening Spirit, the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus: sooner may we expect to see the flowers and blossoms open without the influence of the Sun, than the heart and will of a sinner open to receive Christ, without a principle of spiritual life first derived from him: and this will be past doubt to all that consider, not only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of nature, but the ignorance, prejudice, and aversations of nature by which the door of the heart is barr'd and chain'd up against Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. so that nature hath neither abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor will, power or desire to come to Christ; if any have an heart open'd to receive him, 'tis the Lord that opens it, by his almighty power; and that in the way of an infused principle of life supernatural.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be doubted, and objected, against this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> If we cannot believe till we are quickened with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, as you say, and cannot be justified till we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, as all say; then it will follow that a regenerate soul may be in the state of condemnation for a time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently perish if death should befall him in that juncture.</p>
                  <p>To this I return, that when we speak of the priority of <note place="margin">Sol.</note> this quickening work of the Spirit to our actual believing, we rather understand it of the priority of nature, than of time: the nature and order of the work requiring it to be so: a vital principle must in order of nature be infused before a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal act can be exerted. First make the tree good, and then
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54344:71"/>
the fruit good: and admit we should grant some priority in time also to this quickening principle, before actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faith, yet the absurdity mentioned would be no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent upon that concession: for as the vital act of faith quickly follows the regenerating principle, so the soul is abundantly secured against the danger objected; God never beginning any special work of grace upon the soul, and then leaving it and the soul with it in hazzard, but preserves both to the finishing and compleating of his gracious design, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Objects may be considered <hi>Politically,</hi> and with respect to such things they are alive also: they can buy and sell, and manage all their worldly affairs with as much dexterity, skill, and policy as other men, yea, <hi>the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light, Luke</hi> 16. 8.

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theologically</hi> considered, they are dead; without life, sense or motion towards God, and the things that are above: their understandings are dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the things that are of God: their wills are dead, and cannot move towards Jesus Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 65. their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are dead, even to the most excellent and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual objects: and all their duties are dead duties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life or spirit.

First, There is no <hi>beauty</hi> in the dead, all their loveliness goes away at death; there is no spiritual beauty or loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in any that are unregenerate: 'tis true, many of them have excellent moral <hi>homilitical vertues,</hi> which adorn their conversations in the eyes of men; but what are all these, but so many sweet flowers strewed over a dead Corpse?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The dead have no <hi>pleasure</hi> nor delight: even so the unregenerate are incapable of the delights of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life: <hi>to be spiritually minded is life and peace, Rom.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> this is the only serene, placid, and pleasant life: when the <hi>prodigal</hi> who was once dead, was alive, then he began to be merry, <hi>Luke.</hi> 15. 24. they live in sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but this is to be dead while alive in Scripture reckoning.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The dead have no <hi>heat,</hi> they are as cold as clay: so are all the unregenerate towards God and things above: their <hi>lusts</hi> are <hi>hot,</hi> but their <hi>affections</hi> to God <hi>cold</hi> and frozen: that which makes a gracious heart <hi>melt,</hi> will not make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate heart move.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, If there be spiritual <hi>hunger and thirst,</hi> it's a sweet sign of spiritual life; this sign agrees to Christians of a day old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. even <hi>new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word:</hi> if spiritual life be in you, you know how to expound that Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 1. without any other interpreter than your own experience: you will feel somewhat like the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, If there be <hi>spiritual conflicts</hi> with sin, there is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life in your soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. not only a combat betwixt <hi>light</hi> in the higher, and <hi>lust</hi> in the lower faculties: nor only opposition to more gross external corruptions that carry more infamy and horror with them than other sins do: but the same faculty will be the seat of War; and the more inward, secret and spiritual any lust is, by so much the more will it be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and mourned over.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the weakest Christian may upon impartial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation find such signs of spiritual life in himself (if he will allow himself time to reflect upon the bent and frame of his own heart) as desires after God, conscience of duties, fears, cares, and sorrows about sin: delight in the society of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and spiritual men, a loathing and burden in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vain and carnal persons.</p>
                     <p>O but I have a very dead heart to spiritual things.</p>

            <p>NO sooner is the soul quickened by the Spirit of God, but it answers in some measure the end of God in that work, by its <hi>active reception of Jesus Christ, in the way of believing:</hi> what this vital act of faith is, upon which so great a weight depends, as our Interest in Christ and everlasting blessedness, this Scripture before us will give you the best account of it: wherein (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Coherence and contexture of the words) we have three things to ponder.</p>

               <hi>name]</hi> here the terms are varied, though the thing exprest in both be the same: what he call'd <hi>receiving</hi> there, is call'd <hi>believing</hi> on his name here, to shew us that the very essence of saving faith consists in our receiving of Christ: by <hi>his name,</hi> we are to understand Christ himself: it is usual to take these two, believing in him, and believing in his name, as terms convertible and of the same importance. <gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>That the receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ, is that saving and vital act of faith, which gives the soul right both to his person and <note place="margin">Doct.</note> benefits.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>We cannot act spiritually, till we begin to live spiritually: therefore the Spirit of life must first joyn himself to us in his quickening work, (as was shewn you in the last Sermon) which being done, we begin to act spiritually by taking hold upon, or receiving Jesus Christ, which is the thing designed to be opened in this Sermon.</p>
               <p>The soul is the life of the body, faith is the life of the soul, and Christ is the life of faith. There are several sorts of faith besides saving faith, and in saving faith there are several acts besides the justifying or saving act; but <hi>this receiving act</hi> which is to be our subject this day, is that upon which both our righteousness and eternal happiness do depend. This as a <hi>form</hi> differences saving faith from all other kinds or sorts of faith: by this it is that we are justified and saved. <hi>To as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>

Now, the method into which I shall cast the discourse of this subject, that I may handle it with as much perspicuity and profit as I can, shall be</p>
               <p>First, To explain and open the nature of this <hi>receiving</hi> of Christ and shew you what it includes. <note place="margin">1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To prove that this is the justifying and saving act of faith. <note place="margin">2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To shew you the excellency of this act of Faith. <note place="margin">3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, To remove some mistakes, and give you the true account of the dignity and excellency of this act. <note place="margin">4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, And then bring home all in a proper and close ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. <note place="margin">5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, In the first place then, I will endeavour to explain <note place="margin">(1.) There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which the nature of saving faith is exprest in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> eating Christs flesh, and drinking his blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. coming to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Having the son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. Trusting or depending upon him, for which the Hebrew use th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> The first signifies a firm and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trust. The second to lean or depend with security. The third to betake ones self to a sanctuary for protection: all which is supposed or included in our receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ: in eating and drinking we must receive meat and drink, coming to Christ is necessarily supposed in receiving him, for there is no receiving at a distance: Having the son, and receiving him are notions of the same importance; and for trusting, relying with security, and betaking our selves to Christ for refuge, they are all involved in the receiving act: for as God offers him to us as the only prop of our hearts and hopes, so we receive hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> o rely upon him: and as he is held forth in the Gospel as the only <hi>Asylum</hi> or <hi>City</hi> of refuge, so we take or receive him, and accordingly betake our souls to him for refuge.</note> and open the nature of this <hi>receiving of Christ,</hi> and shew you what is implyed in it.</p>
               <p>And indeed it involves many deep mysteries and things of greatest weight: people are generally very ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the importance of this expression, they have very sleight thoughts of faith, who never past under the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating, convincing and humbling work of the Spirit: but we shall find that saving faith is quite another thing, and differs in its whole kind and nature from that tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itional faith, and common assent, which is so fatally mistaken for it in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54344:75"/>
For First, It is evident, that no man can receive Jesus Christ in the darkness of natural ignorance: we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and discern who and what he is, whom we receive to be the Lord our righteousness. If we know not his person and his offices, we do not <hi>take,</hi> but mistake Christ. It's a good rule in the <hi>Civil Law, non consentit qui non sentit:</hi> a mistake of the person invalidates the match: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e that takes Christ for a meer man, or denys the satisfaction of his blood, or devests him of his humane nature, or denys any of his most glorious and necessary offices, let them cry up as high as they will, his spirituality, glory, and exemplary life and death; they can never receive Jesus Christ aright: this is such a crack, such a flaw in the very foundation of faith, as undoes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all: <hi>ignorantis non est consensus:</hi> all saving faith is founded in light and knowledge: and therefore it's called knowledge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 11. and <hi>seeing</hi> is inseparably connected with <hi>believing, Joh.</hi> 6. 40. men must hear and learn of the father before they can come to Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving act of faith is directed and guided by knowledge. I will not presume to state the degree of knowledge, which is absolutely necessary to the reception of Christ, I know the first of actings faith are in most Christians accompanied with much darkness and confusion of understanding: but yet we must say in the general, that where ever faith is, there is so much light as is sufficient to discover to the soul, its own sins, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and wants; and the all-sufficiency, suitableness, and necessity of Christ for the supply and remedy of all; and without this Christ cannot be received. <hi>Come unto me ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The receiving Christ necessarily implies the <hi>Assent</hi> of the understanding to the truths of Christ revealed in the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> his person, natures, offices, his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, death and satisfaction; which <hi>assent,</hi> though it be not in it self saving faith, yet is it the foundation and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of it: it being impossible the soul should receive and fiducially embrace, what the mind doth not <hi>assent</hi> unto as true and infallibly certain. Now there are three degrees of <hi>assent,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Dr.</hi> Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>in</hi> Rom. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>conjecture, opinion,</hi> and <hi>belief. Conjecture</hi> is but a slight, and weak inclination to assent to the thing propounded, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54344:76"/>
of the weighty objections that lye against it. <hi>Opinion</hi> is a more steady and fixed assent, when a man is almost certain, though yet some fear of the contrary remains with him. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> is a more full and assured assent to the truth, to which the mind may be brought four ways.</p>
               <p>First, By the perfect intelligence of sense, not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or deceived. So I believe the truth of these proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Fire is hot: water moist: honey is sweet: gall is bitter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the native clearness of self-evidencing principles. So I believe the truth of these propositions, The whole is more than a part: the cause is before the effect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By discourse, and rational deduction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of this proposition, Where all the parts of a thing are, there is the whole.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By infallible Testimony, when any thing is witnessed or asserted, by one whose truth is unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and of this sort is the assent of faith: which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Nec enim dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ut cum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ad homines loqueretur ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reret suas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, tanquam aliter fides ei non haberetur: sed ut oportuit est locutus, quasi rerum omnium maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus judex, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus est non ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentari, sed pronunciare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>&amp;c. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius de falsa religione p. (mihi) 179.</hi> Titubat fides ubi vacillat divinarum Scripturarum autoritas. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> call'd our receiving the witness of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 9. our setting to our Seal that God is true, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 33. This <hi>prima veritas,</hi> divine veracity is the very <hi>formal object</hi> of faith: into this we resolve our faith. <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> is that firm foundation upon which our assent is built: and thus we see good reason to believe those profound myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the incarnation of Christ, the Hypostatical Union of the two natures in his wonderful person, the <hi>mystical</hi> Union of Christ and believers, though we cannot understand these things by reason of the darkness of our minds. It satisfies the soul to find these mysteries in the written word, upon that foundation it firmly builds its assent: and without such an assent of faith, there can be no embracing of Christ: all acts of faith and religion without assent, are but as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arrows shot at randome into the open air, they signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for want of a fixed determinate object.</p>
               <p>It is theresore the policy of <hi>Satan,</hi> by injecting or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Atheistical thoughts (with which young Converts use to find themselves greatly infested) to undermine and destroy the whole work of faith: but God makes his people victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over them: yea, and even at that time they do assent to the truths of the word, when they think they do not:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54344:76"/>
as appears by their tenderness and fear of sin, their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care of duty: If I discern these things in a Christians life, he must excuse me if I believe him not, when he saith he doth not assent to the truths of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our receiving Christ necessarily implies our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>approbation,</hi> liking, and estimation, yea, the acquiescence of our very souls in Jesus Christ, as the most excellent, sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and compleat remedy for all our wants, sins and dangers that ever could be prepared by the wisdome and love of God for them: we must receive him with such a frame of heart as rests upon him, trusts to and relys upon him, if ever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him aright: <hi>to them that believe he is precious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. this is the only soveraign plaister in all the world that is large enough, and efficacious enough to cure our wounds: and therefore as Christ is most highly esteemed, and heartily approved as the only remedy for our souls, so the soveraign grace and wisdome of God are admired, and the way and method he hath taken to save poor lost souls by Jesus Christ most heartily approved; as the most apt and excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, both for his glory and our good, that ever could be taken: for 'tis a plain case, that none will espouse themselves with conjugal affections to that person whom they esteem not as the best for them that can be chosen: none will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake and quit all for his sake, except they account him as the spouse did, <hi>the chiefest of ten thousand, Cant.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>There are two things in Christ which must gain the greatest approbation in the soul of a poor convinced sinner, and bring it to rest upon Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>First, That it can find nothing in Christ that is distastful or unsuitable to it, as it doth experimentally find in the best creatures. In him is no <hi>weakness</hi> but a fulness of all saving abilities; <hi>able to save to the uttermost:</hi> no <hi>Pride</hi> causing him to scorn and contemn the most wretched soul that comes to him: no <hi>inconstancy</hi> or levity, to cause him to cast off the soul whom he hath once received: no <hi>passion,</hi> but a <hi>Lamb</hi> for meekness and patience: there is not a spot to be found in him, but <hi>he is altogether lovely, Cant.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the believer can find nothing in Christ that is distastful, so it finds nothing wanting in Christ that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54344:77"/>
or desirable: such is the fulness of wisdome, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, sanctification, and redemption that is in Christ, that nothing is left to desire, but the full enjoyment of him. O saith the soul, how compleatly happy shall I be, if I can but win Christ! I would not envy the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the earth, were I but in Christ. I am an hungry and a thirst, and Christ is meat indeed, and drink indeed; this is the best thing in all the world for me, because so necessary, and so sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the needs of a soul ready to perish. I am a law-condemned, and a self-condemned sinner; trembling for fear of the execution of the curse upon me every moment; in Christ is compleat righteousness to justifie my soul; O there is nothing better for me than Christ. I see my self plunged both in nature and practice into the odious pollutions of sin, and in Christ is a fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness: his blood is a fountain of <hi>merit,</hi> his spirit a fountain of holiness and <hi>purity:</hi> none but Christ, none but Christ. O the manifold wisdome and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love of God to prepare, and furnish such a Christ, so fully answering all the needs, all the distresses, all the fears and burdens of a poor sinner! Thus the believing soul approves of Christ as best for it. And thus in believing it gives glory to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Receiving Christ consists in the <hi>consent and choice of the will:</hi> and this is the opening of the heart, the opening and stretching forth of the soul to receive him: <hi>thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, Psal.</hi> 110. 3.</p>
               <p>'Tis the great design and main scope of the Gospel to work over the wills of poor sinners to this: and this was the great complaint of Christ against the incredulous Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is disputed by some whether faith can be seated in two distinct faculties, as we seem to place it, when we say it involves both the <hi>approbation</hi> of the <hi>judgement,</hi> and the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>will.</hi> I will not here intangle my discourse with that fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less dispute. I am of the same judgement with those Divines that think Faith cannot be expressed fully by any one single habit or act of the mind or will distinctly, for that (as one

Consent (saith <hi>Vasquez)</hi> seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the concourse of the will with the understanding: but to leave that, it is most certain, the saving justifying act of faith lies principally in the consent of the will, which consent is the effect of the almighty power of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. he allures and draws the will to Christ, and he <hi>draws with the cords of a man, (i. e.)</hi> he prevails with it by rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for the soul being prepared by convictions of its lost and miserable estate by sin, and that there is but one door of hope open to it for an escape from the wrath to come, and that is Christ: being also satisfied of the fulness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness of his saving ability, and of his willingness to make it over for our salvation upon such just and equal terms; this cannot but prevail with the will of a poor distressed sinner, to consent and chuse him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, The last and principal thing included in our receiving of Christ, is the <hi>respect</hi> that this act of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath, unto the terms upon which Christ is tendred to us in the Gospel, to which it is most agreeable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>so we preach, and so ye believed:</hi> faith answers the Gospel offer <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

So he tenders himself, and so they receive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54344:78"/>
him; as will be evident in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, The Gospel offers Christ to us <hi>sincerely</hi> and really, and so the true believer receives and accepts him: even with <note place="margin">1.</note> a <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. If ever the soul be serious and in earnest in any thing, it it so in this: can we suppose the heart of him that flys for his life to the <hi>refuge City,</hi> to be serious and in earnest to escape by flight the <hi>Avenger of blood</hi> who pursues him, then is the heart of a convinced sinner seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this matter; for under that notion is the work of faith presented to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ is offered to us in the Gospel <hi>intirely</hi> and <hi>undividedly,</hi> as cloathed with all his offices, Priestly, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, <note place="margin">2.</note> and Regal: as Christ Jesus the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. and so the true believer receives him: the <hi>hypocrite</hi> like the harlot is for dividing, but the sincere believer finds the need he hath of every office of Christ, and knows not how to want any thing that is in him.</p>
               <p>His ignorance makes him necessary and desirable to him, as a <hi>Prophet:</hi> His guilt makes him necessary as a <hi>Priest:</hi> His strong and powerful Lusts and Corruptions makes him necessary as a <hi>King:</hi> and in truth he sees not any thing in Christ that he can spare; he needs all that is in Christ, and admires the infinite wisdome in nothing more than the investing Christ with all these offices, which are so suited to the poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wants and miseries. Look as the three offices are undivided in Christ, so they are in the believers acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance: and before this tryal, no hypocrite can stand, for all hypocrites reject and quarrel with something in Christ: they like his pardon, better than his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they call him indeed Lord and master, but it is but an empty Tite they bestow upon him; for let them ask their own hearts, if Christ be Lord over their <hi>thoughts,</hi> as well as <hi>words:</hi> over their <hi>secret,</hi> as well as <hi>open</hi> actions: over their <hi>darling</hi> Lusts, as well as others: let them ask, who will appear to be Lord and master over them, when Christ and the world come in competition? when the pleasures of sin shall stand upon one side, and sufferings to death, and deepest points of self-denyal upon the other side? Surely 'tis the greatest affront that can be offered to the divine wisdome and goodness to separate in our acceptance, what is so
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54344:78"/>
united in Christ for our salvation and happiness. As with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one of these offices the work of our salvation could not be compleated, so without acceptance of Christ in them all, our Union with him by faith cannot be compleated.</p>
               <p>The Gospel offer of Christ includes all his offices, and Gospel faith just so receives him, to submit to him, as well as to be redeemed by him: to imitate him in the holiness of his life, as well as to reap the purchases and fruits of his <hi>death.</hi> It must be an entire receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ is offered to us in the Gospel <hi>exclusively,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> as the alone and only saviour of sinners; with whose blood <note place="margin">A man may as lawfully joyn Saints or Angels in his mediation with Christ, as graces. It is gross idolatry to make the works of God a God: and it is but a more subtil Idolatry to make the works of Christ a Christ. <hi>Burges de Lege.</hi>
                  </note> and intercession nothing is to be mixed: but the foul of a sinner is singly to rely and depend on him and no other. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and so faith receives him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71. 16. <hi>I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>And be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ:</hi> to depend partly upon Christs righteousness, and partly upon our own, is to set one foot upon a rock, and the other in a quick-sand: either Christ will be to us all in all, or nothing at all in point of righteousness and salvation: he affects not social honour: as he did the whole <hi>work,</hi> so he expects the sole <hi>praise:</hi> if he be not able to save to the uttermost, why do we depend upon him at all? and if he be, why do we lean upon any beside him?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Gospel offers Christ <hi>freely</hi> to sinners as the <hi>gift,</hi> not the <hi>sale</hi> of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. and even so faith receives him. The believer comes to Christ with an empty hand, not only as an undeserving, but as an hell deserving sinner: he comes to Christ as to one that justifies the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Unto him that worketh not, but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> where by him that worketh not, he means a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced humbled sinner, who finds himself utterly unable to do the task the Law sets him <hi>(i. e.)</hi> perfectly to obey it; and therefore in a Law sense is said not to work: for it's all one as to the intent and purpose of the Law not to work and not to work perfectly: this he is convinced of, and therefore comes to Christ as one that is in himself ungodly, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the righteousness by which he alone can stand before
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54344:79"/>
God; is in Christ, and not in himself, in whole, or in part: and by the way, let this encourage poor souls that are scared and daunted for want of due qualifications, from closing with and embracing Christ: there is nothing qualifies any man for Christ more than a sense of his unworthiness of him, and the want of all excellencies or ornaments that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to divine acceptance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Gospel offers Christ <hi>orderly</hi> to sinners, first his <hi>person,</hi> then his <hi>priviledges.</hi> God first gives his son, and then <note place="margin">5.</note> with him, or as a consequent of that gift; he gives us all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. In the same order must our faith receive him. The believer doth not marry the <hi>portion</hi> first, and then the <hi>person:</hi> but to be found in him is the first and great care of a believer.</p>
               <p>I deny not but it's lawful for any to have an eye to the benefits of Christ. Salvation from wrath is, and lawfully may be intended and aimed at: <hi>look unto me, and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth, Isa.</hi> 45. 22. Nor do I deny but there are many poor souls who being in deep distress and fear, may and often do look mostly to their own safety at first; and that there is much confusion as well in the actings of their faith, as in their condition; but sure I am it is the proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in believing, first to accept the person of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: heaven is no doubt very desirable, but Christ is more: <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? Psal.</hi> 73. 25. Union with Christ is in order of nature antecedent to the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his priviledges, therefore so it ought to be in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method of believing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Christ is <hi>Advisedly</hi> offered in the Gospel to sinners, as the result of Gods eternal counsel, a project of grace upon which his heart and thoughts have been much set, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 13. <note place="margin">6.</note> The counsel of peace was betwixt the Father and Son. And so the believer receives him, most deliberately weighing the matter in his most deep and serious thoughts: for this is a time of much solitude and thoughtfulness. The souls espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals are acts of judgement, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 19. on our part, as well as on Gods: we are therefore bid to sit down and count the cost, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28. Faith, or the actual receiving of Christ is the result of many previous debates in the soul: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath been ponder'd over and over: the objections and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54344:79"/>
discouragements both from the self-denying terms of the Gospel, and our own vileness and deep guilt have been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and lain upon our hearts day and night, and after all things have been ballanced in the most deep consideration, the soul is determined to this conclusion, I must have Christ be the terms never so hard, be my sins never so great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I will yet go to him and venture my soul upon him; if I perish I peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h. I have thought out all my thoughts, and this is the result, union with Christ here, or separation from God for ever must be my lot.</p>
               <p>And thus doth the Lord open the hearts of his elect, and win the consent of their wills to receive Jesus Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deepest consideration, and debate of the matter in their own most solemn thoughts: they understand and know that they must deeply deny themselves, take up his cross and follow him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 24. renounce not only <hi>sinsul</hi> but <hi>religious</hi> self; these are hard and difficult things, but yet the necessity and excellency of Christ makes them appear eligible, and rational: by all which you see faith is another thing than what the sound of that word (as it is generally understood) signifies to the understandings of most men. This is that fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial receiving of Christ here to be opened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our next work will be to evince this receiving <note place="margin">2.</note> of Christ as it hath been opened, to be that special saving faith of Gods elect: this is that faith of which such great and glorious things are spoken in the Gospel, which whosoever hath shall be saved, and he that hath it not shall be damned: and this I shall evidently prove by the following Arguments or reasons.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                  <p>First, That faith which gives the soul right and title to spiritual Adoption, with all the priviledges and benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> is true saving Faith.</p>
                  <p>But such a receiving of Christ as hath been describ'd, gives the soul right and title to spiritual Adoption, with all the priviledges and benefits thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore such a receiving of Christ as hath been describ'd, is true and saving faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54344:80"/>
The Major proposition is undeniable, for our right and title to spiritual Adoption and the priviledges thereof rises from our Union with Jesus Christ; we being united to the son of God, are by vertue of that Union reckon'd or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sons. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>You are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ:</hi> the effect of saving faith is union with Christs person, the consequent of that Union is Adoption, or right to the inheritance.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is most plain in the Text: <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power or right to become the sons of God:</hi> a false faith hath no such priviledges annexed to it: no unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is thus dignified: no stranger entitled to this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Arg. 2.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, That only is saving and justifying faith, which is in all true believers, in none but true believers; and in all <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> true believers at all times.</p>
                  <p>But such a receiving of Christ as hath been described, is in all true believers, in none but true believers; and in all true believers at all times.</p>
                  <p>Therefore such a receiving of Christ as hath been describ'd, is the only saving and justifying faith.</p>
                  <p>The Major is undenyable, that must needs contain the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of saving faith which is proper to every true believer, at all times, and to no other.</p>
                  <p>The Minor will be as clear, for there is no other act of faith, but this of <hi>fiducial receiving Christ</hi> as he is offer'd, that doth agree to all true believers, to none but true believers; and to all true believers at all times.</p>
                  <p>There be three Acts of faith, <hi>Assent, Acceptance,</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> generally give the essence of saving faith <note place="margin">Actus fidei consistit in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Assent</hi> is too low to contain the essence of saving faith, it is found in the unregenerate as well as the regenerate: yea, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as well as men, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19. 'tis supposed and included in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

faith, but it is not the justifying or saving act. <hi>Assurance</hi> is as much too high: being found only in some eminent believers; <note place="margin">Many new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live like the new-born babe: <hi>vivit &amp; est vitae nesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ipse suae:</hi> the whole stock of many a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever consists in the bare direct acts of faith.</note> and in them too, but at some times: there's many a true believer to whom the joy and comfort of assurance is denyed: they may say of their Union with Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> said of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; whether in the body, or out of the body I cannot tell: so they, whether in Christ, or out of Christ they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell.</p>
                  <p>A true believer may <hi>walk in darkness, and see no light, Isa.</hi> 50. 10. nay, a man must be a believer, before he know himself to be so: the <hi>direct act</hi> of faith is before the <hi>reflex act:</hi> so that the justifying act of faith lies neither in <hi>Assent,</hi> nor in <hi>Assurance. Assent</hi> saith, I believe that Christ is, and that he is the Saviour of the elect. <hi>Assurance</hi> saith, I believe and am sure that Christ dyed for me, and that I shall be saved through him. So that <hi>Assent widens</hi> the nature of faith too much, and <hi>Assurance</hi> upon the other hand <hi>straitens</hi> it too much: but <hi>Acceptance,</hi> which saith, I take Christ in all his offices to be mine, this fits it exactly, and belongs to all true believers, and to none but true believers; and to all true believers at all times: this therefore must be the justifying and saving act of faith.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, That and no other is the justifying and saving act of faith, to which the properties and effects of saving faith do <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> belong, or in which they are only found.</p>
                  <p>But in the fiducial receiving of Christ, are the properties and effects of saving faith only found.</p>
                  <p>This therefore must be the justifying and saving act of faith.</p>
                  <p>First, By saving faith Christ is said to <hi>dwell in our hearts, Eph.</hi> 3. 17. but it is neither by <hi>assent,</hi> nor <hi>assurance,</hi> but by <hi>acceptance,</hi> and receiving him that he dwells in our hearts: not by assent, for then he would dwell in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; nor by assurance, for he must dwell in our hearts before we can be assured of it; Therefore it is by acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By faith we are justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assent nor assurance for the reasons above, do justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54344:81"/>
therefore it must be by the receiving act and no other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Scripture ascribes great difficulties to that faith by which we are saved: as being most cross and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the corrupt nature of man; but of all the acts of faith none is clog'd with like difficulties, or conflicts with greater oppositions than the receiving act doth: about this act hang the greatest difficulties, fears, and deepest self-denyal. In assent a mans reason is convinced, and yields to the evidence of truth, so that he can do no other but assent to the truth. In assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance there is nothing against a mans will or comfort, but much for it; every one desires it: but it is not so in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Christ upon the self-denying terms of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as will hereafter be evinced. We conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in this consists the nature and essence of saving faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Having seen what the receiving of Jesus Christ <note place="margin">3.</note> is, and that it is the faith by which we are justified and saved: I next come to open the <hi>Dignity</hi> and excellency of this faith, whose praises and <hi>Encomiums</hi> are in all the Scriptures: there you find it renowned by the title of <hi>precious faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>enriching faith, Jam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>the work of God, Joh.</hi> 6. 29. the <hi>great mystery of Godliness,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. with many more rich <hi>Epithets</hi> throughout the Scriptures bestowed upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now faith may be considered two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either
<q>
                        <l>Qualitatively or</l>
                        <l>Relatively.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Considered <hi>qualitatively,</hi> as a saving grace, it hath the same excellency that all other precious saving graces have: as it is the fruit of the Spirit it is more precious than Gold, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11, 19. and so are all other graces as well as faith: in this sense they all shine with equal glory, and that a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry transcending all the glory of this world: but then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faith <hi>Relatively</hi> as the instrument by which the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ is apprehended and made ours, and in that consideration it excels all other graces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:54344:81"/>
This is the grace that is singled out from among all other graces, to <hi>receive Christ,</hi> by which office it is dignified above all its fellows: as <hi>Moses</hi> was honoured above the many thousands of <hi>Israel,</hi> when God took him up into the <hi>Mount,</hi> admitted him nearer to himself than any other of all the Tribes might come; for they stood without the <hi>Rail,</hi> while <hi>Moses</hi> was received into the special presence of God, and was admitted to such views as others must not have: so faith is honoured above all its fellow graces in being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out, and solemnly anointed to this high <hi>office</hi> in our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: this is that precious eye that looks unto Christ as the stung <hi>Israelites</hi> did to the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> and derives healing vertue from him to the soul. It is the grace which instrumentally saves us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. as it's Christs glory to be the <hi>door</hi> of salvation, so it's Faiths glory to be the golden <hi>key</hi> that opens that door.</p>
                  <p>What shall I say of Faith? 'tis the <hi>bond</hi> of Union, the <hi>instrument</hi> of justification, the <hi>spring</hi> of spiritual peace and joy, the <hi>means</hi> of spiritual livelihood and subsistence: and therefore the great <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>drift</hi> of the Gospel, which aims at and presseth nothing more than to bring men and women to believe.</p>
                  <p>First, This is the <hi>bond of our Union</hi> with Christ: that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is begun in our vivification, and compleated in our actual receiving of Christ: the first is a bond of Union on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits part, the second, a bond of Union on our part. <hi>Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith, Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and herein it is a door opened to let in many rich blessings to the soul: for by uniting us to Christ, it brings us into special favour and acceptation with God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. makes us the special objects of Christs conjugal love and delight, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 29. draws from his heart sympathy and tender sense of all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and burdens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis the instrument of our justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. till Christ be received, (thus received by us) we are in our sins, under guilt and condemnation; but when faith comes, then comes freedome: <hi>by him all that believe are justified from all things, Acts</hi> 13. 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. for it apprehends or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the pure and perfect righteousness of the Lord Jesus, wherein the soul how guilty and sinful soever it be in it self,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54344:82"/>
stands faultless and spotless before the presence of God: all <note place="margin">Inveniri in Christo taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam habet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem ad dei judicium; in iis nullam invenit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnationem, quia justitiâ, qualem esse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit <hi>(i. e.)</hi> perfectâ accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatâ exorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos nos inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit; nempe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia Christi per fidem nobis imputata. <hi>Bern. in Loc.</hi>
                     </note> obligations to punishment are upon believing immediately dissolved: a full and final pardon sealed. O precious faith, who can sufficiently value it!</p>
                  <p>What respect, Reader, wouldst thou have to that hand that should bring thee a Pardon when on the Ladder or Block! why, that pardon, which thou canst not read without tears of joy, is brought thee by the hand of faith. O inestimable grace! that cloaths the pure righteousness of Jesus upon our defiled souls: and so causes us to become the <hi>righteousness of God in him,</hi> or as it is 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>righteous as he is righteous: non formali &amp; intrinsecâ Justitiâ, sed relativâ:</hi> not with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal inherent righteousness of our own, but with a relative imputed righteousness from another.</p>
                  <p>I know this most excellent and most comfortable doctrine of imputed righteousness is not only <hi>denyed</hi> but <hi>derided</hi> by <hi>Papists. Stapleton</hi> calls it <hi>spectrum Cerebri Lutherani:</hi> the monstrous birth of <hi>Luthers</hi> brain: but blessed be God this comfortable truth is well secured against all attempts of its adversaries. Let their blasphemous mouths call it in derision as they do, <hi>putative righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> (i. e.) a meer fancied or conceited righteousness: yet we know assuredly Christs righteousness is imputed to us, and that in the way of faith. If <hi>Adams</hi> sin became ours by Imputation, then so doth <hi>Christs</hi> righteousness also become ours by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. If Christ were made a sinner by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our sins to him, who had no sin of his own; then we are made righteous by the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to us, who have no righteousness of our own; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. This was the way in which <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of them that believe was justified, and therefore this is the way in which all believers, the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> must in like manner be justified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. Who can express the worth of faith in this one respect, if this were all it did for our souls?</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, It is the <hi>spring</hi> of our spiritual peace and joy; and that as it is the Instrument of our <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If it be an instrument of our <hi>Justification,</hi> it cannot but be the spring of our <hi>consolation. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, we have peace with God:</hi> in uniting us with Christ, and apprehending and applying his righteousness to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54344:82"/>
us, it becomes the seed or root of all the peace and joy of a Christians life. Joy the child of faith therefore bears its name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>the joy of faith.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we rejoyce with joy unspeakable:</hi> we cannot forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we are tickled, nor can we forbear rejoycing while by faith we are brought to the sight and knowledge of such a priviledged state: when faith hath first given, and then cleared our title to Christ, Joy is no more under the souls command: we cannot but rejoyce, and that with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is the <hi>means</hi> of our spiritual livelihood and subsistance: all other graces like birds in the nest depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what faith brings in to them: take away faith, and all the graces languish and dye: joy, peace, hope, patience, and all the rest depend upon faith, as the members of the natural body do upon the vessels by which blood and spirits are conveyed to them. <hi>The life which I now live</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is by the faith of the Son of God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides our <hi>ordinary food,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Cordials, Psal.</hi> 27. 13. <hi>I had fainted unless I had believed.</hi> And seeing it is all this to our souls,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In the last place it is no wonder that it is the main scope and drift of the Gospel to press and bring souls to believing: 'tis the Gospels grand design to bring up the hearts of men and women to faith. The urgent <hi>commands</hi> of the Gospel aim at this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 36. hither also look the great <hi>promises</hi> and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35 <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. so <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. And the opposite sin of unbelief is every where fearfully aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and <hi>threatned, Joh.</hi> 16. 8, 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. 35. And this was the third thing premised, namely, a discovery of the transcendant worth and excellency of saving faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, But lest we commit a mistake here, to the prejudice of Christs honour and glory, which must not be <note place="margin">4.</note> given to another, no not to faith it self, I promised you in the fourth place to snew you upon what account faith is thus dignified and honoured: that so we may give unto <hi>faith,</hi> the things that are <hi>faiths;</hi> and to <hi>Christ,</hi> the things that are <hi>Christs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:54344:83"/>
And I find four opinions about the interest of faith in our Justification: some will have it to justifie us <hi>formally,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively: (i. e.) upon the account of its own intrinsecal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and worth, and this is the <hi>Popish</hi> sense of Justification by faith. Some affirm that though faith be not our perfect legal righteousness considered as a work of ours, yet the <hi>act</hi> of believing is imputed to us for righteousness <hi>(i. e.)</hi> God graciously accepts it instead of perfect legal righteousness, and so in his esteem it's our evangelical righteousness. And this is the <hi>Arminian</hi> sense of justification by faith.</p>
                  <p>Some there are also even among our reformed Divines that contend that faith justifies and saves us as it is the <hi>Condition</hi> of the new Covenant. And Lastly, others will have it to justifie us as an <hi>Instrument</hi> apprehending or receiving the righteousness of Christ; with which opinion I must close: when I consider my Text calls it a <hi>receiving of Christ:</hi> most certain it is</p>
                  <p>That First, It doth not justifie in the <hi>Popish sense,</hi> upon the account of its own proper worth and dignity: for then</p>
                  <p>First, Justification should be of debt, not of grace; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This would frustrate the very scope and end of the death of Christ; for if righteousness come by the Law, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the way of works and desert, then is Christ dead in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then the way of our justification by faith would be so sar from excluding, that it would establish boasting, expressly contrary to the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> 3. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then there should be no defects or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in faith, for a defective and imperfect thing can never be the matter of our Justification before God: if it justifie upon the account of its own worth and proper dignity, it can have no flaw nor imperfection in it, contrary to the common sense of all believers. Nay,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Then it's the same thing to be justified by faith, and to be justified by works, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> so carefully distinguisheth and opposeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. so that we conclude it doth not justifie in the Popish sense, for any worth or proper excellency that is in it self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And it is as evident it doth not justifie us in the <hi>Arminian sense,</hi> viz. as the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>credere,</hi> the Act of believing is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54344:83"/>
imputed, or accepted by God as our Evangelical righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, instead of perfect legal righteousness. In the former opinion you have the dreggs of Popery, and here you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Popery. Let all <hi>Arminians</hi> know we have as high esteem for faith as any men in the world can have, but yet we will not rob Christ to cloath faith: we cannot embrace their opinion, because</p>
                  <p>First, We must then dethrone Christ, to exalt faith: we are willing to give it all that is due to it, but we dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyl Christ of his glory for faiths sake: he is <hi>the Lord our righteousness, Jer.</hi> 23. we dare not set the servant above the master: we acknowledge no righteousness but what the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and satisfaction of Christ yields us: his blood, not our faith, his satisfaction, not our believing it, is the matter of our justification before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We dare not yield this point, lest we undermine all the comfort of Christians by bottoming their pardon and peace upon a weak, imperfect work of their own. Oh how tottering and unstable must their station be, that stand upon such a bottom as this! what ups and downs are there in our faith, what mixtures of unbelief at all times, and prevalency of unbelief at some times; and is this a foundation to build our justification and hope upon? <hi>debile fundamentum fallit opus:</hi> if we lay the stress here, we build upon very loose ground, and must be at a continual loss both as to safety and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We dare not wrong the justice and truth of God at that rate, as to affirm that he esteems and imputes our poor weak faith for perfect legal righteousness: we know that the judgement of God is always according to truth: if <note place="margin">Ergo quia fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Christum justitiam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram recipit &amp; gratiae dei in Christo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia tribuit, ideo fidei tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buitur justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio, maxime propter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, &amp; non ideo quia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum opus est. <hi>Confess. Helv.</hi>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> the justice of God requires full payment, sure it will not say it's fully satisfied by any act of ours; when all that we can do amounts not to one <hi>mite</hi> of the vast summ we owe to God. So that we deservedly reject this opinion also.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And for the third <hi>opinion</hi> that it justifies as the <hi>Condition of the new Covenant,</hi> though some of great name and worth among our Protestant Divines seem to go that way, yet I cannot see according to this opinion any reason why <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> may not as properly be said to justifie us as faith, for it is a condition of the new Covenant as much as faith, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54344:84"/>
if faith justifie as a condition, then every other grace that is a condition must justifie as well as faith. I acknowledge faith to be a condition of the Covenant, but cannot allow that it justifies as a condition. And therefore must profess my self best satisfied in the last opinion, which speaks it an <hi>instrument</hi> in our justification: it is the hand which receives the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ that justifies us, and that gives it its value above all other graces: as when we say a <hi>Diamond Ring</hi> is worth one hundred pounds, we mean not the Gold that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, but the stone that is set in it is worth so much: faith consider'd as an habit is no more precious than other graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits are, but consider'd as an <hi>instrument</hi> to receive Christ, and his righteousness; so it excels them all: and this instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of faith is noted in those phrases <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Is the receiving of Christ the vital and saving act of faith <note place="margin">Infer. 1.</note> which gives the soul right to the person and priviledges of Christ: Then it follows, <hi>That the rejecting of Christ by unbelief must needs be the damning and soul-destroying sin, which cuts a man off from Christ and all the benefits purchased by his blood.</hi> If there be <hi>life in receiving,</hi> there must needs be <hi>death in rejecting</hi> Christ.</p>
                  <p>There is no <hi>grace</hi> more <hi>excellent</hi> than faith, no <hi>sin</hi> more <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable</hi> and abominable than unbelief: faith is the saving grace, and unbelief is the damning sin. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 36. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24.</p>
                  <p>And the reason why this sin of unbelief is the damning sin is this, because in the justification of a sinner, there must be a cooperation of all the <hi>Concauses</hi> that have a joint influence into that blessed effect: As there must be free grace for an <hi>impulsive</hi> cause, The blood of Christ as the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause; so of necessity there must be faith the <hi>Instrumental</hi> cause to receive and apply what the free grace of God designed, and the blood of Christ purchased for us. For where there are many <hi>social causes</hi> or <hi>concauses</hi> to produce one effect, there the effect is not produced till the last cause be in Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him shall receive remissions of sins, Acts</hi> 10. 43.

                  </p>
                  <p>Though Christ be come in the flesh, though he dyed and rose again from the dead; yet if you believe not, you must for all that, <hi>dye in your sins, Joh.</hi> 8. 24. and what a dreadful thing is this! better dye the death of a dog, better dye in a

                  <p>Before Christ can be received the heart must be emptied and opened: but most mens hearts are full of self righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and vain confidence: this was the case of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mans righteousness was once in himself, and what liquor is first put into the vessel, it ever afterward savours of it: 'tis with <hi>Adams</hi> posterity as with <hi>Bees</hi> which have been accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to go their own hive, and carry all thither; if the <hi>hive</hi> be removed to another place, they will still flye to the old place, hover up and down about it, and rather dye there, than go to a new place. So it is with most men. God hath removed their righteousness from <hi>doing,</hi> to <hi>believing:</hi> from <hi>themselves,</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> but who shall prevail with them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake self? nature will venture to be damned rather than do it: there is much <hi>submission</hi> in believing, and great self deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: a proud self-conceited heart will never stoop to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stock of anothers righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is no easie thing to perswade men to receive Christ as their Lord in all things, and submit their necks to his strict and holy precepts, though it be a great truth that

                  </p>
                  <p>First, It may come to pass from the inevidence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Assurance is a practical <hi>Syllogism,</hi> and it proceeds thus:</p>
                  <p>All that truly have received Christ Jesus, they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
                  <p>I have truly received Jesus Christ,</p>
                  <p>Therefore I am the child of God.</p>
                  <p>The Major proposition is found in the Scripture, and there can be no doubt of that: the <hi>Assumption</hi> depends upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or internal sense. <hi>I have truly received Jesus Christ:</hi> here usually is the stumble, many great <hi>objections</hi> lye against it, which they cannot clearly answer: as,</p>
                  <p>Light and knowledge are necessarily required to the right <note place="margin">1. Ob.</note> receiving of Christ, but I am dark and ignorant, many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal unregenerate persons know more than I do, and are more able to discourse of the mysteries of Religion than I am.</p>
                  <p>But you ought to distinguish of the <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <note place="margin">Sol.</note> knowledge, and then you would see that your bewailed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is no bar to your interest in Christ. There are two kinds of knowledge:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Natural.</item>
                     <item>2. Spiritual.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>There is a <hi>natural knowledge</hi> even of spiritual objects, a spark of nature blown up by an advantagious education, and though the objects of this knowledge be spiritual things, yet the light in which they are discerned is but a meer natural light.</p>
                  <p>And there is a <hi>spiritual knowledge</hi> of spiritual things, the <hi>teaching of the anointing,</hi> as it's call'd 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the effect and fruit of the Spirits sanctifying work upon our souls, when the experience of a mans own heart informs and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his understanding, when by feeling the workings of grace in our own souls, we come to understand its nature: this is spiritual knowledge. Now a little of this knowledge is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54344:87"/>
better evidence of a mans interest in Christ, than the most raised and excellent degree of natural knowledge: as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> truly observes: <hi>praestat paucula de meliori scientia degu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasse, quam de ignobiliori multa:</hi> one drachm of knowledge of the best and most excellent things, is better than much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of common things. So it is here, a little spiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jesus Christ, that hath life and savour in it, is more than all the natural sapless knowledge of the unregenerate, which leaves the heart dead, carnal and barren: 'tis not the <hi>quantity</hi> but the <hi>kind,</hi> not the <hi>measure</hi> but the <hi>savour:</hi> if you know so much of the evil of sin as renders it the most bitter and burdensome thing in the world to you, and so much of the necessity and excellency of Christ, as renders him the most sweet and desirable thing in the world to you; though you may be defective in many degrees of knowledge, yet this is enough to prove yours to be the fruit of the Spirit: you may have a sanctified heart, though you have an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or weak head: many that knew more than you are in <hi>hell,</hi> and some that once knew as little as you are now in <hi>heaven: in absoluto &amp; facili stat aeternitas:</hi> God hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd heaven only for clear and subtil heads: a little sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and effectual knowledge of Christs person, offices, suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, and necessity may bring thee thither, when others with all their curious speculations and notions may perish for ever.</p>
                  <p>But you tell me that <hi>Assent</hi> to the truths of the Gospel is <note place="margin">2. Ob.</note> necessarily included in saving faith, which though it be not the justifying and saving act, yet it is presupposed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to it: now I have many staggerings and doubtings about the certainty and reality of these things: many horrid atheistical thoughts, which shake the assenting act of faith in the very foundation, and hence I doubt I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p>There may be and often is a true and sincere <hi>assent</hi> found in the soul that is assaulted with violent atheistical suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Sol.</note> from Satan; and thereupon questions the truth of it: and this is a very clear evidence of the reality of our assent, that whatever doubts or contrary suggestions there be, yet we dare not in our practice contradict or slight those truths or duties which we are tempted to disbelieve. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:54344:87"/>
we are assaulted with atheistical thoughts, and tempted to slight and cast off all fears of sin, and practice of religious duties, yet when it comes to the point of practice, we dare not commit a known sin, the awe of God is upon us: we dare not omit a known duty, the tye of conscience is found strong enough to hold us close to it: in this case, 'tis plain, we do really assent, when we think we do not. A man thinks he doth not love his child, yet carefully provides for him in health, and is full of grief and fears about him in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: why now, so long as I see all fath rly duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and affections to his childs welfare manifested; let him say what he will as to the want of love to him, whilest I see this, he must excuse me if I do not believe him, when he saith he hath no love for him: Just so is it in this case, A man saith I do not assent to the being, necessity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Jesus Christ: yet in the mean time his soul is fill'd with cares and fears about securing his interest in him, he is found panting and thirsting for him with vehement desires, there's nothing in all the world would give him such joy, as to be well assured of an interest in him; while it is thus with any man, let him say or think what he will of his assent, it's manifest by this he doth truly and heartily assent, and there can be no better proof of it than these real effects produc'd by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But if these, and other objections were never so fully answer'd for the clearing of the <hi>assumption,</hi> yet it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls out, that believers are afraid to draw the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that fear arises partly from</p>
                  <p>First, The weighty importance of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The sense of the deceitfulness of their own hearts.</p>
                  <p>First, The conclusion is of infinite importance to them, it is the everlasting happiness of their souls, than which nothing is or can be of greater weight upon their spirits: things in which we are most deeply concerned are not lightly and hastily received by us: it seems so great and so good, that we are still apt (if there be any room for it) to suspect the truth and certainty thereof, as never being sure enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54344:88"/>
Thus when the women that were the first messengers and witnesses of Christs resurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10, 11. came and told the disciples those wonderful and comfortable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, it's said, <hi>that their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not:</hi> they thought it was too good to be true: too great to be hastily received: so is it in this case.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The sense they have of the deceitfulness of their own hearts, and the dayly workings of hypocrisie there, makes them afraid to conclude in so great a point as this is.</p>
                  <p>They know that very many dayly cozen and cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this matter, they know also that their own hearts are full of falseness and deceit, they find them so in their daily observations of them, and what if they should prove so in this? why then they are lost for ever! they also know there is not the like danger in their fears and jealousies, that would be in their vain confidences and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: by the one they are only deprived of their present <hi>comfort,</hi> but by the other they would be ruined for ever: and therefore choose rather to dwell with their own fears, (though they be uncomfortable companions) than run the danger of so great a mistake, which would be infinitely more fatal. And this being the common case of most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it follows that there must be many more believers in the world than do think or dare conclude themselves to be such.</p>

                  <p>If the right receiving of Jesus Christ be true saving and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, <hi>then those that have the least and lowest degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Infer. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of saving faith, have cause for ever to admire the bounty and riches of the grace of God to them therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have received never so little of his bounty by the hand of providence in the good things of this life, yet if he have given you any measure of true saving faith, he hath dealt bountifully indeed with you: this mercy alone is enough to ballance all other wants and inconveniencies of this life. <hi>Poor in the world, rich in faith, James</hi> 2. 5. O let your hearts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54344:88"/>
take in the full sense of this bounty of God to you, say with the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</hi> and you will in this one mercy find matter enough of praise and thanksgiving, wonder and admiration to your dying day, yea, to all eternity: for do but consider</p>
                  <p>First, The smallest measure of saving faith which is found in any of the poople of God, receives Jesus Christ; and in receiving him what mercy is there which the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving soul doth not receive in him and with him? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>O believer, though the arms of thy faith be small and weak; yet they embrace a great Christ, and receive the richest gift that ever God bestowed upon the world: no sooner art thou become a believer, but Christ is in thee the hope of glory: and thou hast authority to become a son or daughter of God: thou hast the broad seal of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to confirm thy title and claim to the priviledges of Adoption, for <hi>to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God. To as many]</hi> be they strong, or be they weak; provided they really receive Christ by faith; there is authority or power given, so that it's no act of presumption in them to say God is our Father, heaven is our inheritance. Oh precious faith! the treasures of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds cannot purchase such priviledges as these: all the Crowns and Scepters of the earth sold at their full value, are no price for such mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The least degree of saving faith brings the soul into a state of perfect and full Justification. For if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Jesus Christ, it must therefore needs in him, and with him receive a free, full, and final pardon of sin: the least measure of faith receives remission for the greatest sins. <hi>By him all that believe are justified from all things, Acts</hi> 13. 39. it unites thy soul with Christ, and then as the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of that Union, there is no condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not one condemnation, how many soever our sins have been.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The least measure or degree of saving faith is a greater mercy than God hath bestowed, or ever will bestow
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54344:89"/>
upon many that are far above you in outward respects: <hi>all men have not faith:</hi> nay 'tis but a remnant among men that believe. Few of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the world have such a gift as this: they have houses and lands, yea, Crowns and Scepters, but no Faith, no Christ, no pardon: they have authority to rule over men, but no authority to become the sons of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Say therefore in thy most debased, straitned, afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Return to thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The least degree of saving faith is more than all the power of nature can produce: there must be a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al revelation of the arm of the Lord in that work, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1. Believers are not <hi>born of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God, Joh.</hi> 1. 12, 13. all believing motions towards Christ are the effects of the Fathers drawing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. a glorious and irresistable power goes forth from God to produce it, whence it's call'd <hi>the faith of the operation of God, Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>So then, Let not believers depise the day of small things: or overlook that great and infinite mercy which is wrapt up in the least degree of saving faith.</p>

                  <p>My soul pities and mourns over the infidel world. Ah what will become of the millions of poor unbelievers! there is but one door of salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ; and but one Key of faith to open that door: and as that key was never given to the heathen world, so it's laid aside, or taken away from the people by their cruel guides, all over the Popish world: were you among them you should hear nothing else prest as necessary to your salvation but a blind implicite faith, to believe as the Church believes, that is, to believe they know not what.</p>
                  <p>To believe as the <hi>Pope</hi> believes, that is, as an Infidel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, for so they confess he may be, <note n="*" place="margin">Non enim fides interior Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54344:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
among them, yet it is very sparingly discoursed, very falsely described, and exceedingly slighted by them, as the veriest trifle in the world.</p>
                  <p>First, It is but sparingly discoursed of: they love not to accustome the peoples ears to such doctrine: one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confesses that there is so deep a silence of explicit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faith in the <hi>Romish Church</hi> that you may find many eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where that believe no more of these things than heathen <note place="margin">Navarr, cap. 11. p. 142.</note> 
                     <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When it is preacht or written of, it is falsely described: for they place the whole nature and essence of justifying and saving faith in a naked <hi>assent:</hi> which the Devils have as well as men, <hi>James</hi> 2. 19. no more than this is prest upon the people at any time, as necessary to their salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And even this particular explicit faith when it is spoken or written of is exceedingly slighted. I think if the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> himself were in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> he could hardly tell how to bring men to a more low and slight esteem of faith; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it as a verier trifle, and needless thing than these his Agents have done. Some (<note n="a" place="margin">Petr. à S. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph. sum. Art. 1. p. 6.</note>) say, if a man believe with a particular explicit faith <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if he actually assent to Scripture truths once in a year, it is enough. Yea, and others (<note n="b" place="margin">Bonacina Tom. 2. in 1. praecept.</note>) think it too much to oblige people to believe once in twelve months, and for their ease tell them if they believe once in twelve years it is sufficient: and lest this should be too great a task (<note n="c" place="margin">Jo. Sanc. Disp. 41. n. 32.</note>) others affirm that if it be done but once in their whole life, and that at the point of death too, it is enough, especially for the rude and common people. Good God! what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is here! it was a saying long ago of <hi>Gregory</hi> (as I remember) <hi>malus minister est nisus di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Reflect solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the transactions that have been betwixt Christ and your souls: think close on this subject of meditation.</p>
               <p>If all you were worth in the world lay in one precious stone, and that stone were to be tried by the skilful <hi>Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,</hi> whether it were true or false, whether it would flye or endure under the smart stroke of his Hammer, sure your thoughts could not be unconcerned about the issue: why, all that you are worth in both worlds depends upon the truth of your saith, which is now to be tried.</p>
               <p>O therefore read not these lines with a running careless eye, but seriously ponder the matter before you: you would be loth to put to Sea, though it were but to cross the <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> in a rotten leaky bottome: and will you dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the ocean of eternity in a false rotten faith? God forbid: you know the Lord is coming to try every mans faith as by fire, and that we must stand or fall for ever with the sincerity or hypocrisie of our faith. Surely you can never be too exact and careful about that on which your whole estate depends, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>Now there are three things upon which we should have a very tender and watchful eye for the discovery of the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our faith, and they are

               <p>First, <hi>Illumination</hi> is a necessary antecedent to faith: you cannot believe till God hath opened your eyes to see your sin, your misery by sin, and your remedy in Jesus Christ alone: you find this act of the Spirit to be the first in order both of nature and time, and introductive to all the rest, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi> As faith without <hi>works</hi> (which must be a <hi>consequent</hi> to it) is <hi>dead,</hi> so faith without <hi>light,</hi> which must be an <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> to it, is <hi>blind:</hi> faith is the <hi>hand</hi> by which Christ is received, but knowledge is the <hi>eye</hi> by which that hand is directed.</p>
               <p>Well then, hath God opened your eyes to see sin and misery in another manner than ever you saw it before? for certainly if God have opened your eyes by saving illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you will find as great a difference betwixt your former and present apprehensions of sin and danger, as betwixt a painted <hi>Lion</hi> upon the wall or sign post, and the real living <hi>Lion</hi> that meets you roaring in the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conviction</hi> is an <hi>Antecedent</hi> to believing: where this goes not before, no faith can follow after: the Spirit first convinces of sin, then of righteousness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. So <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. <hi>repent ye, and believe the Gospel:</hi> believe it O man, that breast of thine must be wounded, that vain and frothy heart of thine must be pierced and stung with conviction, sense, and sorrow for sin: thou must have some sick days and restless nights for sin, if ever thou rightly close with Christ by faith: 'tis true, there is much difference found in the strength, depth, and continuance of conviction and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual troubles in converts, as there is in the labours and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing pains of women, but sure it is, the child of faith is not ordinarily born without some pangs. Conviction is the application of that light which God makes to shine in our minds, to our particular case and condition, by the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and sure when men come to see their miserable and sad estate by a true light, it cannot but wound them, and that to the very heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Self-despair,</hi> or a total and absolute loss in our selves about deliverance, and the way of escape, either by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54344:91"/>
our selves, or any other meer creature, doth and must go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith.</p>
               <p>So it was with those believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what shall we do?</hi> they are the words of men at a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal loss: it is the voyce of poor distressed souls that saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in misery, but knew not, saw not, nor could devise any way of escape from it, by any thing they could do for themselves, or any other creature for them: and hence the Apostle uses that emphatical word, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(i. e.) shut up to the faith,</hi> (i. e.) as men besieged and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a garrison in time of a storm, when the enemy pours in upon them through the breaches, and over-powers them: there is but one <hi>sally-port</hi> or gate at which they can escape, and to that they all throng; as despairing of life if they take any other course: Just so do mens convictions besiege them, distress them, beat them off from all their holds and intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and bring them to a pinching distress in themselves, shutting them up to <hi>Christ</hi> as the only way of escape. Duties cannot save me, reformation cannot save me, nor Angels nor men can save me; there is no way but one, <hi>Christ</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for evermore.</p>
               <p>I thought once that a little repentance, reformation, resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and a stricter life, might be a way to escape wrath to come; but I find the bed is too short, and the covering too narrow: all is but loss, dung, dross, in comparison with Jesus Christ: if I trust to those <hi>Aegyptian reeds,</hi> they will not only fail me, but pierce and wound me too. I see no hope within the whole <hi>Horizon</hi> of sense.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hence come <hi>vehement and earnest crys to God</hi> for faith, for Christ, for help from heaven to transport the soul out of this dangerous condition, to that strong rock of salvation: to bring it out of this farious stormy Sea of trouble where it's ready to wreck every moment, into that safe and quiet harbour Christ.</p>
               <p>O when a man shall see his misery and danger, and no way of escape but Christ, and that he hath no ability in himself to come to Christ, to open his heart thus to receive him, but that this work of faith is wholly supernatural, the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God; How will the soul return again and again upon God with such crys as that <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:54344:91"/>
Lord enable me to come to Christ: give me Christ or I perish for ever: what profit is there in my blood? why should I dye in the sight and presence of a Saviour? O Lord it is thine own work and a most glorious work: reveal thine arm in this work upon my soul, I pray thee: give me Christ, if thou deny me bread: give me faith, if thou deny me breath: it's more necessary that I believe, than that I live.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Reader,</hi> reflect upon the days and nights that are past, the places where thou hast been conversant: where are the bed-sides, or the secret corners where thou hast besieged hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with such crys? if God have thus inlightned, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, distressed thy soul, and thus set thee a mourning after Christ, it will be one good sign that faith is come into thy soul; for here are certainly the <hi>Harbingers</hi> and fore runners of it, that ordinarily make way for faith into the souls of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would be satisfied of the sincerity and truth <note place="margin">2. Mark.</note> of your faith, then examine what <hi>Concomitants</hi> it is attended with in your souls. I mean what frames and tempers your souls were in at that time when you think you received Christ. For certainly in those that receive Christ (excepting those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose hearts God hath in a more still and insensible way infused faith betime, by his blessing upon pious education) such concomitant frames of Spirit may be remarkt, as these following.</p>
               <p>First, The heart is deeply <hi>serious,</hi> and as much in earnest in this matter, as ever it was, or can be about any thing in the world. This you see in that example of the <hi>Jaylor, Acts</hi> 16. 29. <hi>he came in trembling and astonished:</hi> it is the most solemn and important matter that ever the soul had before it in this world, or ever shall, or can have: how much are the hearts of men affected in their outward straits and distresses about the concernments of the body? their hearts are not a little concern'd in such questions as these, <hi>What shall I eat? what shall I drink?</hi> where withal shall I and mine be fed and cloathed? but certainly the straits that souls are in about salvation, must be allowed to be greater than these; and such questions as that of the <hi>Jaylors; Sirs! what must I do to be saved?</hi> make deeper impressions upon the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54344:92"/>
heart, than what shall I eat, or drink? Some indeed have their thoughts sinking deeper into these things than others: these thoughts lye with different degrees of weight upon men: but all are most solemnly and awfully concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their condition: all frothiness and frolicks are gone, and the heart settles it self in deepest earnest about its eternal state.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The heart that receives Jesus Christ is in a frame of deep <hi>humiliation</hi> and self-abasement. O when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to apprehend the first approaches of grace, pardon and mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y Jesus Christ to his soul: a soul convinced of its utter unworthiness, and desert of hell; and can scarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing else from the just and holy God but damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how do the first dawnings of mercy melt and humble it! <q>O Lord what am I that thou shouldest feed me and preserve me! that thou shouldest but for a few years spare me, and forbear me! but that ever Jesus Christ should love me and give himself for me, that such a wretched sinner as I should obtain Union with his person, pardon, peace and salvation by his blood! Lord whence is this to such a worm as I? and will Christ indeed bestow himself upon me? shall so great a blessing as Christ ever come within the arms of such a soul as mine? will God in very deed be reconciled to me in his son? what to me! to such an enemy as I have been! shall my sins which are so many, so horrid, so much aggravated beyond the sins of most men, be forgiven me? O what am I vile dust, base wretch, that ever God should do this for me!</q> And now is that Scripture indeed fulfill'd and made good, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 63. <hi>That thou maist remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</hi> Thus that poor broken-hearted believer stood behind Christ weeping, and washing his feet with tears; as one quite melted down and overcome with the sense of mercy to such a vile sinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The soul that receives Jesus Christ is in a <hi>weary Condition,</hi> restless and full of disquietness, neither able to bear the burden of sin, nor knowing how to be discharged from it; except Christ will give it ease, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:54344:92"/>
that is believe in me, <hi>you that are weary and heavy laden:</hi> if they do not look into their own souls they know there's no <hi>safety,</hi> and if they do, there's no <hi>comfort.</hi> O the burdensome sense of sin overweighs them: they are ready to fail, to sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The soul that rightly receives Christ is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a weary, but in a <hi>longing condition:</hi> never did the <hi>hart</hi> pant more earnestly for the water-brooks: never did the <hi>hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> desire the shadow, never did a <hi>condemned person</hi> long for a pardon, more than the soul longs after Jesus Christ. O said <hi>David,</hi> that one would give me of the waters of the well of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to drink. O saith the poor humbled sinner, that one would give me of the open'd fountain of the blood of Christ to drink! O for one drop of that precious blood! O for one encouraging smile from Christ! O now were ten thousand worlds at my command, and Christ to be bought; how freely would I lay them all down to purchase him! but he is the <hi>gift</hi> of God. O that God would give me Christ if I should go in raggs, and hunger and thirst all my days in this world!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The soul in the time of its closing with or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christ is in a <hi>state of conflict:</hi> it hangs betwixt hopes and fears, encouragements and discouragements, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion many a sad stand and pause in the way to Christ; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the number and nature of its sins discourage it, then the riches and freeness of the grace of Christ erects his hopes again: there's little hope, saith unbelief, nay it's utterly impossible saith <hi>Satan,</hi> that ever such a wretch as thou shouldst find mercy; now the hands hang down. O but then there's a necessity, an absolute necessity; I have not the choice of two, but am shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up to one way of deliverance: others have found mercy, and the invitation is to all that are weary, and to all that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirst: he saith he that cometh to him, he will in no wise cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; now new hopes inspire the soul, and the hands that did hang down are again strengthned.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Concomitant frames</hi> that accompany faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Examine the <hi>Consequents</hi> and effects of Faith if you <note place="margin">3. Mark.</note> would be satisfied of the truth and sincerity of it: and such are</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:54344:93"/>
First, <hi>Evangelical meltings,</hi> and ingenuous thawings of the heart under the apprehensions of grace and mercy: <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Love to Christ, his ways and people. Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> (i. e.) it represents the love of God, and then makes use of the sweetness of it by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to constrain the soul to all acts of obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may testifie the reality of its love to God and Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Heart <hi>purity, Acts</hi> 15. 9. <hi>purifying their hearts by faith:</hi> it doth not only cleanse the <hi>hands</hi> but the <hi>heart:</hi> no principle in man besides faith can do this: morality may <hi>hide</hi> corruption, but faith only <hi>purifies</hi> the heart from it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Obedience</hi> to the commands of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26. the very name of faith is call'd upon obedience: for it accepts Christ as Lord, and urges upon the soul the most powerful arguments in the world to draw it to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>In a word, let the poor doubting believer that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions his faith, reflect upon those things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable in his own experience, which being well considered will greatly tend to his satisfaction in this point.</p>
               <p>It's very doubtful to you whether you believe, but yet in the mean while, it may be past doubt, (being a matter of clear experience) that you have been deeply convinced of sin, struck off from all carnal props and refuges, made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept Jesus Christ upon what terms soever you might enjoy him: you doubt whether Christ be yours, but it's past doubt that you have a most high and precious esteem of Christ, that you heartily long for him, that you prize and love all, whether persons or things, that bears his image: that nothing in the world would please your hearts like a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation into his likeness, that you had rather your souls should be fill'd with his Spirit, than your houses with Gold and Silver. 'Tis doubtful whether Christ be yours, but it's past doubt that one smile from Christ, one token of his love, would do you more good than all the honours and smiles of the world; and nothing so grieves you, as your
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54344:93"/>
grieving him by sin doth: you dare not say that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, nor can you deny but that you have had many sick days and nights for him: that you have gone into many secret places with yearning bowels after him: whether he be yours or not, you cannot tell; but that you are resolved to be his, that you can tell: whether he will save you is a doubt, but that you resolve to lye at his feet, and wait only on him, and never look to another for salvation, is no doubt.</p>
               <p>Well, well; poor pensive soul, if it be so, arise, lift up thy dejected head, take thine own Christ into thy arms. These are undoubted signs of a real closure with Christ: thou makest thy self poor, and yet hast great riches: such things as these are not found in them that despise and reject Christ by unbelief.</p>

               <p>First, To unbelievers who from hence must be prest, as ever they expect to see the face of God in peace, to receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ as he is now offered to them in the Gospel: this is the very scope of the Gospel, I shall therefore press it by three great Considerations: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, What is in Christ whom you are to receive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is in the offer of Christ by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is in the rejecting of that offer.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>First Motive.</head>
                  <p>First, Consider well what is in Christ whom I perswade you this day to receive: did you know what is in Christ, you <note place="margin">Motive 1.</note> would never neglect or reject him as you do: For</p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54344:94"/>
First, God is in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. the Deity hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to dwell in his flesh, he is God manifest in flesh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. a Godhead dwelling in flesh is the worlds wonder: so that in receiving Christ, you receive God himself.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Authority</hi> of God is in Christ, <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> 23. 21. <hi>My name is in him: him hath God the father sealed, Joh.</hi> 6. 27. he hath the Commission, the great seal of heaven to redeem and save you: all power in heaven and earth is given to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. he comes in his Fathers name to you, as well as in his own name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The wisdome of God is in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Christ the wisdom of God:</hi> yea, <hi>in him are hid all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2. 3. Never did the wisdome of God display it self before the eyes of Angels and men as it hath done in Christ. The <hi>Angels desire to look into it,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. yet they are not so much concerned in the project and design of this wisdome in redemption as you are.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>fulness of the Spirit</hi> is in Christ: yea, it fills him so as it never did nor will fill any creature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by measure to him:</hi> all others have their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, stints, and measures; some more, some less; but the Spirit is in Christ without measure.

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The love of God</hi> is in Christ: yea, the very yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bowels of divine love are in him: what is Christ but the love of God wrapt up in flesh and blood? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9, 10. <hi>In this was manifested the love of God towards us,</hi> and herein is love

                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The mercies and compassions</hi> of Christ are all in Christ, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 21. Mercy is the thing that poor sinners want, it's that they cry for at the last gasp, it's the only thing that can do them good. O what would they give to find mercy in that great day? Why, if you receive Christ, you shall with him receive mercy: but out of him there is no mercy to be expected from the hands of God: for God will never exercise mercy to the prejudice of his Justice, and it is in Christ that justice and mercy meet and embrace each other.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, To Conclude, <hi>The salvations of God</hi> are in Christ. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there salvation in any other.</hi> Christ is the <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Devils have as much ground to expect salvation as you: you see what is in Christ to induce you to receive him.</p>

                     </gap>ow living in the word: the sound of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> is not come to their ears; but he is offered to you by the special favour and bounty of heaven: and will you not receive him? O then how will the devils, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54344:95"/>
and the heathens upbraid your folly! and say, had we had one such tender of mercy of which you have had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, we would never have been now in this place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider <hi>how</hi> Christ is offered to you, and you shall find that he is offered,</p>
                  <p>First, Freely, as <hi>the gift of God</hi> to your souls: you are not to <hi>purchase</hi> him, but only to <hi>receive</hi> him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money let him come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ is offered importunately by repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>As though God did beseech you, we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> O what amazing condescension is here in the God of mercy!

O then what wilt thou say for thy self when God will not hear thee, when thou shalt intreat and cry for mercy? Which brings us to the</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Motive 3.</head>
                  <p>Consider the sin and danger that there is in refusing or <note place="margin">Motive 3.</note> neglecting the present offers of Christ in the Gospel, and surely there is much sin in it: the very malignity of sin, and the summ of all misery lyes here: for in refusing Christ,</p>
                  <p>First, you put the greatest contempt and slight upon all the Attributes of God that it is possible for a creature to do: God hath made his justice, his mercy, his wisdome, and all his attributes to shine in their brightest glory in Christ: never was there such a display of the glory of God made to the world in any other way.</p>
                  <p>O then, what is it to reject and despise Jesus Christ, but to offer the greatest affront to the glory of God that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for men to put upon him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you hereby frustrate and evacuate the very design and importance of the Gospel to your selves, you <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. as good, yea, better had it been for you, that Christ had never come into the world, or if he had, that your lot had fallen in the dark places of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54344:95"/>
the earth where you had never heard his name: yea, good had it been for that man if he had never been born.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hereby a man murthers his own soul. <hi>I said there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto you that you shall dye in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins, Joh.</hi> 8. 24. unbelief is self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther: you are guilty of the blood of your own souls: life and salvation was offered you, and you rejected it: yea,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The refusing of Christ by unbelief will aggravate your damnation, above all others that perish in ignorance of Christ. O 'twill be more tolerable for heathens than for you: the greatest measures of wrath are reserved to punish the worst of sinners, and among sinners none will be found worse than unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To Believers, this point is very useful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <note place="margin">2.</note> them to divers excellent duties: among which I shall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out two principal ones.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>First, You that have received Jesus Christ truly, give your selves no rest till you are fully satisfied that you have done so: acceptance brings you to heaven hereafter, but assurance will bring heaven into your souls now. O what a life of delight and pleasure doth the assured believer live! what pleasure is it to him to look back and consider where once he was, and where now he is: to look forward and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider where he now is! and where shortly he shall be! I was in my sins, I am now in Christ, I am in Christ now, I shall be with Christ and that for ever, after a few days. I was upon the very brink of hell, I am now upon the very borders of heaven; I shall be in a little while among the innumerable company of Angels and glorified Saints bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part with them in the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the Lamb for evermore.</p>
                  <p>And why may not you that have received Christ, receive the comfort of your union with him? there be all the grounds and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54344:96"/>

                     </note> betwixt Christ and your souls, which is the very groundwork of assurance: you have the Scriptures before you which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the signs of faith, and the very things within you that answer those signs in the word. So you read, and so, just so you might feel it in your own hearts, would you attend to your own experience. The spirit of God is ready to seal you, 'tis his office and his delight so to do: <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>O therefore give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to this work, attend the study of the Scriptures, and of your own hearts more, and grieve not the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and you may arrive to the very desire of your hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Bring up your conversations to the excellent principles and rules of faith. <hi>As you have received Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Lord, so walk in him, Col.</hi> 2. 6. live as you believe: you received Christ sincerely in your first close with him, O main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the like seriousness and sincerity in all your ways to the end of your lives: you received him intirely and <hi>undividedly</hi> at first, let there be no exceptions against any of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands afterward: you received him <hi>exclusively</hi> to all others; see that you watch against all self-righteousness and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness now, and mingle nothing of your own with his blood, whatever gifts or enlargements in duty God shall give you afterwards.</p>
                  <p>You received him <hi>advisedly</hi> at first, weighing and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the self-denying terms upon which he was offered to you, O shew that it was real, and that you see no cause to repent the bargain, whatever you shall meet with in the ways of Christ and duty afterwards. Convince the world of your constancy and chearfulness in all your sufferings for Christ, that you are still of the same mind you were, and that Christ with his cross, Christ with a prison, Christ with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est afflictions is worthy of all acceptation: <hi>as you have received him, so walk ye in him:</hi> let him be as sweet, as lovely, as precious to you now, as he was the first moment you received him: yea, let your love to him, delights in him, and self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for him, increase with your acquaintance with him day by day.</p>

This is the Saints dignity to be Christs fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, consorts, or copartners: So that look whatever grace or spiritual excellency is in Christ, it is not impropriated to himself, but they do share with him; for indeed he was fill'd with the fulness of the Spirit for their sakes and use: as the Sun is fill'd with light not to shine to it self, but to others; so is Christ with grace: and therefore some translate the Text not <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First, By the spirit poured out upon him, he was prepared for and consecrated to his offices, he was anointed with the holy Ghost and with power, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As this precious oyl runs down from Christ the head to the borders of his garments, I mean as it is shed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believers, so it exceedingly beautifies their faces, and makes them shine with glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It renders them apt, expedite and ready to every good work: <hi>non tar dat unctarota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It kindles and maintains the flame of divine love in their souls, and like a lamp inlightens their minds in the knowledge of Spiritual things, the anointing teaches them.</p>

            <p>And with this oyl of gladness is Christ said to be anointed <hi>above his fellows,</hi> (i. e.) to have a far greater share of the Spirit of grace than they: <hi>for to every one of the Saints is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ, Eph.</hi> 4. 7. but to him the Spirit is not given by measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. <hi>It hath pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell, Col.</hi> 1. 19. and <hi>of his fulness we all receive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1. 16.

               <p>Now that the scope of this discourse be not mistaken, let the Reader know that I am not here treating of the Saints communion or fellowship with God in duties, as in prayer, hearing, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of that interest which believers have in the good things of Christ by vertue of the Mystical Union betwixt them through faith: there is a twofold communion of the Saints with Christ.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The first is an <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The second is a <hi>State.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>There is an actual fellowship or communion the Saints have with Christ in holy duties: wherein Christians let forth their hearts to God by desires, and God lets forth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and refreshments again into their hearts: they open their mouths wide, and he fills them: this communion with God is the joy and comfort of a believers life: but I am not to speak of that here. It is not any <hi>act</hi> of communion, but the <hi>State</hi> of communion, from which all acts of communion flow, and upon which they all depend; that I am now to treat of: which is nothing else but the joynt interest that Christ and the Saints have in the same things: as when a ship, an house, or estate is among many partners,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54344:100"/>
or joynt-heirs, every one of them hath right to it, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in it, though some of them have a greater and others a lesser part. So is it betwixt Christ and his people: there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a fellowship or joynt interest betwixt them, upon which ground they are call'd <hi>co-heirs with Christ, Rom.</hi> 8. 17. This communion or participation in Christs benefits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Union of our nature, and the <hi>mystical union</hi> of our persons with the Son of God: in the first he partakes with us, in the second we partake with him; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the remote, the later the next cause thereof.</p>
               <p>In the explication of this point I shall speak to these four things,
<list>
                     <item>1. What are those things in which Christ and believers have fellowship.</item>
                     <item>2. By what means they come to have such a fellowship with Christ.</item>
                     <item>3. How great a dignity this is to have fellowship with Jesus Christ.</item>
                     <item>4. And then apply the whole in divers practical infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, What are those things in which Christ and believers <note place="margin">1.</note> have fellowship: to which I must speak both <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>positively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The Saints have no fellowship with Jesus Christ in <note place="margin">Negatively.</note> those things that belong to him as God: such as his consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality, coequality, and coeternity with the father: 'tis the blasphemy of the wicked <hi>Familists</hi> to talk of being God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into God and Christed into Christ: neither men or Angels partake in these things, they are the proper and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <note place="margin">Justitia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti fit nostra, non quoad uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalem valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remsed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larem necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp; impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur nobis non ut causis sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationis, sed ut subjectis sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandis. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw de justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione.</hi>
                  </note> glory of the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>Secondlly, The Saints have no communion or fellowship in the honour and glory of his <hi>mediatory works, viz.</hi> his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God, or redemption of the elect: 'tis true, we have the benefit and fruit of his mediation and satisfaction, his righteousness also is imputed to us for our personal justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but we share not in the least with Christ in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this work: nor have we an inherent righteousness in us as Christ hath, nor can we justifie and save others as
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54344:101"/>
Christ doth: we have nothing to do with his peculiar honour and praise in these things: though we have the benefit of being saved, we may not pretend to the honour of being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours as Christ is to our selves or others. Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is not made ours as to its universal value, but as to our particular necessity: nor is it imputed to us as to so many causes of salvation to others, but as to so many subjects to be saved by it our selves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But then, there are many glorious and excellent <note place="margin">Posi ively.</note> things which are in common betwixt Christ and believers, though in them all he hath the preeminence, he shines in the fulness of them as the <hi>Sun,</hi> and we with a borrowed and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser light, but of the same kind and nature as the Stars. Some of these I shall particularly and briefly unfold in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, Believers have communion with Christ in his <hi>names</hi> and titles: they are call'd Christians from Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 15. from him the whole family in heaven and earth is named: this is that worthy name the Apostle speaks of, <hi>James</hi> 2. 7. He is the son of God, and they also by their union with him have power or authority to become the sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. He is the heir of all things, and they are joynt heirs with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. He is both King and Priest, and he hath made them Kings and Priests, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. but they do not only partake in the names and titles, but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion consists in things as well as titles: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have communion with him in his <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> (i. e.) the righteousness of Christ is made theirs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and he is <hi>the Lord our righteousness, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. 'Tis true, the righteousness of Christ is not inherent in us, as it is in him; but it is ours by imputation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. 11. and our union with him is the ground of the imputation of his righteousness to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>we are made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in him, Phil.</hi> 3. 9. for Christ and believers are considered as one person, in construction of Law; as a man and his wife, a <hi>debtor</hi> and <hi>surety</hi> are one: and so his payment or satisfaction is in our name, or upon our account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54344:101"/>
Now this is a most inestimable priviledge, the very ground of all our other blessings and mercies. O what a benefit is this to a poor sinner, that owes to God infinitely more than he is ever able to pay him, by doing or suffering; to have such a rich treasure of <hi>merit</hi> as lyes in the obedience of Christ, to discharge in one entire payment all his debts to the least farthing? <hi>Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Isa.</hi> 45. 24. even as a poor woman that owes more than she is worth, in one moment is discharged of all her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, by her marriage to a wealthy man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Believers have communion with Christ in his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> or Sanctification, for of God he is made unto them not only righteousness, but <hi>Sanctification</hi> also: and as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer priviledge they have a stock of merit in the blood of Christ to justifie them, so here they have the Spirit of Christ to sanctisie them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and therefore we are said of his fulness to receive <hi>grace</hi> for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> say some, grace upon grace, manifold graces or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace: or <hi>grace for grace,</hi> that is, grace answerable to grace: as in the seal and wax, there is line for line, and cut for cut exactly answerable to each other: or grace for grace, that is, say others, the free grace of God in Christ for the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or filling of our souls with grace: be it in which sense it will, it shews the communion believers have with Jesus Christ in grace and holiness. Now holiness is the most precious thing in the world, it's the image of God, and chief excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of man: it is our evidence for glory, yea, and the first-fruits of glory: in Christ dwells the fulness of grace, and from him our head it is derived and communicated to us: thus he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. You would think it no small priviledge to have Baggs of Gold to go to, and enrich your selves with, and yet that were but a very trifle in comparison to have Christs righteousness and holiness to go to for your Justification and Sanctification. More particularly,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Believers have communion with Christ in <hi>his death:</hi> they dye with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I am crucified with Christ, (i. e.)</hi> the death of Christ hath a real killing and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying influence upon the lusts and corruptions of my heart and nature: true it is he died for sin one way, and we dye
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54344:102"/>
to sin another way: he dyed to <hi>expiate</hi> it, we dye to it when we <hi>mortifie</hi> it: the death of Christ is the death of sin in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: and this is a very glorious priviledge: for the death of sin is the life of your souls: if sin do not dye in you by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, you must dye for sin by eternal damnation: if Christ had not dyed, the Spirit of God by which you now mortifie the deeds of the body, could not have been given unto you: then you must have lived Vassals to your sins, and dyed at last in your sins: but the fruit, efficacy and benefit of Christs death is yours, for the killing those sins in you which else had been your ruine.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Believers have Communion with Christ in <hi>his life and resurrection</hi> from the dead: as he rose from the dead, so do they; and that by the power and influence of his <hi>vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and resurrection: 'tis the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus that makes us free from the Law of sin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. our spiritual life is from Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins:</hi> and hence Christ is said to live in the believer, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Now I live, yet not I; but Christ liveth in me:</hi> and it is no small priviledge to partake of the very life of Christ, which is the most excellent life that ever any creature can live: yet such is the happiness of all the Saints, the life of Christ is manifest in them, and such a life as shall never see death.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, To conclude, Believers have fellowship with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ <hi>in his glory</hi> which they shall enjoy in heaven with him: they shall be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. and that's not all, (though as one saith it were a kind of heaven but to look through the keyhole, and have but a glimpse of Christs blessed face) but they shall partake of the glory which the father hath given him, for so he speaks <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22, 24. and more particularly they shall sit with him in his throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. and when he comes to judge the world, he will come to be glorified in the Saints, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. So that you see what glorious and inestimable things are and will be in common betwixt Christ and the Saints. His Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, his righteousness, his holiness, his death, his life, his glory. I do not say that Christ will make any Saint equal with him in glory: that's impossible: he will be known from all the Saints in heaven, as the Sun is distinguished from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54344:102"/>
the Stars: but they shall partake of his glory, and be fill'd with his joy there: and thus you see what those things are that the Saints have fellowship with Christ in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next I would open the way and means by which <note place="margin">2.</note> we come to have fellowship with Jesus Christ in these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent priviledges; and this I shall do briefly in the following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>

                     <hi>some there is an equality, and in others an inequality: according to the measure and gift of Christ,</hi> to every one.</p>
                  <p>In Justification they are all equal: the weak and the strong believer are alike justified, because it is one and the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousness of Christ which is applied to the one and to the other, so that there are no different degrees of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but all that believe are justified from all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. and there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. be they never so weak in faith, or defective in degrees of grace.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54344:103"/>
It's a plain case, that there is great variety sound in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace and comfort among them that are joyntly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in Christ, and equally justified by him.</p>

                  <p>Thus hath the Lord appointed several blessings for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Christ, and several channels of conveying them from him to us: by imputed righteousness we are freed from the <hi>guilt</hi> of sin, by imparted holiness we are freed from the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of sin, and by our glorification with Christ we are freed from all the reliques and remains both of sin and misery let in by sin upon our natures.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly and Lastly, I shall in a few particulars open the <hi>dignity</hi> and excellency of this fruit of our Union with Christ, and shew you, that a greater glory and honour cannot be put upon man, than to be thus in fellowship with Jesus Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one as we are one:</hi> and therefore more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly let it be considered</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>With whom we are associated,</hi> even the Son of God: with him that is over all, God blessed for ever. Our asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with <hi>Angels</hi> is an high advancement, for Angels and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54344:104"/>
Saints are fellow servants in the fame family, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and through Christ we are come to an innumerable company of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. but what is all this to our fellowship with Jesus Christ himself; and that in another manner than Angels have? for though Christ be to them an head of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, yet not an head of vital influence as he is to his mystical body the Church: this therefore is to them a great mystery, which they greatly affect to study, and pry into.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>What we are that are dignified with this title,</hi> the <hi>fellows</hi> or copartners with Jesus Christ: not only <hi>dust</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>dust thou art,</hi> but sinful dust; such wretched sinners as by nature, and the sentence of the Law ought to be associated with devils, and partakers with them of the wrath of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The benefits we are partakers of in and with the Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> and indeed they are wonderful and astonishing things, so far as they do already appear, but yet we see but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of them, comparatively to what we shall see, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> O what will that be! to see him as he is, and to be transformed into his likeness.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The way and manner in which we are brought into this fellowship with Christ,</hi> which is yet more admirable. The <hi>Apostle</hi> gives us a strange account of it in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>is poverty might be rich:</hi> he empties himself of his glory, that we might be fill'd: he is made a curse, that we might enjoy the blessing: he submits to be crown'd with thorns, that we might be crowned with glory and honour: he puts himself into the number of worms, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 6. that we might be made equal to the Angels; O the unconceivable grace of Christ!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The reciprocal nature of that communion which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and believers:</hi> we do not only partake of what is his, but he partakes of what is ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with us in all our wants, sorrows, miseries, and afflictions, and we have communion with him in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, grace, sonship, and glory: he takes part of our misery and we take part of his blessedness: our sufferings are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54344:104"/>
his sufferings, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. O what an honour is it to thee, poor wretch, whom a great many would not turn aside to ask how thou doest, to have a King, yea, the Prince of all the Kings of the earth to pity, relieve, sympathize, groan and bleed with thee, to sit by thee in all thy troubles, and give thee his Cordials, to say thy troubles are my troubles, and thy afflictions are my afflictions: whatever toucheth thee toucheth me also: O what name shall we give unto such grace as this is?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and Lastly, <hi>Consider the perpetuity of this priviledge:</hi> your fellowship with Christ is <hi>interminable,</hi> and abides for ever. Christ and the Saints shall be glorified together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. while he hath any glory, they shall partake with him. 'Tis said indeed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. that there shall be a time when Christ will deliver up the Kingdome to his father: but the meaning is not that ever he will cease to be an head to his Saints, or they from being his members: no, no, the relation never cease: Justification, Sanctification and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption are everlasting things, and we can never be devested of them.</p>

                  <p>First, The increase of your Sanctification, by fresh participations from the Fountain: as <hi>Cloth</hi> which is often dipt into the <hi>Fat</hi> receives the deeper dye, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier tincture; so will your souls by assiduous communion with God. It will also be discerned,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In your deeper humiliation and spiritual sense of your own vileness: the more any man partakes of God, and is acquainted with him, and assimilated to him; the more base and vile in his own sight he still grows, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It will appear in your more vehement longings after the full enjoyment of God in heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. you that have the first-fruits, will groan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your selves after the full harvest, and satisfying fruition: you will not be so taken with things below, as to be content

with the best lot on earth for your everlasting portion. O if hese communicated drops be so sweet, what is there in Christ the fountain?</p>
                  <p>And thus I have opened the method of grace in bringing home Christ and his benefits to Gods elect by Union in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to communion with him.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Impetration</hi> of our Redemption by Jesus Christ, being finished in the first part, and the way and means by which Christ is <hi>applied</hi> to sinners in the foregoing part of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> I am now orderly come to the general <hi>Use</hi> of the whole; which in the first place shall be by way of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to invite and perswade all men to come unto Christ, who in all the former Sermons
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54344:108"/>
hath been represented in his <hi>garments of salvation,</hi> red in his apparel, prepared and offered to sinners as their all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and only remedy: and in the following Sermons will be represented in his <hi>perfumed garments</hi> coming out of his <hi>Ivory Palaces, Psal.</hi> 45. 8. to allure and draw all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>For a general head to this Use which will be large, I have chosen this Scripture, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words are the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, in which there is a vital ravishing sound: 'tis your mercy to have such a joyful sound in your ears this day: and in them I will consider their <hi>dependance, parts</hi> and <hi>scope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to their dependance it is manifest they have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate relation to the foregoing verse, wherein Christ opens his Commission and declares the fulness of his authority and saving power, and the impossibility of coming to God any other way: <hi>all things are delivered to me of my Eather, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father: neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> v. 27.</p>
            <p>This 28 <hi>verse</hi> is brought in proleptically to obviate the discouragements of any poor convinced and humbled soul, who might thus object, Lord, I am fully satisfied of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy saving power, but greatly doubt whether ever I shall have the benefit thereof. For I see so much sin and guilt in my self, so great vileness, andutter unworthiness, that I am over-weighed and even sink under the burden of it: my soul is discouraged because of sin. This objection is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the words of my <hi>Text, Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,</hi> Q. d. let not the sense of your sin and misery drive you from your only remedy: be your sins never so many, and the sense and burthen of them never so heavy; yet for all that, <hi>come unto me:</hi> you are the persons whom I invite and call. I came not to call the righteous but sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>In the words three things are especially remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ye that labour and are heavy laden:</hi> the word which we translate labour signifies a labouring even to faintness and tiring, to the consumption and wast of the spirits: and the other word signifies such a pressure by a burden that is too heavy to be born that we do even sink down under it.</p>
            <p>There is some difference among expositors about the quality of this burthen. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> &amp; some others after him expound it of burden of the legal rites &amp; <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which was a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den indeed such as neither they, nor their fathers could bear: under the task and burden of these legal observances they did sweat and toyl to obtain a righteousness to justifie them before God, &amp; all in vain; and this is a pious sense, but others expound it of the burthen of sin in general; the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and evils of practice, which souls are convinced have brought them under the curse, and will bring them to hell, and therefore labour and strive all that in them lyes, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation to clear themselves from it, but all in vain; whilest they strive in their own strength. Such are they that are here called to come to Christ, which is the second thing, namely</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Invitation of burthened souls to Christ. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden: come unto me,</hi> (i. e.) believe in me, lean and rest your burthened souls upon me. I am able to ease all your burthens, in me is that righteousness and peace which you seek in vain in all the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal rites and Ceremonies: or in your repentance, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and duties, but it will give you no ease, 'twill be no benefit to you except you come unto me. Faith is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed under this notion, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. <note place="margin">2.</note> and it is to be further noted that <hi>[all]</hi> burthened souls are
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54344:109"/>
invited to come. <hi>All</hi> ye that labour: whatever your sin or guilt hath been, whatever your fears or discouragements are, yet come <hi>(i. e.)</hi> believe in me.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is the encouragement Christ gives to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>And I will give you rest:</hi>

               </note> I will give you rest from your labour, your Consciences shall be pacified, your heart at rest and quiet in that pardon, peace and favour of God which I will procure for you by my death. But here it must be heedfully noted, that this promise of rest in Christ is not made to men simply as they are sinners, nor yet as they are burthened, and heavy laden sinners: but as they come to Christ, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as they are believers. For let a man break his heart with sin, let him weep out his eyes for sin, let him mourn as a <hi>dove,</hi> and shed as many tears for sin (if it were possible) as ever there fell drops of rain upon the ground, yet if he come not to Christ by faith, his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall not save him, nor all his sorrows bring him to true rest.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> 14. 9. 'tis so far from being burthensome to some, that it is a <hi>sport</hi> to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 23. but when a mans eyes are opened to see the evil that is in sin, and the eternal misery that follows it, (sin and hell being linkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with such strong chains as nothing but the blood of Christ can loose) then no burthen is like that of sin: <hi>a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conscience who can bear? Prov.</hi> 18. 14. For let us but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the efficacy that the Law of God hath upon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, when it comes in the spirituality and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it to convince and humble the soul of a sinner. For then</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The memory of sin long since committed is refresht and revived as if it had been but yesterday:</hi> there are fresh recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions <note place="margin">1. What inward troubles for sin are.</note> of sin long since acted, and forgotten, as if they had never been: what was done in our youth is fetcht back again, and by a new impression of fear and horror set home upon the trembling conscience. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the sins of my youth.</hi> Conscience can call back the days that are past, and draw up a new charge upon the score of old sins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. all that ever we did is recorded and entred into the book of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and now is the time to open that book, when the Lord will convince and awaken sinners: we read in <hi>Job</hi> 14. 17. of sealing up iniquities in a bag, which is an allusion to the <hi>Clerk of the Assizes,</hi> that takes all the indictments that are made against persons at the <hi>Assizes,</hi> and seals them up in a bag, in order to a Tryal. This is the first office and work of conscience, upon which</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:54344:110"/>
The second, namely its <hi>Accusations,</hi> do depend: these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of Conscience are terrible things, who can stand <note place="margin">2.</note> before them? they are <hi>full,</hi> they are <hi>clear,</hi> and all of them referring to the approaching Judgement of the great and terrible God.</p>
               <p>Conscience dives into all sins, secret as well as open, and <note place="margin">Prima est haec ultio, quod se judice, nemo uocens absolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> into all the circumstances and aggravations of sin, as being committed against light, against mercy, against the strivings, warnings, and regretts of conscience. So that we may say of the efficacy of conscience as it is said <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 6. of the influence of the <hi>Sun, nothing is hid from the heat or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof.</hi> Come (saith the woman of <hi>Samaria) see a man that hath told me all that ever I did, Joh.</hi> 4. 29, Christ convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her but of one sin by that discourse, but conscience by that one fetcht in and charged all the rest upon her. And as the accusations of conscience are full, so they are <hi>clear,</hi> and undeniable: a man becomes self-convinced, and there remains no shift, excuse, or plea to defend himself: a thousand witnesses cannot prove any point more clearly than one te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of conscience doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>the man was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>

                     </gap> &amp; ille capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus er at.</note> a mute; muzzled (as the word signifies) by the clear testimony of his own conscience: these accusations are the second work or office of conscience, and they make way for the third, namely,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>sentence</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> of Conscience: and truly this is an insupportable burthen: the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3.</note> of conscience is nothing else but its application of the condemning sentence of the Law to a mans person: the Law curseth every one that transgresseth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence applys this curse to the guilty sinner. So that it sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences the sinner in Gods name and authority, from which there is no appeal: the voice of conscience is the voice of God, and what it pronounces in Gods name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he will confirm and ratifie, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>if our hearts</hi> (i. e.) our consciences, <hi>condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things:</hi> this is that torment which no man can endure. See the effects of it in <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Judas,</hi> and in <hi>Spira,</hi> 'tis a real foretast of hell torments: this is that <hi>worm that never dyes, Mark</hi> 9. 44. For look as a worm in the body is bred of the corruption that is there, so the accusations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54344:110"/>
of conscience are bred in the soul by the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and guilt that is there: as the worm in the body preys and bites upon the tender sensible inward parts, so doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science touch the very quick. This is its third effect or work to sentence and condemn, and this also makes way for a fourth, namely,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To upbraid and reproach the sinner under his misery:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> and this makes a man a very <hi>terrour to himself:</hi> to be pittied in misery is some relief, but to be upbraided and reproached doubles our affliction: you know it was one of the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Christs</hi> sufferings, to be reproached by the tongue of his enemies, whilest he hanged in torments upon the cursed tree: but all the scoffs and reproaches, the bitter jeers and <hi>Sarcas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> in the world are nothing to these of a mans own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: this will cut to the very bone.</p>
               <p>O when a mans conscience shall say to him in a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as <hi>Reuben</hi> to his afflicted brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 22. <hi>Spake I not unto you saying, do not sin against the child: and ye would not hear, therefore behold also his blood is required.</hi> So consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Did I not warn you, threaten you, perswade you in time against these evils? but you would not hearken to me, therefore behold now you must suffer to all eternity for it: the wrath of God is kindled against thy soul for it: this is the fruit of thy own wilful madness and obstinacy. Now thou shalt know the price of sinning against God, against light, and conscience. O this is terrible! every bite of conscience makes a poor soul to startle, and in a terrible fright to cry, Oh the worm! Oh the bitter foretast of Hell! a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
               <p>This is a fourth wound of conscience, and it makes way for a fifth, for here it is as in the pouring out of the vials, and the sounding of those woe-trumpets in the Revelation, one woe is past, and another cometh. After all these deadly blows of conscience upon the very heart of a sinner, comes another as dreadful as any that is yet named, and that is,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The fearful expectations of wrath to come which <note place="margin">5.</note> it begets in the soul of a guilty sinner: of this you read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>a fearful looking for of Judgement, and fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and this makes the stoutest sinner quail and faint under the burthen of sin. For the tongue of man cannot declare
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54344:111"/>
what it is to lye down and rise with those fearful expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the case of such sinners is somewhat like that which is described in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 65, 66, 67. <hi>The Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind, and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have no assurance of thy life: in the morning thou shalt say Would God it were evening, and at even thou shalt say Would God it were morning, for the fear of thine heart, wherewith thou shalt fear, &amp;c.</hi> Only in this it differs, in this Scripture you have the terrours of those described, whose temporal life hangs in doubtful suspense, but in the persons I am speaking of it is a trembling under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions and expectations of the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
               <p>Believe it Friends, words cannot express what those poor creatures feel, that lye down and rise under these fears and frights of conscience. Lord what will become of me! I am free among the dead, yea, among the damned. I hang by the frail thred of a momentany life, which will and must break shortly, and may break the next moment, over the everlasting burnings: no pleasant bread is eaten in these days, but what is like the bread of condemned men.</p>
               <p>And thus you see what the burden of sin is, when God makes it to bear upon the consciences of men, no burden of affliction is like it: losses of dearest relations: sorrows for an only son are not so pungent, and penetrating as these, For</p>
               <p>First, No creature enjoyment is pleasant under these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles: in other troubles they <unclear>may</unclear> signifie something to a mans relief, but here they are nothing, the wound is too deep to be healed by any thing but the blood of Jesus Christ: Conscience requires as much to satisfie it, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to satisfie him. When God is at peace with thee (saith Conscience) then will I be at peace with thee too; but till then, expect no rest nor peace from me: all the pleasures and diversions in the world shall never stop my mouth: go where thou wilt, I will follow thee like thy shadow: be thy portion in the world as sweet as it will, I will drop in Gall and Wormwood into thy cup, that thou shalt tast no sweetness in any thing, till thou hast got thy pardon.</p>

These inward troubles for sin, alienate the mind from all former pleasures and delights, there's no more taste or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in them, than in the white of an Egg.

Ornaments have no beauty, what heart hath a poor creature to deck that body, in which dwells such a miserable soul! to feed and pamper that carcass that hath been the souls inducement to, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in sin, and must be its companion in everlasting misery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, These inward troubles for sin, put a dread into death beyond whatever the soul saw in it before. Now it looks like the <hi>King of terrours</hi> indeed: you read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. of some that through fear of death are all their life long sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage. O what a lively comment is a soul in this case able to make upon such a Text? they would not scare at the pale horse, nor at him that sits on him though his name be called death, if it were not for what follows him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. but when they consider that hell follows, they tremble at the very name, or thoughts of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such is the nature of these inward troubles of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that they swallow up the sense of all other outward troubles: alas these are all lost in the deeps of soul sorrows as the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rivulets are in the vast Sea: he that is wounded at the heart, will not cry <hi>Oh</hi> at the bite of a Flea: and surely no greater is the proportion betwixt outward and inward sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: a small matter formerly would discompose a man, and put him into a fret, now ten thousand outward troubles are lighter than a feather. For, saith he, <hi>why doth the living man complain?</hi> am I yet on this side eternal burnings? O let me not complain then, whatever my condition be: have I losses in the world, or pains upon my body? alas these are not to be named with the loss of God, and the feeling of his wrath and indignation for evermore. Thus you see what troubles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles for sin be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you ask in the second place, how it comes <note place="margin">2. How souls are supported under such troubles.</note> to pass that any soul is supported under such strong troubles of Spirit that all that feel them do not sink under them; that all that go down into these deep waters of sorrow, are not drowned in them: The Answer is,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:54344:112"/>
First, Though this be a very sad time with the soul (much like that of <hi>Adam,</hi> betwixt the breach of the first Covenant, and the first promise of Christ made to him) yet the souls that are thus heavy laden do not sink, because God hath a most tender care over them, and regard to them: under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them are the everlasting arms, and thence it is they sink not: were they left to grapple with these troubles in their own strength, they could never stand: but God takes care of these mourners that their Spirits do not fail before him, and the souls that he hath made, I mean those of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whom he is this way preparing for, and bringing unto Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord is pleased to nourish still some hope in the soul under the greatest fears and troubles of Spirit: though it have no <hi>comfort</hi> or joy, yet it hath some <hi>hope</hi> in the bottom and that keeps up the heart: the afflicted soul doth in this case as the afflicted Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his mouth in the dust if yet there may be hope:</hi> he saith, <hi>its good for a man to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of God:</hi> there are usually some glimmerings or dawnings of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through Christ in the midnight darkness of inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: <hi>non dantur purae tenebrae,</hi> in hell indeed there is no hope to enlighten the darkness, but it is not so upon earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The experiences of others who have been in the same deeps of trouble are also of great use to keep up the soul <note place="margin">

                  </note> above water. The experience of another is of great use to prop up a desponding mind, whilest as yet it hath none of its own: and indeed for the support of souls in such cases they were recorded 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>For this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long suffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting:</hi> for an encouraging <hi>pattern,</hi> an eminent precedent to all poor sinners that were to come after him: that none might absolutely despair of finding mercy through Christ. You know if a man be taken sick, and none can tell what the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease is, none can say that ever they heard of such a disease before, it's exceeding frightful; but if one and another, it may be twenty, come to the sick mans bedside and tell him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54344:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir, be not afraid, I have been in the very same case that you now are, and so have many more, and all did well at last, why this is half a cure to the sick man. So it is here a great support to hear the experiences of other Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As the experiences of others support the soul under these burdens, so the riches of free grace through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ uphold it: 'tis rich and abundant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. <hi>ult.</hi> plenteous redemption, and 'tis free and to the worst of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 18. and under these troubles it finds it self in the way and proper method of mercy, for so my Text (a Text that hath upheld many thousand drooping hearts) states it: all this gives hope, and encouragement under trouble.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Lastly, Though the state of the soul be sad and sinking, yet Jesus Christ usually makes haste in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the trouble to relieve it, by sweet and seasonable disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his grace: <hi>cum duplicantur lateres, venit Moses:</hi> in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen. It is with Christ as it was with <hi>Joseph</hi> whose bowels yearned towards his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and he was in pain till he had told them <hi>I am Joseph your brother.</hi> This is sweetly exhibited to us in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parable of the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15. when his Father saw him, being yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck and kissed him: mercy runs nimbly to help when souls are ready to fail under the pressure of sin. And thus you see both how they are burthened, and how upheld under the burthen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be enquired in the last place, why God makes the burden of sin press so heavy upon the hearts of poor <note place="margin">3. Why doth God make the burden of sin lie so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon the souls of some sinners.</note> sinners, 'tis answered,</p>
               <p>First, He doth it to divorce their hearts from sin, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them an experimental taste of the bitterness and evil that is in sin: mens hearts are naturally glewed with delight to their sinful courses: all the perswasions and arguments in the world are too weak to separate them and their beloved lusts. The morsels of sin go down smoothly and sweetly: they roll them with much delectation under their tongues; and it is but need that such bitter potions as these should be administred to make their stomachs rise against sin, as that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54344:113"/>
word used by the Apostle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. signifies, <hi>in that ye</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>sorrowed after a godly sort, what indignation it wrought:</hi> it notes the rising of the stomach with rage, a being angry even unto sickness, and this is the way, the best and most effectual way to separate the soul of a sinner from his Lusts: for in these troubles conscience saith, as it is in Jer. 4. 18. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is great, because it reacheth unto thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord doth this, to make Jesus Christ most welcome and desirable to the soul. Christ is not <hi>sweet,</hi> till sin be made <hi>bitter</hi> to us. Matth. 9. 12. <hi>They that be whole need not a Physician, but they that be sick.</hi> If once God wound the heart of a sinner with the stinging sense of sin, then nothing in the world is so precious, so necessary, so vehemently desired, and panted for, as Jesus Christ. O that I had Christ, if I did go in raggs, if I did feed upon no other food all my dayes, but the bread and water of affliction! This is the language of a soul filled with the sense of the evil of sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord doth this to advance the riches of his free grace in the eyes of sinners. Grace never appears Grace, till sin appear to be sin. The deeper our sense of the evil of sin is, the deeper our apprehensions of the free grace of God in Christ will be. The louder our <hi>groans</hi> have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of sin, the louder will our <hi>acclamations</hi> and praises be for our salvation from it by Jesus Christ. <hi>To me</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) the chiefest of sinners was this grace given,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. Never doth the grace of a Prince melt the heart of a Traytor, as when Tryal, Sentence, and all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for his execution have past, before his unexpected pardon comes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Lord doth this to prevent relapses into sin: <hi>In that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought!</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 7. The burnt Child dreads the fire; the Bird that is delivered out of the <hi>Tallons</hi> of the <hi>Hawk,</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles afterward at the noise of his <hi>Bells. After such a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as this, should we again break thy Commandments?</hi> Ezra 9. 13, 14. Ask a poor penitent soul, that hath been in the deeps of sorrow for sin, Will you return to your former course of sin again? and it sounds in his ears, as if you should ask him,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54344:113"/>

                     </gap>o tanti emere poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> O no: it hath cost him dear already.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Lastly, This the Lord doth, to make them both skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compassionate in relieving others that are under like inward troubles. None can speak so judiciously, so pertinently, so feelingly to anothers case, as he that hath been in the <note place="margin">Haud ignara mali, miseris <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thus you have had a brief account, what the burden of sin is, how souls are supported under that burden, and why the Lord causes sin to lye so heavy upon the souls of some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The improvement of all will be in a double Use: <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>First, No soul is so capacious now, to take in the fulness of the evil and misery of sin, as they are, who are gone down to the place of torments. Even as the joyes of Gods face
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54344:115"/>
above are much unknown to them that have the foretastes and first-fruits of them here by faith; so the misery of the damned is much unknown, even to them that have in their consciences now the bitterest taste and sense of sin in this world: as we have the visions of heaven, so we have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of hell also but darkly through a glass.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, No burden of sin presseth so continually upon the soul here, as it doth there: afflicted souls on earth have intermissions and breathing times; but in hell there are no Lucid intervals: the wrath of God there is still flowing: it is in <hi>fluxu continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Fourthly, Under these troubles the soul hath hope, but there all hope is cut off: all the Gospel is full of hope; it breathes nothing but hope to sinners that are moving Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward under their troubles: but in hell the pangs of despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rend their consciences for ever.

                        <hi>pardon of sin be to a sin-burdened soul!</hi> Is it a refreshment to a prisoner, to have his chains knockt off? a comfort to a debtor, to have his debts paid, and obligations cancelled? What joy must it then be to a sin-burthened soul, to hear the voice of pardon and peace in his trembling conscience? Is the light of the morning pleasant to a man after a weary tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some night? the Spring of the year pleasant after a hard and tedious Winter? they are so indeed; but nothing so sweet, as the favour, peace and pardon of God to a soul that hath been long restless and anxious under the terrors and fears of conscience: for though after pardon and peace a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members sin still, yet it is as one that remembers the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pits and deep waters from which he hath been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delivered, and had a narrow escape. O the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54344:115"/>
sweetness of a pardon! Who can read it, and not wet it with tears of joy? Are we glad when the grinding pain of the Stone, or racking fits of the Colick are over? and shall we not be transported, when the accusations and condemnations of conscience are over? Tongue cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press what these things are; this joy is something that no words can convey to the understanding of another, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt the anguish of sin.</p>

                     <p>First, One that is truly burdened with sin, will not allow himself to live in the secret practice of sin: either your trouble will put an end to your course of sinning, or your sinning will put an end to your troubles. Consult 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THIS Point sounds sweetly in the ear of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed sinner, it is the most joyful voice that ever the soul heard; the voice of blessing from Mount <hi>Gerezim,</hi> the ravishing voice from Mount <hi>Sion, Ye are come to Jesus the Mediator.</hi> In opening of it I will shew,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is to come to Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. How Christ invites men to come to him.</item>
                  <item>3. Why his invitation is directed to burdened souls.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, We will enquire what it is to come to Christ, and <note place="margin">1.</note> how many things are involved in it.</p>
               <p>In general, To come to Christ, is a phrase <hi>aequipollent,</hi> or of the same amount with believing in Christ. It is an expression that carries the nature and necessity of faith in it, and is reciprocated with believing, John 6. 35. <hi>He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.</hi> Coming to Christ, is believing in Christ; and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Christ, is coming to Christ: they are <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> and import the self same thing: only in this notion of faith there are many rich and excellent things hinted to us, which no other word can so aptly convey to our minds: as,</p>
               <p>First, It hints this to us, That the souls of convinced and burdened sinners, do not only discern the <hi>reality</hi> of Christ, or that he is; but also the necessity of applying Christ, and that their eternal life is in their union with him: for this is most certain, that the object of faith must be determinate and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54344:118"/>
fixed; the soul must believe that Christ is, or else there can be no emotions of the soul after him: all coming presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a fixed term to which we come, Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God, must believe that God is.</hi> Take away this, and all motion after Christ presently stops. No wonder then that souls in their first motions to Christ find themselves clogg'd with so many atheistical temptations, shaking their assent to the truth of the Gospel at the very root and foundation of it: but they that come to Christ do see that <hi>he is,</hi> and that their life and happiness lyes in their union with him; else they would never come to him upon such terms as they do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Coming to Christ, implyes the souls despair of salvation any other way: the way of faith is a supernatural way, and souls will not attempt it, until they have tryed all natural wayes to help and save themselves, and find it all in vain: therefore the <hi>Text</hi> describes these <hi>Comers to Christ</hi> as weary persons, that have been tugging and striving all other wayes for rest, but can find none; and so are forced to relinquish all their fond expectations of salvation in any other way, and come to Christ as their last and only remedy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Coming to Christ, notes a supernatural and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power acting the soul quite above its own natural abilities in this motion, John 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me except my father which hath sent me draw him.</hi> It is as possible for the ponderous mountains to start from their Bases and Centres, mount themselves aloft into the air, and there flye like wandring Atoms hither and thither; as it is for any man of himself, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by a pure natural power of his own, to come to Christ: it was not a stranger thing for <hi>Peter</hi> to come to Christ walking upon the Waves of the Sea, than for his or any mans soul to come to Christ in the way of faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Coming to Christ, notes the voluntariness of the soul in its motion to Christ. 'Tis true, there's no coming without the Fathers drawing; but that drawing hath nothing of <hi>co-action</hi> in it; it doth not destroy, but powerfully, and with an overcoming sweetness perswade the will. 'Tis not forced or driven, <hi>but it comes:</hi> being made willing in the day of Gods power, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. Ask a poor distressed sinner in that season, Are you willing to come to Christ? O rather than live. Life is not so necessary as Christ is. O with all my heart,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54344:118"/>
ten thousand worlds for Jesus Christ if he could be purchased, were nothing answerable to his value in mine eyes. The souls motion to Christ is free and voluntary, <hi>'tis coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It implyes this in it, That no duties or Ordinances (which are but the wayes or means by which we come to Christ) are or ought to be <hi>Central</hi> and <hi>terminative</hi> to the soul: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the soul of a believer is not to sit down and rest in them; but to come by them, or through them to Jesus Christ, and take up his rest in him only. No duties, no reformations, no Ordinances of God how excellent soever these things are in themselves, and how necessary soever they are in their proper place and use, can give rest to the weary and heavy laden soul: it cannot centre in any of them; and you may see it cannot, because it still <hi>gravitates,</hi> and inclines to another thing, even Christ; and cannot terminate its motion till it be come to him. Christ is the term to which a believer moves; and therefore cannot sit down by the way as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as if he were at his journeys end. Ordinances and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have the nature and use of means to bring us to Christ, but not to be to any man instead of Christ.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Coming to Christ, implies an hope or expectation <note place="margin">Venite ad me, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus fidei, &amp; spei religiosae, &amp; desiderii. <hi>Burgensis in loc.</hi>
                  </note> from Christ in the coming soul. If it have no hope, why doth it move forward? as good sit still, and resolve to perish where it is, as come to Christ, if there be no ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect salvation by him. Hope is the spring of motion and industry: if you cut off hope, you hamstring faith: it cannot move to Christ, except it be satisfied at least of the possibility of mercy and salvation by him. Hence it is, that when comers to Christ are strugling with the doubts and fears of the issue, the Lord is pleased to enliven their faint hopes, by setting on such Scriptures as that John 6. 37. <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out:</hi> and Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He is able to save to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all that come unto God by him.</hi> This puts life into hope, and hope puts life into industry and motion.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Coming to Christ for rest, implies that believers have, and lawfully may have an eye to their own happiness in closing with the Lord Jesus Christ. The poor soul comes for rest: it comes for salvation: its eye and aim is upon it: and this aim of the soul at its own good is legitimated and allowed by that expression of Christ, John 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:54344:119"/>
                  <hi>ye may have life.</hi> If Christ blame them for not coming to him that they might have life, sure he would not blame them, had they come to him for life.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, But Lastly, and which is the principal thing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this expression, Coming to Christ, notes the all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Christ to answer all the needs and wants of distressed souls, and their betaking themselves accordingly to him only for relief, being content to come to Christ for whatever they need, and live upon that fulness that is in him. If there were not an all-sufficiency in Christ, no soul would come to him: for this is the very ground upon which men come, Heb. 7. 25. <hi>he is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the uttermost: in the greatest plunges, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers: he hath a fulness of saving power in him; and this encourages souls to come unto him. One beggar uses not to wait at the door of another, but all at the doors of them they conceive able to relieve them. And as this notes the fulness of Christ as a Saviour, so it must needs note the emptiness and humility of the soul as a comer to him. This is call'd submission in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. Proud nature must be deeply distressed, humbled and moulded into another temper, before it will be perswaded to live upon those terms, to come to Christ for every thing it wants, to live upon Christ's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the way of grace and favour, and have no stock of its own to live upon. O this is hard, but it's the way of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place let us see how Christ invites <note place="margin">2.</note> men to come unto him, and you shall find the means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this work, are either <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>principal,</hi> namely the Spirit of God, who is Christ's <hi>Vice-gerent,</hi> and comes to us in his name and room to perswade us to believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 26. or <hi>external,</hi> namely the preaching of the Gospel by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated <hi>Embassadors,</hi> who in Christ's stead beseech men to be reconciled to God: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to come to Christ by faith in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their reconciliation and peace with God. But all means and instruments employ'd in this work of bringing men to Christ, entirely depend upon the blessing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Spirit of God, without whom they signifie nothing: how long may Ministers preach, before one soul come to Christ, except the Spirit co-operate in that work? Now as to the manner in which men are perswaded, and their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54344:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wills wrought upon to come to Christ, I will briefly note seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts of the Spirit in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>First, There is an <hi>illustrating work</hi> of the Spirit upon the minds of sinners, opening their eyes to see their danger and misery. Till this be discovered, no man stirs from his place: 'tis sense of danger that rouzes the secure sinner, that distresses him and makes him look about for deliverance, crying, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> and 'tis the discovery of Christs ability to save, which is the ground and reason, (as was observed above) of its motion to Christ. Hence, <hi>seeing the Son,</hi> is joyned with believing or <hi>coming to him,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 6. 40.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>Authoritative call,</hi> or commanding voice of the Spirit in the Word; a voice that's full of awful majesty and power, 1 Joh. 3. 23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> This call of the Spirit to come to Christ rolls one great block, namely the fear of presumption, out of the souls way to Christ, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>presumption</hi> in coming, makes it <hi>rebellion,</hi> and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable obstinacy to refuse to come. This answers all pleas against coming to Christ from our unworthiness and deep guilt, and mightily encourages the soul to come to Christ, whatever it hath been or done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are soul-encouraging <hi>conditional promises</hi> to all that do come to Christ in obedience to the Command. Such is that in my Text, <hi>I will give you rest:</hi> and that in John 6. 37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out:</hi> and these breathe life and encouragement into poor souls that hang back and are daunted through their own unworthiness.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are <hi>dreadful threatnings</hi> denounced by the Spirit in the Word against all that refuse or neglect to come to Christ, which are of great use to engage and quicken souls in their way to Christ, Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believes not, shall be damned. Dye in his sins,</hi> John 8. 24. <hi>The wrath of God shall remain on him,</hi> John 3. ult. Which is as if the Lord had said, Sinners don't dally with my Christ: don't be alwayes treating and never concluding or resolving: for if there be Justice in heaven, or Fire in hell, every soul that comes not to Christ, must and shall perish to all eternity: upon your own heads let the blood and destruction of your own souls be for ever, if you will not come unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:54344:120"/>
Fifthly, There are <hi>moving and working examples</hi> set before souls in the Word, to prevail with them to come, alluring and encouraging Examples of such as have come to Christ under deepest guilt and discouragement, and yet found mercy, 1 Tim. 1. 15, 16. <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief: howbeit (or nevertheless) for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him to life everlasting.</hi> Who would not come to Christ after such an <hi>example</hi> as this? And if this will not prevail, there are dreadful examples recorded in the Word setting before us the miserable condition of all such as refuse the calls of the Word to come to Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20. <hi>By which also he went and preached to the spirits which are in prison, which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah.</hi> The meaning is, the sinners that lived before the Flood, but now are in hell, clapt up into that prison, had the offers of grace made them, but despised them, and now lye for their disobedience in prison, under the wrath of God for it, in the lowest hell.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Lastly, There is an effectual <hi>perswading,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and victorious work of the Spirit upon the hearts and wills of sinners, under which they come to Jesus Christ. Of this I have spoken at large before in the <hi>fourth Sermon,</hi> and therefore shall not add any thing more here. This is the way and manner, in which souls are prevailed with to come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the last place, if you enquire why Christ makes his invitations to weary and heavy laden souls, and to <note place="margin">3.</note> no other: the answer is briefly this:</p>
               <p>First, Because in so doing, he follows the <hi>Commission</hi> which he received from his Father; for so you will find it runs in Isa. 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tydings to the meek, he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.</hi> You see here how Christs Commission binds him up: his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent him to poor broken hearted sinners, and he will keep close to his Commission. <hi>He came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:54344:120"/>
                  <hi>but sinners (i. e.</hi> sensible burthened sinners) <hi>to repentance,</hi> Matth. 9. 13. <hi>I am not sent</hi> (saith he) <hi>but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</hi> Thus his Instructions and Commission from the Father, limit him only to sensible and burthened souls, and he will be faithful to his Commission.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The very order of the Spirits work in bringing men to Christ, shews us to whom the invitations and offers of grace in Christ are to be made. For none are convinced of righteousness, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the compleat and perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is in Christ for their Justification, until first they be convinced of sin; and consequently, no man will or can come to Christ by faith, till convictions of sin have awakened and distressed them, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 9. This being the due order of the Spirits operation, the same order must be observed in Gospel offers and invitations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It behoves, that Christ should provide for his own glory as well as for our safety, and not expose that, to secure this; but save us in that way which will bring him most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praise. And certainly such a way is this, by first convincing, humbling and burthening the souls of men, and then bringing them to rest in himself.</p>
               <p>Alas! Let those that never saw or felt the evil of sin, be told of rest, peace and pardon in Christ, they will but despise it, as a thing of no value, Luke 5. 31. <hi>The whole need not a Physician, but those that are sick.</hi> Bid a man that thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sound and whole, go to the <hi>Physician,</hi> and he will but laugh at the motion. If you offer him the richest composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will refuse it, slight it, and it may be spill it upon the ground: ay, but if the same man did once feel an acute disease, and were made to sweat and groan under strong pains, if ever he come to know what sick dayes and restless nights are, and to apprehend his life to be in eminent hazard; then messengers are sent one after another in post-haste to the Physician; then he begs him with tears to do what in him lyes for his relief; he thankfully takes the bitterest potions, and praises the care and skill of his Physician with tears of joy; and so the Patients safety and the Physicians honour are both secured. So is it in this method of grace. The Uses follow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be carefully observed how happily that universal particle <hi>all</hi> is inserted in Christs invitation for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinners. <hi>Come unto me [All] ye that labour: q. d.</hi> let no broken-hearted sinner exclude himself, whenas he is not by me excluded from mercy: my grace is my own, I may bestow it where I will, and upon whom I will. 'Tis not I, but <hi>Satan</hi> that impales and incloses my mercy from humbled souls that are made willing to come unto me: he calls that your <hi>presumption,</hi> which my invitation makes your <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I doubt my case is excepted by Christ himself in <hi>Matth.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> 12. 31. where blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is exempted from pardon: and I have had many horrid blasphemous thoughts injected into my soul.</p>
                  <p>Art thou a burdened and heavy laden soul? If so, thy case is not in that, or any other Scripture exempted from mercy: <note place="margin">Sol.</note> for the unpardonable sin is alwayes found in an impenitent heart: as that sin finds no pardon with God, so neither is it followed with contrition and sorrow in the soul that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it.</p>
                  <p>But if I am not guilty of that sin, I am certainly guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> great and heinous abominations of another kind, too great for me to expect mercy for, and therefore I dare not go to Christ.</p>
                  <p>The greater your sins have been, the more need you have to go to Jesus Christ. Let not a <hi>Motive</hi> to Christ, be made <note place="margin">Sol.</note> an <hi>Obstacle</hi> in your way to him. Great sinners are expresly called <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 18. great sinners have come to Christ and found mercy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. And to conclude, it's an high reproach and dishonour to the blood of Christ, and mercy of God which flowes so freely through him, to object the greatness of sin to either of them. Certainly you have not sinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>extent of mercy,</hi> or beyond the <hi>efficacy of the blood of</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:54344:121"/>
of <hi>Christ:</hi> but pardon and peace may be had, if you will thus come to Christ for it.</p>
                  <p>Oh but it's now too late; I have had many thousand calls by the Gospel, and refused them; many purposes in my heart <note place="margin">3. Obj.</note> to go to Christ, and quenched them: my time therefore is past, and now 'tis to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>If the time of grace be past, and God intends no mercy for thee, how comes it to pass thy soul is now filled with trouble <note place="margin">Sol.</note> and distress for sin? Is this the frame of a mans heart that is past hope? Do such signs as these appear in men that are hopeless? Beside, the time of grace is a <hi>secret</hi> hid in the breast of God; but coming to Christ is a <hi>duty</hi> plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the <hi>Text:</hi> and why will you object a thing that is secret and uncertain, against a duty that is so plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Nor do you your selves believe what you object: for at the same time that you say your seasons are over, it is too late; you are notwithstanding found repenting, mourning, praying and striving to come to Christ. Certainly if you knew it were too late, you would not be found labouring in the use of means. Go on therefore, and the Lord be with you. 'Tis not presumption but obedience, to come when Christ calls; as here he doth, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden:</hi>

The word <hi>rest</hi> in this place notes, (and is so rendered by some) a <hi>recreation:</hi> 'tis restored, renewed and recreated as it <note place="margin">Recreabo vos, nempe à lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine, à mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestia, &amp; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Vatab.</hi> &amp; <hi>Erasm.</hi>
                  </note> were, by that sweet repose it hath upon Christ. Believers know, that faith is the sweetest recreation you can take. Others seek to divert and lose their troubles by sinful recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, vain company and the like; but they little know what that recreation, and sweet restoring rest that faith gives the soul, is. You find in Christ what they seek in vain among the creatures. Believing is the highest recreation known in this world. But to prevent mistakes, three <hi>Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> need to be premised, lest we do <hi>in ipso limine impingere,</hi> stumble at the threshold, and so lose our way all along af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>

All believers have the promise, have rest and peace granted them under Gods own hand in many promises; which faith brings them under: and we know that the truth and faithfulness of God stands engaged to make good every line and word of the promise to them. So that though they have not a full and clear actual sense and feeling of rest, they are nevertheless by faith come into the state of rest.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Caution 3.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We may not conceive, that faith it self is the souls rest, but</hi>

                  <p>Having thus guarded the point against misapprehensions by these needful cautions, I shall next shew you, how our coming to Christ by faith brings us to rest in him. And here let it be considered what those things are that burden, grieve and disquiet the soul before its coming to Christ, and how it is relieved and eased in all those respects by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its coming to the Lord Jesus: and you shall find,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:54344:125"/>
First, That one principal ground of trouble, <hi>is the guilt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>of sin upon the conscience,</hi> of which I spake in the former point. The curse of the Law lyes heavy upon the soul, so heavy that nothing is found in all the world able to relieve it under that burthen: as you see in a condemned man, spread a Table in <hi>Prison</hi> with the greatest dainties, and send for the rarest <hi>Musicians,</hi> all will not charm his sorrow; but if you can produce an <hi>authentick pardon,</hi> you ease him presently: just so it is here, faith plucks the thorn out of the conscience which so grieved it, unites the soul with Christ, and then that ground of trouble is removed: for <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ,</hi> Rom. 8. 11. The same moment the soul comes to Christ, it is past from death to life; is no more under the Law, but Grace. If a mans debt be paid by his surety, he need not fear to shew his face boldly abroad: he may freely meet the <hi>Sergeant</hi> at the prison door.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The soul of a convinced sinner is exceedingly <note place="margin">2.</note> burdened with the <hi>uncleanness</hi> and filthiness wherewith sin hath defiled and polluted it. Conviction discovers the universal pollution of heart and life, so that a man loaths and abhorrs himself by reason thereof: If he do not look into his own corruptions, he cannot be <hi>safe:</hi> and if he do, he cannot bear the sight of it; he hath no <hi>quiet:</hi> Nothing can give rest, but what gives <hi>relief</hi> against this evil. And this only is done by faith uniting the soul with Jesus Christ. For though it be true, that the pollution of sin be not presently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly taken away by coming to Christ; yet the burden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is exceedingly eased: for upon our believing, there is an heart-purifying principle planted into the soul, which doth by degrees cleanse that fountain of corruption, and will at last perfectly free the soul from it, Acts 15. 9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith:</hi> and being once in Christ, he is concerned for the soul, as a member now of his own mystical body to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and cleanse it, that at last he may present it perfect to the Father without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. The reigning power of it is gone immediately upon believing, and the very existence and being of it shall at last be destroyed. O what rest must this give under those troubles for sin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:54344:125"/>
Thirdly, It was an intolerable burthen to the soul to be under the continual fears, aiarms and frights of death and <note place="margin">3.</note> damnation. Its life hath been a life of bondage upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ever since the Lord opened his eyes to see his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Poor souls lye down with tremblings for fear what a night may bring forth. 'Tis a sad life indeed to live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual bondage to such fears. But faith sweetly relieves the trembling Conscience, by removing the <hi>guilt</hi> which breeds it; fears. The sting of death is sin; when guilt is removed, fears vanish. Smite Lord, smite, said <hi>Luther,</hi> for my sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Now if sickness come, 'tis another thing than it was <note place="margin">Feri Domine, feri, nam à pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis meis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutus sum, <hi>Luth.</hi>
                     </note> wont to be, Isai. 33. 21. <hi>The Inhabitant shall not say I am sick, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquities:</hi> a man scarce feels his sickness in comparison to what he did, whilst he was without Christ, and hope of pardon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A convinced sinner out of Christ sees every thing <note place="margin">4.</note> against him: nothing yields any comfort, yea every thing increases and aggravates his burthen, whether he look to things past, present, or to come. If he reflect upon <hi>things past,</hi> his soul is filled with anguish to remember the sins committed, and the seasons neglected; and the precious mercies that have been abused: if he look upon <hi>things present,</hi> the case is doleful and miserable: nothing but trouble and danger; Christless, and comfortless: and if he look forward to <hi>things to come,</hi> that gives him a deeper cut to the heart than any thing else; for though it be sad and miserable for the present, yet he fears it will be much worse hereafter; all these are but the beginning of sorrows: and thus the poor awakened sinner becomes a <hi>Magor missabib;</hi> fear round about.</p>
                  <p>But upon his coming to Christ all things are marvellously al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: a quite contrary face of things appears to him: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing gives him hope and comfort which way soever he looks: so speaks the Apostle, 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. <hi>All things are yours</hi> (saith he) <hi>whether life, or death; or things present, or things to come, all is yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods:</hi> they are ours <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for our advantage, benefit and comfort; more particularly upon our coming to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Things past are ours,</hi> they conduce to our advantage and comfort. Now the soul can begin to read the gracious end and design of God, in all its preservations and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54344:126"/>
whereby it hath been reserved for such a day as this. O! it melts his heart to consider, his Companions in sin and Vanity are cut off, and he spared; and that for a day of such mercy as the day of his espousals with Christ is. Now all his past sorrows and deep troubles of spirit which God hath exercised him with, begin to appear the greatest mercies that ever he received; being all necessary, and introductive to this blessed union with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Things present</hi> are ours, though it be not yet with us as we would have it; Christ is not <hi>sure</hi> enough, the heart is not <hi>pure</hi> enough; sin is too strong, and grace is too weak; many things are yet out of order; yet can the soul bless God for this with tears of joy, and praise him for this brimful of admiration, and holy astonishment; that it is, as it is; that he is where he is, though he be not yet where he would be. O 'tis a blessed life to live as a poor <hi>recumbent,</hi> by acts of trust and affiance, though as yet it have but little evidence: that it is resolved to trust all with Christ, though it be not yet certain of the issue. O this is a comfortable station, a sweet condition to what it was, either when it <hi>wallowed</hi> in sin in the days before conviction, or was <hi>swallowed</hi> up in fears and troubles for sin after conviction: now it hath hope though it want assurance; and hope is sweet to a soul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of such deep distresses: now it sees the remedy, and is applying it, whereas before the wound seemed desperate: now all hesitations and debates are at an end in the Soul, 'tis no longer bivious and unresolved what to do; all things have been deeply considered, and after consideration, issued into this resolve or decree of the will. I will go to Christ; I will venture all upon his Command and Call; I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque my eternal interests in that Bottom: here I fix; and upon this ground I resolve to live and dye. O how much better is this, than that floating life it lived before, roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the billows of inward fears and troubles, not able to drop Anchor any where, nor knowing where to find an Harbour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Things to come are ours:</hi> and this is the best and sweetest of all: man is a prospecting creature, his eye is much upon things to come, and it will not satisfie him that it is well at present, except he have a prospect that it shall be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54344:126"/>
so hereafter: but now the soul hath committed it self and all its concernments to Christ for eternity, and this being done, it's greatly relieved against evils to come.</p>
                  <p>I cannot (saith the Believer) think all my troubles over, and that I shall never meet any more afflictions, it were a fond va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to dream of that; but I leave all these things where I have left my soul: he that hath supported me under inward, will carry me through outward troubles also. I cannot think all my <hi>temptations</hi> to sin past, O, I may yet meet with sore assaults from <hi>Satan:</hi> yet it is infinitely better to be watching, praying and striving against sin, than it was when I was obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the lusts of it. God that hath delivered me from the love of sin, will, I trust, preserve me from ruine by sin. I know also death is to come, I must feel the pangs and agonies of it; but yet the aspect of death is much more pleasant than it was. I come Lord Jesus to thee, who art the death of death, whose death hath disarmed death of its sting. I fear not its dart, if I feel not its sting. And thus you see briefly, how by faith Believers enter into rest. How Christ gives rest even at present to them that come to him, and all this but as a beginning of their everlasting rest.</p>

and ruine your souls. 'Tis true, they have a very specious and colourable appearance, they are guilded over with pretences of the Justice of God, the heinous nature of sin; the want of due and befitting qualifications for so holy and pure a God: the lapsing of the reason of mercy, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other of like nature: but I beseech you lay down this as a sure conclusion, and hold it fast; that whatever it be that discourages and hinders you from coming to Christ, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the interest of your souls, and the hand of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is certainly in it.</p>

O that you would be perswaded to it, how soon would you find what so long you have been seeking in vain! how long will you thus oppose your own good! how long will you keep your selves upon the rack of Conscience! is it easie to go under the throbs and wounds of an accusing and condemning Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?

               <hi>Christ as the Physician of Souls</hi> comes under our first Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Text before us.</p>
            <p>The occasion of these words of Christ, was the call of <hi>Matthew the Publican:</hi> who having first opened his <hi>Heart,</hi> next opened his <hi>House</hi> to Christ, and entertains him there: this strange and unexpected change wrought upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> quickly rings in all the Neighbourhood, and many <hi>Publicans</hi> and Sinners resorted thither; at which the stomachs of the proud <hi>Pharisees</hi> began to swell: from this occasion they took offence at Christ, and in this <hi>verse</hi> Christ takes off the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by such an answer as was fitted both for their <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and his own <hi>vindication.</hi> But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them; <hi>The whole have no need of a Physician, but they that be sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gives it (saith one) as a reason why he conversed so much with <hi>Publicans</hi> and Sinners, and so little among the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> because there was more work for him: men set up where they think Trade will be quickest: Christ came to be a <hi>Physician</hi> to sick souls. <hi>Pharisees</hi> were so well in their own conceit, that Christ saw he should have little to do among them; and so he applied himself to those who were more sensible of their sickness.</p>

               </p>
               <p>First, The guilt of sin, this is a mortal wound, a stab in <note place="margin">1.</note> the very heart of a poor sinner. 'Tis a fond and groundless distinction that <hi>Papists</hi> make of sins <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial:</hi> all sin in its own nature is mortal, Rom. 6. 23. <hi>The wages of sin is death:</hi> yet though it be so in its own nature, Christ can, and doth cure it by the Soveraign Balfom of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, Eph. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> This is the deepest and deadliest wound the soul of man feels in this world: what is <hi>guilt,</hi> but the obligation of the soul to everlasting punishment and misery? It puts the soul under the sentence of God to eternal wrath; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning sentence of the great and terrible God; than which, nothing is found more dreadful and insupportable: put all pains, all poverty, all afflictions, all miseries in one Scale, and Gods condemnation in the other, and you weigh but so many Feathers against a <hi>talent</hi> of Lead.</p>
               <p>This Disease our great <hi>Physician</hi> Christ cures by <hi>Remission,</hi> which is the dissolving of the obligation to punishment; the loosing of the soul that was bound over to the Wrath and Condemnation of God, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 17, 18, 19. this remission being made, the soul is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared from all its obligations to punishment, Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation:</hi> all Bonds are cancelled; the <hi>guilt</hi> of all sins is healed or removed; original, and actual; great, and small. This cure is performed upon souls <hi>by the blood of Christ:</hi> nothing is found in Heaven or earth besides his blood, that is able to heal this disease; Heb. 9. 22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding of blood there is no remission;</hi> nor is it any blood that will do it, but that only which dropt from the wounds of Christ, Isa. 53. 5. <hi>By his stripes we are healed:</hi> his blood only is innocent and precious blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. blood of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worth and value; the blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. blood
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54344:130"/>
prepared for this very purpose, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. this is the blood that performs the cure; and how great a cure is it! for this cure the souls of Believers shall be praising and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their great <hi>Physician</hi> in Heaven to all eternity, Rev. 1. 5, 6. <hi>To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The next <hi>evil</hi> in sin, cured by Christ, is the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> of it over the souls of poor sinners. Where sin is in dominion, the soul is in a very sad condition; for it darkens the <hi>Understanding,</hi> depraves the <hi>Conscience,</hi> stiffens the <hi>Will,</hi> hardens the <hi>Heart,</hi> misplaces and disorders all the <hi>Affections:</hi> and thus every faculty is wounded by the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sin over the soul. How difficult is the cure of this disease! it passes the skill of Angels or men to heal it: but Christ undertakes it, and makes a perfect cure of it at last; and this he doth by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> As he cures the guilt of sin by pouring out his <hi>blood</hi> for us, so he cures the dominion of sin, by pouring out his <hi>Spirit upon us.</hi> Justification is the cure of <hi>guilt,</hi> Sanctification the cure of the <hi>dominion</hi> of sin. For,</p>
               <p>First, As the Dominion of sin darkens the <hi>understanding,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. so the spirit of holiness which Christ sheds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, cures the darkness and blindness of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty, and restores it again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. they that were darkness are hereby light in the Lord: the anointing of this Spirit teacheth them all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the dominion of sin depraved and defiled the <hi>Conscience, Tit.</hi> 1. 15. wounded it to that degree, as to disable it to the performances of all its Offices and Functions; so that it was neither able to apply, convince, or tremble at the word: So when the Spirit of holiness is shed forth, O what a tender sense fills the renewed Conscience! for what small things will it check, smite and rebuke! how strongly will it bind to duty, and bar against sin!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the dominion of sin stiffned the <hi>Will,</hi> and made it stubborn and rebellious; so Christ by sanctifying it, brings it to be pliant and obedient to the will of God. <hi>Lord,</hi> saith the sinner, <hi>what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:54344:131"/>
Fourthly, As the power of sin hardneth the <hi>Heart,</hi> so that nothing could affect it, or make any impression upon it; when sanctification comes upon the soul, it thaws and breaks it, as hard as it was, and makes it dissolve in the breast of a sinner in godly sorrow, Ezec. 36. 26. <hi>I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</hi> It will now melt ingenuously under the threatnings of the word, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 19. or the strokes of the Rod, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. or the manifestations of grace and mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As the power of sin misplaced and disordered all the <hi>affections,</hi> so sanctification reduces them again, and sets them right, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. And thus you see how sanctification becomes the rectitude, health and due temper of the soul, so far as it prevails, curing the diseases that sin in its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion filled the soul with. True it is, this cure is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this life: there are still some grudgings of the old diseases in the holiest souls, notwithstanding sin be dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from its dominion over them: but the cure is begun, and daily advances towards perfection, and at last will be compleat, as will appear in the cure of the next evil of sin, namely,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Inherence</hi> of sin in the soul; this is a sore disease, the very core and root of all our other complaints <note place="margin">3.</note> and ayles. This made the holy <hi>Apostle</hi> bemoan himself, and waile so bitterly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. because of <hi>sin that dwelt in him:</hi> and the same misery is bewailed by all sanctified persons all the world over.</p>
               <p>'Tis a wonderful mercy to have the guilt and the dominion of sin cured; but we shall never be perfectly sound and well till the existence, or indwelling of sin in our natures be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too. When once that is done, then we shall feel no more pain, nor sorrows for sin: and this our great <hi>Physician</hi> will at last perform for us, and upon us: but as the cure of guilt was by our <hi>Justification,</hi> the cure of the dominion of sin by our <hi>Sanctification;</hi> so the third and last which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the whole cure, will be by our <hi>Glorification;</hi> and till then it is not to be expected. For it's a clear case, that sin like Ivy in the old Walls, will never be gotten out, till the Wall be pulled down, and then it's pulled up by the roots. This
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54344:131"/>
cure Christ will perform in a moment upon our dissolution. For 'tis plain,</p>
               <p>First, That none but perfected souls, freed from all sin, are admitted into Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis as plain, that no such personal perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and freedom is found in any man on this side death, and the grave, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 46. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 12. a truth sealed by the sad experience of all the Saints on earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If such freedom and perfection must be before we can be perfectly happy, and no such thing be done in this life; it remains that it must be done immediately upon their <hi>dissolution,</hi> and at the very time of their glorification: as sin came in at the time of the union of their souls and bodies in the womb, so it will go out at the time of their separation by death: then will Christ put the last hand to this glorious work, and perfect that cure which hath been so long under his hand in this world: and thenceforth sin shall have no power upon them; it shall never tempt them more, it shall never defile them more; it shall never grieve and sadden their hearts any more: henceforth it shall never cloud their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, darken their understandings, or give the least inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to their communion with God: when sin is gone, all these its mischievous effects are gone with it. So that I may speak it to the comfort of all gracious hearts, according to what the Lord told the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 8, 9. (to which I allude for illustration of this most comfortable truth) <hi>Ye shall not do after all the things that ye do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes, for ye are not as yet come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you.</hi> Whilst you are under Christs cure upon earth, but not perfectly healed; your understandings mistake, your thoughts wander, your affections are dead, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is daily interrupted: but it shall not be so in Heaven, where the cure is perfect: you shall not know, love, or delight in God as you do this day; for you are not as yet come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you: and so much as to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of sin, and Christs method of curing them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As sin is the disease of the Saints, so also is <hi>Sorrow.</hi> The best of Saints must pass through the vally of <note place="margin">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:54344:132"/>
                  <hi>Bacha</hi> to Heaven. How many tears fall from the Eyes of the Saints upon the account of outward, as well as inward troubles; even after their reconciliation with God? <hi>Through much tribulation we must enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22. It would be too great a digression in this place, to note but the more general heads, under which almost infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite particulars of troubles and afflictions are found. It shall suffice only to shew, that whatever distress or trouble any poor soul is in upon any account whatsoever; if that soul belong to Jesus Christ, he will take care of it <hi>for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and deliver it at last by a compleat cure.</p>
               <p>First, Christ cures troubles by <hi>sanctifying</hi> them to the souls of his that are under affliction, and makes their very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>medicinal</hi> and healing to them. Trouble is a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and hath a deadly sting; but Christ is a wise <hi>Physician,</hi> and extracts a Soveraign Oyl out of this <hi>Scorpion,</hi> that heals the wound it makes. By affliction our wise Physician purges our corruptions, and so prevents or cures greater troubles by les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser; inward sorrows, by outward ones, Isai. 27. 9. <hi>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ cures outward <hi>troubles</hi> by inward <hi>conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which are made to rise in the inner man as high as the waters of affliction do upon the outward man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. One drop of spiritual comfort is sufficient to sweeten a whole Ocean of outward trouble. It was an high expression of an <note place="margin">Nihil Corpus sent it in nerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, cum Anima sit in Coelo.</note> afflicted Father, whom God comforted just upon the death of his dear and only Son, with some clearer manifestations of his love than was usual. <hi>O,</hi> said he, <hi>might I but have such consolations as these, I could be willing (were it possible) to lay an only Son into the grave every day I have to live in this world.</hi> Thus all the troubles of the world are cured by Christ, John 16. 33. <hi>In the world ye shall have trouble, but in me ye shall have peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ cures all outward sorrows and troubles in his people <hi>by death,</hi> which is their removal from the place of sorrows to peace and rest for evermore. Now God wipes all tears from their eyes, and the days of their mourning are at an end: they then put off the Garments and Spirit of mourning, and enter into peace, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 2. they come to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54344:132"/>
that place and state, where tears and sighs are things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Inhabitants: one step beyond the state of this mortality, brings us quite out of the sight and hearing of all troubles and lamentations. These are the diseases of souls, <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>sorrow;</hi> and thus they are cured by Christ the <hi>Physician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Next, I shall shew you that Jesus Christ is the only <hi>Physician</hi> of souls: none like him for a sick sinner: and this will be evident in divers respects.</p>
               <p>First, None so <hi>wise</hi> and judicious as Jesus Christ to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <note place="margin">2.</note> and comprehend the nature, depth, and danger of soul diseases. O how ignorant and unacquainted are men with the state and case of afflicted souls! but <hi>Christ hath the tongue of the Learned, that he should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary,</hi> Isai. 50. 4. He only understands the weight of sin, and depth of inward troubles for sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, None so able to cure and heal the wounds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted souls as Christ is: he only hath those medicines that can cure a sick soul. The blood of Christ, and nothing else in Heaven or Earth, is able to cure the mortal wounds which guilt inflicts upon a trembling Conscience: let men try all other receipts, and costly experience shall convince them of their insufficiency. Conscience may be benummed by stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive medicines, prepared by the Devil for that end, but pacified it can never be, but by the blood of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 16. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, None so <hi>tender hearted,</hi> and sympathizing with sick souls, as Jesus Christ: he is full of bowels and tender compassions to afflicted souls: he is one that can have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because he hath had experience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. If I must come into the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> hand with broken bones, give me such a one to choose, whose own bones have been broken, who hath felt the anguish in himself. Christ knows what it is by experience, having felt the anguish of inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the weight of Gods wrath, and the terrors of a forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, more than any, or all the sons of men: this makes him tender over distressed souls, Isai. 42. 3. <hi>A brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reed he will not break, and smoaking flax he shall not quench.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, None cures in so <hi>wonderful</hi> a <hi>method</hi> as Christ doth: he heals us by his stripes, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 5. The Physician
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54344:133"/>
dyes that the Patient may live: his wounds must bleed, that ours may be cured: he feels the smart and pain, that we might have the ease and comfort. No Physician but Christ will cure others at this rate.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, None so <hi>ready</hi> to relieve a sick soul as Christ: he is within the call of a distressed soul at all times. Art thou sick for sin, weary of sin, and made truly willing to part with sin? Lift up but thy sincere cry to the Lord Jesus for help, and he will quickly be with thee: when the Prodigal, the embleme of a convinced humbled sinner, said in himself, I will return to my Father, the Father ran to meet him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20. he can be with thee in a moment.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, none so <hi>willing</hi> to receive and undertake all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed and afflicted souls as Jesus Christ is: he refuses none that come to him, Joh. 6. 37. <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wayes cast out:</hi> whatever their sins have been, or their sorrows are; however they have wounded their own souls with the deepest gashes of guilt; how desperate and helpless soever their case appears in their own or others Eyes: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver puts them off, or discourages them, if they be but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, None so <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>successful</hi> as Christ: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails of performing a perfect cure upon those he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes: never was it known that any soul miscarried in his hands, <hi>John</hi> 3. 15, 16. other <hi>Physicians</hi> by mistakes, by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or carelesness, fill Church-yards, and cast away the lives of men: but Christ suffers none to perish that commit themselves to him.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, none so <hi>free</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> as Christ, he doth all gratis: he sells not his medicines, though they be of infinite value, but freely gives them, Isai. 55. 1. <hi>He that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney let him come;</hi> if any be sent away, 'tis the rich, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 53. not the poor and needy: those that will not accept their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy as a free gift, but will needs purchase it at a price.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, and Lastly, <hi>None rejoyces in the recovery</hi> of souls more than Christ doth. O it is unspeakably delightful to him to see the efficacy of his blood upon our souls, Isai. 53. 11. <hi>He shall see the travail of his soul (i. e.</hi> the success of his death and sufferings) <hi>and shall be satisfied:</hi> when he foresaw the success of the Gospel upon the world, it's said <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 21.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54344:133"/>
                  <hi>In that hour Jesus rejoyced in spirit:</hi> and thus you see, there is no Physician like Christ for sick souls.</p>

Though there be such a disease as is incurable, yet take this for thy comfort, never any soul was sick <hi>( i. e.)</hi> sensibly burthened with it, and willing to come to Jesus Christ for healing: for under that sin, the will is so wounded that they have no desire to Christ. O inestimable mercy, that the sickest sinner is capable of a perfect cure! There be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and ten thousands now in Heaven and earth, who said once, never was any case like theirs; so dangerous, so hopeless.

This blood of Christ must be freshly applied to every new wound sin makes upon our souls, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. every new sin wounds him afresh, opens the wounds of Christ anew. O think of this again, and again, you that so easily yield to the solicitations of Satan: is it so cheap and easie to sin, as you seem to make it? Doth the cure of souls cost nothing? True, it is free to us, but was it so to Christ? No, no, it was not; he knows the price of it, though you do not: hath Christ healed you by his stripes, and can you put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fresh sufferings for you so easily? Have you forgot also your own sick days and nights for sin, that you are careless in resisting, and preventing it? Sure 'tis not easie for Saints to wound Christ and their own souls, at one stroke: if you renew your sins, you must also renew your sorrows and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Title.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. you must feel the throes and pains of a troubled Spirit again, things with which the Saints are not unacquainted: of which they may say as the Church, <hi>Remembring my affliction, the Wormwood and the Gall, my soul hath them still in remembrance,</hi> Lam. 3. 19. Yea, and if you will yet be remiss in your watch, and so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily incur new guilt; though a pardon in the blood of Christ may heal your souls, yet some Rod or other in the hand of a displeased Father shall afflict your bodies, or smite you in your outward Comforts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 32.</p>

                     <hi>yet been a Physician?</hi> They are mortally wounded by sin, and are like to dye of their sickness; no saving healing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications having hitherto been made unto their souls: and this is the case of the greatest part of mankind; yea, of them that live under the discoveries of Christ in the Gospel: which appears by these sad symptoms.</p>
                  <p>First, In that their eyes have not yet been opened to see their sin and misery, in which illumination the cure of souls begins, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. to this day he hath not given them Eyes to see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 4. but that terrible stroke of God, which blinds and hardens them, is too visibly upon them, mentioned in <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. 9, 10. no hope of healing till the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Eyes be opened to see his sin, and misery.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that nothing will divorce and separate them from their lusts: a sure sign they are not under Christs cure, nor were ever made sick of sin. O if ever Christ be a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician to thy soul, he will make thee <hi>loath</hi> what now thou <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi> and say to thy most pleasant and profitable lusts, <hi>get ye hence,</hi> Isai. 30. 22. till then there is no ground to think that Christ is a Physician to you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that they have no sensible and pressing need of Christ, nor make any earnest enquiry after him, as most certainly you would do, if you were in the way of healing and recovery. These and many other sad <hi>symptoms</hi> do too plainly discover the disease of sin to be in its full strength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your souls; and if it so continue, how dreadful will the issue be?

                  <p>In the last place, this point yields us matter of advice and direction to poor souls that are under the disease of sin, <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and they are of two sorts, which I will distinctly speak to, <hi>viz.</hi> First, Such as are under their first sickness, or spiritual sorrow for sin, and know not what course to take: or, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, such as have been longer in the hands of Christ the Physician, but are troubled to see the cure advance so slowly upon them, and fear the issue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:54344:135"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> As to those that are in their first troubles for sin, <note place="margin">1.</note> and know not what course to take for ease and safety; I would address to them these following Counsels.</p>
                  <p>First, Shut your Ears against the dangerous counsels of carnal persons or relations; for as they themselves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with these troubles: so also are they with all proper memedies; and it is very usual with the Devil to convey his temptations to distressed souls by such hands; because by them he can do it with least suspicion. It was <hi>Augustins</hi> complaint, that his own Father took little care for his soul; and many Parents act in this case, as if they were imployed by Satan.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be not too eager to get out of trouble, but be content to take Gods way, and wait his time: no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is wise, would desire to have her travail hastned one day before the due time: nor will it be your interest to hasten too soon out of trouble. 'Tis true, times of trouble are apt to seem tedious; but a false peace will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger you more than a long trouble: a man may lengthen his own troubles to the loss of his own peace, and he may shorten them to the hazard of his own soul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Open your case to wise, judicious and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Christians, and especially the Ministers of Christ, whose office it is to counsel and direct you in these difficulties; and let not your troubles lye like a secret smothering fire, always in your own breasts. I know men are more ashamed to open their sins under convictions, than they were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them before conviction: but this is your interest, and the true way to your rest and peace. If there be with, or near you an Interpreter, one of a thousand, to shew you your righteousness, and remedy, as it lies in Christ; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not your own souls in a sinful concealment of your case: it will be the joy of their hearts to be imployed in such work as this is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be much with God in secret: open your hearts to him, and pour out your complaints into his Bosome. The 102. <hi>Psalm</hi> bears a title very suitable to your case and duty: yea, you will find if your troubles work kindly, and God intend a cure upon your souls, that nothing will be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54344:136"/>
able to keep God and your souls asunder: whatever your incumbrances in the world be, some time will be daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed to be so spent betwixt you and God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Plead hard with God in prayer for help and healing: <hi>Heal my soul</hi> (saith <hi>David) for I have sinned against thee,</hi> Psal. 41. 4. tell him, Christ hath his Commission sealed for such as you are: he was sent <hi>to bind up the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Isai. 61. 1. tell him he came into the world to seek and save that which was lost, and so are you now in your own account and apprehension. Lord, what profit is there in my bood? Wilt thou pursue a dried leaf? And why is my heart wounded with the sense of sin, and mine eyes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see my danger and misery, are not these the first dawnings of mercy upon sinners? O let it appear, that the time of mercy, even the set time is now come.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Understand your peace to be in Christ only, and faith to be the only way to Christ and rest: let the great enquiry of your souls be after Christ and faith, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the nature and necessity of these, and cry to God day and night for strength to carry you to Christ in the way of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to those that have been longer under the hands of Christ, and yet are in troubles still, and cannot <note place="margin">2.</note> attain peace, but their wounds bleed still, and all they hear in Sermons, or do in way of duty, will not bring them to rest: to such I only add two or three words for a close.</p>
                  <p>First, Consider whether you ever rightly closed with Christ since your first awakening, and whether there be not some way of sin in which you still live: if so, no wonder your wounds are kept open, and your souls are strangers to peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you be conscious of no such flaw in the foundation, consider how much of this trouble may arise from your constitution and natural temper, which being melancholy, will be doubtful and suspicious: you may find it so in other cases of less moment, and be sure Satan will not be wanting to improve it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Acquaint your selves more with the nature of true justifying faith; a mistake in that hath prolonged the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54344:136"/>
troubles of many: if you look for it in no other act but assurance, you may easily overlook it, as it lies in the mean time in your affiance or acceptance. A true and proper conception of saving faith would go far in the cure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubled souls.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be more careful to shun sin, than to get your selves clear of trouble. 'Tis sad to walk in darkness, but worse to lye under guilt. Say, Lord, I would rather be grieved my self, than be a grief to thy Spirit. O keep me from sin, how long soever thou keep me under sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Wait on God in the way of faith, and in a tender spirit towards sin, and thy wounds shall be healed at last by thy great Physician.</p>

            <p>First, You have here a mercy freely promised, <hi>viz.</hi> by God the Father from the beginning of the world, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <note place="margin">1.</note> and confirmed in several succeeding ages to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> in his Covenant transactions.</p>
            <p>This Mercy is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> of whom he speaks in this Prophecie: the same which he stiles <hi>an horn of salvation in the house of David,</hi> vers. 69.</p>
            <p>The mercy of God in Scripture is put either for,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His free favour to the Creature, or,</item>
               <item>2. The effects and fruits of that favour.</item>
            </list>
            <p>'Tis put for the free and undeserved favour of God to the creature, and this favour of God may respect the creature two wayes, either as <hi>undeserving,</hi> or as <hi>ill deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It respected innocent man as <hi>undeserving,</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> could put no obligation upon his Benefactor: it respecteth fallen man as <hi>ill deserving.</hi> Innocent man could not merit favour, and fallen man did merit wrath: the favour or mercy of God to both is every way free; and that is the first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word mercy: but then it is also taken for the effects and fruits of Gods favour; and they are,</p>
            <list>
               <label>Either,</label>
               <item>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Principal and primary, or,</item>
                     <item>2. Subordinate and Secundary.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Of Secundary and Subordinate Mercies, there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, both Temporal, respecting the body, and Spiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the soul: but the Principal and Primary Mercy is but one, and that is Christ, the first-born of mercy; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital mercy; the comprehensive-root-mercy, from whom
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54344:138"/>
are all other mercies; and therefore called by a singular <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi> in my Text <hi>The Mercy, (i. e.)</hi> the mercy of all mercies; without whom no drop of saving mercy can flow to any of the sons of men; and in whom are all the tender bowels of Divine mercy yearning upon poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>The Mercy,</hi> and <hi>the mercy promised.</hi> The first promise of Christ was made to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed afterwards to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> and as the Text speaks, unto the Fathers, in their respective genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find here also, <hi>the promised mercy faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed. To perform the mercy promised.</hi> What mercy <note place="margin">2.</note> soever the love of God engageth him to promise, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God stands engaged for the performance thereof. Christ the promised mercy, is not only performed truly, but he is also performed according to the promise in all the circumstances thereof exactly. So he was promised to the Fathers, and just so performed to us their Children: hence the Note is:</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That Jesus Christ the Mercy of mercies, was graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and faithfully performed by God to his people. <note place="margin">Doct.</note>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <l>Three things are here to be opened.</l>
               </q>
               <p>First, Why Christ is stiled <hi>the Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What kind of Mercy Christ is to his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How this promised Mercy was performed.</p>
               <p>First, Christ is the mercy, <hi>emphatically</hi> so called, the peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, invaluable, and matchless mercy; because he is the <note place="margin">1.</note> prime fruit of the mercy of God to Sinners. The mercies of God are infinite: mercy gave the world and us our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: all our protections, provisions and comforts in this world are the fruits of mercy: the after-births of Divine Favour: but Christ is the first-born from the womb of mercy: all other mercies compared with him, are but fruits from that root, and streams from that fountain of mercy: the very bowels of Divine mercy are in Christ, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 78. according to the tender mercies, or as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bowels of the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:54344:138"/>
Secondly, Christ is <hi>the mercy,</hi> because all the mercy of <note place="margin">2.</note> God to sinners is dispensed and conveyed through Christ to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. Christ is the <hi>medium</hi> of all Divine communications: the <hi>Channel</hi> of Grace; through him is both the <hi>decursus &amp; recursus gratiarum;</hi> the flows of mercy from God to us, and the returns of praise from us to God: fond and vain therefore are all the expectations of mercy out of Christ: no drop of saving mercy runs beside this Channel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ is <hi>the mercy,</hi> because all inferiour mercies derive both their <hi>nature, value, sweetness</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> from <note place="margin">3.</note> Christ, the fountain mercy of all other mercies.</p>
               <p>First, they derive their <hi>nature</hi> from Christ: for out of him those things which men call mercies, are rather traps and snares, than mercies to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32. The time will come when the <hi>rich</hi> that are Christless will wish, O that we had been poor! and <hi>Nobles</hi> that are not ennobled by the new birth, O that we had been among the lower rank of men! All these things that pass for valuable mercies, like <hi>Ciphers</hi> signifie much when such a speaking Figure as Christ stands before them, else they signifie nothing to any mans comfort or benefit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They derive their <hi>value</hi> as well as nature from Christ: for how little, I pray you, doth it signifie to any man to be rich, honourable, politick, and successfull in all his designs in the world; if after all, he must lye down in Hell?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All other mercies derive their <hi>sweetness</hi> from Christ, and are but insipid things without him. There is a twofold sweetness in things; one <hi>natural,</hi> another <hi>spiritual:</hi> those that are out of Christ can relish the first, Believers only relish both: they have the natural sweetness that is in the mercy it self, and a sweetness supernatural from Christ and the Covenant, the way in which they receive them. Hence it is that some men taste more spiritual sweetness in their <hi>daily bread,</hi> than others do in the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> one and the same mercy by this means becomes a feast to soul and body at once.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, All mercies have their <hi>duration</hi> and perpetuity from Christ: all Christless persons hold their mercies upon
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54344:139"/>
the greatest contingencies and terms of uncertainty: if they be continued during this life, that's all: there is not a drop of mercy after death; but the mercies of the Saints are continued to eternity: the end of their mercies on earth, is the beginning of their better mercies in Heaven. There is a twofold end of mercies, one <hi>perfective,</hi> another <hi>destructive:</hi> the death of the Saints perfects and compleats their mercies; the death of the wicked destroys and cuts off their mercies: for these reasons Christ is called <hi>the mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place let us enquire what manner of mercy Christ is; and we shall find many lovely, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent, <note place="margin">2.</note> properties to commend him to our souls.</p>
               <p>First, He is a <hi>free</hi> and undeserved mercy, called upon that account <hi>the gift of God,</hi> John 4. 10. And to shew how free this gift was, God gave him to us when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. needs must that mercy be free, which is given not only to the undeserving, but to the ill deserving: the benevolence of God was the sole impulsive cause of this gift, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ is a <hi>full</hi> mercy replenished with all that answers to the <hi>wishes</hi> or <hi>wants</hi> of sinners: in him alone is found whatever the justice of an angry God requires for satisfaction, or the necessities of souls require for their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Christ is full of mercy, both <hi>extensively</hi> and <hi>intensively;</hi> in him are all kinds and sorts of mercies, and in him are the highest and most perfect degrees of mercy; <hi>for it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell,</hi> Col. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ is the <hi>seasonable</hi> mercy, given by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to us in due time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. in the fulness of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. a seasonable mercy in his <hi>exhibition</hi> to the world in <hi>general,</hi> and a seasonable mercy in his <hi>application</hi> to the soul in <hi>particular:</hi> the wisdom of God pitched upon the best time for his incarnation, and it hits the very nick of time, for his application. When a poor soul is distressed, lost, at its wits end, ready to perish; then comes Christ: all Gods works are done in season, but none more seasonable than this great work of Salvation by Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christ is the <hi>necessary mercy:</hi> there is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity of Jesus Christ: hence in Scripture he is called the <hi>bread of life,</hi> Joh. 6. 48. he is bread to the hungry: he is
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54344:139"/>
the <hi>water of life,</hi> Joh. 7. 37. as cold water to the thirsty soul: he is a ransome for captives, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. a garment to the naked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> only bread is not so necessary to the hungry, nor water to the thirsty, nor a ransom to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, nor a garment to the naked; as Christ is to the soul of a sinner, the breath of our nostrills, the life of our souls is in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Christ is a <hi>fountain mercy,</hi> and all other mercies flow from him: a believer may say of Christ, <hi>all my fresh springs are in thee:</hi> from his merit, and from his Spirit flow our Redemption, Justification, Sanctification, Peace, Joy in the Holy Ghost, and blessedness in the world to come: <hi>In that day shall there be a fountain opened,</hi> Zech. 13. 1.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Christ is a <hi>satisfying mercy;</hi> he that is full of Christ can feel the want of nothing. <hi>I desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. Christ bounds and terminates the vast desires of the soul; he is the very Sabbath of the soul: how hungry, empty, straitned, and pinched in upon every side, is the soul of man in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and fulness of all outward things, till it come to Christ? The weary motions of a restless soul, like those of a River, cannot be at rest till they pour themselves into Christ, the Ocean of blessedness.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Christ is a <hi>peculiar mercy</hi> intended for, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a remnant among men: some would extend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as large as the world, but the Gospel limits it to those only that believe: and these Believers are upon that account called a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. The offers of Christ indeed are large, and general; but the application of Christ is but to few, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 1. the greater cause have they to whom Christ comes, to lye with their mouths in the dust, astonished and overwhelmed with the sense of so peculiar and distinguishiug mercy.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Jesus Christ is a <hi>suitable mercy,</hi> fitted in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to our needs and wants, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. wherein the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wisdom of God is illustriously displaied: <hi>ye are complete in him</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. Are we ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? He is <hi>reconciliation:</hi> are we sold to sin and Satan? He is <hi>redemption:</hi> are we condemned by Law? He is <hi>the Lord our righteousness:</hi> hath sin polluted us? He is a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:54344:140"/>
                  <hi>opened</hi> for sin and for uncleaness: are we lost by depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God? He is <hi>the way</hi> to the Father. Rest is not so suitable to the weary, nor bread to the hungry, as Christ is to the sensible sinner.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Christ is an <hi>astonishing and wonderful mercy:</hi> his name is called <hi>Wonderful, Isai.</hi> 9. 6. and as his name is, so is he; a wonderful Christ: his person is a wonder, 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh:</hi> his abasement wonderful, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. his love is a wonderful love: his redemption full of wonders: Angels desire to look into it: he is and will be admired by Angels and Saints to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Jesus Christ is <hi>an incomparable and matchless mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, so is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved among the Sons</hi> (saith the enamoured Spouse) <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. Draw the comparison how you will betwixt Christ and all other enjoyments, you will find none in Heaven or earth to match him: he is more than all <hi>externals,</hi> as the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> is more than that of a <hi>Candle:</hi> nay the worst of Christ is better than the best of the world: his reproaches are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the worlds pleasures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. he is more than all <hi>Spirituals,</hi> as the <hi>Fountain</hi> is more than the <hi>Streams:</hi> he is more than justification, as the <hi>cause</hi> is more than the <hi>effect:</hi> more than sanctification, as the <hi>person</hi> himself is more than his image or <hi>picture:</hi> he is more than all peace, all comfort, all joys, as the <hi>Tree</hi> is more than the <hi>Fruit.</hi> Nay draw the comparison betwixt Christ and things eternal, and you will find him better than they: for what is Heaven without Christ? Psal. 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> If Christ should say to the Saints, Take Heaven among you, but as for me, I will withdraw my self from you: the Saints would fall a weeping, even in Heaven it self, and say, Lord, Heaven will be no more Heaven to us, except thou be there; thou art the better half of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Christ is an <hi>unsearchable mercy:</hi> who can spell his wonderful name, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. who can tell over his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches,</hi> Eph. 3. 8. Hence it is that souls never tire in the study or love of Christ, because new wonders are eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rising out of him: he is a deep which no line of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted understanding, angelical or humane can fathom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:54344:140"/>
Twelfthly, and Lastly, Christ is an <hi>everlasting mercy; the same yesterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. All other enjoyments are perishable, time eaten things: time like a Moth will fret them out: but the riches of Christ are dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 18. the graces of Christ are durable graces, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. all the creatures are flowers that appear and fade in their month: but this Rose of <hi>Sharon,</hi> this Lilly of the Valley, never withers. Thus you see the mercy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, with his desirable properties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The last thing to be opened is the manner of <note place="margin">3.</note> Gods performing this mercy to his people: which the Lord did,
<list>
                     <item>1. Really and truly, as he had promised him.</item>
                     <item>2. Exactly agreeable to the promises and predictions of him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, Really and truly; as he had promised, so he made good the promise, Act. 2. 36. <hi>Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both Lord and Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manifestation of Christ in the flesh was no phantasm or delusion, but a most evident and palpable truth, 1 Joh. 1. 1. <hi>That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled.</hi> A truth so certain, that the assertors of it appealed to the very enemies of Christ for the certainty thereof, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22. yea, not only the sacred but prophane writers witness to it: not only the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> but even the Heathen writers of those times, both <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jewish,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius, Tacitus, Plinius</hi> the younger, and <hi>Josephus</hi> the Jewish <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary</hi> do all acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God did really and truly perform Christ the promised mercy, so he performed this promised mercy exactly agreeable to the promises, types, and predictions made of him to the Fathers, even to the most minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereof. This is a great truth for our faith to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in: let us therefore cast our eyes both upon the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>performances</hi> of God, with respect to Christ the mercy of mercies. See how he was represented to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54344:141"/>
long before his manifestation in the flesh: and what an one he appeared to be when he was really exhibited in the flesh.</p>
               <p>First, As to his person and qualifications, as it was <hi>foretold,</hi> so it was <hi>fulfilled.</hi> His original was said to be unsearchable and eternal, <hi>Mica.</hi> 5. 2. and so he affirmed himself to be, Rev. 1. 11. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last:</hi> Joh. 6. 31, 32. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am:</hi> his two natures united in one person was plainly foretold, Zech. 13. 7. <hi>the man my fellow;</hi> and such a one God performed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. His immaculate puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and holiness was foretold, Dan. 9. 24. <hi>to anoint the most Holy;</hi> some render it <hi>the great Saint:</hi> the Prince of Saints, and such an one he was indeed, when he lived in this world: Joh. 8. 46. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of sin?</hi> His Offices were foretold, the prophetical Office predicted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15. and fulfilled in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. his Priestly Office foretold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 4. fulfilled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. his Kingly Office foretold, <hi>Mica.</hi> 5. 2. and in him fulfilled, his very enemies being Judges, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 37.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to his birth, the time, place, and manner thereof was foretold to the Fathers, and exactly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a tittle.</p>
               <p>First, The time prefixed more generally in <hi>Jacobs Phophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Gen.</hi> 44. 10. when the Scepter should depart from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as indeed it did in <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Idumean:</hi> more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Daniel</hi> seventy weeks from the decree of <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 9. 24. answering exactly to the time of his birth: so cogent and full a proof, that <hi>Porphyry,</hi> the great enemy of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had no other evasion, but that this Prophecie was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after the event; which yet the Jews (as bitter enemies to Christ as himself) will by no means allow to be true: and Lastly, The time of his birth was exactly pointed at in <hi>Haggai</hi>'s Prophecie, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7, 9. compared with <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. he must come whilst the second Temple stood: at that time was a general expectation of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 19. and at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he came, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 38.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The place of his birth was foretold to be <hi>Bethlehem Ephrata, Mica.</hi> 5. 2. and so it was, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 5, 6. to be brought up in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Zech. 6. 12. <hi>Behold the man whose name is the branch,</hi> the word is <hi>Netzer,</hi> whence is the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54344:141"/>
word <hi>Nazarite:</hi> and there indeed was our Lord brought up, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Parent was to be a <hi>Virgin, Isai.</hi> 7. 14. pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually fufilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His Stock or Tribe was foretold to be <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49. 10. and it is evident (saith the Apostle) <hi>that our Lord sprang out of Judah,</hi> Heb. 7. 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His <hi>Harbinger</hi> or forerunner was foretold, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. fulfilled in <hi>John the Baptist, Luk.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The obscurity and meanness of his birth was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 2. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. to which the event answered, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Doctrine and Miracles were foretold, <hi>Isai.</hi> 61. 1, 2. and <hi>Isai.</hi> 35. 4, 5. the accomplishment whereof in Christ is evident in the History of all the <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, His death for us was foretold by the Prophets, Dan. 9. 26. <hi>The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself:</hi> Isai. 53. 5. <hi>He was wounded for our transgression:</hi> and so he was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 50. The very kind and manner of his death was prefigured in the brazen Serpent, his Type, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his death upon the Cross, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His burial in the <hi>Tomb</hi> of a rich man was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 9. and accomplished most exactly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 59, 60.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His resurrection from the dead was Typed out in <hi>Jona,</hi> and fulfilled in Christs abode three days and nights in the Grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 39.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The wonderful spreading of the Gospel in the world, even to the Isles of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was fore-prophesied, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49. 6.

                  <p>I know many poor sinners comfort themselves with this, when they come upon a bed of sickness, I am sinful, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54344:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God is merciful: and it is very true, God is merciful; plenteous in mercy; his mercy is great above the heavens; mercy pleaseth him: and all this they that are in Christ shall find experimentally to their comfort and salvation: but what is all this to thee, if thou beest Christless? There is not one drop of saving mercy that comes in any other Chanel than Christ to the soul of any man.</p>
                  <p>But must I then expect no mercy out of Christ? This is a hard case, very uncomfortable doctrine. Yes, thou maist be a Christless and Covenantless soul, and yet have variety of temporal mercies as <hi>Ishmael</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20, 21. God may give thee the fatness of the Earth, Riches, Honours, Pleasures, a numerous and prosperous Posterity; will that content thee? Yes, if I may have Heaven too: no, no, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven nor Pardon, nor any other Spiritual or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercy may be expected out of Christ, <hi>Jude vers.</hi> 21. O deceive not your selves in this point. There are two bars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and all Spiritual mercies, <hi>viz.</hi> the guilt of sin, and the filth of sin: and nothing but your own union with Christ can remove these, and so open the passage for Spiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to your souls.</p>
                  <p>Why, but I will repent of sin, strive to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, make restitutions for the wrongs I have done, cry to God for mercy, bind my soul with vows and strong resolutions against sin for time to come: will not all this lay a ground work for hope of mercy to my soul? No, no, this will not, this cannot do it.</p>
                  <p>First, All your <hi>sorrows,</hi> tears and mournings for sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain mercy: could you shed as many tears for any one sin that ever you committed, as all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> have shed upon any account whatsoever since the creation of the World; they will not purchase the pardon of that one sin: for the Law accepts no short payment, it requires plenary satisfaction, and will not discharge any soul without it: nor can it acknowledge or own your sorrows to be such: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a soul in Christ finds through him acceptance with God, but out of him it's nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All your <hi>strivings</hi> to obey the Commands of God, and live more strictly for time to come, will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, Mat. 5. 20. <hi>Except your righteousness shall exceed</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:54344:142"/>
                     <hi>the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Your <hi>restitution</hi> and reparation of wrongs you have done cannot obtain mercy: <hi>Judas</hi> restored, and yet was damned: man is repaired, but God is not: remission is the act of God; 'tis he must loose your Consciences from the bond of guilt, or they can never be loosed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, All your <hi>cryes</hi> to God for mercy will not prevail for mercy, if you be out of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 9. A righteous Judge will not reverse the just sentence of the Law, though the Prisoner at the Bar fall upon his knees, and cry, mercy, mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Your <hi>vows</hi> and engagements to God for time to come cannot obtain mercy: for they being made in your own strength, 'tis impossible you should keep them; and if you could, yet it is impossible they should obtain remission and mercy: should you never sin more for time to come, yet how shall God be satisfied for sins past? Justice must have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or you can never have remission, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. and no work wrought by man can satisfie Divine Justice, nor is the satisfaction of Christ made over to any for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, but to such only as are in him: therefore never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect mercy out of Christ.</p>

                  <p>God hath mercies of all sorts to give; but Christ is the chief, the prime mercy of all mercies: O be not satisfied without that mercy.

                     </note> he protested God should not put him off so: and <hi>David</hi> was of the same mind, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. If the Lord should give any of you the desires of your hearts in the good things of this life, let not that satisfie you whilst you are Christless. For,</p>
                  <p>First, What is there in these earthly enjoyments, whereof the vilest of men have not a greater fulness than you? <hi>Job</hi> 21. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 3, 12.</p>

                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:54344:143"/>
Secondly, What comfort can all these things give to a soul already condemned as thou art? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What sweetness can be in them, whilst they are all unsanctified things to you? Enjoyments and their sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are two distinct things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. Thousands of unsanctified enjoyments will not yield your souls one drop of solid spiritual comfort.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What pleasure can you take in these things out of which death must shortly strip you naked? You must die, you must dye; and whose then shall all those things be for which you have laboured?

O said he, what a preaching of Christ is here? Had Christ been thus preached to me in the day of my trouble for sin, what had become of me! But blessed be God there is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency both of merit and mercy in Jesus Christ for all sinners, for the vilest among sinners, whose hearts shall be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come unto him.

                  <p>But yet it cannot enter into my thoughts that I should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">Object.</note> mercy.</p>
                  <p>First, You measure God by your selves, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 19. If <note place="margin">Sol.</note> a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? Man will not, but the merciful God will upon the submission of his enemies to him.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Altogether lovely (i. e.)</hi> as there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely found in him, so all that is in him is wholly lovely: as <note place="margin">Quantus quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis studi is &amp; votis est expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendus, <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                  </note> every raye of Gold is precious, so every thing that is in Christ is precious: who can weigh Christ in a pair of ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and tell you what his worth is? His price is above Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and all that thou canst desire is not to be compared with him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Altogether lovely, (i. e.)</hi> he is comprehensive of all things that are lovely: he seals up the sum of all loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: <hi>quae faciunt divisa beatum, in hoc mixta fluunt;</hi> things that shine as single stars with a particular glory, all meet in Christ as a glorious constellation, Col. 1. 19. <hi>It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.</hi> Cast your eyes among all created beings, survey the Universe, observe strength in one, beauty in a second, faithfulness in a third, wisdom in a fourth; but you shall find none excelling in them all as Christ doth. Bread hath one quality, Water ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Rayment another, Physick another, but none hath all in it self as Christ hath: he is bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, a garment to the naked, healing to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54344:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and whatever a soul can desire is found in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Altogether lovely, (i. e.)</hi> nothing is lovely in <hi>opposition</hi> to him, or in separation from him; if he be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely, then whatsoever is opposite to, or separate from him, can have no loveliness in it: take away Christ, and where is the loveliness of any enjoyment? The best crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comfort out of Christ is but a broken Cistern, or a Vessel whose bottom is fallen out, it cannot hold one drop of true comfort, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. It is with the creature, the sweetest and loveliest creature, as with a beautiful image in the Glass; turn away the Face, and where is the Image? Riches, Honours, and comfortable Relations are sweet when the face of Christ smiles upon us through them, but without him what empty trifles are they all?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Altogether lovely, (i. e.)</hi> transcending all created excellencies in beauty and loveliness, so much it speaks: if you compare Christ and other things, be they never so love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, never so excellent and desireable; Christ carries away all loveliness from them, <hi>he is</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>before all things,</hi> Col. 1. 17. not only before all things in time, nature, and order; but before all things in dignity, glory and true excellency: in all things he must have the preeminence: for let us but compare Christs excellency with the creatures, in a few particulars, and how evidently will the transcendent loveliness of Jesus Christ appear! For,</p>
               <p>First, All other loveliness is <hi>derivative</hi> and secondary, but the loveliness of Christ is <hi>original</hi> and <hi>primary.</hi> Angels and men, the world and all the desirables in it, receive what excellency they have from him, they are streams from the fountain: but as the waters in the fountain it self are more <note place="margin">Dulcius ex ips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> fonte bibuntur aquae.</note> abundant, so more pure and pleasant than in the streams: and the farther any thing departs and is removed from its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original, the less excellency there is in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The loveliness and excellency of all other things is but <hi>relative</hi> and <hi>respective,</hi> consisting in its reference to Christ, and subserviency to his glory; but Christ is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered <hi>absolutely</hi> in himself: he is desireable for himself, other things are so for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:54344:147"/>
Thirdly, The beauty and loveliness of all other things is <hi>fading</hi> and perishing, but the loveliness of Christ is <hi>fresh</hi> to all eternity: the sweetness of the best of creatures is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding flower, if not before, yet certainly at death it must fade away, Job 4. 21. <hi>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?</hi> Yes, yes, whether natural excellencies of the body, or acquired endowments of the mind, lovely features, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualities, attracting excellencies: all these like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant flowers are withered, faded, and destroyed by death: but Christ is still the same, yesterday, to day and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The beauty and loveliness of creatures is <hi>ensna ring,</hi> and dangerous; a man may make an <hi>Idol</hi> of it, and dote beyond the bounds of moderation upon it: but there is no danger of excess in the love of Christ: the soul is then in the healthiest frame and temper, when it is most sick of love to Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The loveliness of every creature is of a <hi>cloying</hi> and glutting nature: our estimation of it abates, and links by our nearer approach to it, or longer enjoyment of it: creatures like Pictures are fairest at a due distance; but it is not so with Christ, the nearer the soul approacheth him, and the longer it lives in the enjoyment of him, still the more sweet and desireable he is.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Lastly, All other loveliness is <hi>unsatisfying,</hi> and straitning to the soul of man: there is not room enough in any one, or in all the creatures for the soul of man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and expatiate it self; but it still feels it self pinch't in, <note place="margin">Aestuat infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix angusto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite mundi.</note> and narrowed within those strait limits: and this comes to pass from the inadequateness and unsuitableness of the creature to the nobler and more excellent soul of man: which like a Ship in a narrow River hath not room to turn, and besides is ever and anon striking ground, and foundring in those shallows: but Jesus Christ is every way adequate to the vast desires of the soul: in him it hath Sea-room enough: there it may spread all its fails, no fear of touching the bottom. And thus you see what is the importance of this phrase, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Next I promised to shew you in what respects Jesus Christ is altogether lovely. And, <note place="margin">2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54344:147"/>
First, <hi>He is altogether lovely in his person;</hi> a deity dwelling in flesh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. The wonderful union and perfection of the divine and humane nature in Christ renders him an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of admiration and adoration to Angels and men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. God never presented to the world such a vision of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before: and then considering how the humane nature of our Lord Jesus Christ is replenished with all the graces of the Spirit, so as never any of all the Saints was filled; O how lovely doth this render him! Joh. 3. 34. <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him:</hi> this makes him fairer than the children of men, grace being poured into his lips, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 2. If a small measure of grace in the Saints makes them such sweet and desireable companions, what must the riches and fulness of the Spirit of grace, filling Jesus Christ without measure, make him in the eyes of believers? O what a glory and a luster must it stamp upon him!</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He is altogether lovely in his Offices:</hi> for let us but consider the suitableness, fulness, and comfortableness of them.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>suitableness</hi> of the Offices of Christ to the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wants of men, and we cannot but adore the infinite wisdom of God in his investiture with them: we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture blind and ignorant, at best but groping in the dim light of nature after God: <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. Jesus Christ is a light to lighten the Gentiles, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49. 6. When this great Prophet came into the world, then did the day-spring from on high visit us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 78. The state of nature is a state of aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enmity to God; Christ comes into the world an attoning sacrifice, making peace by the blood of his Cross, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. All the world, by nature, are in bondage and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to Satan, a lamentable thraldom: Christs comes with a kingly power to rescue sinners, as a prey, from the mouth of the terrible one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let the <hi>fulness</hi> of his Offices be also considered, by reason whereof he is able <hi>to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. The three Offices comprising in them all that our souls do need become an universal relief to all our wants; and therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unspeakably <hi>comfortable</hi> must the Offices of Christ be to the souls of sinners: if light be pleasant to our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54344:148"/>
eyes, how pleasant is that light of life springing from the Sun of righteousness! <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. If a pardon be sweet to a condemned malefactor, how sweet must the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus be to the trembling Conscience of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned-sinner? If a rescue from a cruel Tyrant be sweet to a poor Captive; how sweet must it be to the ears of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved sinners to hear the voice of liberty and deliverance proclaimed by Jesus Christ? Out of the several Offices of Christ, as out of so many fountains, all the promises of the new Covenant flow; as so many soul refreshing streams of peace and joy: all the promises of illumination, counsel and direction flow out of the <hi>Prophetical Office:</hi> all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of reconciliation, peace, pardon, and acceptation flow out of the <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> with the sweet streams of Joy and Spiritual comfort depending thereupon: all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of converting, increasing, defending, directing, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying grace, flow out of the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> of Christ: indeed all promises may be reduced to the three Offices: so that Jesus Christ must needs be <hi>altogether lovely in his Offices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Jesus Christ is <hi>altogether lovely in his relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, He is a lovely <hi>Redeemer, Isai.</hi> 61. 1. he came to open the Prison-dores to them that are bound. Needs must this Redeemer be a lovely one, if we consider <hi>the depth of misery</hi> from which he redeemed us, <hi>even from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. How lovely was <hi>Titus</hi> in the eyes of the poor enthralled <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom he delivered from their bondage! This endeared him to them unto that degree, that when their liberty was proclaimed, they even trode one another to death to see the <hi>Herauld</hi> that proclaimed it; and all the night following with instruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick danced about his Tent, crying with united voyces A <hi>Saviour,</hi> a <hi>Saviour.</hi> Or whether we consider the <hi>numbers redeemed,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of their redemption, Rev. 5. 9. <hi>And they sang a new Song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> He redeemed us not with Silver and Gold, but with his own precious Blood by way of <hi>price,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. with his out-stretched and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arm, by way of <hi>power, Col.</hi> 1. 13. he redeemed us freely,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54344:148"/>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. fully, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. seasonably, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and out of special and peculiar love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. In a word, he hath redeemed us for ever, never more to come into bondage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. Oh how lovely is Jesus Christ in the relation of a Redeemer to Gods elect!</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is a lovely <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to all that he espouses to himself: how doth the Church glory in him, in the words following my Text, <hi>This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O ye Daughters of Jerusalem; (q. d.)</hi> Heaven and earth cannot show such another: which needs no fuller proof than the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, That he espouseth to himself in mercy, and in loving kindness, such deformed, defiled, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy souls as we are; who have no beauty, no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to make us desirable in his eyes: all the springs of his love to us are in his own breast, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7. He choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us not because we were, but that he might make us lovely, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. He passed by us when we lay in our blood, and said unto us live, and that was the time of love, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 16. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He expects nothing with us, and yet bestows himself, and all he hath upon us: our poverty cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich him, but he made himself poor to enrich us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No Husband loves the Wife of his bosome at the rate Christ loved his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. He loved the Church, and gave himself for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, None bears with weaknesses, and provocations as Christ doth, the Church is stiled the <hi>Lambs Wife, Rev.</hi> 21. 9.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, No Husband is so immortal and everlasting a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as Christ is. Death separates all other relations, but the souls union with Christ is not dissolved in the Grave: yea, the day of a Believers death is his marriage-day, the day of his fullest enjoyment of Christ: no Husband can say to his Wife what Christ saith to the Believer, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, No Bridegroom advanceth his Bride to such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by Marriage as Christ doth: he relates them to God as their Father; and from that day the mighty and glorious
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54344:149"/>
Angels think it no dishonour to be their servants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They are brought in admiring the beauty and glory of the Spouse of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 9.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and Lastly, No marriage was ever consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with that triumphal solemnity, as the marriage of Christ and Believers shall be in Heaven, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 14, 15. <hi>She shall be brought to the King in rayment of needle work, the virgins, her companions, that follow her, shall be brought unto thee, with gladness and rejoycing shall they be brought, they shall enter into the Kings Palace.</hi> Among the Jews the marriage house was called <hi>Bethillula,</hi> the house of praise: there was joy upon all hands; but not like the joy that will be in Heaven, when Believers, the Spouse of Christ, shall be brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>God the Father</hi> will rejoyce to behold the blessed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment and consummation of that glorious design and project of his love. <hi>Jesus Christ the Bridegroom</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to see the travail of his soul, the blessed birth and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of all his bitter pangs and agonies, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit</hi> will rejoyce to see the complement and perfection of that sanctifying design which was committed to his hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. To see those souls whom he once found as rough stones, now to shine as the bright polished stones of the Spiritual Temple. <hi>Angels</hi> will rejoyce; great was the joy when the foundation of this design was laid in the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ: <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 13. Great therefore must their joy be when the top-stone is set up with shouting, crying, Grace, grace. The <hi>Saints</hi> themselves shall rejoyce unspeakably when they shall enter into the Kings Palace, and be for ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. Indeed there will be joy on all hands, except among the Devils, and damned; who shall gnash their teeth with envy at the everlasting advancement and glory of Believers. Thus Christ is altogether lovely, in the relation of a <hi>Bridegroom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ is altogether lovely in the <hi>relation of an Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> 'tis he that pleads the cause of Believers in Heaven: appears for them in the presence of God, to prevent all new breaches, and continue the state of friendship and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us. In this relation Christ is altogether lovely. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:54344:149"/>
First, He makes our cause his own, and acts for us in Heaven as for himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. He is touched with the tender sense of our troubles and dangers, and is not only one with us by way of <hi>representation,</hi> but also one with us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of sympathy and affection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ our <hi>Advocate</hi> follows our suit, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in Heaven, as his great and main design and business, therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. he is said to <hi>live for ever to make intercession for us:</hi> as if our concernments were so minded by him there, as to give up himself wholly to that work: as if all the glory and honour which is paid him in Heaven, would not satisfie him, or divert him one moment from our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He pleads the cause of Believers by his blood: it satisfies him not as other <hi>Advocates,</hi> to be at the expence of words and oratory, which is a cheaper way of pleading; but he pleads for us by the voice of his own blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. where we are said to be come <hi>to the blood of sprinkling, that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth better things than that of Abel:</hi> every wound he received for us on earth, is a mouth opened to plead with God on our behalf in Heaven, <hi>quot vulnera, tot ora:</hi> and hence it is that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. he is represented standing before God, <hi>as a Lamb that had been slain:</hi> as it were exhibiting and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Heaven those deadly wounds received on earth, from the justice of God upon our account: other Advocates spend their <hi>breath,</hi> Christ his <hi>blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He pleads the cause of Believers freely: other Advocates plead for reward, and exhaust the Purses while they plead the causes of their Clients.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In a word, he obtaineth for us all the mercies for which he pleads; no cause miscarries in his hand which he undertakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. O what a lovely Advocate is Christ for Believers!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christ is altogether lovely in the <hi>relation of a Friend,</hi> for in this relation he is pleased to own his people, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 4, 5. There are certain things in which one friend manifests his affection and friendship to another, but none like Christ. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:54344:150"/>
First, No Friend is so <hi>open-hearted</hi> to his friend as Christ is to his people: he reveals the very counsels and secrets of his heart to them, Joh. 15. 15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, No Friend in the world is so <hi>expensive and bountiful</hi> to his friend, as Jesus Christ is to Believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13. He parts with his very blood for them: <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> love (saith he) <hi>hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends:</hi> he hath exhausted the precious treasures of this invaluable blood to pay our debts. O what a lovely friend is Jesus Christ to Believers!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No Friend <hi>sympathises</hi> so tenderly with his Friend in affliction, as Jesus Christ doth with his friends: in all our afflictions he is afflicted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. He feels all our sorrows, wants and burthens as his own. Whence it is that the sufferings of Believers are called the sufferings of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, No Friend in the world takes that <hi>complacency</hi> in his Friend as Jesus Christ doth in Believers, Cant. 4. 9. <hi>Thou hast ravished my heart</hi> (saith he to the Spouse) <hi>thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck:</hi> the Hebrew here rendred <hi>ravished,</hi> signifies to puff up, or to make one proud; how is the Lord Jesus plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to glory in his people! how is he taken and delighted with those gracious ornaments which himself bestows upon them! no friend so lovely as Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, No Friend in the world loves his Friend with so <hi>ferverous, and strong affection,</hi> as Jesus Christ loves Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Rachel,</hi> and endured for her sake the parching heat of Summer, and cold of Winter: but Christ indured the storms of the wrath of God, the heat of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ignation for our sakes. <hi>David</hi> manifested his love to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> in wishing, <hi>O that I had died for thee!</hi> Christ manifested his love to us, not in wishes that he had died, but in death it self, in our stead, and for our sakes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, No Friend in the world is so <hi>constant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ble</hi> in friendship, as Christ is, Joh. 13. 1. <hi>Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:54344:150"/>

Oh how lovely is Christ in the relation of a friend! I might farther shew you the loveliness of Christ in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and in his <hi>providences,</hi> in his <hi>communion</hi> with us, and <hi>communications</hi> to us: but there is no end of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christs loveliness. I will rather choose to press Believers to their dutys towards this <hi>altogether lovely Christ,</hi> which I shall briefly dispatch in a few words.</p>

                  <p>First, Is Jesus Christ altogether lovely, then I beseech <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> you <hi>set your souls upon this lovely Jesus:</hi> methinks such an object as hath been here represented should compel love from the coldest breast, and hardest heart. Away with those empty nothings, away with this vain deceitful world which deserves not the thousandth part of the love you give it: let all stand aside, and give way to Christ. O did you but know his worth and excellency, what he is in himself, what he hath done for, and deserved from you; you would need no arguments of mine to perswade you to love him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Esteem nothing lovely, but as it is enjoyed in</hi>

                     <hi>Christ, or improved for Christ:</hi> affect nothing for it self, love nothing separate from Jesus Christ. In two things we all sin in the love of creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>excess</hi> of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, loving them above the rate, and value of creatures, and in the <hi>inordinacy</hi> of our affections, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in loving them out of their proper places.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let us all be humbled for the baseness of our hearts,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>that are so free of their affections to vanities, and trifles; and so hard to be perswaded to the love of Christ, who is altogether lovely.</hi> Oh how many pour out streams of love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light upon the vain and empty creature, whilst no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments can squeese out one drop of love from their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate

and unbelieving hearts to Jesus Christ! I have read of one <hi>Johannes Mollius,</hi> who was observed to go often alone, and weep bitterly; and being prest by a Friend to know the cause of his trouble; Oh, said he, it grieves me that I cannot bring this heart of mine to love Jesus Christ more fervently.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Represent Christ as he is to the world, by your</hi>

                     <hi>carriages towards him:</hi> Is he altogether lovely? Let all the world see and know that he is so, by your delights in him, and communion with him, zeal for him, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to part with any other lovely thing upon his account: proclaim his excellencies to the world, as the Spouse here did: convince them how much your Beloved is better than any other Beloved. Display his glorious excellencies in your heavenly Conversations: hold him forth to others, as he is in himself, altogether lovely. See that you <hi>walk worthy of him unto all well-pleasing,</hi> Col. 1. 10. <hi>Shew forth the praises of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. Let not that <hi>worthy name be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed through you,</hi> James 2. 7. He is glorious in himself, and will put glory upon you; take heed ye put not shame and dishonour upon him: he hath committed his honour to you, do not betray that trust.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Never be ashamed to own Christ:</hi> he is altogether <note place="margin">5.</note> lovely: he can never be a shame to you: 'twill be your great sin, to be ashamed of him. Some men glory in their <hi>shame,</hi> be not you ashamed of your <hi>glory:</hi> if you be ashamed of Christ now, he will be ashamed of you, when he shall appear in his own glory, and the glory of all his holy Angels. Be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of nothing but sin, and among other sins, be ashamed especially for this sin, that you have no more love for him who is <hi>altogether lovely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Be willing to leave every thing that is lovely upon</hi>

                     <hi>earth, that you may be with the altogether lovely Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven.</hi> Lift up your voices with the Spouse, Rev. 20. 20. <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</hi> 'Tis true, you must pass through the pangs of death into his bosom and enjoyment; but sure 'tis worth suffering much more than that, to be with this lovely Jesus. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the patient waiting for of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 5.</p>

                  <p>Eighthly, Let the loveliness of Christ draw all men to <note place="margin">8.</note> him. Is loveliness in the creature, embodied beauty, so attractive? And can the transcendent loveliness of Christ draw none? Oh the blindness of man! If you see no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Christ, why you should desire him, 'tis because the God of this world hath blinded your minds.</p>

               <q>—And the desire of all Nations, shall come.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe former Chapter is mainly spent in reproving the negligence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who being discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from time to time, had delayed the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Temple:</hi> and in the mean time imployed their care, and cost in building and adorning their own houses: but at last being perswaded to set about the work, they meet with this discouragement, that such was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the present time, that the second structure would no way answer the magnificence and splendor of the first. In <hi>Solomons</hi> days the Nation was wealthy, now drained, so that there would be no proportion betwixt the second and the first. To this grand discouragement, the Prophet applies this relief, that whatsoever should be wanting in external pomp and glory, should be more than recompensed by the presence of Jesus Christ in this <hi>second Temple.</hi> For <hi>Christ, the desire of all Nations</hi> (saith he) shall come into it. Which by the way may give us this useful note, That the presence of Jesus Christ gives a more real and excellent glory to the places of his worship, than any external beauty, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54344:152"/>
ornaments whatsoever can bestow upon them. Our eyes like the <hi>Disciples</hi> are apt to be dazled with the goodly stones of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in the mean time to neglect, and overlook that which gives it its greatest honour and beauty.</p>
            <p>But to return, In these words we have both the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and an <hi>index</hi> pointing at the time of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; he is called <hi>the desire</hi> of all Nations: and the time of his coming in the flesh, 'tis plainly intimated to be while the second <hi>Temple</hi> should be standing: where by the way, we find just cause to admire and bemoan the blindness that is hapned to the <hi>Jews;</hi> who owning the truth of this Prophecie, and not able to deny the destruction of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, many hundred years past, will not yet be brought to acknowledge the incarnation of the true Messiah, notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>But to the point, the character or description of Christ, stiled <hi>the desire of all nations,</hi> who was to come into the world in the time of the second <hi>Temple, Mal.</hi> 3. 12. and that after grievous concussions and shakings of the world, which were to make way for his coming, for so our Prophet here speaks, <hi>I will shake all nations, and the desire of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall come,</hi> to which the <hi>Apostle</hi> alludes in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26. applying this prophecie to Jesus Christ, here called the <hi>desire of all Nations:</hi> putting the <hi>act</hi> for the <hi>object,</hi> desire for the thing desired; as in Ezec. 24. 16. <hi>the desire of thine eyes,</hi> that is the desirable Wife of thy bosome. So here the <hi>desire of all nations,</hi> that is <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of the desires of Gods elect in all nations of the world. A Saviour infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable in himself, and actually desired by all the people of God, dispersed among all kindreds, tongues and nations in the world.</p>

                  <p>That the desires of Gods Elect in all Kingdoms, and among <note place="margin">Doct.</note> all people of the earth, are and shall be drawn out after, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:54344:153"/>
The merciful God beholding the universal ruines of the world by sin, hath provided an universal remedy for his own Elect, in every part of the earth. Christ is not impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to any one Kingdom or Nation in the world; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Gods salvation to the ends of the earth, and accordingly speaks the Apostle, Col. 2. 11. <hi>There is neither Greek</hi> nor <hi>Jew, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond nor Free; but Christ is all, and in all.</hi> In the explication of this point, two things must be enquired into.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why Christ is called the desire of all Nations.</item>
                  <item>2. Upon what account the people of God in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons desire him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, Why he is called the desire of all Nations: and <note place="margin">1.</note> what that Phrase may import: and there are diverse things that are supposed or included in it.</p>
               <p>First, That God the Father hath appointed him as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remedy, for the sins and miseries of his people in all parts and quarters of the world. So in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption betwixt the Father and the Son, the Lord expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself, Isai. 49. 6. and he said, <hi>It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant, to raise up the Tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maist be my salvation to the end of the earth.</hi> Suitable whereunto is that Prophecie, Isai. 52. 15. <hi>He shall sprinkle many Nations.</hi> If God had not appointed him for, he could not be desired by all Nations.</p>
               <p>And indeed herein the grace of God doth admirably shine forth in the freeness of it, that even the most barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not excluded from the benefit of redemption by Christ. This is that the <hi>Apostle</hi> admires, that Christ should be <hi>preached to the Gentiles,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. A people that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be lost in the darkness of Idolatry; yet even for them Christ was given by the Father. <hi>Ask of me</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost parts of the earth for thy possession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ <hi>the desire of all Nations,</hi> plainly notes the <hi>sufficiency</hi> that is in him to supply the wants of the whole world: as the Sun in the Heavens suffices all Nations for light and influence, so doth the Sun of Righteousness suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Redemption, Justification, Sanctification and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54344:153"/>
salvation of the people of God, all the world over, Isa. 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It implies the <hi>reality that is in godliness:</hi> it shews you that Religion is no fancy, as the Atheistical world would perswade us: and this evidently appears in the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form effects</hi> of it upon the hearts of all men in all nations of the world, that are truely religious: all their desires, like so many Needles touched by one and the same Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, move towards Jesus Christ, and all meet together in one and the same blessed object Christ. Were it possible for the people of God to come out of all Nations, Kindreds and Languages in the world, into one place, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and compare the desires and workings of their hearts; though they never saw each others face, nor heard of each others name; yet as face answers to face in a glass, so would their desires after Christ answer to each other: all hearts work after him in the same manner, what one saith, all say; these are my troubles and burthens, these my wants and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series: the same things my desires and fears: one and the same Spirit harmonically works in all Believers through the world, which could never be, if Religion were but a fancie as some call it, or a combination or confederacy as others call it: fancies are as various as faces; and confederacies presuppose mutual acquaintance, and conference.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christ the desire of all Nations implies the vast extent his Kingdom hath and shall have in the world: out of every Nation under Heaven some shall be brought to Christ, and to Heaven by him. And though the number of Gods elect, compared with the multitudes of the ungodly in all Nations, is but a remnant, a little flock, and in that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative sense there are few that shall be saved; yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed absolutely, and in themselves, they are a vast number, which no man can number, Mat. 8. 11. <hi>Many shall come from the East, and from the West, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> In order whereunto the Gospel, like the Sun in the Heavens, circuits the world: it arose in the <hi>East,</hi> and takes its course towards the <hi>western world:</hi> rising by degrees upon the remote Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Nations of the earth; out of all which a number is to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54344:154"/>
be saved, even <hi>Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands to God,</hi> Pfal. 68. 31. And this consideration should move us to pray carnestly for the poor Heathens, who yet sit in darkness, and the shadow of death; there is yet hope for them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It holds forth this, that when God opens the eyes of men to see their sin, and danger by it; nothing but Christ can give them satisfaction: 'tis not the amenity, fertility, riches and pleasures the Inhabitants of any Kingdom of the world do enjoy, that can quench and satisfie the desires of their souls: when once God touches their hearts with the sense of sin and misery: Christ and none but Christ is desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and necessary in the eyes of such persons. Many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world abound with riches and pleasures, the providence of God hath carved liberal portions of the good things of this life to many of them, and scarce left any thing to their desires that the world can afford. Yet all this can give no satisfaction without Jesus Christ, the desire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one thing necessary, when once they come to see the necessity and excellency of him: then take the world who will, so they may have Christ the desire of their souls. Thus we see upon what grounds and reasons Christ is stiled the desire of all Nations.</p>
               <p>But there lies one great Objection against this truth, <note place="margin">Object.</note> which must be satisfied, <hi>viz.</hi> if Christ be the desire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how comes it to pass, that Jesus Christ finds no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in so many Nations of the world, among whom Christianity is hissed at, and Christians not tolerated to live among them; who see no beauty in him that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desire him.</p>
               <p>First, We must remember the Nations of the World have their times and seasons of conversion. Those that <note place="margin">Sol.</note> once embraced Christ, have now lost him, and Idols are now set up in the places where he once was sweetly worshipped. The Sun of the Gospel is gone down upon them, and now shines in another <hi>Hemisphere:</hi> and so the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World are to have their distinct days, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of illumination. The Gospel, like the Sea, gaineth in one place what it loseth in another: and in the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons appointed by the Father they come successively to be enlightned in the knowledge of Christ; and then shall that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54344:154"/>
promise be fulfilled, Isai. 49. 7. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of Rulers; Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it also be remembered, that although Christ be rejected by the Rulers and Body of many Nations; yet he is the desire of all the Elect of God dispersed, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among those Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire, upon what <note place="margin">2.</note> account Christ becomes the desire of all Nations, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of all those in all the Nations of the world that belong to the election of grace. And the true ground and reason thereof is, because Christ only hath that in himself which relieves their wants and answers to all their needs. As,</p>
               <p>First, They are all by nature under condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16, 18. under the curse of the Law; against which nothing is found in Heaven or earth able to relieve their Consciences but the blood of sprinkling, the pure and perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord Jesus: and hence it is that Christ becomes so desirable in the eyes of poor sinners all the world over. If any thing in nature could be found to pacifie and purge the Consciences of men from guilt and fear; Christ would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be desirable in their eyes; but finding no other remedy but the blood of Jesus, to him therefore shall all the ends of the earth look for righteousness and for peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All Nations of the world are polluted with the filth of sin, both in nature and practice, which they shall see, and bitterly bewail when the light of the Gospel shall shine amongst them; and the same light by which this shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, will also discover the only remedy of this evil to Ile in the spirit of Christ, the only fountain opened to all Nations for sanctification and cleansing: and this will make the Lord Jesus incomparably desirous in their eyes. Oh how welcome will he be that cometh unto them, not by blood only, but by water also! <hi>John</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the light of the Gospel shall shine upon the Nations, they shall then see, that by reason of the guilt and filth of sin, they are all barr'd out of Heaven. Those dores are chained up against them, and that none but Christ can open an entrance for them into that Kingdom of God:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54344:155"/>
that <hi>no man cometh to the Father but by him,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any name under Heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they must be saved, but the name of Christ,</hi> Act. 4. 12. Hence the hearts of sinners shall pant after him, as the Hart panteth for the water brooks. And thus we see upon what grounds Christ becomes the <hi>desire of all Nations.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all followeth in five several uses of the point, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>it then in any Nation, upon whom the light of the Gospel hath shined, to reject Jesus Christ,</hi> and say as those in Job 21. 14. <hi>Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> To thrust away his worship, government, and servants from amongst them, and in effect to say as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 14. we will not have this man to reign over us: thus did the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. they put away Christ from among them, and thereby judged themselves unworthy of eternal life.

Is he to you as the refuge City to the manslayer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18, 19. as a spring of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great Rock in a weary land, <hi>Isai.</hi> 32. 2. Such vehement desires are true desires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Are your desires after Christ universal? <hi>(i. e.)</hi> is every thing in Christ desirable in your eyes? the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> like the <hi>Harlot</hi> is for a divided Christ: they would be called by his name, but live upon their own stock, <hi>Isai.</hi> 4. 1. if his holiness, and government, his cross, and sufferings be desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his sake, such universal desires are right desires.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Are your desires after Christ industrious desires, using all the means of accomplishing what you desire? You say you desire Christ, but what will you do to obtain your desires? If you seek him carefully and incessantly in all the ways of duty, if you will strive in prayer, labour to believe, cut off right hands, and pluck out right eyes, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> be content to part with the most profitable and pleasant ways of sin, that you may enjoy Christ the desire of your souls, then are your desires right desires.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Are your desires after Christ permanent desires, or only a suddain mood and fit, which goes off again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54344:156"/>
effect? If your desires after Christ abide upon your hearts, if your longings be after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him at all times, though not in the same height and degree, then are your desires right desires? Christ always dwells in the desires of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they can feel him in their desires, when they cannot discern him in their loves or delights.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Will your desires after Christ admit no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor find rest any where but in the injoyment of Christ, then are your desires right desires: the soul that desires Christ can never be at rest till it come home to Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2, 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. The Devil can satisfie others with riches and pleasures of this world, as Children are quieted with Rattles. If nothing but Christ can rest and terminate your desires, surely such restless desires are right desires.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Do your desires after Christ spring from a deep sense of your need and want of Christ: hath conviction open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your eyes to see your misery, to feel your burthens, and to make you sensible that your remedy lies only in the Lord Jesus, then are your desires right desires: bread and water are made necessary and desirable by hunger and thirst. By these things try the truth of your desires after Christ.</p>

                  <p>Do you indeed upon serious trial find such desires after <note place="margin">Use 3.</note> Christ, as were described above, Oh bless the Lord for that day wherein Christ the desire of Nations became the desire of your souls, and for your comfort know that you are happy and blessed souls at present.</p>
                  <p>First, Blessed in this, that your eyes have been opened to see both the want and the worth of Christ. Had not Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his precious eye-salve to the eyes of your mind, you could never have desired him, you would have said with them in Isai. 53. 2, 3. <hi>He hath no form nor comliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him:</hi> or as they to the Spouse, Cant. 5. 9. <hi>What is thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved more than another Beloved?</hi> Oh blessed souls, inlightned of the Lord; to see those things that are hid from them that perish!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:54344:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, You are blessed in this, that your desires after Christ are a sure evidence that the desire of Christ is towards you: had he not first desired you, you could never have desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him. We may say of desires as it is said of love; we desire him because he first desired us: your desires after Christ are inflamed from the desires of Christ after you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Blessed in this, that your desires shall surely be satisfied, Mat. 5. 6. <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled:</hi> Prov. 10. 24. <hi>The desires of the righteous shall be granted.</hi> God never raised such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires as these in the souls of his people to be a torment to them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Blessed in this, that God hath guided your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to make the best choice that ever was made in the world: whilst the desires of others are hunting after riches, pleasure and honours in the world, toiling themselves like Children in pursuit of a painted Butterfly, which when they have caught, doth but daub their fingers: God mean while hath directed your desires to Christ, the most excellent object in Heaven or earth. Any good will satisfie some men, Oh happy soul if none but Christ can satisfie thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Blessed in this, that there is a work of grace cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wrought upon thy soul, and these very desires after Christ are a part thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Blessed in this, that these desires after Christ keep thy soul active and working after him continually in the ways of duty, Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I desired, that will I seek after.</hi> Desire will be a continual spring to diligence and industry in the ways of duty: the desire of the end quickens to the use of means, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 1. Others may fall asleep and cast off duty, but it will be hard for you to do so, whose souls burn with desire after Christ.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Blessed in this, that your desires after Christ will make death much the sweeter and easier to you, Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</hi> When a Christian was once asked, whether he were willing to dye? He returned this answer, let him be unwilling to dye, who is unwilling to go to Christ: and <note place="margin">Illius est nolle mori, qui nolit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum.</note> much like it was that of another, <hi>vivere renuo, ut Christo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> I refuse this life, to live with Christ.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:54344:157"/>
                  <head>4th Use for Exhortation.</head>
                  <p>In the fourth place, let me exhort and perswade all to <note place="margin">Use 4.</note> make Jesus Christ the desire and choice of their souls. And here I fall in with the main scope and design of the Gospel: and Oh that I could effectually press home this Exhortation upon your hearts. Let me offer some moving Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to you, and the Lord accompany them to your hearts.</p>
                  <p>First, Every Creature naturally desires its own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not you desire the preservation of your precious and immortal souls? If you do, then make Christ your desire and choice, without whom they can never be preserved, <hi>Jude vers.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, don't your souls earnestly desire the bodies they live in? how tender are they over them, how careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them? though they pay a dear rent for those Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they live in: and is not union with Christ infinitely more desirable than the union of soul and body? Oh covet union with him, then shall your souls be happy, when your bodies drop off from them at death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 3. yea, soul and body shall be happy in him, and with him for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How do the men of this world desire the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it? They pant after the dust of the earth: they rise early, sit up late, eat the bread of carefulness; and all this for very vanity. Shall a worldling do more for earth than you for Heaven? Shall the Creature be so earnestly desired, and Christ neglected?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What do all your desires in this world benefit you, if you go Christless? Suppose you had the desire of your hearts in these things, how long shall you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them if you miss Christ?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Doth Christ desire you, who have nothing lovely or desirable in you? And have you no desires after Christ, the most lovely, and desirable one in both worlds? His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are towards you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. O, make him the desire and choice of your souls.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, How absolutely necessary is Jesus Christ to your souls? Bread and water, breath and life is not so necessary
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54344:157"/>
as Christ is, <hi>One thing is necessary,</hi> Luk. 10. 42. and that one thing is Christ: if you miss your desires in other things, you may yet be happy; but if you miss Christ, you are undone for ever.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, How suitable a good is Christ to your souls? Comprizing whatsoever they want, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Set your hearts where you will, none will be found to match and suit them as Christ doth.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, How great are the benefits that will redound to you by Jesus Christ? In him you shall have a rich inheritance setled upon you: all things shall be yours when you are Christs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. and is not such a Christ worth desiring?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, All your well-grounded hopes of glory are built upon your union with Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. If you miss Christ, you must dye without hope; will not this draw your desires to him?</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Suppose you were at the Judgement Seat of God, where you must shortly stand; and saw the terrors of the Lord in that day; the <hi>Sheep</hi> divided from the <hi>Goats,</hi> the sentences of absolution and condemnation past by the great and awful Judge, upon the righteous and the wicked; would not Christ be then desirable in your eyes? As ever you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to stand with Comfort at that Bar, let Christ be the desire and choice of your souls now.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter the <hi>Apostle</hi> discourses to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the excellency of his Ministry, both to obviate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which some might cast upon it for want of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ornaments; and to give the greater authority unto it among all: and whereas the spiritual simplicity of his Ministry laid it under the contempt of some, he removes that several ways, by showing them,</p>
            <p>First, That it was not suitable to the design, and end of his ministry, his aim being to know nothing among them, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither was it for the advantage of their souls: it might indeed tickle their <hi>fancies,</hi> but could be no solid foundation to their faith and comfort, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, Therefore this excellent wisdom which he preached, far transcended all the natural wisdom of this world: yea, the most raised and improved understandings of those that were most renowned, and admired in that age for wisdom, vers. 8. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this world knew.</hi>

               <p>First, In the fulness of grace inherent in him: the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ is filled with grace, as the Sun with light, Joh. 1. 14. <hi>Full of grace and truth:</hi> never any creature was so filled by the Spirit of Grace, as the man Christ Jesus is filled, for <hi>God gives not the spirit to him by measure,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. By reason of this fulness of grace inherent in him, he is <hi>sairer than the Children of men,</hi> Psal. 45. 2. Excelling all the Saints in spiritual lustre, and gracious excellencies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Dignity and Authority put upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is crowned King in <hi>Sion:</hi> all power in Heaven and earth is given unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. he is Lawgiver to the Church, <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. All acts of worship are to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his name, Prayer, Preaching, Censures, Sacraments, all to be administred in his name.

The Judgement of the world in the great day will be administred by him, Mat. 25. 31. <hi>Then shall he sit upon the Throne of his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, Jesus Christ shall have glory and honour ascribed to him for evermore by Angels and Saints, upon the account of his Mediatorial work. This some Divines call his passive glory; the glory which he is to receive from his redeemed ones, Rev. 5. 8, 9, 10. <hi>And when he had taken</hi>

And thus you see, that our Lord Jesus Christ is upon all accounts the <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi> The Uses follow.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>So speaks the Apostle, Phil. 3. 3. <hi>For we are the circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi> Those that <hi>worship God in the Spirit</hi> are sincere Believers, to such sincere Believers Christ is consolation, <hi>our rejoycing is in Christ Jesus:</hi> and they have no consolation in any thing beside him, nothing in the world can give them comfort without Christ, <hi>we have no confidence in the flesh.</hi> The Gospel is glad tidings of great joy, but that which makes it to be so, is Jesus Christ whom it imports and reveals to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 11.

                  <item>1. What is meant by Consolation.</item>
                  <item>2. That Christ, and he only is Consolation to Believers.</item>
                  <item>3. That Believers only have Consolation in Christ.</item>
                  <item>4. How it comes to pass, that any Believer should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; since Christ is Consolation to all Believers.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first thing to be opened, is the nature of Consolation, <note place="margin">1.</note> which is nothing else but <hi>the cheariness of a mans spirit whereby he is upheld, and fortified against all evils felt, or feared.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation is to the soul, what health is to the body after wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sickness, or the reviving Spring to the earth, after a long and hard Winter: and there are three sorts of consolation, or comfort suitable to the disposition and temper of the mind, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Natural Comfort</hi> is the refreshment of our natural Spirits by the good Creatures of God, Acts. 14. 17. <hi>Filling their hearts with food and gladness. Sinful Comfort</hi> is the satisfaction
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54344:165"/>
and pleasure men take in the fulfilling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their lusts, by the abuse of the creatures of God, James 5. 5. <hi>Ye have lived in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure upon earth, (i. e.)</hi> your life hath been a life of sensuality and sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual Comfort</hi> is the refreshment, peace and joy gracious souls have in Christ, by the exercise of faith, hope, and other graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. and this only deserves the name of true so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Consolation: to which four things are required.</p>
               <p>First, That the matter thereof be some <hi>spiritual,</hi> eminent and durable good: else our consolation in it, will be but as the crackling of Thorns under a Pot; a sudden blaze, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinct with the failing matter: Christ only gives the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of solid, durable Consolation: The righteousness of Christ, the pardon of sin, the favour of God, the hopes of glory, are the substantial materials of a Believers Consolation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. Things are as their foundations be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Interest</hi> and propriety in these comfortable things, is requisite to our consolation by them, Luke 1. 47. <hi>My Spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> 'Tis no consolation to him that is hungry, to see a Feast; to him that is poor, to see a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; if the one may not taste, or the other partake thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and evidence of interest in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is requisite to actual consolation, though without it a man may be in the state of consolation: for that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not, is (in point of actual comfort) as if it were not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In order hereunto the work of the Spirit upon our hearts is requisite, both to give, and clear our interest in Christ, and the promises: and both these ways he is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is joy, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. And thus briefly of the nature of Consolation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next I will shew you that Christ, and he only <note place="margin">2.</note> is matter of Consolation to Believers: which will demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively appear by this Argument.</p>
               <p>He that brings to their souls all that is comfortable, and removes from their souls all that is uncomfortable, must <note place="margin">Argu.</note> needs be the only consolation of Believers.</p>
               <p>But Jesus Christ brings to their souls all that is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and removes from their souls all that is uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:54344:166"/>
Therefore Christ only is the Consolation of Believers.</p>
               <p>First, Jesus Christ brings whatsoever is comfortable to the souls of Believers. Is pardon comfortable to a person condemned? Nothing can be matter of greater comfort in this world. Why, this Christ brings to all Believers, Jer. 23. 6. <hi>And this is the name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our righteousness:</hi> this cannot but give strong consolation; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is the foundation of peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance for ever;</hi> Isai. 32. 17. Come to a dejected soul, labouring under the burthen of guilt, and say, Cheer up, I bring you good tidings; there is such an Estate befallen you, or such a troublesom bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness comfortably ended for you; alas! this will not reach the heart. If you can bring me (saith he) good news from Heaven, that my sins are forgiven, and God reconciled; how soon should I be comforted! And therefore (as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) this was the usual receipt with which Christ cured the souls of men and women, when he was here on earth; Son, or Daughter, <hi>be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee:</hi> and indeed it is as easie to separate light and warmth from the beams of the Sun, as cheeriness and comfort from the voice of pardon.</p>
               <p>Are the hopes and expectation of Heaven and glory comfortable? Yes sure, nothing is comfortable if this be not, Rom. 5. 2. <hi>We rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi> Now, Christ brings to the souls of men all the solid grounds and foundations upon which they build their expectations of glory, Col. 1. 27. <hi>Which is Christ, in you, the hope of glory.</hi> Name any thing else that is solid matter of comfort to the souls of men, and the grounds thereof will be found in Christ, and in none but Christ; as might easily be demonstrated by the enumeration of multitudes of particular instances, which I cannot now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Jesus Christ removes fom Believers, whatever is uncomfortable; therein relieving them against all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their affliction and sorrow. As namely,</p>
               <p>First, Is sin a burthen, and matter of trouble to Believers? Christ, and none but Christ removes that burthen, Rom. 7. 24, 25. <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> (saith sin burthened <hi>Paul)</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:54344:166"/>
                  <hi>who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> The satisfaction of his blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. The sanctification of his Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5, 6. His perfect deliverance of his people from the very being of sin at last, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26, 27. This relieves at present, and removes at last the matter and ground of all their troubles and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Do the temptations of Satan burthen Believers? O yes, by reason of temptations, they go in trouble, and heaviness of spirit. Temptation is an enemy under the walls, temptation greatly endangers, and therefore cannot but greatly afflict the souls of Believers; but Christ brings the only matter of relief against temptations. The intercession of Christ is a singular relief at present, Luke 22. 32. <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ are a full relief for the future: <hi>The God of peace shall shortly tread Satan under your feet,</hi> Rom. 16. 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Is spiritual <hi>desertion,</hi> and the hiding of Gods face, matter of affliction, and casting down to Believers? Yes, yes, it quails their hearts, nothing can comfort them; <hi>Thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> Psal. 30. 7. Outward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do but break the <hi>skin,</hi> this touches the <hi>quick:</hi> they like rain fall only upon the Tiles, this soaks into the House; but Christ brings to Believers substantial matter of Consolation against the troubles of desertion: he himself was deserted of God for a time, that they might not be deserted for ever: in him also the relieving promises are made to Believers, that notwithstanding God may desert them for a time, yet the union betwixt him and them shall never be dissolved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. Though he forsake them for a moment, in respect of evidenced favour, yet he will return again and comfort them, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54. 7. Though Satan tug hard, yet he shall never be able to pluck them out of his Fathers hand, <hi>John</hi> 10. 20. Oh what relief is this! What consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Christ to a deserted Believer!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Are outward afflictions matter of dejection, and trouble? Alas, who finds them not to be so? How do our hearts fail, and our spirits sink under the many smarting rods of God upon us! but our relief and consolation under them all, is in Christ Jesus: for the rod that afflicts us is in the hand
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54344:167"/>
of Christ that loveth us, Rev. 3. 19. <hi>Whom I love I rebuke and chasten:</hi> his design in affliction is our profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. That design of his for our good shall certainly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and after that no more afflictions for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3, 4. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. So that upon the whole, two things are most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>First, Nothing can comfort the soul without Christ: he is the soul that animates all Comforts, they would be but dead things without him. Temporal enjoyments, riches, honours, health, relations, yield not a drop of true Comfort without Christ. Spiritual enjoyments, Minister, ordinances, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are fountains sealed, and springs shut up till Christ open them, a man may go comfortless in the midst of them all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No troubles, sorrows, or afflictions can deject, or sink the soul that Christ comforteth, 2 Cor. 6. 10. <hi>As sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, yet always rejoycing.</hi> A Believer may walk with a heart brim full of comfort, amidst all the troubles of this world. Christ makes the darkness of trouble, to be light round about his people. So that the conclusion stands firm, and never to be shaken; that Christ, and Christ only is the Consolation of Believers: which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>In the Third place, I am to shew you, that Believers, and <note place="margin">3.</note> none but Believers can have consolation in Christ: which will convincingly appear from the consideration of those things which we laid down before, as the requisites to all true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Coonsolation. For,</p>
               <p>First, No unbeliever hath the <hi>materials</hi> out of which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comfort is made; which (as I there told you) must be some solid, spiritual and eternal good, as Christ and the Covenant are. What do unregenerate men rejoyce in, but trifles and meer vanities, in a thing of nought? <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 13. See how their mirth is described in Job 21. 12. <hi>They take their Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the sound of the Organ.</hi> He doth not say, they take the <hi>Bible,</hi> turn to the promises, and rejoyce in Christ and the Covenant; 'tis not the melody of a good Conscience, the joy of the Holy Ghost: no, no, they have no acquaintance with such musick as that: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of Believers is in those things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. And this is well-built consolation which reaches the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:54344:167"/>
Secondly, I told you that propriety, and interest in Christ, and the promises is required to all Spiritual Consolation: but no unbeliever hath any title or interest in Christ, and the promises, and so they can signifie nothing to him in point of Comfort. 'Tis not another mans mony, but my own, that must feed, cloath and comfort me; nor is it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Christ, but my own Christ, that must justifie, save and comfort my soul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You were told that evidence of a mans peace, and reconciliation with God, is necessary to his actual conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which no unbeliever can possibly have; he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace within him, to make him a qualified subject of any special promise; nor any witness, or seal of the spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and clear his propriety in Christ: for he never seals, but where he first sanctifies. So that it is beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that Believers, and none but Believers are partakers of the Consolations that are in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and Lastly, There is one inquiry remains to be satisfied, namely, seeing Jesus Christ is consolation to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, how it comes to pass that so many Believers in the world should walk so dejectedly as they do without any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Consolation.</p>
               <p>First, This may not be wondred at, if we consider that the Consolations of Christ are of two sorts. <hi>Seminal</hi> and in preparation, or <hi>actual</hi> in present possession. Every Believer in the world hath the root, and seed of comfort, planted and sown for him, Psal. 97. 11. <hi>Light is sown for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</hi> They have Christ and the promises which are the seeds of Consolation, and will bring forth joy at last, though at present they have no actual Consolation; the seed of all joy is sown, and in due time they shall reap the full ripe fruit thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It must be remembred that <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> are distinct blessings, every Believer hath interest in Christ, but every Believer hath not the evidence thereof, Isai. 50. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child of God is not of sufficient age to know his Father, or take comfort in that blessed inheritance whereunto he is begotten again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:54344:168"/>
Thirdly, Every Believer doth not walk with like strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and exact holiness, all do not exercise faith in a like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: among Christians some are strong in grace, rich in faith, strict in obedience, tender of sin to an eminent degree, these usually are owners of much Consolation: but others are weak in grace, poor in faith, comparatively careless of their hearts and ways; frequently grieving the good Spirit of God, and wounding their own Consciences (the vessel into which Spiritual Consolation is poured) and these are usually denied the joy and comfort which others abound withal.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Consolations of Christ are arbitrarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed by the Spirit who is the Comforter, and giveth to every man in such proportions and seasons as pleaseth him; whence it comes to pass, that he that is rich in comfort to day, may be poor to morrow, and contrarily the heart that is brimful of sorrow one hour, is filled with peace and joy in believing the next. Things that are necessary to <hi>the being</hi> of a Christian are fixed and stable, but things belonging only to the <hi>well-being</hi> of a Christian come and go according to the good pleasure and appointment of the Spirit. The use of all follows.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Inference 1.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence it follows, that the state of unbelievers is the most sad and uncomfortable state in the world: having no interest in Christ</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inference 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the Consolation of</hi> Israel. 'Tis true, they abound in Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts, they live in pleasure upon earth. Joy displaies its colours in their faces: but for all this there is not the least drop of true Consolation in any of their hearts: they have some comfort in the Creature, but none in Christ: that little they gather from the Creature now, is all their portion of joy, Luke 6. 24. <hi>Ye have received your consolation:</hi> as this is all they have, so they shall enjoy it but a little while, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 13, 17. and while they do injoy it, it's mixt with many gripes of Conscience, Job 14. 13. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness:</hi> whatever consolation any unbeliever speaks of besides this, is but by rote; for when the day of his distress cometh, and the terrors of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54344:168"/>
Conscience shall awake him out of his pleasant dreams, all his sensual joys will vanish from him, and the dores of true Consolation will be all shut against him. Let him go to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, knock at that dore, and say, Lord Jesus thy name is Consolation, my heart is ready to burst within me, hast thou no Consolation for me? O Lord for one drop of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comfort now, but alas there is none, no not in Christ himself for any unbeliever. 'Tis Childrens bread; the Saints priviledge; comfort and grace are undivided: let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into himself, search his own Conscience for comfort, and say, O Conscience, thou art more than a thousand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and thousands have been comforted by thee: where thou speakest comfort, none can speak trouble, hast thou no Consolation for me in my deepest distress? Alas, no, if God condemn thee, wherewithal shall I comfort thee? I can speak neither more nor less than the Scriptures put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mouth, and I find not one word in all the Book of God warranting me to be thy Comforter: believe it as an undoubted truth, (though the sense of the bewitched world over-rules it) that the state of unbelievers, even at the best, is a sad and dismal state.</p>

                     <hi>the Consolation of his people: we rejoice</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi> That's the true temper of a believing soul: Take heed you live not partly upon Christ, and partly upon the Creature for your Comfort; much rather beware that you forsake not Christ the fountain of living waters, and hew out Cisterns for your selves which can hold no water, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. If you make any Creature the spring and fountain of your comfort, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly God will dry up that spring: if your souls draw their Comfort from any Creature, you know they must out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live that Creature, and what then will you do for Comfort? Beside, as your Comforts are, so are you. The food of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature is suitable to its nature. You see divers Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures feeding upon several parts of the same herb; the Bee upon the flower, the Bird upon the seed, the Sheep upon the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54344:169"/>
stalk, and the Swine upon the root; according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so is their food: sensual men feed upon sensual things: spiritual men upon spiritual things; as your food is, so are you. If carnal comforts can content thy heart, sure thy heart must then be a very carnal heart: yea, and let Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves take heed, that they fetch not their Consolations out of themselves instead of Christ. Your graces and duties are excellent means and instruments, but not the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and foundation of your Comfort: they are useful buckets to draw, but not the well it self in which the springs of consolation rise. If you put your duties in the room of Christ, Christ will put your comforts out of the reach of your duties.</p>

If you would not be a discomfort to Christ, he would be a comfort to you every day, and in every condition to the end of your lives: your condition abounds with all the helps and advantages of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: you have the command of Christ to warrant your comforts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. You have the Spirit of Christ for a spring of comfort, you have the Scriptures of Christ for the rules of comfort: you have the duties of Religion for the means of comfort: why is it then that you go comfortless? If your afflictions be many in the world, yet your encouragements be more in Christ: your troubles in the world may be turned into joy, but your comforts in Christ can never be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into trouble.

               <bibl>EPHES. 1. 7. <note place="margin">Text. Enforcing the general exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive drawn from the first benefit purchased by Christ.</note>

               <q>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SIx great <hi>Motives</hi> have been presented already from the <hi>Titles</hi> of Christ, to draw the hearts of sinners to him: more are now to be offered from the <hi>benefits</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to Believers by Christ. Essaying by all means to win the hearts of men to Christ. To this end I shall in the first place open that glorious <hi>priviledge</hi> of <hi>Gospel remission;</hi> freely and fully conferred upon all that come to Christ by faith, <hi>in whom we have redemption by faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words we have first a singular benefit, or choice mercy bestowed, <hi>viz. Redemption;</hi> interpreted by way of <hi>apposition, the remission of sins:</hi> this is a priviledge of the first rank, a mercy by it self: none sweeter, none more desirable among all the benefits that come by Christ. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:54344:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, You have the price of this mercy, an account what it cost, even the <hi>blood of Christ;</hi> in whom we have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption [through his blood] Precious things are of great price, the blood of Christ is the <hi>meritorious cause</hi> of remission.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have here also the <hi>impulsive cause,</hi> moving God to grant pardons at this rate to sinners, and that is said to be the <hi>riches of his grace.</hi> Where by the way you see, that the <hi>freeness</hi> of the grace of God, and the <hi>fulness</hi> of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ meet together without the least jar in the remission of sin; contrary to the vain cavil of the <hi>Socinian</hi> adversaries, <hi>In whom we have redemption, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, You have the <hi>qualified subjects</hi> of this blessed priviledge, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, in whose name he here speaks <hi>[we] have remission, (i. e.)</hi> we the Saints, and faithful in Christ Jesus, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>we</hi> whom he hath chosen in Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world, and predestinated unto the adoption of Children, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>we</hi> that are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. 'tis <hi>we,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> only who have redemption through his blood.</p>
            <p>Hence observe,</p>

               <p>In the explication of this point, three things must be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state.</item>
                  <item>2. That their pardon is the purchase of the blood of Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. That the riches of Grace are manifested in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, That all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state: where I will first shew you what pardon or the remission of sin is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:54344:171"/>
Secondly, That this is the priviledge of none but Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>First, Now remission of sin is the gracious act of God, in and through Christ, discharging a believing sinner from all the guilt and punishment of his sin, both temporal and eternal.</p>
               <p>'Tis the act of God, he is the author of remission, none can forgive sins but God only, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 7. against him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>(i. e.)</hi> principally and essentially the offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. To his Judgement guilt binds over the soul, and who can remit the debt, but the <hi>Creditor, Mat.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>'Tis an act of God <hi>discharging</hi> the sinner: it is Gods loosing of one that stood bound, the cancelling of his bond, or obligation: called therefore remission, or releasing in the Text: the blotting out of our iniquities, or the removing our sins from us, as it's called in other Scriptures, see <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 11. <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>It is a gracious act of God, the effect of pure grace, done for his own name sake, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 25. discharging us without any satisfaction at all by us; there is much grace in that: and providing a surety for us every way able to pay our debt, there is more grace in that.</p>
               <p>'Tis the gracious act of God in and through Christ: the satisfaction of Christ is the procuring cause of our remission, and so God declares himself just in the remission of our sin, Rom. 3, 25. <hi>Gracious is the Lord and righteous, Psal.</hi> 116. 5. Justice and mercy meet here, and embrace each other: <hi>in whom</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>we have remission:</hi> no other price could purchase this priviledge, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6, 7. not rivers of Oyl, or humane Blood.</p>
               <p>And this gracious act of God discharges the pardoned soul both from guilt and punishment: guilt is nothing else but the force and power that is in sin, to oblige the sinner to undergo the penalty due to sin. Therefore sinners are said to be <hi>guilty of Hell-fire, Mat.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Guilty of eternal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mark</hi> 3. 29. to be under the judgement of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. Remission takes away both guilt and punishment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it takes away all guilt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. and all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And so much of the first thing to be opened, namely what the remission of sin is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:54344:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, Now that this remission of sin is the priviledge of Believers is most apparent, for all the causes of remission are in conjunction to procure it for them. The love of God which is the impulsive cause of pardon: the blood of Christ which is the meritorious cause of pardon; and saving faith which is the instrumental cause of pardon, do all cooperate for their remission, as is plain in the Text.</p>
               <p>Besides, all the promises of pardon are made to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. and Lastly, All the signs of pardon are sound in them, and in them only, that love God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. mercisulness to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14. a blessed calmness and peace in the Conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. So that it is a truth beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, that all that are in Christ are in a pardoned state.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next I will shew you, that the Pardon of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">2.</note> is the purchase of the blood of Christ: nothing but the blood of Christ is a price equivalent to the remission of sin, for this blood was innocent and untainted blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. the blood of a Lamb without spot. This blood was precious blood, blood of infinite worth and value, the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. it was prepared blood for this very purpose, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. prepared by Gods eternal appointment: prepared by Christs miraculous and extraordinary producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by the operation of the Spirit: prepared by his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary sequestration, or sanctification of himself to this very use and purpose.</p>
               <p>The blood of Jesus is not only innocent, precious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared blood, but it is also blood actually shed and sacrificed to the justice of God, for the expiation of guilt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of our discharge, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 5. To conclude, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere justice of God could put in no exception against the blood of Christ, 'tis unexceptionable blood, being (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was noted) untainted by sin, and dignified above all estimation by the person whose blood it was. Justice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no less, and could demand no more: and this is the price at which our pardons are purchased: and without which no sin could be pardoned, for <hi>without shedding of blood</hi> (such blood as this) <hi>there is no remission,</hi> Heb. 9. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The last thing to be opened is, <hi>That God hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>manifested the riches of his grace in the remission of our sins:</hi> so speaks the Apostle, Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where sin abounded grace did</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:54344:172"/>
                  <hi>much more abound:</hi> And 1 Tim. 1. 14. <hi>The grace of our Lord (viz.</hi> in the pardon of sin) <hi>was exceeding abundant.</hi> Which will appear (if we bring our thoughts close to the matter) in several particulars.</p>
               <p>First, From the <hi>nature</hi> of the mercy, which is the richest of all mercies, except Christ, the purchaser of it: no mercy sweeter than a pardon to a condemned sinner. No pardon like Gods pardon, to a man condemned at his Bar: all the goodness of God is made to pass before our eyes in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning acts of grace, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The very riches of grace must needs be in the pardon of sin, if we consider the <hi>method</hi> in which pardons are dispensed, which is (as the Text speaks) <hi>through his blood.</hi> Herein <hi>God commends his love to us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. he commends it more, than if he had pardoned sin without such a sacrifice, for then he had only displayed his mercy; but not caused Mercy and Justice to meet and triumph together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The riches of his grace shines forth in the <hi>peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity</hi> of the mercy. Remission is no common favour, it was never extended to the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> nor to the far greater part of the children of men, but only to a little flock, a small remnant of mankind, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The riches of grace are manifested in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, if we consider the <hi>subjects</hi> of this priviledge, who are not only equally plunged into sin and misery with others by nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. but many of the Lords pardoned ones are actually guilty of deeper-died abominations, than many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned ones in the civilized world are defiled with. To me (saith <hi>Paul)</hi> the greatest of sinners, one that was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>to me is this grace given. I obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>and such were some of you, but ye are justified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. Yea, God singles out the most base, despised, poor, and contemptible ones among men, to be the subjects of this glorious priviledge, 1 Cor. 1. 26. <hi>You see your calling brethren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, More of the riches of grace still appears if we view the <hi>latitude</hi> and extent of this act of grace. Oh how innumerable are our transgressions! <hi>Who can understand his errors?</hi> Psal. 19. 12. <hi>Yet the blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. Small and great sins, open and secret sins, old
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54344:172"/>
and new sins; all pardoned without exception. O the riches of grace! O the unsearchable goodness of God! <hi>With the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption; and he shall redeem Israel from all his Iniquities,</hi> Psal. 130. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and lastly, The riches of Grace shine forth in the <hi>irrevocableness</hi> and <hi>perpetuity</hi> of remission: as grace pardons all sins without <hi>exception,</hi> so the pardons it bestows are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>revocation.</hi> The pardoned soul shall <hi>never come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> Joh. 5. 24. <hi>As far as the East is from the West, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us,</hi> Psal. 103. 10. The <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> are the two opposite points of Heaven, which can never come together; neither shall the pardoned soul and its sins ever meet any more. <hi>Thou hast cast</hi> (saith <hi>Hezekiah) all my sins behind thy back.</hi> The penitent Believer sets his sins before his <hi>face,</hi> but the merciful God casts them all behind his <hi>back,</hi> never to behold them more, so as to charge them upon his pardoned people. And thus you see, what the pardon of sin is, what the price that purchaseth pardon is; and what riches of grace God manifesteth in the remission of Believers sins: which were the things to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and opened in the Doctrinal part. The improvement of the whole you will have in the following Uses.</p>

                  <head>Inference 1.</head>
                  <p>If this be so that all Believers, and none but Believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Inference 1.</note> the remission of their sins through the riches of grace, by the blood of Christ: <hi>What a happy condition then are Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in!</hi> Those that never felt the load of sin, may make light of a pardon, but so cannot you that have been in the deeps of trouble and fear about it: those that have been upon the rack of an accusing and condemning Conscience, as <hi>David, Heman,</hi> and many of the Saints have been, can never sufficiently value a pardon. <hi>Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered; blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,</hi> Psal. 32. 1, 2. or, O the blessednesses and felicities of the pardoned man! as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> sounds. Remission cannot but appear the wonder of <note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> mercies, if we consider through what difficulties the grace of God makes way for it to our souls; what strong bars the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54344:173"/>
love of God breaks asunder, to open our way to this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for there can be no pardon without a <hi>Mediator:</hi> no other <hi>Mediator</hi> but the Son of God: the Son of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discharge our debts but by taking them upon himself as our surety, and making full payment by bearing the wrath of God for us; and when all this is done, there can be no actual pardon, except the spirit of grace open our blind eyes, break our hard hearts, and draw them to Christ in the way of believing. And as the mercy of remission comes to us through wonderful difficulties, so it is in it self a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect mercy. God would not be at such vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the riches of his grace, Christ would not lay out the invaluable treasures of his precious blood to procure a cheap and common blessing for us. Rejoyce then ye par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned souls, God hath done great things for you, for which you have cause to be glad.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Inference 2.</head>
                  <p>Hence it follows, <hi>That interest in Christ by faith brings the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inference 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Conscience of a Believer into a state of rest and peace,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being justified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> I say not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer is presently brought into actual peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Conscience, there may be many fears, and much trouble even in a pardoned soul: but this is an undoubted truth, that faith brings the pardoned soul into that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and state where he may find perfect rest in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with respect to the guilt and danger of sin. The blood of Christ sprinkles us from an evil (that is an accusing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning) Conscience. We are apt to fear, that this or that special sin, which hath most terrified and affrighted our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, is not forgiven: but if there be riches enough in the grace of God, and efficacy enough in the blood of Christ; then the sins of Believers, all their sins, great as well as small, one as well as another without limitation or exception are pardoned.</p>
                  <p>For let us but consider, if God remits no sin to any man, but with respect to the blood of Christ, then all sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as any one sin; because the dignity and desert of that blood is infinite, and as much deserves an universal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54344:173"/>
for all sins, as the particular pardon of any, even the least sin. Moreover, remission is an act of Gods Fatherly love in Christ, and if it be so, then certainly no sin of any Believer can be retained or excluded from pardon: for then the same soul should be in the favour of God so far as it is pardoned, and out of the favour of God, so far as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned; and all this at one and the same instant of time, which is a thing both repugnant to it self, and to the whole stream of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude, what is the design and end of remission, but the saving of the pardoned soul? But if any sin be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or excluded from pardon, the retaining of that sin must needs irritate and void the pardon of all other sins; and so the acts of God must cross and contradict each other; and the design and end of God miscarry and be lost, which can never be. So then we conclude, faith brings the believing soul into a state of rest and peace.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Inference 3.</head>
                  <p>Hence it also follows, <hi>That no remission is to be expected by any</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inference 3.</note> 
                     <hi>soul without interest by faith in Jesus Christ: no Christ no pardon, no faith no Christ.</hi> Yet how apt are many poor deluded souls to expect pardon in that way where never any soul yet did, or ever can meet it? Some look for pardon from the absolute mercy of God, without any regard to the blood of Christ, or their interest therein: we have sinned, but God is merciful. Some expect remission of sin by vertue of their own duties, not Christs merits. I have sinned but I will repent, restore, reform, and God will pardon: but little do such men know how they therein diminish the evil of sin, undervalue the justice of God, slight the blood of Christ, and put an undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheat upon their own souls for-ever: to expect pardon from absolute mercy, or our own duties, is to knock at the wrong dore, which God hath shut up to all the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. Whilst these two principles abide firm, that the <hi>price</hi> of pardon is only in the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>benefit</hi> of pardon only by the <hi>application</hi> of his blood to us; this must remain a sure conclusion, that no remission is to be expected by any soul without interest by faith in Jesus Christ. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54344:174"/>
restitution and reformation are excellent duties in their kind, and in their proper places; but they were never meant for saviours or satisfactions to God for sin.</p>

                  <p>If it be intolerable ingratitude among men to requite good with evil, sure that sin must want a name bad enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, which puts the greatest dishonour upon God for the greatest mercy that ever was given by God to the world: <hi>there is mercy with thee</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>that thou maist be feared,</hi> not that thou maist be the more abused, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 4. Nay, let me say the <hi>Devils</hi> never sinned at this rate: they cannot abuse the pardoning grace of God, because such grace was never offered unto them. And certainly if the abuse of the common mercies of God, as meat and drink by gluttony and drunkenness, be an hainous sin, and highly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God: then the abuse of the riches of his grace, and the precious blood of his Son must be out of measure sinful; and the greatest affront we can put upon the God of mercy.</p>

                  <p>To Conclude, <hi>If this be so, as ever you expect pardon and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inference 5.</note> 
                     <hi>mercy from God, come to Christ in the way of faith; receive and embrace him now in the tenders of the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To drive home this great Exhortation, I beseech you, as in the bowels of Christ Jesus, and by all the regard and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue you have for your own souls, let these following Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations sink down into your hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:54344:174"/>
First, That all Christless persons are actually under the condemnation of God, John 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already:</hi> and it must needs be so, for every soul is concluded under the curse of the Law, till Christ make him free, <hi>John</hi> 8. 36. Till we are in Christ, we are dead by Law, and when we believe unto justification, then we <hi>pass from death to life.</hi> A blind mistaken Conscience may possibly acquit you, but assure your selves God condemns you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider what a terrible thing it is to lye under the condemnation of God, the most terrible things in nature cannot shadow forth the misery of such a state. Put all sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all poverty, all reproaches, the torments invented by all <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> into one Scale, and the condemnation of God into the other; and they will be all found lighter than a Feather. Condemnation is the sentence of God, the great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God: 'Tis a sentence shutting you up to everlasting wrath; 'tis a sentence never to be reversed, but by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christ in the season thereof. O souls, you cannot bear the wrath of God, you do not understand it if you think it tolerable: one drop of it upon your Consciences now, is enough to distract you in the midst of all the pleasures and comforts of this world: yet all that are out of Christ are sentenced to the fulness of Gods wrath for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is yet a possibility of escaping the wrath to come: a dore of hope opened to the worst of sinners: a day of grace is afforded to the Children of men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 15. God declares himself unwilling that any should perish, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. O what a mercy is this! Who that is on this side Heaven or Hell fully understands the worth of it?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This dore of mercy will be shortly shut, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 25. God hath many ways to shut it: he sometimes shuts it by withdrawing the means of grace, and removing the <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi> a judgement at this time to be greatly feared. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times shuts he it by withdrawing his Spirit and blessing from the means, whereby all Ordinances lose their efficacy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. But if he shut it not by removing the means of grace from you, certain it is, it will be shortly shut by your removal from all the means and opportunities by Salvation by death.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When once the dore of mercy is shut, you are gone beyond all the possibilities of pardon and salvation, for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54344:175"/>
evermore: the night is then come, in which no man can work, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. All the golden seasons you now enjoy will be irrecoverably gone out of your reach.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Pardons are now daily granted to others: some (and they once as far from mercy as you now are) are at this day reading their pardons with tears of joy dropping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The world is full of the examples and instances of the riches of pardoning grace. And whatever is needful for you to do in the way of repentance, and faith to obtain your pardon; how easily shall it be done, if once the day of Gods power come upon you? <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. Oh therefore lift up your cries to Heaven, give the Lord no rest, take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial till he open the blind eye, break the stony heart, open and bow the stubborn will, effectually draw thy soul to Christ; and deliver thy pardon signed in his blood.</p>

            <p>IN our last discourse we opened to you the blessed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of remission of sin from the following verse; in this verse lies another glorious priviledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>acceptation</hi> that Believers have with God through Jesus Christ: both which comprise (as the two main branches) our justification before God. In the words read (to omit many things that might be profitably observed from the method and dependance of the Apostles discourse) three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are observable,</p>

               <p>In the opening of this point, three things must be doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally discussed and opened.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:54344:176"/>
First, What the acceptation of our persons with God is? <note place="margin">1.</note> To open which, we must remember, that there is a twofold <hi>acceptance of persons</hi> noted in Scripture.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. One is the sinful act of a corrupt man.</item>
                  <item>2. The other the gracious act of a merciful God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, accepting of persons is noted in Scripture as the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act of a corrupt man: a thing which God abhors: being the corruption and abuse of that power and authority which men have in judgement: overlooking the merit of the cause through sinful respect to the quality of the person, whose cause it is. So that the cause doth not commend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the person the cause: this God every where brands in men, as a vile perverting of judgement, and utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it himself, Gal. 2. 6. <hi>God accepteth no mans person:</hi> Rom. 2. 11. <hi>There is no respect of persons with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is also an accepting of persons, which is the gracious act of a merciful God; whereby he receives both the persons and duties of Believers into special grace and favour for Christs sake: and of this my Text speaks. In which act of favour three things are supposed or included.</p>
               <p>First, It supposes an estate of alienation and enmity: those only are accepted into favour that were out of favour; and indeed so stood the case with us, Ephes. 2. 12, 13. <hi>Ye were aliens and strangers, but now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</hi> So the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> in 1 Pet. 2. 10. <hi>Which in time past were not a people, but now are the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</hi> The fall made a fearful breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man. Sin like a thick cloud intercepted all the beams of divine favour from us: the satisfaction of Christ dissolves that cloud, Isai. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins:</hi> This dark cloud thus dissolved, the face of God shines forth again with chearful beams of favour and love upon all, who by faith are interested in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It includes the removing of guilt from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Believers, by the imputation of Christs righteousness
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54344:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them, Rom. 5. 1, 2. <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand:</hi> for the face of God cannot shine upon the wicked: the person must be first made <hi>righteous</hi> before it can be made <hi>accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it includes the offering up, or tendering of our persons and duties to God by Jesus Christ. Accepting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies presenting or tendring: Believers indeed do present themselves to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. but Christs presenting them makes their tender of themselves acceptable to the Lord, Col. 1. 22. <hi>In the body of his flesh through death to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight.</hi> Christ leads every Believer as it were by the hand, into the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presence of God; after this manner bespeaking acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance for him. <q>Father, here is a poor soul that was born in sin, hath lived in Rebellion against thee all his days; he hath broken all thy laws, and deserved all thy wrath; yet he is one of that number which thou gavest me before the world was. I have made full payment by my blood for all his sins. I have opened his eyes to see the sinfulness, and misery of his condition: broken his heart for his rebellions against thee: bowed his will in obedience unto thy will: united him to my self by faith, as a living member of my body. And now, Lord, since he is become mine by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, let him be thine also by special acceptation: let the same love with which thou lovest me, embrace him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so who is now become mine.</q> And so much for the first particular, <hi>viz.</hi> what acceptation with God is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place I must shew you how it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <note place="margin">2.</note> that Believers are thus ingratiated or brought into the special favour of God by Jesus Christ. And this will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced divers ways.</p>
               <p>First, By the <hi>Titles</hi> of love and endearedness with which the Lord graceth and honoureth Believers, who are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>the houshold of God,</hi> Ephes. 2. 19. the <hi>friends of God,</hi> Jam. 2. 23. the <hi>dear Children of God,</hi> Ephes. 5. 1. the <hi>peculiar people of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>A Crown of Glory,</hi> and a <hi>Royal Diadem</hi> in the hand of their God, <hi>Isai.</hi> 62. 3. the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure, Psal.</hi> 147. 10, 11. Oh what tearms of endearedness doth God use towards his people!
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54344:177"/>
Doth not all this speak them to be in special favour with him? Which of all these alone doth not signifie a person highly in favour with God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The gracious manner in which he treats them upon the throne of grace, to which he allows them to come with boldness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. This also speaks them in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour of God: he allows them to come to him in prayer, with the liberty, confidence and filial boldness of children to a Father, Gal. 4. 6. <hi>Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> the familiar voice of a dear child: yea, which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful dignation and condescension of the great God to poor worms of the earth, he saith, Isai. 45. 11. <hi>Thus saith the Lord the holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me:</hi> an expression so full of grace and special favour to Believers, that it needs great caution in reading and understanding such an high and astonishing expression: the meaning is, that God hath as it were subjected the works of his hands to the prayers of his Saints: and it is as if he had said, If my glory, and your necessity shall require it, do but ask me in prayer, and whatever my almighty power can do, I will do it for you: however let no favourite of Heaven forget the infinite distance betwixt himself and God. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven, and was called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> yet see with what humility of spirit, and reverential awe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresseth to God, Gen. 18. 27. <hi>Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.</hi> So that you see the Titles of favour above mentioned are no empty Titles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods readiness to grant, as well as their liberty to ask speaks them the special favourites of God. The heart of God is so propense, and ready to grant the desires of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that it is but ask and have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. the dore of grace is opened at the knock of prayer: that is a favourite indeed to whom the King gives a blank to insert what request he will: <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you; ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you,</hi> John 15. 7. Oh blessed liberty of the sons of God! <hi>David</hi> did but say, <hi>Lord turn the Counsel of Ahitophel into foolishness,</hi> and it was done
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54344:178"/>
as soon as asked, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 31. <hi>Joshua</hi> did but say, <hi>Thou Sun stand still in Gibeon:</hi> and a miraculous stop was presently put to its swift motion in the Heavens: nay, which is wonderful to consider, a prayer in the womb, yet unborn, I mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the heart, and not yet uttered by the lips of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is often anticipated by the propenseness of free grace, Isai. 65. 24. <hi>And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer, and whilst they are yet speaking I will hear.</hi> The prayers of others are rejected as an abomination, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. God casts them back into their-faces, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 3. But free grace signs the petitions of the Saints more readily, than they are presented: we have not that freedom to ask, that God hath to give: 'tis true, the answer of a Believers prayers may be a long time suspended from his sense and knowledge; but every prayer according to the will of God is presently granted in Heaven, though for wise and holy ends they may be held in a doubtful suspense about them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The free discoveries of the secrets of Gods heart to Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speaks them to be his special favourites: men open not the counsels and secrets of their own hearts to enemies or strangers, but to their most inward and intimate friends: <hi>The secret of the Lord is-with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant,</hi> Psal. 25. 14. When God was about to destroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> he will do nothing in that work of judgement till he had acquainted <hi>Abraham,</hi> his friend, with his purpose therein, Gen. 18. 17. <hi>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? for I know him,</hi> &amp;c. So when a <hi>King</hi> was to be elected for <hi>Israel,</hi> and the person whom God had chosen, was yet unknown to the people, God as it were whispered that secret unto <hi>Samuel</hi> the day before, 1 Sam. 9. 15. <hi>Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came:</hi> according to the manner of Princes with some special favourite.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lords receiving every small thing that comes from them with grace and favour, when (mean while) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the greatest things offered by others, doth certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak Believers the special favourites of God. There was but one good word in a whole sentence from <hi>Sarah,</hi> and that very word is noted and commended by God, 1 Pet. 3. 6. <hi>She called</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54344:178"/>
                  <hi>him Lord.</hi> There were but some small beginnings or buddings of grace in young <hi>Abijah,</hi> and the Lord took special notice of it, 1 Kings 14. 12. <hi>Because in him there is found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</hi> Let this be an encouragement to young ones, in whom there are found any breathing desires after Christ: God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them if any sincerity be found in them: a secret groan uttered to God in sincerity shall not be despised, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. The very bent of a Believers will when he hath no more to offer unto God is an acceptable present, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. The very intent and purpose that lies secretly in the heart of a Believer, not yet executed, is accepted with him, 1 Kings 8. 18. <hi>Where as it was in thine heart to build an house to my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.</hi> Thus small things offered to God by Believers find acceptance with him, whilst the greatest presents, even solemn assemblies, Sabbaths and prayers from others are rejected: <hi>They are a trouble unto me</hi> (saith God) <hi>I am weary to bear them,</hi> Isai. 1. 14, 15. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense from <hi>Sheba,</hi> the sweet Cane from a far Country are not acceptable, nor sacrifices sweet unto God from other hands, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 20. From all which it appears beyond doubt, that the persons and duties of Believers are accepted into the special favour of God by Jesus Christ: which was the second thing to be spoken to, and brings us to the third general, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, How Christ the Beloved procures this benefit for <note place="margin">3.</note> Believers? And this he doth four ways.</p>
               <p>First, By <hi>the satisfaction of his blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> No friendship without reconciliation, no reconciliation but by the blood of Christ: therefore the new and living way by which Believers come unto God with acceptance, is said to be consecrated for us through the veil of Christs flesh, and hence believers have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The favour of God is procured for Believers, <hi>by their mystical union with Christ,</hi> whereby they are made <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5. 30. So that look as <hi>Adams</hi> posterity stood upon the same terms that he their natural head did; so Believers Christs mystical members stand in the favour of God, by the favour which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54344:179"/>
Christ their spiritual head hath, John 17. 33. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Believers are brought into favour with God <hi>by Christs becoming their Altar,</hi> upon which their persons and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are all offered up to God: the Altar sanctifies the gift, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. And this was typified by that legal rite menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 9, 10. Christ is that golden Altar from whence all the prayers of the Saints ascend to the throne of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the odours and incense of his merits, Rev. 8. 34. <hi>And another Angel came and stood at the Altar, having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it, with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne; and the smoak of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand.</hi> And thus you see how the persons and duties of Believers are brought into favour and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God by Jesus Christ. The Uses follow.</p>

'Tis said, Rev. 8. 4, 5, 6. <hi>That the smoak of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hand:</hi> and immediately it is added, vers. 5. <hi>And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and earth-quakes, and the seven Angels, which had the seven Trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.</hi> The prayer of a single Saint is sometimes followed with wonderful effects, Psal. 18. 6, 7. <hi>In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cryed unto my God: he heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him even into his ears: then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved, and were shaken because he was wroth:</hi> what then can a thundring legion of such praying souls do!

two great truths, <hi>viz.</hi> that the servants and slaves of sin may for a time enjoy the external priviledges of the house or Church of God; but it would not be long before the master of the house will turn them out of dore: but if they were once the adopted Children of God, then they should abide in the house for ever.

               <p>First, What those things are from which Believers are <note place="margin">1.</note> not made free in this world? we must not think that our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberty by Christ presently brings us into an absolute liberty in all respects. For,</p>
               <p>First, Christ doth not free Believers from obedience to the moral Law: 'Tis true we are no more under it as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> for our <hi>justification;</hi> but we are, and must still be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as a <hi>rule</hi> for our <hi>direction.</hi> The matter of the moral law is unchangeable as the nature of good and evil is, and cannot be abolished except that distinction could be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. The precepts of the Law are still urged under the Gospel to enforce duties upon us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. 'Tis therefore a vain distinction invented by <hi>Libertines</hi> to say it binds us as <hi>Creatures</hi> not as <hi>Christians:</hi> or that it binds the unregenerate part, but not the regenerate: but this is a sure truth, that they who are freed from its <hi>penalties,</hi> are still under its <hi>precepts:</hi> though Believers are no more under its <hi>curse,</hi> yet they are still under its <hi>conduct:</hi> the Law sends us to Christ to be <hi>justified,</hi> and Christ sends us to the Law to be <hi>regulated.</hi> Let the heart of every Christian joyn therefore with <hi>Davids</hi> in that holy wish, Psal. 119. 4, 5. <hi>Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently, O that my heart were directed to keep thy Statutes.</hi> 'Tis excellent when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans begin to obey the Law <hi>from</hi> life, which others obey <hi>for</hi> life: because they are justified, not that they may be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When duties are done in the strength and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ, which is Evangelical; not in our own strength and for our own ends, which is servile and legal obedience:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54344:183"/>
had Christ freed us from obedience, such a liberty had been to our loss.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ hath not freed Believers in this world from the temptations and assaults of Satan: even those that are freed from his <hi>dominion,</hi> are not free from his <hi>molestation.</hi> 'Tis said indeed, Rom. 16. 20. <hi>God shall shortly bruise Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan under your feet:</hi> but mean time he hath power to bruise and buffet us by his injections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. he now bruiseth Christs heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> bruiseth him in his tempted and afflicted members: though he cannot kill them, yet he can and doth afflict and fright them, by shooting his fiery darts of temptation among them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. 'Tis true, when the Saints are got safe into Heaven, they are out of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot; there is perfect freedom from all temptation. A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may then say, O thou enemy, temptations are come to a perpetual end. I am now arrived there, where none of thy fiery darts can reach me: but this freedom is not yet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ hath not yet freed Believers in this world from the motions of indwelling sin: these are continually acting and infesting the holiest of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21, 23, 24. Corruptions like <hi>Canaanites</hi> are still left in the Land to be thorns in our eyes, and goads in our sides. Those that boast most of freedom from the motions of sin, have most cause to suspect themselves still under the dominion of sin. All Christs freemen are troubled with the same complaint: who among them complains not as the Apostle did, Rom. 7. 24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliever me from the body of this death?</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, Jesus Christ doth not free Believers in this world from inward troubles and exercises of soul upon the account of sin. God may let loose Satan and Conscience too, in the way of terrible accusations, which may greatly distress the soul of a Believer, and wofully eclipse the light of Gods Countenance, and break the peace of their souls. <hi>Job, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were all made free by Christ, yet each of them hath left upon record his bitter complaint upon this account, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 19, 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. unto <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Christ hath not freed Believers in this world from the rods of affliction. God in giving us our liberty doth not abridge his own liberty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 32. all the Children of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54344:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God are made free, yet what Son is there whom the Father chastneth not? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 8. Exemption from affliction is so far from being the mark of a Freeman, that the Apostle there makes it the mark of a slave. Bastards, not Sons want the discipline and blessing of the Rod: to be freed from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction would be no benefit to Believers, who receive so many benefits by affliction.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, No Believer is freed by Christ from the <hi>stroak</hi> of death, though they are all freed from the <hi>sting</hi> of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. The bodies of Believers are under the same Law of mortality with other men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. we must come to the Grave as well as others: yea, we must come to it through the same agonies, pangs and dolours that other men do: the foot of death treads as heavy upon the bodies of the redeemed as of other men. Believers indeed are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by mercy from others, but the distinguishing mercy lies not here. Thus you see what Believers are not freed from in this world: if you shall now say, what advantage then hath a Believer, or what profit is there in regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I Answer,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Believers are freed from many great and <note place="margin">2.</note> sad miseries and evils by Jesus Christ notwithstanding all that hath been said. For,</p>
               <p>First, All Believers are freed from the <hi>rigour</hi> and <hi>curse</hi> of the Law: the rigorous yoak of the Law is broken off from their necks, and the sweet and easie yoak of Jesus Christ put on, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. The Law required perfect working under the pain of a curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. accepted of no short endeavours; admitted no repentance; gave no strength: it is not so now, proportionable strength is given, <hi>Phil</hi> 4. 13. Sincerity is reckoned perfection, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. Transgression brings not under condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. O blessed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! when duty becomes delight, and failings hinder not acceptance: this is one part of the blessed freedom of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All Believers are freed from the guilt of sin, it may <hi>trouble,</hi> but it cannot <hi>condemn</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. The hand writing which was against us is cancelled by Christ, nailed to his Cross, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 14. When the seal and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing is torn off from the Bond, the Debtor is made free
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54344:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereby: Believers are totally freed, Acts 13. 39. <hi>Justified from all things:</hi> and finally freed, John 5. 24. <hi>They shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into condemnation.</hi> O blessed freedom! How sweet is it to lie down in our beds, yea in our graves; when guilt shall neither be our Bed fellow, nor Grave fellow!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ frees all Believers from the <hi>dominion</hi> as well as the guilt of sin. <hi>Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. <hi>The law of the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. Now who can estimate such a liberty as this? What slavery, what an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable drudgery is the service of divers lusts from all which Believers are freed by Christ: not from the <hi>residence</hi> but from the <hi>reign</hi> of sin. 'Tis with sin in Believers as it was with those beasts mentioned Dan. 7. 12. <hi>They had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Jesus Christ sets all Believers free from the power of Satan; in whose right they were by nature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. they are translated from the power of darkness into the Kingdom of Christ. Satan had the possession of them, as a man of his own goods; but Christ dispossesseth that strong man armed, alters the property, and recovers them out of his hand, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21, 22. There are two ways by which Christ frees Believers out of Satans power and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, namely,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By Price.</item>
                  <item>2. By Power.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, By <hi>Price,</hi> the blood of Christ purchaseth Believers out of the hand of justice by satisfying the law for them, which being done, Satans authority over them falls of course, as the power of a Jaylor over the Prisoner doth, when he hath a legal discharge, Heb. 2. 14. <hi>For as much then as the Children are partakers of flesh and blood: he also himself took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> The cruel Tyrant beats and burthens the poor captive no more after the ransom is once paid, and he actually freed, and therefore Christ deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:54344:185"/>
Secondly, By <hi>power.</hi> Satan is exceeding unwilling to let go his prey: he is a strong and a malicious enemy: every rescue and deliverance out of his hand, is a glorious effect of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. How did our Lord Jesus Christ grapple with Satan at his death, and triumphed over him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. O glorious salvation, blessed liberty of the Children of God!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Christ frees Believers from the poisonous sting and hurt of death: kill us it can, but hurt us it cannot, 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56. <hi>O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law: but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> If there be no hurt, there should be no horror in death: 'tis guilt that arms death both with its hurting and terrifying power. To dye in our sins, <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. To have our bones full of the sins of our youth, which shall lye down with us in the dust, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 11. To have death, like a Dragon, pulling a poor guilty Creature as a prey into its dreadful Den, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 14. In this lies the danger and horror of death: but from death as a curse, and from the grave as a Prison, Christ hath set Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers at liberty, by submitting to death in their room, by his victorious resurrection from the grave, as the first-born of the dead: death is disarmed of its hurting power: the death of Believers is but a sleep in Jesus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The next thing to be briefly spoken to, is the <note place="margin">3.</note> kind and nature of that freedom and liberty purchased and procured by Christ for Believers.</p>
               <p>Now liberty may be considered two ways.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>As to civil freedom or liberty, it belongs not to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business: Believers as to their civil capacity are not freed from the duties they owe to their Superiors. Servants, though Believers, are still to be subject to their Masters accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh with fear and trembling, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 5. nor from obedience to lawful Magistrates whom we are to obey in the

'Tis not a carnal but a spiritual freedom Christ hath purchased for us: and this spiritual freedom is again to be considered, either</p>

               <p>The liberty Believers have at present is but a beginning liberty, they are freed but in part from their spiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but it is a growing liberty every day, and will be consummate, and compleat at last.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Christian Liberty is,</p>

               </list>
               <p>The liberty Believers are invested with, is of both kinds: they are not only freed from many miseries, burthens and dangers; but also invested by Jesus Christ with many royal priviledges and invaluable immunities.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And this brings us to the fourth and last thing; <note place="margin">4.</note> namely the properties of this blessed freedom which the Saints enjoy by Jesus Christ: and if we consider it duly it will be found to be,</p>
               <p>First, A wonderful liberty, never enough to be admired: how could it be imagined that ever those who owed unto God more than ever they could pay by their own eternal sufferings, those that were under the dreadful curse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, in the power and possession of Satan the strong man armed; those that were bound with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chains in their spiritual prison; their understanding bound with ignorance, their wills with obstinacy, their hearts with impenetrable hardness, their affections with a thousand bewitching vanities; that slight their state of slavery so much as industriously to oppose all instruments and means of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: For such persons to be set at liberty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54344:186"/>
all this, is the wonder of wonders, and is deservedly marvellous in the eyes of Believers for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The freedom of Believers is a peculiar freedom: a liberty which few obtain, the generality abiding still in bondage to Satan, who from the multitude of his Subjects is stiled <hi>the god of this world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Believers in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are often called a remnant, which is but a small part of the whole piece: the more cause have the people of God to admire distinguishing mercy: how many Nobles and great ones of the world are but royal slaves to Satan and their own lusts!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The liberty of Believers is a liberty dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the blood of Christ: what that Captain said, Acts 22. 28. <hi>With a great sum obtained I this freedom,</hi> may be much more said of the Believers freedom: 'twas not Silver or Gold but the precious blood of Christ that purchased it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The freedom and liberty of Believers is a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encreasing liberty, they get more and more out of the power of sin, and nearer still to their compleat salvation every day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. the body of sin dieth daily in them: they are said to be crucified with Christ: the strength of sin abates continually in them after the manner of crucified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: who dye a slow but sure death: and look in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the power of sin abates, proportionably their spiritual liberty encreases upon them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The freedom of Believers is a comfortable free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: the Apostle comforts Christians of the lowest rank, poor servants, with this consideration, 1 Cor. 7. 22. <hi>He that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords freeman, q. d.</hi> Let not the meanness of your outward condition, which is a state of subjection and dependance, a state of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and contempt, at all trouble you: you are the Lords freemen, of precious account in his eyes. O 'tis a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table liberty!</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and Lastly, 'Tis a perpetual and final freedom, they that are once freed by Christ have their manumissions and final discharge from that state of bondage they were in before. Sin shall never have dominion over them any more: it may tempt them and trouble them, but shall never more
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54344:186"/>
rule and govern them, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And thus you see what a glorious liberty the liberty of Believers is.</p>
               <p>The improvement whereof will be in the following Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>

                     <hi>others in the world?</hi> shall not the captive rejoycé in his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered liberty? The very Birds of the air (as one observes) had rather be at liberty in the woods, though lean and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, than in a golden Cage with the richest fare: every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture naturally prises it, none more than Believers, who have felt the burthen and bondage of corruption: who in the days of their first illumination and conviction have poured out many groans and tears for this mercy. What was said of the captive people of God in <hi>Babylon,</hi> excellently shadows forth the state of Gods people under spiritual bondage, with the way and manner of their deliverance from it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>By the blood of thy Covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</hi> Believers are delivered by the blood of Christ out of a worse pit than that of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and look as the Tribes in their return from thence were overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy and astonishment, Psal. 126. 1, 2. <hi>When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion; we were like them that dream, then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing:</hi> they were overwhelmed with the sense of the mercy: so should it be with the people of God. 'Tis said, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24. when the Prodigal Son (there made the embleme of a returning converting sinner) was returned again to his Fathers house; that there was heard musick and dancing, mirth and feasting in that house. The Angels in Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice when a soul is recovered out of the power of Satan: and shall not the recovered soul, immediately concerned in the mercy, greatly rejoyce? Yea, let them rejoyce in the Lord, and let no earthly trouble or affliction ever have power to interrupt their joy for a moment after such a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance as this.</p>

'Tis said, Mat. 12. 44, 45. <hi>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rest and findeth none: then he saith, I will return into mine house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept and garnished; then goeth he, and taketh with him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</hi> Even as a Prisoner that hath escaped, and is again recovered, is loaded with double irons. Let the people of God be content to run any hazzard, endure any difficulties in the way of Religion, rather than return again into their former bondage, to sin and Satan. O Christian, if ever God gave thee a sight, and a sense of the misery and danger of thy natural state, if ever thou hast felt the pangs and throes of a labouring and distressed Conscience, and after all this tasted the unspeakable sweetness of the peace and rest that is in Christ, thou wilt rather choose to dye ten thousand deaths than to forsake Christ, and go back again into that sad condition.</p>

               <q>For Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust; that he might bring us to God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe scope of the Apostle in this place is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and fortifie Christians for a day of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. In order to their chearful sustaining whereof he prescribeth two excellent rules of mighty use for all suffering Christians.</p>
            <p>First, To get a good Conscience within them, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>hic murus aheneus esto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To set the example of Christs suffering before them, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. for Christ hath once suffered for sinners: the sufferings of Christ for us, is the great motive engaging Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to suffer chearfully for him.</p>
            <p>In the words before us we have,</p>
            <p>First, The sufficiency and fulness of Christs sufferings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in that particle [once] Christ needs to suffer no more, having finished and compleated that whole work at once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:54344:189"/>
Secondly, The meritorious cause of the sufferings of Christ, and that is sin, <hi>Christ once suffered for sins:</hi> not his own sins, but ours: as it follows in the next clause, which is the third thing here observable, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The admirable grace and unexampled love of Christ to us sinners, <hi>the just for the unjust,</hi> in which words the substitution of Christ in the room and place of sinners, the vice-gerence of his death is plainly expressed. Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only <hi>nostro bono,</hi> for our good, but also <hi>nostro loco</hi> in our stead.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Here is also the final cause or design and scope of the sufferings of Christ, which was <hi>to bring us to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Here is also the issue of the sufferings of Christ, which was the death of Christ in the flesh, and the quickning of Christ after death by the Spirit: many excellent observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are lodged in the bosom of this Scripture: all which I must pass in silence at this time, and confine my discourse to the final cause of the sufferings of Christ, namely <hi>that he might</hi> bring <hi>us to God:</hi> where the observation will be plainly and briefly this.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the end of Christs cursed death and bitter sufferings was <note place="margin">Doct.</note> to bring all those for whom he died unto God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>In the explication and preparation of this point for use two things must be spoken unto.</p>

                        <item>1. What Christs bringing us to God imports.</item>
                        <item>2. What influence the death of Christ hath upon this design of bringing us to God.</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First, What Christs bringing us to God imports: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">1.)</note> there be many great and excellent things carried in this expression: more generally it notes our state of <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> and our state of <hi>glorification:</hi> by reconciliation we are brought nigh to God, Ephes. 2. 13. <hi>Ye are made nigh, (i. e:)</hi> reconciled, <hi>by the blood of Christ.</hi> Heb. 12. 22, 23. we are said <hi>to come to God the Judge of all.</hi> By reconciliation we are brought nigh unto God now; by glorification we shall be
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54344:189"/>
brought home to God hereafter, 1 Thes. 4. 17. <hi>We shall be ever with the Lord:</hi> but more particularly this phrase, <hi>that he might brings us to God,</hi> imports,</p>
               <p>First, That the chief happiness of man consisteth in the <note place="margin">(1.)</note> enjoyment of God: that the creature hath as necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God for happiness, as the stream hath upon the fountain, or the image in the glass upon the face of him that looks into it. Look as the sum of the creatures misery lies in this, <hi>depart from me;</hi> separation from God is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of damnation: So on the contrary, the chief hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the creature consisteth in the enjoyment and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vision of God, 1 John 3. 2. Psal. 17. 15. <hi>I shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when I awake with thy likeness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It implies mans revolt and apostasie from God, <note place="margin">(2.)</note> Ephes. 2. 12. <hi>But now in Christ Jesus, ye who were sometime afar</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</hi> de ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Dei.</note> 
                  <hi>off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</hi> Those whom Christ bringeth unto God were before afar off from him, both in state and condition; and in temper and disposition: we were lost creatures, and had no desire to return to God: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal was said to go into a far Country, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christs bringing us to God implies our inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to return to God of our selves: we must be brought back by Christ, or perish for ever in a state of separation from God: the lost sheep is made the <hi>embleme</hi> of the lost sinner, <note place="margin">(3.)</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 5. The sheep returns not to the fold of it self, but the shepheard seeks it, finds it, and carries it back upon his shoulders: and the <hi>Apostle</hi> plainly tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. that when <hi>we were without strength (i. e.)</hi> any ability to recover, help or save our selves; <hi>in due time Christ died for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christs bringing us to God evidently implies <note place="margin">(4.)</note> this, that Gods unsatisfied justice was once the great bar betwixt him and man: man can have no access to God but by Christ: Christ brings us to God by no other way but the way of satisfaction by his blood: <hi>he hath suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.</hi> Better ten thousand worlds should perish for ever, than God should lose the honour of his justice. This great <hi>Obex,</hi> or bar to our enjoyment of God is effectually removed by the death of Christ: whereby it is not only fully satisfied, but highly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54344:190"/>
honoured and glorified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. and so the way by which we are brought to God is again opened (to the wonder and joy of all Believers) by the blood and sufferings of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and lastly, It shews us the peculiar happiness and <note place="margin">(5.)</note> priviledge of Believers above all people in the world. These only are they which shall be brought to God by Jesus Christ in a reconciled state: others indeed shall be brought to God as a <hi>Judge,</hi> to be condemned by him: Believers only are brought to God in the Mediators hand, as a reconciled <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to be made blessed for ever in the injoyment of him: every Believer is brought singly to God at his death, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. and all Believers shall be jointly and solemnly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God in the great day, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 24. They shall be all presented faultless before the presence of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with exceeding joy. Now the priviledge of Believers in that day will lie in diverse things.</p>
               <p>First, That they shall be all brought to God together: this will be the general assembly mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. there shall be a collection of all Believers in all ages of the world into one blessed assembly: they shall come from the East, and West, and North, and South, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 29. O what a glorious train will be seen following the redeemer in that day!</p>
               <p>Secondly, As all the Saints shall be collected into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: so they shall be all brought or presented unto God, faultless and without blemish, Jude v. 24. <hi>A glorious Church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,</hi> Ephes. 5. 27. For this is the general assembly of the spirits of just men that are made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. All sin was perfectly separated from them, when death had separated their souls and bodies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In this lies the priviledge of Believers, that as they shall be all brought together, and that in a state of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute purity and perfection, so they shall be all brought to God: they shall see his face, in the vision whereof is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16 11. The objective blessedness of the Saints consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their fruition of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. To see God in his word and works, is the happiness of the Saints on earth, but to see him face to face will be the fulness of their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness in Heaven, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. This is that intuitive,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54344:190"/>
transforming and satisfying vision of which the Scripture frequently speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to be brought unto God, must needs imply a state of perfect joy and highest delight: so speaks the Apostle <hi>Jude v.</hi> 14. Christ shall present or bring them to God with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy: and more fully the joy of this day is expressed, Psal. 45. 15. <hi>With joy and rejoycing shall they be brought, they shall enter into the Kings Palace:</hi> it will be a day of universal joy, when all the Saints are brought home to God in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected state. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. God the Father will rejoice when Christ brings home that precious number of his elect, whom he redeemed by his blood: he rejoyceth in them now though imperfect, and under many distastful corruptions and weaknesses, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. How much more will he rejoyce in them when Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents them without spot or wrinkle to him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jesus Christ will exceedingly rejoyce, 'twill be the day of the gladness and satisfaction of his heart: for now, and not till now he receives his mystical fulness, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all the blessed issues of his death, which cannot but give him unspeakable contentment, Isai. 53. 11. <hi>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The day in which Believers are brought home to God, will be a day of unspeakable joy to the holy Spirit of God himself. For unto this all his sanctifying designs in this world had respect: to this day he sealed them: after this day he stirred up desires and groanings that cannot be uttered in their hearts, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Thus all the great and blessed persons, Father, Son and Spirit, will rejoyce in the bringing home of the elect to God. For as it is the greatest joy to a man to see the designs which his heart hath been long projecting and intently set upon, by an orderly conduct, at last brought to the happy issue he first aimed at; much more will it be so here: the counsel and hand of each person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply concerned in this blessed design.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Angels of God will rejoyce at the bringing home of Believers to him: the spirits of just men made perfect will be united in one general assembly with an innumerable company of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 22. Great is the affection and love of Angels to redeemed ones: they greatly rejoyced at
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54344:191"/>
the incarnation of Christ for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13. They great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted to pry into the mysterie of their redemption, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. They were marvellously delighted at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version which was the day of their espousals to Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10. They have been tender and careful over them, and very serviceable to them in this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but rejoice exceedingly to see them all brought home in safety to their Fathers house.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To Conclude, Christs bringing home of all Believers unto God, will be matter of unspeakable joy to themselves. For whatever knowledge and acquaintance they had with God here, whatever sights of faith they had of Heaven and the glory to come in this world; yet the sight of God and Christ the Redeemer will be an unspeakable surprise to them in that day. This will be the day of relieving all their wants; the day of satisfaction to all their desires: for now they are come where they would be; arrived at the very desires of their souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the last place, let it be considered what influence the death of Christ hath upon this design, and you <note place="margin">2.</note> shall find it much every way. In two things especially the death of Christ hath a blessed causality and influence in this matter,</p>
               <list>
                  <label>viz.</label>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It effectually removes all obstacles to it.</item>
                        <item>2. It purchaseth (as a price) their title to it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First, The death of Christ removes all obstacles out of the way of this mercy: such were the bars hindring our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to God, as nothing but the death of Christ could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and open a way for Believers to come to God. The <hi>guilt</hi> of sin barred us from his gracious presence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 2. The <hi>filth</hi> of sin excluded us from God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. The <hi>enmity</hi> of our nature perfectly stopped up our way to God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. by reason hereof fallen man hath no desire to come unto God, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. The <hi>Justice</hi> of God like a flaming Sword turning every way, kept all men from access to God: and lastly, <hi>Satan</hi> that malicious and armed adversary lay as a Lyon in the way to God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Oh with what strong bars were
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54344:191"/>
the gates of Heaven shut against our souls! The way to God was chained up with such difficulties as none but Christ was able to remove; and he by death hath effectually removed them all: the way is now open, even the new and the living way, consecrated for us by his blood. The death of Christ effectually removes the guilt of sin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. washes off the filth of sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6. takes away the enmity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21. satisfied all the demands of justice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. hath broken all the power of Satan, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and consequently the way to God is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and fully opened to Believers by the blood of Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The blood of Christ purchaseth for Believers their right and title to this priviledge, Gal. 4. 4, 5. <hi>But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law: to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons, (i. e.)</hi> both the relation and inheritance of sons. There was value and worth enough in the precious blood of Christ, not only to pay all our debts to justice, but over and above the payment of our debts to purchase for us this invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priviledge. We must put this unspeakable mercy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to God, as my Text puts it, upon the account and score of the death of Christ. No Believer had ever tasted the sweetness of such a mercy, if Christ had not tasted the bitterness of death for him. The use of all you will have in the following Deductions of truth.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Great is the preciousness and worth of souls, that the life of Christ should be given to redeem and recover them to God:</hi> As God laid out his thoughts and counsel from eternity upon them to project the way and method of their salvation: so the Lord Jesus in pursuance of that blessed design, came from the bosom of the Father, and spilt his invaluable blood to bring them to God. No wise man expends vast sums to bring home trifling commodities. How cheap soever our souls are in our estimation, 'tis evident by this they are of precious esteem in the eyes of Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Redeemed souls must expect no rest or satisfaction on this side Heaven, and the full enjoyment of God:</hi> the life of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this world is a life of motion and expectation: they are now coming to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. God, you see, is the centre and rest of their souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. As the Rivers cannot rest <note place="margin">Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There be four things which do and will break the rest and disturb the souls of Believers in this world; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, temptations, corruptions, and absence from God: if the three former causes of disquietness were totally remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so that a Believer were placed in such a condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth where no affliction should disturb him, no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trouble him, no corruption defile or grieve him: yet his very absence from God must still keep him restless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, 2 Cor. 5. 6. <hi>Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi>

                     <hi>What sweet and pleasant thoughts should all Believers have of death!</hi> When they dye, and never till they dye shall they be fully brought home to God. Death to the Saints is the dore by which they enter into the enjoyment of God: the dying Christian is almost at home, yet a few pangs and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies more, and then he is come to God in whose presence is the fulness of joy. <hi>I desire,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. It should not scare us to be brought to death, the King of terrors, so long as it is the office of death to bring us to God. That dreaming opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the soul sleeping after death is as ungrounded as it is uncomfortable: the same day we loose from this shore, we shall be landed upon the blessed shore, where we shall see and enjoy God for ever. O if the friends of dead Believers did but understand where, and with whom their souls are, whilst they are mourning over their bodies: certainly a few believing thoughts of this would quickly dry up their tears,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54344:192"/>
and fill the house of mourning with voices of praise and thanksgiving.</p>

                     <hi>How comfortable and sweet should the converses and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christians be with one another in this world!</hi> Christ is bringing them all to God through this vale of tears, they are now in the way to him, all bound for Heaven, going home to God to their everlasting rest in glory: every day, every hour, every duty brings them nearer and nearer to their journeys end, Rom. 13. 11. <hi>Now,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</hi> O what manner of heavenly communications and ravishing discourses should Believers have with each other as they walk by the way! O what pleasant and delightful stories should they tell one another about the place and state whither Christ is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and where they shall shortly be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, transporting, transforming visions they shall have that day they are brought home to God: how surprizingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious the sight of Jesus Christ will be to them, who died for them to bring them unto God. How should such discourses as these shorten and sweeten their passage through this world; strengthen and encourage the dejected and feeble minded, and exceedingly honour and adorn their profession! Thus lived the Believers of old, Heb. 11. 9, 10. <hi>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange Country, dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac, and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise, for he looked for a City which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</hi> But alas, most Christians are either entangled in the cares and troubles, or so ensnared by the delights and plasures, which almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually divert and take up their thoughts by the way, that there is but little room for any discourses of Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among many of them: but certainly this would be as much your interest as your duty. When the <hi>Apostle</hi> had entertained the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> with a lovely discourse of their meeting the Lord in the air, and being ever with the Lord, he charges it upon them as their great duty to comfort one another with those words, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17, 18.</p>

Troubles and afflictions are of excellent use under the blessing of the Spirit to further Christs great design of bringing you to God. How often would you turn out of that way which leads to God, if God did not hedge up your way with thorns, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 6. Doubtless when you come home to God, you shall find you have been as much beholding (it may be a great deal more) to your troubles than to your comforts, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you thither: however the sweetness of the end will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more than recompence the sorrows and troubles of the way: nor are they worthy to be compared with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that shall be revealed in you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</p>

ANd thus I have finished the Motives drawn from the titles and benefits of Christ, serving to enforce and quicken the great Gospel-exhortation of coming to, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually applying the Lord Jesus Christ in the way of faith. O that the blessings of the Spirit might follow these Calls, and fix these Considerations as Nailes in sure places.

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe scope of the Apostle in this Epistle, and more particularly in this Chapter, is to state the due use and excellency of the Law, which he doth accordingly,</p>
            <p>First, By denying to it, power to justifie us, which is the peculiar honour of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By ascribing to it a power to convince us, and so prepare us for Christ.</p>
            <p>Neither attributing to it more honour than belongeth to it, nor yet detracting from it that honour and usefulness which God hath given it. It cannot make us righteous; but it can convince us that we are unrighteous; it cannot heal, but it can open and discover the wounds that sin hath given us: which he proves in this place by an argument drawn from his own experience, confirmed also by the general experience of Believers, in whose persons and names we must here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54344:195"/>
him to speak; <hi>For I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, sin revived, and I died:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three particulars are very observable.</p>
            <p>First, The opinion <hi>Paul</hi> had, and all unregenerate men have of themselves before Conversion: <hi>I was alive once:</hi> by <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>life</hi> understand here liveliness, chearfulness, and confidence of his good estate and condition: he was full of vain hope, false joy and presumptuous confidence, a very brisk and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The sense and opinion he had, and all others will have of themselves, if ever they come under the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating <note place="margin">2.</note> work of the Spirit in his ordinary method of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>I died.</hi> The death he here speaks of, stands opposed to that life before mentioned; and signifies the sorrows, fears and tremblings that seized upon his soul, when his state and temper were upon the change: the apprehensions he then had of his condition struck him home to the heart and damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his carnal mirth: <hi>I died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ground and reason of this wonderful alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and change of his judgement, and apprehension of <note place="margin">3.</note> his own condition; <hi>the Commandment came, and sin revived;</hi> the Commandment came, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> it came home to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, it was set on with a divine and mighty efficacy upon my heart: the Commandment was come before by way of promulgation and the literal knowledge of it: but it never came till now in the spiritual sense and convincing power to his soul: though he had often read and heard the Law before, yet he never clearly understood the meaning and extent, he never felt the mighty efficacy thereof upon his heart before; it so came at this time, as it never came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Of these briefly in their order.</p>
               <p>First, There is in unregenerate men a great deal of <hi>carnal security,</hi> they dread no danger, Luke 11. 21. <hi>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:</hi> there is generally a great stillness and silence in the Consciences of such men: when others (in a better condition) are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trembling, they sleep securely, so they live, and so oft-times they dye, Psal. 73. 4. <hi>they have no bonds in their death;</hi> Hebrew, no knots, no difficulties that puzzle them: 'tis true, the Consciences of few men are so perfectly stupifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that sometime or other they twinge and gird them, but it seldom works at that height, or continues with them so long as to give any considerable interruption to their carnal peace and quietness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The life of the unregenerate consisteth in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous hope: this is the very foundation of their carnal security. So Christ tells the Jews, John 8. 54, 55. <hi>Of whom ye say that he is your God, and yet ye have not known him.</hi> The world is full of hope without a promise, which is but as a Spiders web when a stress comes to be laid upon it, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8. Unregenerate men are said indeed to be without hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. but the meaning is, they are without any solid well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hope: for in Scripture account vain hope is no hope. Except it be a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 3. a hope flowing from union with Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. a hope nourished by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4. a hope for which a man can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. a hope that puts men upon heart-purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavours, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. it is in the account of God a cypher, a vanity, not deserving the name of hope: and yet such a groundless, dead, Christless, irrational idle hope is that which the unregenerate lives upon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The life of the unregenerate consisteth in false joy, the immediate off spring of ungrounded hope, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20. the stony ground received the word with joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:54344:196"/>
There are two sorts of joy upon which the unregenerate live,</p>
               <list>
                  <label>viz.</label>
                  <item>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A sensitive joy in things <hi>Carnal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. A delusive joy in things <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>They rejoyce in Corn, Wine and Oyl, in their Estates and Children, in the pleasant fruitions of the Creature: yea, and they rejoyce also in Christ and the Promises, in Heaven and Glory: with all which they have just such a kind of communion as a man hath in a dream with a full feast and curious musick, and just so their joy will vanish when they awake. Now these three, <hi>security, hope</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> make up the livelihood of the carnal world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next it concerns us to enquire what are the <note place="margin">2.</note> things that maintain and support this security, hope and joy in the hearts of unregenerate men, and if we consider duely, we shall find Church priviledges, natural ignorance, false evidences of the love of God, slight workings of the Gospel, self-love, comparing themselves with the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; and Satans policy managing all these in order to their eternal ruine; are so many springs to feed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this life of delusion in the unregenerate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, Church priviledges lay the foundation to this strong delusion: thus the Jews deceived themselves, saying in their hearts, <hi>We have Abraham for our Father,</hi> Mat. 3. 9. This propt up their vain hopes that <hi>Abrahams</hi> blood ran in their veins, though <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedience never wrought in their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Natural ignorance, this keeps all in peace; they that see not, fear not. There are but two ways to quiet the hearts of men about their spiritual and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, <hi>viz. the way of assurance</hi> and faith, or <hi>the way of ignorance</hi> and self-deceit: by the one we are put beyond danger, by the other beyond fear, though the danger be greater. Satan could never quiet men if he did not first blind them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, False evidence of the love of God is another spring feeding this security, vain hope, and false joy in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54344:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hearts of men: see the power of it to hush and still the Conscience, Mat. 7. 22. <hi>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name,</hi> &amp;c. The things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they build their evidence and confidence were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things in Religion, yet they had a quieting power upon them as if they had been the best evidences in the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Slight workings of the Gospel, such are transient motions of the affections under the word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8. the working of their desires about spiritual objects, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8. the external change and reformation of their ways, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43. all which serve to nourish the vain hopes of the unregenerate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Self-love is an apparent reason and ground of security and false hope, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 3. it makes a man to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look great evils in himself, whilst he is sharp-sighted to discover and censure lesser evils in others: self-love takes away the sight of sin, by bringing it too near the eye.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, Mens comparing themselves with those that are more prophane and grosly wicked than themselves, serves notably to quiet and hush the Conscience asleep; <hi>God, I thank thee,</hi> said the Pharisee, <hi>I am not as other men, or as this Publican.</hi> O what a Saint did he seem to himself, when he stood by those that were more externally wicked!</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly and Lastly, The policy of Satan to manage all these things to the blinding and ruining of the souls of men, is another great reason they live so securely and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly as they do, in a state of so much danger and misery, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. <hi>The God of this world blinds the eyes of them that believe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, You have seen what the life of the unregenerate is, and what maintains that life: in the next place I shall <note place="margin">3.</note> give you evidence that this is the life the generality of the world do live: a life of carnal security, vain hope and false joy: this will evidently appear, if we consider,</p>
               <p>First, The activity and liveliness of mens spirits in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of the world. O how lively and vigorous are their hearts in the management of earthly designs, Psal. 6. 4. <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi> The world eats up their hearts, time and strength. Now this could never be if their eyes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54344:197"/>
were but opened to see the danger and misery their souls be in: how few designs for the world run in the thoughts of a condemned man? O if God had ever made the light of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to shine into their Consciences, certainly the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would lye the quite contrary way; even in too great a neglect of things of this life: but this briskness and liveliness plainly shews the great security which is upon most men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The marvellous quietness and stillness that is in the thoughts and consciences of men about their everlasting concernments plainly shews this to be the life of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: how few scruples, doubts or fears shall you hear from them? how many years may a man live in carnal fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies before he shall hear such a question as this seriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> There are no questions in their lips, because no fear or sense of danger in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The general contentedness and profest willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of carnal men to dye, gives clear evidence that such a life of security and vain hope is the life they live; <hi>Like sheep they are laid in the grave,</hi> Psal. 49. 14. O how quiet and still are their Consciences, when there are but a few breaths more between them and everlasting burnings! Had God opened their eyes to apprehend the consequences of death, and what follows the pale Horse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. it were impossible but that every unregenerate man should make that bed on which he dies shake and tremble under him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, The low esteem men have for Christ, and the total neglect of, at least the meer trifling with those duties in which he is to be found, plainly discovers this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid secure life to be the life that the generality of the world do live: for were men sensible of the disease of sin, there could be no quieting them without Christ the <hi>Physician, Phil.</hi> 3. 8. All the business they have to do in this world could never keep them from their knees, or make them strangers to their Closets: all which, and much more that might be said of like nature, gives too full and clear proof to this sad assertion, that this is the life the unregenerate world gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lives.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the last place I would speak a few words to <note place="margin">4.</note> discover the danger of such a life as hath been described, to

which purpose let the following brief hints be minded se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.</p>
               <p>First, By these things souls are inevitably betrayed into Hell and eternal ruine, this blinding is in order to damning, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded:</hi> those that are turned over into eternal death are thus generally mop't and hoodwinkt in order thereunto, Isai. 6. 9, 10. <hi>And he said go and tell this people, hear ye indeed but understand not, and see ye indeed but perceive not: make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As damning is the event of blinding, so nothing makes Hell a more terrible surprise to the soul than this doth: by this means the wrath of God is felt before its danger be apprehended, a man is past all hope before he begins to have any fear: his eternal ruine like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall cometh suddenly at an instant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 13. And as it damns surely and surprizingly, so,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nothing more aggravates a mans damnation than to sink suddenly into it, from amidst so many hopes and high confidence of safety: for a man to find himself in Hell when he thought and concluded himself within a step of Heaven, O what a Hell will it be to such men! the higher their vain hopes lifted them up, the more dreadful must their fall be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. And as it damns surely, surprizingly and with highest aggravations, So,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This life of security and vain hope frustrates all the means of recovery and salvation in the only season, wherein they can be useful and beneficial to us: by reason of these things the word hath no power to convince mens Consciences, nothing can bring them to a sight and sense of their condition: therefore Christ told the self-confident and blind Jews, Mat. 21. 21. <hi>That the Publicans and Harlots go into the kingdom of God before them:</hi> and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their hearts lye more open and fair to the strokes of conviction and compunction for sin than those do, who are blinded by vain hopes and confidences.</p>

Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters study for truths apt to awaken and convince the Consciences of them that hear them, but their words return again to them: they turn to God and mourn over the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we have laboured in vain, and spent our strength for nought; and this is the cause of all security; and vain hopes bar fast the dores of mens hearts against all the convictions and perswasions of the word: the greater cause have they to admire the grace of God, who have or shall find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the word sharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit: to whose hearts God brings home the Commandment by an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual application.</p>

                     <hi>How great a mercy is it to be awakened out of that general sleep and security which is fallen upon the world?</hi> You cannot esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <note place="margin">Inference 3.</note> the value of that mercy, for it is a peculiar mercy. O that ever the Spirit of the Lord should give thy soul a jog under the Ministry of the word, startle, and rouse thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, whilst others are left snoring in the deep sleep of security round about thee: when the Lord shall deal with thy soul much after that rate he did with <hi>Paul</hi> in the way to <hi>Damascus,</hi> who not only saw a light shining from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which those that travelled with him saw as well as he, but heard that voice from Heaven which did the work upon his heart, though his Companions heard it not. Besides, it is not only a peculiar mercy, but it is a leading introductive mercy to all other spiritual mercies that follow it to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: if God had not done this for thee, thou hadst never been brought to faith, to Christ or Heaven: for from this act of the Spirit all other saving acts take their rise: so that you have cause for ever to admire the goodness of God in such a favour as this is.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Hence it follows, that the generality of the world are in the direct way to eternal ruine, and whatever their vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inference 4.</note> 
                     <hi>are, they cannot be saved: Narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Hear me all you that live this dangerous life of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal security and vain hope, whatever your perswasions and confidences are; except you give them up and get better grounds for your hope, you cannot be saved. For,</p>
                  <p>First, Such hopes and confidences as yours are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the established order of the Gospel, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. in all that shall be saved: and this order shall never be altered for any mans sake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If such as you be saved, all the threatnings in Scripture must be reversed, which lie in full opposition to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54344:199"/>
your vain hopes, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8, 9. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth of God in these threatnings must fail, or your vain hopes must fail.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If ever such as you be saved, new conditions must be set to all the promises: for there is no condition of any special promise found in any unregenerate person. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your hearts with these Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If ever such a hope as yours bring you to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then the saving hope of Gods elect is not rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to us in the Scriptures. Scripture hope is the effect of regeneration, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. and purity of heart is the effect of that hope, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. Nay,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The very nature of Heaven is mistaken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if such as you be Subjects qualified for its enjoyment: for assimilation or the conformity of the soul to God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, is in the Scripture account a principal ingredient of that blessedness: by all which it manifestly appears that the hopes of most men are vain, and will never bring them to Heaven.</p>

               </list>
               <p>First, I shall give you some demonstrations of the mighty power and efficacy that there is in the word or Law of God: <note place="margin">1.</note> which will appear with fullest evidence,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:54344:200"/>
First, From the various <hi>subjects</hi> upon whom it works: the hearts and Consciences of men of all orders and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">1.</note> have been reached and wounded to the quick by the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged sword of Gods Law. Some among the <hi>great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> of the earth, (though indeed the fewest of that rank) have been made to stoop and tremble under the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. the wise and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the world have felt its power, and been brought over to imbrace the humbling and self-denying ways of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 34. Thus <hi>Origen, Hierom, Tertullian, Bradwardine,</hi> and many more came into <hi>Canaan</hi> laden with <hi>Egyptian Gold,</hi> as one speaks <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they came into the Church of God abundantly enriched and furnished with the learned arts and sciences; devoting them all to the service of Christ: Yea, and which is as strange, <hi>the most simple, weak and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> have been wonderfully changed and wrought upon by the power of the word: <hi>the testimonies of the Lord make wise the simple.</hi> Men of weak understandings in all other matters have been made wise to salvation by the power of the word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. Nay, the most malicious and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enemies of Christ have been wounded and converted by the word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 24. Those that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prejudice of the worst, and most <hi>idolatrous education,</hi> have been the subjects of its mighty power, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 26. To conclude, men of the most profligate and debauched lives have been wonderfully changed, and altered by the power of the word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The mighty efficacy of the Law of God appears in the <hi>manner of its operation</hi> which works suddenly, strikes like a Dart through the hearts and Consciences of men, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. a wonderful change is made in a short time: and as it works quickly and suddenly, so it works irresistibly, with an uncontrouled power, upon the spirits of men, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. Let the soul be armed against conviction with the thickest ignorance, strongest prejudice, or most obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, the word of God will wound the breast even of such a man; when God sends it forth in his authority and power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The wonderful power of the Law or word of God is evidently seen in the strange effects which are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it in the hearts and lives of men. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:54344:201"/>
First, It changes and alters the frame and temper of the mind: it moulds a man into a quite contrary temper, Gal. <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> 1. 23. <hi>He which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith, which once he destroyed:</hi> thus a <hi>Tyger</hi> is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lamb by the power of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It makes the soul upon which it works to forgo and quit the dearest interest it hath in this world for Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. riches, honours, self righteousness, dearest relations are denied and forsaken: reproach, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and death it self are willingly imbraced for Christs sake; when once the efficacy of the word hath been upon the hearts of men, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6. Those that were their companions in sin are declined, renounced and cast off with abhorrence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. In such things as these the mighty power of the word discovers it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next let us see wherein the efficacy of the word upon the souls of men principally consisteth: and we find <note place="margin">2.</note> in Scripture it exerteth its power in five distinct acts upon the soul; by all which it strikes at the life, and kills the very heart of vain hopes. For,</p>
               <p>First, It hath an awakening efficacy upon secure and sleepy sinners: it rouzes the Conscience, and brings a man to a sense and feeling apprehension, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13, 14. the first effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual jog or touch of the word startles the drousie Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A poor sinner lies in his sins as <hi>Peter</hi> did in his Chains fast asleep, though a Warrant were signed for his Execution the next day: but the Spirit in the word awakens him, as the Angel did <hi>Peter:</hi> and this awakening power of the word is in order both of time and nature antecedent to all its other operations and effects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Law of God hath an enlightning efficacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minds of men: 'tis eye-salve to the blinded eye, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. a light shining in a dark place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. a light shining into the very heart of man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. When the word comes in power, all things appear with another face: the sins that were hid from our eyes, and the danger which was concealed by the policy of Satan from our souls, now lie clear and open before us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The word of God hath a convincing efficacy: it sets sin in order before the soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. as an Army is
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54344:201"/>
drawn up in exact order, so are the sins of nature and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the sins of youth and age, even a great and terrible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is drawn up before the eye of the Conscience; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the word are clear and full, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. the very secrets of a sinners heart are made manifest; his mouth is stopt; his pleas are silenced; his Conscience yields to the charge of guilt, and equity of the sentence of the Law. So that the soul stands mute, and self-condemned at the Bar of Conscience: it hath nothing to say why the wrath of God should not come upon it to the uttermost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Law of God hath a soul-wounding, an heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting efficacy: it pierces into the very soul and spirit of man, Act. 2. 37. <hi>When they heard this, they were pricked at their hearts, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles; Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what shall we do?</hi> A dreadful sound is in the sinners ears, his soul is in deep distress, he knows not which way to turn for ease; no Plaister but the blood of Christ can heal these wounds which the word makes: no outward trouble, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, disgrace or loss ever touched the quick as the word of God doth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The word hath a heart-turning, a soul converting efficacy in it: 'tis a regenerating as well as a convincing word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. The Law wounds, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel cures; the Law discovers the evil that is in sin, and the misery that follows sin: and the Spirit of God working in fellowship with the word effectually turns the heart from sin. And thus we see in what glorious acts, the efficacy of the word discovers it self upon the hearts of men, and all these acts lie in order to each other: for until the soul be awakened it cannot be enlightned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. till it be enlightned it cannot be convinced, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being nothing else, but the application of the light that shines in the mind to the Conscience of a sinner; till it be convinced it cannot be wounded for sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. and until it be wounded for sin, it will never be converted from sin, and brought effectually to Jesus Christ: and thus you see what the power of the word is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the last place, it will concern us to enquire whence the word of God hath all this power; and it is <note place="margin">3.</note> most certain that it is not a power inherent in it self, nor
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54344:202"/>
derived from the instrument by which it is managed; but from the Spirit of the Lord who communicates to it all that power and efficacy which it hath upon our souls.</p>
               <p>First, Its power is not in or from it self: it works not in a <hi>Physical way</hi> as natural agents do; for then the effect would alwayes follow, except it were miraculously hindred: but this spiritual efficacy is in the word, as the healing vertue was in the waters of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> John 5. 4. <hi>An Angel went down at a certain season into the Pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</hi> It is not a power naturally inherent in it at all times, but communicated to it at some special seasons: how often is the word Preached, and no man awaked or convinced by it!</p>
               <p>Secondly, The power of the word is not communicated to it by the instrument that manageth it, 1 Cor. 3. 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing; neither he that watereth.</hi> Ministers are nothing to such an effect and purpose as this is: he doth not mean that they are useless and altogether unnecessary, but insufficient of themselves to produce such mighty effects: it works not as it is the word of man, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may say of the ordinary, as <hi>Peter</hi> said of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effects of the Spirit, Acts 3. 12. <hi>Ye men of Israel why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</hi> If the effects of the word were in the power, and at the command of him that preacheth it, then the blood of all the souls that perish under our Ministry must lye at our door, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly noted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you say whence then hath the word all this power? Our answer is, it derives it all from the Spirit of God, 1 Thes. 2. 13. <hi>For this cause thank we God without ceasing,</hi>

                  <hi>because when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</hi> 'Tis a successful instrument only when it is in the hand of the Spirit, without whose influence it never did, nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, convert or save any soul.

               <p>First, The Spirit hath a glorious soveraignty over the word it self, whose instrument it is, to make it successful or not; as it pleaseth him, Isai. 55. 10, 11. <hi>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth:</hi> as the Clouds so the word is carried and directed by divine pleasure: 'tis the Lord that makes them both give down their blessings, or to pass away fruitless and empty: yea, 'tis from the Spirit that this part of the word works and not another: those things upon which Ministers bestow greatest labour in their preparation, and from which accordingly they have the greatest expectation; these do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when mean time something that dropt occasionally from them, like a chosen Shaft strikes the mark and doth the work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit of the Lord hath a glorious sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the souls wrought upon; 'tis his peculiar work to take away the stony heart out of our flesh, and to give us an heart of flesh, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 36. 26. We may reason, exhort and reprove, but nothing will stick till the Lord set it on. The Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> under <hi>Pauls</hi> ministry: he opens every heart that is effectually opened to receive Christ in the word: if the word can get no entrance, if your hearts remain dead under it still, we may say concerning such souls, as <hi>Martha</hi> did concerning her Brother <hi>Lazarus; Lord if thou hadst been here, my Brother had not died.</hi> So, Lord, if thou hadst been in this Sermon, in this Prayer, or in that counsel, these souls had not remained dead under them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit hath dominion over the times and seasons of conviction and conversion: therefore the day in which souls are wrought upon is called <hi>the day of his power,</hi> Psal. 110. 3. that shall work at one time, which had no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy at all at another time: because this, and not that was the time appointed: and thus you see whence the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives that mighty power it hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:54344:203"/>
Now this word of God when it is set home by the Spirit is mighty to convince, humble and break the hearts of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Joh. 16. 9. <hi>The Spirit when it cometh shall convince the world of sin:</hi> the word signifies conviction by such clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration as compelleth assent: it not only convinces men in general that they are sinners, but it convinceth men parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of their own sins, and the aggravations of them. So in the Text, <hi>sin revived,</hi> that is, the Lord revived his sins, the very circumstances and aggravations with which they were committed: and so it will be with us when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment comes: sins that we had forgotten, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so far back as our youth or childhood; sins that lay slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Consciences, shall now be rouzed up as so many sleepy <hi>Lyons</hi> to affright and terrifie us: for now the soul hears the voice of God in the word, as <hi>Adam</hi> heard it in the cool of the day and was afraid, and hides it self; but all will not do: for the Lord is come in the word: sin is held up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the Conscience in its dreadful aggravations and fearful consequences, as committed against the holy Law, clear light, warnings of Conscience, manifold mercies, Gods long-suffering, Christs precious blood, many warnings of judgements, the wages and demerit whereof by the verdict of a mans own Conscience, is death, eternal death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 9. thus the Commandment comes, sin revives, and vain hopes give up the Ghost.</p>

                     <hi>Is there such a mighty power in the word, then certainly the word is of divine authority:</hi> there cannot be a more clear, and <note place="margin">Inference 1:</note> satisfying proof, that it is no humane invention, than the common sense that all Believers have of the almighty power in which it works upon their hearts: so speaks the Apostle, 1. Thes. 2. 13. <hi>When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the word of God; which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</hi> Can the power of any creature, the word of a meer man, so convince the Conscience, so terrifie the heart, so discover the very secret thoughts of the soul, put a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such tremblings? No, no, a greater than man must needs
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54344:203"/>
be here: none but a God can so open the eyes of the blind, so open the graves of the dead, so quicken and enliven the Conscience that was <unclear>seared</unclear>, so bind over the soul of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the judgement to come, so change and alter the frame and temper of a mans spirit, so powerfully raise, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh and comfort a drooping dying soul. Certainly the power of God is in all this; and if there were no more, yet this alone were sufficient to make full proof of the divine authority of the Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>That no Judgement of God on this side hell is greater than a hard heart, and stupid Conscience under the Word: it were much better that the providence of God should blast thy Estate, take away thy Children, or destroy thy health, than harden thy heart, and seare thy Conscience under the Word. So much as thy soul is better than thy body, so much as Eternity is more valuable than time; so much is this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Judgement more dreadful than all temporal ones: God doth not inflict a more terrible stroke than this upon any men in this world.</p>
                     <p>O therefore as you love your own souls, and are loth to ruine them to all Eternity, attend upon every opportunity that God affords you, for you know not in which of them the

Lord may work upon your hearts: lay aside your prejudices against the Word, or the weaknesses and infirmities of them that preach it: for the Word works not as it is the word of man, as it is thus neat, and elegant, but as it is the Word of God: pray for the blessing of God upon the Word, for except his word of blessing go forth with it, it can never come home to thy soul: meditate upon what you hear; for without meditation it is not like to have any effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual operation upon you. Search your souls by it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether that be not your very case and state which it describes, your very danger whereof it gives warning; take heed lest after you have heard it, the cares of the world choke not what you have heard, and cause those budding convictions which begin to put forth, to blast and wither: carefully attend to all those <hi>Items</hi> and <hi>memorandums</hi> your Consciences give you under the word, and conclude that the Lord is then come nigh unto you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let this be matter of serious consideration and caution to all such as have only felt some slight, transient, <note place="margin">2.</note> and ineffectual operations of the Gospel upon their souls: the Lord hath come nigh some of our souls, we have felt a strange power in the Ordinances, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes transporting our hearts; but alas, it proves but a morning dew, or an early cloud, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 4. we rejoice in the Word, but it is but for a season, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Look as in nature there are many <hi>abortives</hi> as well as perfect Children, so it is in Religion: yea, where the new Creature is perfectly formed in one soul, there be many abortives and miscarriages: and there may be three reasons assigned for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, The Subtilty and deep policy of Satan, who never more effectually deceives and destroys the souls of men, than in such a method, and by such an artifice as this: for when men have once felt their Consciences terrified under the Word, and their hearts at other times ravished with the joyes and comforts of it, they now seem to have attained all that is necessary to conversion, and constitutive of the new Creature: these things look so well like the regenerating effects of the spirit, that many are easily deceived by them. The devil beguiles the hearts of the unwary by such false appearances,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54344:205"/>
for it is not every man that can distinguish betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and spiritual motions of the affections under the word: it is very frequently seen that even carnal and unrenewed hearts have their meltings and transports as well as spiritual hearts. The subject-matter upon which the word treats are the weighty things of the world to come: heaven and hell are very awful and affecting things, and an unrenewed heart is apt to thaw and melt at them; now here is the cheat of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to perswade a man that these must needs be spiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, because the objects about which they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant are spiritual. Whereas it is certain, the object of the affections may be very spiritual and heavenly, and yet the workings of a mans affections about them, may be in a meer natural way.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The dampening efficacy of the world is a true and proper cause of these abortions and miscarriages under the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14. there are hopeful and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing beginnings and budding of affections in some persons, especially in their youth; but when once they come to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the world, how soon are they dampt and quenched! as the cares of a Family grow on, so do the cares of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wear off: 'tis not as it was wont to be, what shall I do to be saved? how shall I get interest in Christ? but what shall I eat and drink, and wherewithal shall I and mine be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Thus earth justles out heaven, and the present world drowns all thoughts of that to come. Good had it been for many men, they had never been engaged so deep in the world as they are: their life is but a constant hurry of business, and a perpetual diversion from Christ, and things that are eternal.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Lastly, The deceitfulness and treachery of the heart, which too easily gives way to the designs of Satan and suffers it self to be imposed upon by him, is not the least cause why so many hopeful beginnings come to nothing, and the effects of the word vanish. Pride and self-love are very apt to over-value every little good, and slight or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue every evil that is in us: and so quickly choaks those convictions that begin to work in our souls.</p>
                     <p>But oh that such men would consider that the dying away of their convictions, is that which threatens the life of their
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54344:206"/>
souls for ever: now is the bud withered, the blossome blasted, and what expectation is there of fruit after this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord revive them again? The Lord open mens eyes to discern the danger of such things as these are, <hi>Jud. ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. Yet I deny not, but there are many stands and pauses in the work of conversion: it seems to dye away, and then revives again; and revive it must or we are lost; but how many are there who never recover it more! This is a sore Judgement of a most terrible consequence to the souls of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, In the last place, Let it be a word of counsel and advice to them upon whom the word works effectually <note place="margin">3.</note> and powerfully: to whose hearts the commandment is come home, to revive sin, and kill their vain hopes: and these are of two sorts.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Embryos</hi> under the first workings of the Spirit.</item>
                        <item>2. Compleat births of the Spirit, regenerated souls.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>First, <hi>Embryos</hi> that are under the first workings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the word. O let it not seem a misery or unhappiness <note place="margin">1.</note> to you that the Commandment is come, and sin revived, and your former hopes overthrown. It must be thus if ever God intend mercy for you. Had you gone on in that dangerous security you were in before, you had certainly been lost for ever: God hath stopt you in that path that leads down to hell, and none that go in there do ever return again, or take hold of the paths of life. O 'tis better to weep, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and be distressed now, than to mourn without hope for ever: let it not trouble you that sin hath found you out; you could never have found out the remedy in Christ, if you had not found out the disease and danger, by the coming of the commandment. And I beseech you carefully to observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the effects and operations of the word upon your hearts be deeper and more powerful than they are found to be in such souls as miscarry under it: the Commandment comes to them, and shews them this or that more gross and startling sin; doth it come to you and shew you not only this or that particular sin, but all the evils of your heart and life? the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54344:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
corruption of your natures, as well as the transgressions of your lives? if so, it promises well, and looks hopefully and comfortably to you. The commandment comes to others and startles them with the fears of damnation for their sin: it puts them into a grievous fright at hell, and the everlasting burnings; but doth it come to thee and discover the infinite evil that is in thy sin, as it is committed against the great, holy, righteous, and good God; and so melts thy heart into tears for the wrong that thou hast done him, as well as the danger into which thou hast brought thy self? This is a hopeful work, and may encourage thee. It comes to others and greatly shakes, but never destroyes and razes the foundation of their vain hopes: if it so revive sin, as to kill all vain hopes, in thee, and shut thee up to Christ, as thy only door of hope, fear not; these troubles will prove the greatest mercies that ever befell thee in this world, if thus they work, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to work upon thy soul.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others there are upon whom the Word hath <note place="margin">2.</note> had its full effect as to Conversion. O bless God for ever for this mercy: you cannot sufficiently value it. God hath not only made it a convincing and wounding, but a converting and healing word to your souls: he hath not only revived your sins, and killed your vain hopes, but begotten you again to a lively hope: see that you be thankful for this mercy. How many have sate under the same word but never felt such effects of it? As Christ said in another case, There were many Widows in <hi>Israel</hi> in the time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> but unto none of them was the Prophet sent save unto <hi>Sarepia</hi> a City of <hi>Sidon</hi> to a certain Widow there, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 46. So I may say in this case, there were many souls in the same Congregation, at the same time; but unto none of them was the word sent with a Commission to convince and save; but such a one as thy self: one as improbable to be wrought upon as any soul there. O let this beget thankfulness in your souls: and let it make you love the word as long as you live. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for by them thou hast quickened me,</hi> Psal. 119. 93.</p>
                     <p>But above all, I beseech you make it appear that the Commandment hath come home to your hearts with power to convince you of the evil of sin, by your tenderness and care
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54344:207"/>
to shun it as long as you live. If ever you have seen the face of sin in the glass of the Law of God, if your hearts have been humbled and broken for it in the dayes of your trouble and distress; certainly you will choose the worst affliction ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sin: it would be the greatest folly in the world to return again to iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 8. you that have seen so much of the evil that is in it, and the danger that follows it; you that have had such inward terrours and fears of Spirit about it, when that terrible representation was made you; will be loth to feel those gripes and distresses of Conscience again, for the best enjoyment in this world.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:54344:209"/>
First, How doth God teach men, or what is imported in <note place="margin">1.</note> our being taught of God? To this I will speak both <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>positively,</hi> for your clearer apprehension of the sense and meaning of the Spirit of God in this phrase.</p>
               <p>First, The teaching of God, and our hearing and learning of him is not to be understood of any extraordinary visional appearances, or <hi>Oraculous</hi> and immediate voice of God to men: God indeed hath so appeared unto some, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 8. such voices have been heard from Heaven: but now these extraordinary wayes are ceased, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. and we are no more to expect them: we may sooner meet with Satanical delusions, than Divine illuminations in this way. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Learned <hi>Gerson</hi> tells us that the Devil once appeared unto an holy man in Prayer, personating Christ, and saying, I am come in Person to visit thee, for thou art worthy: but he with both hands shut his eyes, saying, <hi>nolo hîc Christum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, satis est ipsum in gloria videre, (i. e.)</hi> I will not see Christ here, it is enough for me to see him in glory. We are now to attend only to the voice of the Spirit in the Scriptures: this is a more sure word, than any voice from Heaven, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The teachings of God are not to be understood as opposite unto, or exclusive of the teachings of men. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teachings do not render Ministeral teachings vain or useless. <hi>Paul</hi> was taught of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version had something extraordinary in it, yet the Ministry of <hi>Ananias</hi> was used, and honoured in that work, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, 17. compared. Divine teachings do indeed <hi>excell,</hi> but not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> humane teachings. I know that Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 24. to which Christ here refers, is objected against the necessity of a standing Ministry in the Church, <hi>they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother,</hi> &amp;c. but if those words should be understood absolutely, they would not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all publick Ordinances of Gods own institution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and deprive us of a principal fruit of Christs Ascension, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. but for the same reason would destroy all private instructions, and fraternal admonitions also. Such a sense would make the <hi>Prophet</hi> to contradict the <hi>Apostle;</hi> and spoile the consent and harmony of the Scriptures: the sence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be <hi>negative</hi> but <hi>comparative:</hi> it shews the excellency of Divine, but doth not destroy the usefulness of humane
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54344:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
teachings. <hi>Subordinata non pugnant:</hi> the teachings of men are made effectual by the teachings of the Spirit, and the Spirit in his teachings will use and honour the Ministry of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But to speak positively, the teachings of God are nothing else, but that spiritual and heavenly light, by which the Spirit of God shineth into the hearts of men to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and though this be the proper work of the Spirit, yet it is called the teachings of the Father, because the Spirit who enlightens us is commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated, and sent by the Father so to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. Now these teachings of the Spirit of God consist in two things, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>First, In his Sanctifying impressions, or regenerating works upon the soul, by vertue whereof it receives marvellous light and insight in spiritual things: and that not only as illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the first act of the spirit in our conversion, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. but as his whole work of sanctification is Illuminative and instructive to the converted soul, 1 Joh. 2. 27. <hi>the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you:</hi> the meaning is, that Sanctification gives the soul experience of those Mysterious things which are contained in the Scriptures, and that experien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the most excellent key to unlock, and open those deep Scripture Mysteries: no knowledge is so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, so clear, so sweet, as that which the heart communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to the head, Joh. 7. 17. <hi>if any man do his will, he shall know the doctrine:</hi> a man that never read the nature of love in books of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> nor the transports and ecstasies thereof in History, may yet truly describe and express it by the sensible motions of that passion in his own soul: yea, he that hath felt, much better understands, than he that hath only read or heard. O what a light doth spiritual sense and experience cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great part of the Scriptures! for indeed sanctification is the very copy or transcript of the Word of God upon
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54344:210"/>
the heart of man, Jer. 31. 33. <hi>I will write my Law in their heart:</hi> so that the Scriptures, and the experiences of believers by this means answer to each other as the lines and letters in the Press, answer to the impressions made upon the paper: or the figures in the <hi>wax</hi> to the engravings in the <hi>Seal.</hi> When a Sanctified man reads <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms,</hi> or <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> how is he surprised with wonder to find the very workings of his own heart so exactly decyphered, and fully expressed there! Oh saith he, this is my very case: these holy men speak what my very heart hath felt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit of God teacheth us, as by his sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying impressions; so by his gracious assistances which he gives us <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as our need requires, Matth. 10. 19. <hi>it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak:</hi> Joh. 14. 26. <hi>he shall bring all things to your remembrance:</hi> he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth both the understanding in due apprehensions of truth, and the heart in the spiritual improvements of truth: and so much briefly of the first particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, we are to enquire what those special truths are which believers hear, and learn of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">2.</note> when they come to Christ.</p>
               <p>And there are divers great and necessary truths wherein the Spirit enlightens men in that day. I cannot say they are all taught every believer in the same degree, and order: but it is certain they are taught of God such lessons as these are, which they never so understood before.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Lesson 1.</head>
                  <p>First, They are taught of God, <hi>that there is abundantly more evil in their sinful natures and actions, than ever they discerned or understood before: the Spirit when he cometh shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of sin,</hi> John 16. 8, 9. Men have a general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin before: so had <hi>Paul</hi> when a Pharisee, but how vastly different were his apprehensions of sin, from all that ever he had in his natural state, when God brought home the Commandment to his very heart! There is a threefold knowledge of Sin, viz. <hi>Traditional, discursive,</hi> and <hi>intuitive.</hi> The First is in the more rude and illiterate multitude. The Second, in more rational and knowing men. The Third
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54344:210"/>
is only found in those that are enlightned, and taught of God: and there is as great a difference betwixt this intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge of sin whereby God makes a soul to discern the nature and evil of it in a spiritual light, and the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; as there is betwixt the sight of a <hi>painted Lyon</hi> upon the wall, and the sight of a <hi>living Lyon</hi> that meets us roaring in the way. The intuitive sight of sin is another thing than men imagine it to be: 'tis such a sight as wounds a man to the very heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. for God doth not only shew a man this or that particular sin, but in the day of conviction he sets all his sins in order before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. yea, the Lord shews him the sinfulness of his nature, as well as practice. Conviction diggs to the root, shews and layes open that original corruption from whence the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evils of the life do spring, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. and which is yet more, the Lord shews the man whom he is bringing to Christ the sinful and miserable state which he is in by reason of both: <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. and now all excuses, pleas, and defences of sin are gone: he shews them <hi>how their iniquities have exceeded,</hi> Job 36. 8, 9. exceeded in number, and in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of sinfulness; exceeding many, and exceeding vile; no such sinner in the world as I: can such sins as mine be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? the greatness of God greatens my sin, the holiness of God makes it beyond measure vile: the goodness of God puts unconceivable weight into my guilt. O can there be mercy with God for such a wretch as I? if there be, then there will not be a greater example of the riches of free grace in all the world than I am: thus God teacheth the evil of sin.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Lesson 2.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God teacheth the soul whom he is bringing to Christ, what that wrath and misery is which hangs over it in the threatnings because of sin.</hi> Scripture threatnings were formerly slighted, now the soul trembles at them: they once apprehended themselves safe enough, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. they thought because they heard no more of their sins after the Commission of them, that therefore they should never hear more, that the effect had been as transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54344:211"/>
a thing as the act of sin was, or if trouble must follow sin, they should speed no worse than others; the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the world being in the same case: and beside, they hoped to find God more merciful, than sowre and precise preachers represented him; but when a light from God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the soul to discover the nature of God and of sin; then it sees that whatever wrath is treasured up for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the dreadful threatnings of the Law, is but the just demerit of sin, the recompence that is meet: <hi>the wages of sin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. ult. the <hi>penal</hi> evil of damnation is but equal to the <hi>moral</hi> evil of sin: So that in the whole Ocean of Gods eternal wrath there is not one drop of injustice: yea, the soul doth not only see the Justice of God in its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation, but the wonderful mercy of God in the suspension thereof so long. O what is it that hath withheld God from damning me all this while! how is it that I am not in hell! Now do the fears and awful apprehensions of eternity seize the soul, and the worst of sensitive creatures is supposed to be in a better condition than such a soul: never do men tremble at the threatnings of God, nor rightly apprehend the danger of their condition, until sin and wrath and the wages of sin be discovered to them by a light from heaven.</p>

                  <head>Lesson 3.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God teaches the soul whom he brings to Christ that deliverance from sin and wrath to come is the greatest, and most important business it hath to do in this world,</hi> Acts 16. 30. <hi>what must I do to be saved? q. d.</hi> O direct me to some effectual way (if there be any) to secure my poor wretched soul from the wrath of God. Sin and the wrath that follows it are things that swallow up the souls, and drink up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry spirit of men: their thoughts never conversed with things of more confessed truth, and awful solemnity: these things float not upon their fancies as matters of meer speculation, but settle upon their hearts day and night as the deepest concernment in all the world: they now know much better than any meer Scholar, the deep sense of that Text, Matth. 16. 26. <hi>what is a man profited, if he shall gain</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:54344:211"/>
                     <hi>the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Five things shew how weighty the thoughts and cares of salvation are upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>First, Their continual thoughtfulness and solicitude about these things: if earthly affairs divert them for a while, yet they are still returning again to this solemn business.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their careful redeeming of time, and saving the very moments thereof to employ about this work: those that were prodigal of hours and dayes before, look upon every moment of time as a precious and valuable thing now.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their fears and tremblings lest they should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and come short at last, shew how much their hearts are set upon this work.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Their inquisitiveness and readiness to embrace all the help and assistance that they can get from others, evidently discovers this to be their great design.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, The little notice they take of all other troubles and afflictions tells you their hearts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about greater things. This is the third Lesson they are taught of God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>Lesson 4.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Lord teaches the soul that is coming to Christ, that though it be their duty to strive to the uttermost for salvation; yet all strivings in their own strength are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to obtain it.</hi> This work is quite above the power of nature: <hi>'tis not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but of God that sheweth mercy:</hi> the soul is brought to a full Conviction of this, by the discovery of the heinous nature of sin, and of the rigour and severity of the Law of God: no repentance, nor reformation can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly amount unto a just satisfaction, nor are they within the compass and power of our will. It was a saying that Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> often used to his friends, speaking about the power of mans will, he would lay his hand upon his breast and say, <hi>every man hath something here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the</hi> Arminian <hi>doctrine;</hi> this fully takes off the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54344:212"/>
soul from all expectations of deliverance that way: it cannot but strive, that is its duty; but to expect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance as the purchase of its own strivings, that would be its sin.</p>

               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>Lesson 5.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The soul that is coming to Christ by faith is taught of God, that though the case it is in be sad, yet it is not despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and remediless;</hi> there is a door of hope, a way of escape for poor sinners, how black and fearful soever their own thoughts and apprehensions are. There is usually at this time a dawning light of hope in the soul that is under the fathers teachings, and this commonly arises from the general and indefinite incouragements and promises of the Gospel: which though they do not presently secure the soul from danger, yet they prop and mightily support it against despair; for though they be not certain that deliverance shall be the event of their trouble, yet the possibilities, and much more the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of deliverance are a great stay to the sinking soul: the troubled soul cannot but acknowledge it self to be in a far better case than the damned are, whose hopes are perished from the Lord, and a death-pang of despair hath seised their Consciences: and herein the merciful and compassionate nature of God is eminently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in haftening to open the door of hope almost as soon as the evil of sin is opened: it was not long after <hi>Adams</hi> eyes were opened to see his misery, that God opened Christ his remedy in that first promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and the same method of grace is still continued to his Elect off-spring, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. these supporting hopes the Lord sees necessary to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage industry in the use of means: 'tis hope that sets all the world awork: if all hope were cut off, every soul would sit down in a sullen despair yielding it self for hell.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord teaches those that come to Christ, that there is a fulness of saving power in him, whereby any soul that duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him may be perfectly delivered from all its sin and misery, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. this is a great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary point for every Believer to learn and hear from the Father: for unless the soul be satisfied of the fulness of Christs saving power, it will never move forward towards him: and herein also the goodness of God is most sweetly and seasonably manifested; for at this time 'tis the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Satan to fill the soul with despairing thoughts of a pardon: but all those black and heart-sinking thoughts va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish before the discovery of Christs alsufficiency. Now the sin-sick soul saith with that woman, Mat. 9. 21. <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his Garment, I shall be healed:</hi> how deep so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the guilt and stain of sin be, yet the soul which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the infinite dignity of the blood of Christ, the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up to God in our room, and Gods declared satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in it; must needs be satisfied that Christ is <hi>able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him,</hi> which is the sixth Lesson Believers are taught of God.</p>

                  <p>Every man that cometh to Christ is taught of God, <hi>that it can never reap any benefit by the blood of Christ, except he have union with the person of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. Time was when men fondly thought nothing was necessary to their salvation but the death of Christ; but now the Lord shews them that their union with Christ by faith is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the place of an <hi>applying cause,</hi> as the death of Christ is in the place of a <hi>meritorious cause:</hi> the <hi>purchase</hi> of salvation is an act of Christ <hi>without us</hi> whilst we are yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the <hi>application</hi> thereof is by a work wrought <hi>within us,</hi> when we are believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. In the purchase all the elect are redeemed together by way of price. In the application they are actually redeemed man by man by way of power. Look as the sin of the first <hi>Adam</hi> could never hurt us, unless

he had been our head by way of generation: so the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ can never benefit us, unless he be our head in the way of regeneration. In teaching this Lesson the Lord in mercy unteaches and blots out that dangerous principle by which the greatest part of the Christianized world do perish, <hi>viz.</hi> that the death of Christ is in it self effectual to salvation, though a man be never regenerated or united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by saving faith.</p>

                     <hi>God teaches the soul whom he is bringing to Christ, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is necessary to be wrought in us, or done by us in order to our union with Christ, is to be obtained from him in the way of prayer,</hi> Ezek. 36. 37.</p>
                  <p>And it is observable that the soul no sooner comes under the effectual teachings of God, but the spirit of prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to breath in it, Acts 9. 8. <hi>behold he prayeth:</hi> those that were taught to pray by men before, are now taught of the Lord to pray; to pray did I say? yea, and to pray fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, as men concerned for their eternal happiness: to pray not only with others, but to pour out their souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in secret; for their hearts are as bottles full of new wine, which must vent or break. Now the soul returns upon its God often in the same day; now it can express its burthens and wants in words and groans which the spirit teacheth: they pray and will not give over praying till Christ come with compleat salvation.</p>

Sins that were profitable and pleasant, as the right hand, and right eye, must now be cut off. Companions in sin, who were once the delight of their lives, must now be cast off.

                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>All that come unto Christ are taught of God that there is such a beauty and excellency in the wayes and people of God as is not to be matcht in the whole world, Psal.</hi> 16. 3. When the eyes of strangers to Christ begin to be opened and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his knowledge, you may see what a change of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wrought in them with respect to the people of God, and towards them especially, whom God hath any way made instrumental for the good of their souls, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. they then called the spouse of Christ, <hi>the fairest among women:</hi> the convincing holiness of the Bride then began to enamour and affect them with a desire of nearer conjunction and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>we will seek him with thee; with thee,</hi> that hast <hi>so charged us;</hi> that hast taken so much pains for the good of our souls: now, and never before, the righteous appeareth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than his Neighbour. Change of heart is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with change of judgement, with respect to the people of God: thus the <hi>Jaylor, Act.</hi> 16. 33. washed the <hi>Apostles</hi> stripes, to whom he had been so cruel before. The godly now seem to be the glory of the places where they live: and the glory of any place seems to be darkned by their removal. As one said of holy Mr. <hi>Barrington, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Town is not at home, when Mr.</hi> Barrington <hi>is out of Town:</hi> they esteem it a choice mercy to be in their company, and acquaintance, Zech. 8. 23. <hi>we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you:</hi> no people like the people of God now: as one said when he heard of two faithful friends, <hi>utinam tertius essem,</hi> O that I might make the third!

                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>All that come to Christ are taught of God, that whatever difficulties they apprehend in Religion, yet they must not upon pain of damnation be discouraged thereby, or return back again to sin.</hi> Luke 9. 62. <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God:</hi> plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work is hard work: a strong and steady hand is required for it: he that plows must keep on, and make no balks of the hardest and toughest ground he meets with. Religion also is the running of a Race, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. there is no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still, much less turning back if ever we hope to win the prize.</p>
                  <p>The Devil indeed labours every way to discourage and daunt the soul, by representing the insuperable difficulties of Religion to it; and young beginners are but too apt to be discouraged, and fall under despondency: but the teachings of the Father are encouraging teachings: they are carried on from strength to strength against all the oppositions they meet from without them, and the many discouragements they find within them: to this conclusion they are brought by the teaching of God, <hi>we must have Christ, we must get a pardon, we must strive for salvation, let the difficulties, troubles and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in the way be never so great or many.</hi> As he said, <hi>necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam:</hi> 'tis necessary that I go on, 'tis not necessary that I live: so saith the soul that is taught of God; 'tis easier with me to dispense with ease, honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; yea, with life it self, than to part with Christ and the hopes of eternal life.</p>

                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>They that come to Christ are taught of God, that whatever guilt and unworthiness they discover in themselves, and whatever fears and doubts hang upon their hearts as to pardon and</hi>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:54344:214"/>
                     <hi>acceptance; yet as the case stands it is their wisdom and great interest to venture themselves in the way of faith upon Jesus Christ, whatever the issue thereof be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three great discouragements are usually found upon the hearts of those that come to Christ in the way of faith.</p>
                  <p>First, The sensible greatness of guilt and sin, how can I go to Christ that am in such a case, that have been so vile a wretch? and here measuring the grace and mercy of Chris by what it finds in it self, or in other creatures, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 19. the soul is ready to sink under the weight of its own discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and misgiving thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The sense they have of their own weakness, and inability to do what God requires, and must of necessity be done, if ever they be saved: my heart is harder than an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, how can I break it? My will is stubborn and exceeding obstinate, I am no way able to bow it; the frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of my spirit is altogether carnal and earthly; and it is not in the power of my hand to alter and change it: alas I cannot subdue any one corruption, nor perform one spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duty, nor bear one of those sufferings and burthens which religion lays upon all that follow Christ: this also proves a great discouragement in the way of faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And which is more than all, the soul that is coming to Jesus Christ, hath no assurance of acceptance with him, if it should adventure himself upon him: 'tis a great hazard, a great adventure; 'tis much more probable (if I look to my self) that Christ will shut the door of mercy against me.</p>
                  <p>But under all these discouragements the soul learns this Lesson from God, that as ungodly as it is, as weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as it is, as full of fears and doubts as it is: nevertheless it is every way its great duty and concernment to go on in the way of faith, and make that great adventure of it self upon Jesus Christ: and of this the Lord convinceth the soul by two things.</p>

                  <p>First, The soul seeth an absolute necessity of coming; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:54344:215"/>
is laid upon it, there is no other way, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 12. God hath shut it up by a blessed necessity to this only dore of escape, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. damnation lies in the neglect of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. The soul hath no choice in this case, Angels, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, duties, repentance, reformation cannot save me, Christ, and none but Christ can deliver me from present guilt and the wrath to come: why do I dispute, demur, delay, when certain ruine must inevitably follow the neglect or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of Gospel offers?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord sheweth those that are under his teaching the probabilities of mercy for their encouragement in the way of believing: and these probabilities the soul is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to gather from the general and free invitations of the Gospel, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 1, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. from the conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 18. from the vast extent of grace beyond all the thoughts and hopes of creatures, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. from the incouraging examples of other sinners who have found mercy in as bad condition as they, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11. from the Command of God which warrants the action, and answers all the objections of unworthiness and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them that come to Christ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. and lastly, from the sensible changes already made upon the temper and frame of the heart. Time was when I had no sense of sin, nor sorrow for sin; no desires after Christ, nor heart to duties; but it is not so with me now. I now see the evil of sin, so as I never saw it before; my heart is now broken in the sense of that evil: my desires begin to be enflamed after Jesus Christ. I am not at rest, nor where I would be, till I am in secret mourning after the Lord Jesus. Surely these are the dawnings of the day of mercy: let me go on in this way; it saith as the Lepers at the siege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>King,</hi> 7. 3, 4. If I stay here I perish, if I go to Christ, I can but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. Hence Believers bear up against all objected discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>certum exitium commutemus incerto,</hi> 'tis the dictate of wisdom, the vote of reason; to exchange a certain for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ruine. And thus you have heard what those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lessons are which all that come to Christ are taught by the Father.</p>

1. What are the Properties of divine teachings.</item>
                     <item>2. What influence they have in bringing souls to Christ.</item>
                     <item>3. Why it is impossible for any man to come to Christ without these teachings of the Father.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, what are the properties of divine teachings. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the teachings of God we affirm in general that though <note place="margin">1.</note> they exclude not, yet they vastly differ from all humane teachings: as the <hi>power</hi> of God, in <hi>effecting</hi> transcends, all humane power, so the wisdom of God in <hi>teaching</hi> transcends all humane <hi>wisdom.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>First, God teacheth <hi>powerfully:</hi> he speaketh to the soul with a strong hand; when the word comes accompanied with the Spirit, 'tis mighty through God, to cast down all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Now the Gospel <hi>comes not in word only</hi> (as it was wont to do) <hi>but in power,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 4, 5. a power that makes the soul fall flat before it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that God is in that word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the teachings of God are <hi>sweet teachings.</hi> Men never relish the sweetness of a truth, till they learn it from God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. His name is as an Oyntment poured forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. his mouth is most sweet. O how powerfully, and how sweetly doth the voyce of God slide into the heart of a poor melting sinner! how jejune, dry, and tastless are all the discourses of men, compared with the teachings of the Father!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God teacheth <hi>plainly and clearly,</hi> he not only opens truths to the understanding, but he openeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding also to perceive them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. In that day the vaile is taken away from the heart: a light shineth into the soul: a clear beam from heaven is darted into the mind, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 45. Divine teachings are fully satisfying: the soul doubts no more, staggers and hesitates no more; but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesces</hi> in that which God teaches: 'tis so satisfied that it can venture all upon the truth of what it hath learnt from God, as that <hi>Martyr</hi> said, <hi>I cannot dispute, but I can dye for Christ.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The teachings of God are <hi>infallible teachings,</hi> the wisest and holiest of men may mistake, and lead others into the same mistakes with themselves; but it is not so in the teachings of God: if we can be sure that God teacheth
<pb facs="tcp:54344:216"/>
us, we may be as sure of the truth of what he teacheth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r his spirit <hi>guideth us into all truth, Joh.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>. and into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The teachings of God are <hi>abiding teachings,</hi> they make everlasting impressions upon the soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 98. <hi>they are ever with it:</hi> the words of men vanish from us; but the words of God stick by us: what God teacheth he writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. and that will abide: <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera scripta manet.</hi> 'Tis usual with souls whose understandings have been opened by the Lord, many years afterward to say, I shall never forget such a scripture that once convinced me, such a promise that once encouraged me.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The teachings of God are <hi>saving teachings,</hi> they make the soul wise unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. There is a great deal of other knowledge that goes to hell with men: the pavement of hell (as one speaks) is pitched with the sculs of many great <hi>Scholars,</hi> but eternal life is in the teachings of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is eternal life to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> This is deservedly stiled the light of life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 12. in this light we shall see light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 9.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The teachings of God make their own way into the dullest and weakest capacities, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 4. <hi>The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly:</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Christ said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>I thank thee O father Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:</hi> 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to see what clear illumination some poor illiterate Christians have in the mysteries of Christ and Salvation, which others of great abilities, deep and searching heads can never discover with all their learning and study.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, To conclude, the teachings of God are <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teachings,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. they change the soul into the same image: God casts them whom he teacheth into the very mould of those truths which they learn from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. These are the teachings of God, and thus he instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth those that come to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next let us see what influences divine teachings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have upon souls in bringing them to Christ: and we shall find <note place="margin">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> a threefold influence in them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:54344:217"/>
1. They have an influence upon the external means by which they come to Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. They have influence upon the mind to remove what hindered it from Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. They have influence upon the will to allure and draw it to Christ.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, They have influence upon the <hi>means</hi> by which we come to Christ: the best ordinances are but a dead letter, except the spirit, the teaching and quickening spirit of God work in fellowship with them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. The best Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters like the Disciples cast forth the Net, but take nothing, win not one soul to God, till God teach as well as they. <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing and <hi>Apollo</hi> nothing, but God that giveth the increase, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. Let the most learned, eloquent and powerful Orator be in the Pulpit, yet no mans heart is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded till it hears the voice of God; <hi>cathedram in coelis habet qui corda docet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They have influence upon the <hi>mind</hi> to remove what hindered it from Christ; except the minds of men be first untaught those errors by which they are prejudiced against Christ, they will never be perswaded to come unto him: and nothing but the Fathers teachings can unteach those errors, and cure those evils of the mind: the natural mind of man slights the truths of God untill God teach them; and then they tremble with an awful reverence of them. Sin is but a trifle till God shews us the face of it in the glass of the Law, and then it appears <hi>exceeding sinful, Rom.</hi> 7. 13. We think God to be such a one as our selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. until he discover himself unto us in his infinite greatness, awful holiness, and severe Justice; and then we cry, who can stand before this great and dreadful God! We thought it was time enough hereafter to mind the concernments of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, untill the Lord open our eyes, to see in what danger we stand upon the very brink of eternity; and then nothing scares us more than the fears that our time will be finished before the great work of Salvation be finished. We thought our selves in a converted State before, till God make us to see the necessity of another manner of conversation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of eternal damnation. We readily caught hold upon
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54344:217"/>
the promises before, when we had no right to them; but the teachings of God make the presumptuous sinner let go his hold, that he may take a better and surer hold of them in Christ. We once thought that the death of Christ in it self had been enough to secure our Salvation; but under the teachings of God, we discern plainly the necessity of a change of heart and state; or else the blood of Christ can never profit us. Thus the teachings of God remove the errors of the mind by which men are withheld from Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The teachings of God powerfully attract and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure the will of a sinner to Christ, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 14. But of these drawings of the father I have largely spoken before, and therefore shall say no more of it in this place, but hasten to the last thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, why it is impossible for any man to come to Christ without the Fathers teachings: and the impossibilities hereof will appear three ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From the power of sin.</item>
                  <item>2. From the indisposition of man.</item>
                  <item>3. From the nature of faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>By all which the Last point designed to be spoken to from this Scripture will be fully cleared, and the whole prepared for application.</p>
               <p>First, The impossibility of coming to Christ without the teachings of the Father will appear from the power of sin, which hath so strong an holdfast upon the hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of all unregenerate men, that no humane argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or perswasions whatsoever can divorce or separate them; for</p>
               <p>First, sin is connatural with the soul, 'tis born and bred with a man: <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 8. It is as natural for fallen man to sin as it is to breath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The power of sin hath been strengthening it self from the beginning, by a long continued Custom, which gives it the force of a second nature; and makes regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and mortification naturally impossible. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 23. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? Then may he also do good that is accustomed to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:54344:218"/>
Thirdly, Sin is the delight of the sinner: <hi>it is a sport to a fool to do mischief, Prov.</hi> 10. 23. Carnal men have no other pleasure in this world, but what arises from their Lusts: to cut off their corruptions by mortification, were at once to deprive them of all the pleasure of their lives.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, sin being connatural, customary, and delightful, doth therefore bewitch their affections and inchant their hearts to that degree of madness and fascination; that they rather choose damnation by God, than separation from sin: <hi>their hearts are fully set in them to do evil, Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. they rush into sin, as the <hi>horse rusheth into the battle, Jer.</hi> 8. 6. And now what think you can separate a man from his beloved Lust, except the powerful and effectual teachings of God? Nothing but a light from heaven can rectifie and reduce the inchanted mind, no power but that of God can change and alter the sinful bent and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the will, 'tis a task above all Creature power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The impossibility of coming to Christ without the Fathers teachings evidently appears from the <hi>indisposed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of man, the subject of this change: <hi>the natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the things which are of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Three things must be wrought upon man, before ever he can come to Christ: his blind understanding must be enlightned; his hard and rocky heart must be broken, and melted; his stiff, fixed and obstinate will must be conquered, and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but all these are the effects of a supernatural power. The illumination of the mind is the peculiar work of God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. The breaking and melting of the heart is the Lords own work; 'tis he that giveth repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. 'Tis the Lord, that <hi>takes away the heart of stone, and giveth an heart of flesh, Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. 'tis he that poureth out the spirit of contrition upon man, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. The changing of the natural bent and inclination of the will is the Lords sole prerogative, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. all these things are effectually done in the soul of man when God teacheth it, and never till then.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The nature of faith by which we come to Christ plainly shows the impossibility of coming without the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teaching. Everything in faith is supernatural: the implantation of the <hi>habit</hi> of faith is so, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. 'tis not
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54344:218"/>
of our selves but the gift of God: 'tis not an habit <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> by industry, but <hi>infused</hi> by grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. The <hi>light</hi> of faith by which spiritual things are discerned is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. 27. It seeth things that are invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The <hi>adventures</hi> of faith are supernatural; for <hi>against hope, a man</hi> believeth <hi>in hope giving glory to God, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. By faith a man goeth unto Christ against all the dictates and discouragements of natural sense and reason. The <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal</hi> of faith is supernatural: the cutting off of the right hand, and plucking out of right eye sins must needs be so, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29. The <hi>Victories</hi> and conquests of faith do all speak it to be supernatural; it overcomes the strongest oppositions from without, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33, 34. it subdueth and purgeth the most obstinate and deep rooted corruptions within, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. it overcometh all the blandishments, and charming allurements of the bewitching world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. all which considered, how evident is the conclusion, that none can come to Christ without the Fathers teachings? The uses follow.</p>

The reason hereof is plainly given us by Christ in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>To you it is given to know the mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, but to them it is not given:</hi> 'tis the droppings and dews of divine teaching upon one, and not upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that dryeth up the green tree, and maketh the dry tree to flourish. Many natural men have very fine brains, searching wits, solid judgements, nimble fancies, tenacious memories: they can search out the mysteries of nature, solve the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> satisfie the enquiries of the most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: they can measure the earth, discover the motions of the heavens; but after all take up their place in Hell: When in the mean time <hi>the Statutes of the Lord</hi> (by the help of his teachings) <hi>make wise the simple, Psal.</hi> 19. 17. 'Tis no matter how dull and incapable the Scholar be, if God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to be the teacher. I remember <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of one who was commonly reputed a fool, and yet he could not but judge him to be truly godly; and that by two signs of grace which appeared in him: one was his seriousness when he heard any discourses of Christ, the other was his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation manifested against sin: it was truly said by those two <hi>Cardinals</hi> (who riding to the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> overheard a poor shepherd in the fields, with tears bewailing his sin) <hi>surgunt indocti &amp; rapient coelum:</hi> the unlearned will rise and take heaven, whilest we with all our learning shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into Hell.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>This also informs us of the true reason of the strange and various successes of the Gospel upon the souls of men:</hi> here we see why <note place="margin">Inference 3.</note> the ministry of one man becomes fruitful, and anothers bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: Yea, why the labours of the same man prosper exceedingly at one time, and not at another: these things are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the teachings of God do accompany our teachings: we often see a weaker and plainer discourse blessed with success, whilst that which is more artificial, neat, and laboured comes to nothing. St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath a pretty similitude to illustrate this, Suppose (saith he) two <hi>Conduits,</hi> the one very plain, the other curiously carved and adorned with images of Lyons, Eagles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the water doth not refresh and nourish
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54344:219"/>
as it cometh from such a curious <hi>Conduit;</hi> but as it is water. Where we find most of man, we frequently find least of God. I speak not this to encourage carelesness and laziness, but to provoke the dispensers of the Gospel to more earnestness; and servent prayer for the assistance and blessing of the Spirit upon their labours; and to make men less fond of their own gifts and abilities: blear-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> may bear Children, when beautiful <hi>Rachel</hi> proves barren.</p>

Let no man therefore be deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the want of those gifts with which unsanctified men are adorned. If God have taught thee the evil of sin, the worth of Christ, the necessity of Regeneration, the mystery of faith, the way of communion with God in duties; trouble not thy self because of thine ignorance in natural or moral things: thou hast that, Reader, which will bring thee to Heaven: and he is a truly wise man that knows the way of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he be ignorant and unskilful in other things: thou knowest that which all the learned <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Libraries</hi> in the world could never teach thee, but God hath revealed them to thee: others have more <hi>science,</hi> thou hast more <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and sweetness: bless God and be not discouraged.</p>

Let not the question be mistaken, I do not ask what Books you have read, what Ministers you have heard, what stock of natural or speculative knowledge you have acquired: but the question is, whether ever God spake to your hearts, and hath effectually taught you such

                  <p>First, To those that never yet heard the voice of God speaking to their hearts: and truly this is the general case of most men and women in the professing world: they have heard the sound of the Gospel, but it hath been a confused, empty and ineffectual sound in their ears: we have heard the voice of man, but have never yet heard the voice of God: the gifts and abilities of Preachers have in a notional and meer humane way improved their understandings, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slightly touched their affections: all this is but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of man upon man. O that you would look for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is beyond all this: satisfie not your selves with what is meerly natural, and humane in ordinances; come to the word with higher ends and more spiritual designs, than to get some notions of truth which you had not before, or to judge the gifts and abilities of the speaker: if God speak not to your hearts, all the Ordinances in the world can do you no good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. O remember what a solemn and awful
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54344:221"/>
thing it is to come to those Ordinances, and attend upon that Ministration in and by which the eternal decrees of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are to be executed upon your souls, which must be to you the <hi>savour of life unto life, or of death unto death;</hi> wrastle with God by prayer for a blessing upon the Ordinances. Say, Lord, speak thy self to my heart, let me hear thy voice, and feel thy power in this Prayer, or in this Sermon: others have heard thy voice, cause me to hear it: it had been much better for me if I had never heard the voice of Preachers, except I hear thy voice in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let all those that have heard the voice of God, and are come to Christ in the vertue of his teachings, admire the wonderful condescension of God to them. O that God should speak to thy soul and be silent to others! there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands living at this day under Ordinances, to whom the Lord hath not given an ear to hear, or an heart to obey, Deut. 29. 4. <hi>To you it is given to know the mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, but to them it is not given,</hi> Mat. 13. 11. and I beseech you walk as men and women that have been taught of God. When <hi>Satan</hi> and your corruptions tempt you to sin, and to walk in the wayes of the carnal and careless world; remember then that Scripture, Eph. 4. 20, 21. <hi>But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus.</hi> To conclude, see that you be exceeding humble and lowly in Spirit: humility qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies you for divine teachings, Psal. 25. 9. <hi>The humble he will teach: and the more ye are taught of God, the more humble you will still be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you see that no man can come to Christ without the <hi>application of the Law,</hi> and <hi>the teachings of the Father:</hi> which being considered, may be very useful to convince us (which indeed is the design of it) that among the multitudes of men and women, living under the Ordinances of God, and the general profession of Religion; there are but few, very few to be found, who have effectually received the Lord Jesus Christ by saving faith.</p>
                  <p>And now, Reader, I suppose by this time thou art desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know by what signs and evidences thy union with Christ by faith may be cleared up and made evident to thee: and how that great question whether thou hast yet effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:54344:222"/>
applied Christ to thy soul or no may be clearly decided, which brings me to the third general Use of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>THe Apostle in this Chapter is engaged in a very trying Discourse: his scope is to discriminate the spirits and states of sincere Believers, from meerly nominal and pretended Christians; which he attempts not to do by any thing that is external, but by the internal effects and operations of the Spirit of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts. His enquiry is not into those things which men profess, or about the duties which they perform, but about the frames and tempers of their hearts, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by which they are acted in religion. According to this Test he puts Believers upon the search and study of their own hearts: calls them to reflect upon the effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit of God wrought within their own souls: assuring them that those gracious effects and fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their hearts will be a solid evidence unto them of their union with Jesus Christ; amounting to much more than a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:54344:223"/>
general conjectural ground of hope, under which it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there may <hi>subesse falsum</hi> lurk a dangerous and fatal mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: but the gracious effects of the Spirit of God within them, are a foundation upon which they may build the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and assurance of their union with Christ: <hi>hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us.</hi> In which words we have three things to consider.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, The thing to be tried, which indeed is the greatest <note place="margin">1.</note> and weightiest matter that can be brought to tryal in this world or in that to come, namely our union with Christ, expressed here by <hi>his abiding in us,</hi> a phrase clearly expressing the difference betwixt those that by profession and common estimation pass for Christians among men, though they have no other union with Christ, but by an <hi>external adhesion</hi> to him in the outside duties of Religion: and those whose uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ is real, vital and permanent, by the indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of Christ in their souls. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5, 6. opens the force and importance of this phrase, <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him; the same bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruit: if a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered:</hi> the thing then to be tried, is whether we stand in Christ as dead branches in a living stock, which are only bound to it by external ligatures or bonds that hold them for a while together: or whether our souls have a vital union and coalition with Christ by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the living sap of that blessed root.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The trial of this union, which is by the <hi>giving of the Spirit to us:</hi> the Spirit of Christ is the very bond of Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and our souls. I mean not that the very person of the Spirit dwelleth in us, imparting his <hi>essential properties</hi> to us: it were a rude blasphemy so to speak; but his saving influences are communicated to us in the way of sanctifying operations: as the Sun is said to come into the House, when his beams and comforting influences come there. Nor yet must, we think that the graces or influences of the Spirit abide in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54344:223"/>
us in the self same measure and manner as they do in Christ: <hi>for God giveth not the spirit to him by measure:</hi> in him all fullness dwells: he is anointed with the Spirit above his fellows: but there are measures and proportions of grace differently communicated to Believers by the same Spirit: and these communicated graces and real operations of the Spirit of grace in our hearts, do undoubtedly prove the reality of our union with Christ; as the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the self-same vital juice or sap of the stock to the branch whereby it lives, and brings forth fruit of the same kind, certainly proves it to be a real part or member of the same tree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Which brings us to the third thing; namely the certainty of the trial this way, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this, or <hi>by this we know:</hi> we so know that we cannot be deceived. To clear this, let us consider two things in grace,
<table>
                  <row>
                     <cell rows="2">viz.</cell>
                     <cell>1. Somewhat <hi>Constitutive</hi>

                     <cell rows="2">of its being.</cell>

                     <cell>2. Somewhat <hi>Manifestative</hi>
                     </cell>
                  </row>
               </table>
            </p>
            <p>There is something in grace which is essential and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive</hi> of its being: and somewhat that flows from grace, and is <hi>manifestative</hi> of such a being: we cannot immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intuitively discern the essence of grace as it is in its simple nature. So God only discerns it, who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it: but we may discern it <hi>mediately</hi> and <hi>secondarily</hi> by the effects and operations of it. Could we see the simple es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of grace, or intuitively discern our union with Christ, our knowledge would be <hi>demonstrative, à priori ad posterius,</hi> by seeing the effects as they are lodged in their cause: but we come to know the being of grace, and the reality of our union with Christ, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> by ascending in our knowledge from the effects and operations, to their true cause and being.</p>
            <p>And accordingly God hath furnished us with a power of self-intuition and reflection: whereby we are able to turn in upon our own hearts and make a judgement upon our selves, and upon our own acts. The soul hath not only a power to <hi>project,</hi> but a power also to <hi>reflect</hi> upon its own actions: not
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54344:224"/>
only to put forth a <hi>direct act</hi> of faith upon Jesus Christ, but to judge and discern that act also: 2 Tim. 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed:</hi> and this is the way in which believers attain their certainty and knowledge of their Union with Christ: from hence the Observation will be,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That interest in Christ may be certainly gathered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the gift of the spirit to us: no man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>hath seen God at any time: if we love one another, God dwelleth in us; and his love is perfected in us: hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 12, 13. The being of God is invisible, but the operations of his Spirit in believers are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and discernable. The souls union with Christ is a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural mystery, yet is it discoverable by the effects thereof, which are very perceptible in and by believers. Two things require Explication, and Confirmation in the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of this point.</p>

               </list>
               <p>First, As to the importance of this phrase we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">1.</note> what is meant by the Spirit, and what by the giving of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now the Spirit is taken in Scripture two wayes.</p>
               <list>
                  <label>viz.</label>
                  <item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In the first sence it is put for the God-head, 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Justified in the Spirit,</hi> (i. e.) by the power of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which raised him from the dead. In the second sense it denotes the third person, or subsistence in the glorious and blessed Trinity, and to him this word <hi>Spirit</hi> is attributed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>properly</hi> in the sence before mentioned, as denoting his <hi>personality;</hi> at other times <hi>metonymically,</hi> and then it is put for
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54344:224"/>
the effects, fruits, graces, and gifts of the Spirit, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by him unto men: Eph. 5. 11. <hi>be ye filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now the fruits or gifts of the Spirit are either,
<list>
                     <item>1. Common, and assisting gifts, or</item>
                     <item>2. Special, and sanctifying gifts.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the last sence and signification, it must be taken in this place: for as to the common, assisting and ministring gifts of the Spirit, they are bestowed promiscuously upon one as well as another. Such gifts in an excellent degree, and large measure are found in the unregenerate, and therefore can never amount to a solid evidence of the souls union with Christ: but his special sanctifying gifts being the proper effect and consequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of that Union, must needs strongly prove and confirm it. In this sense therefore we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>the Spirit</hi> in this place: and by giving the spirit to us we are to understand more than the <hi>coming of the spirit upon us:</hi> the spirit of God is said to come upon men in a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way, for their present assistance in some particular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; though in themselves they be unsanctified persons: thus <hi>the spirit of God came upon Balaam,</hi> Numb. 24. 2. enabling him to prophesie of things to come; and although those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of the spirit be now ceased, yet the spirit ceaseth not to give his ordinary assistances unto men, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and unregenerate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10, 31. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but whatever gifts he gives to others, he is said to <hi>be given, to dwell,</hi> and <hi>to abide</hi> only in believers, 1 Cor. 3. 16. <hi>know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> an expression denoting both his special propriety in them, and gracious familiarity with them: there is a great difference betwixt the <hi>assisting</hi> and the <hi>indwelling</hi> of the spirit: the one is <hi>transient,</hi> the other <hi>permanent.</hi> That is a good rule the Schoolmen give us, <hi>illa tantum dicuntur inesse, quae insunt per modum quietis:</hi> those things are only said to be in a man, which are in him by way of rest, and permanency, and so the spirit is in believers: therefore they are said <hi>to live in the spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. to be <hi>led by the spirit,</hi> ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. to <hi>be in the spirit,</hi> and the spirit to dwell in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And so
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54344:225"/>
much of the first thing to be opened, <hi>viz.</hi> what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by the giving of the spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire and satisfie <note place="margin">2.</note> our selves, how this giving of the spirit evidently proves, and strongly concludes that souls interest in Christ unto whom he is given: and this will evidently appear by the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these five particulars.</p>
               <p>First, The spirit of God in believers is the very <hi>bond</hi> by which they are united unto Christ: if therefore we find in our selves the bond of union, we may warrantably conclude that we have union with Jesus Christ: this is evidently held forth in those words of Christ: Joh. 17. 22, 23. <hi>The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me:</hi> 'tis the glory of Christs humane nature to be united to the God-head: this glory (said Christ) thou gavest me, and the glory thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest me I have given them <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by me they are united unto thee: and how this is done he sheweth us more particularly, <hi>I in them:</hi> there is Christ in us, viz. <hi>mystically;</hi> and <hi>thou in me</hi> there is God in Christ, viz. <hi>Hypostatically:</hi> so that in Christ God and believers meet in a blessed union: 'tis Christs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be one with God: 'tis our glory to be one with Christ, and with God by him: but how is this done? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no other way but by the giving of his Spirit unto us: for so much that phrase <hi>I in them</hi> must needs import: Christ is in us by the sanctifying spirit which is the <hi>bond</hi> of our union with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture every where makes this giving or indwelling of the spirit the great mark and tryal of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Christ; concluding from the presence of it in us, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively</hi> as in the Text; and from the absence of it, <hi>negatively,</hi> as in Rom. 8. 9. <hi>now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his;</hi> Jude ver. 19. <hi>sensual, not having the spirit;</hi> this mark therefore agreeing to all believers, and to none but believers; and that alwayes, and at all times: it must needs clearly inferr the souls union with Christ in whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is found.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:54344:225"/>
Thirdly, That which is a certain mark of our freedom from the Covenant of works, and our title to the priviledges of the Covenant of grace, must needs also inferr our Union with Christ, and special interest in him: but the giving or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the sanctifying spirit in us, is a certain mark of our freedom from the <hi>first Covenant</hi> under which all Christless persons still stand; and our title to the special priviledges of the <hi>second Covenant</hi> in which none but the members of Christ are interested: and consequently it fully proves our Union with the Lord Jesus. This is plain from the <hi>Apostles</hi> reasoning, Gal. 4. 6, 7. <hi>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba father: wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</hi> The spirit of the first Covenant was a servile spirit, a spirit of fear and bondage, and they that were under that Covenant were not <hi>Sons</hi> but <hi>Servants;</hi> but the Spirit of the New Covenant is a free, ingenuous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, acting in the strength of God, and those that do so are the Children of God: and Children inherit the blessed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and royal immunities contained in that great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Covenant of Grace; they are <hi>heirs of God,</hi> and the evidence of this their inheritance by vertue of the second Covenant, and of their freedom from the servitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the first Covenant, is <hi>the spirit of Christ in their hearts crying Abba father:</hi> So Gal. 5. 18. <hi>if ye be led by the spirit ye are not under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the eternal decree of Gods electing love be executed, and the vertues and benefits of the death of Christ applyed by the spirit, unto every soul in whom he dwelleth as a spirit of sanctification; then such a giving of the spirit unto us must needs be a certain mark and proof of our special interest in Christ: but the decree of Gods elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love is executed, and the benefits of the blood of Christ are applyed unto every soul in whom he dwelleth as a spirit of sanctification. This is plain from 1 Pet. 1. 2. <hi>Elect accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foreknowledge of God the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:</hi> where you see both Gods election executed, and the blood of Jesus sprinkled or applyed unto us by the spirit, which is given to us as a spirit of sanctification. There is a blessed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:54344:226"/>
order of working observed as proper to each person in the Godhead: the Father electeth, the Son redeemeth, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sanctifieth. The spirit is the last efficient in the work of our salvation: what the Father decreed, and the Son pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, that the Spirit applyeth; and so puts the last hand to the compleat salvation of believers. And this some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> give as the reason why the sin against the spirit is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, because he being the last agent in order of working, if the heart of a man be filled with enmity against the spirit, there can be no remedy for such a sin: there is no looking back to the death of Christ, or to the Love of God for remedy: this sin against the spirit is that <hi>obex infernalis</hi> the deadly stop and bar to the whole work of salvation: oppositely, where the spirit is received, obeyed, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the way of sanctification; into that soul the eternal love of God, and inestimable benefits of the blood of Christ run freely without stop or interruption; and consequently the interest of such a soul in Jesus Christ is beyond all dispute.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The giving of the spirit to us, or his residing in us as a sanctifying spirit, is every where in Scripture made the pledge and earnest of eternal salvation, and consequently must abundantly confirm and prove the souls interest in Christ: Eph. 1. 13, 14. <hi>In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise; which is the earnest of our inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. So 2 Cor. 1. 22. <hi>who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.</hi> And thus you have the point opened and confirmed. The Use of all followeth.</p>

and drive you to God daily for the increase of knowledge: one drop of such knowledge of Christ and your selves as this, is more worth than a Sea of humane, moral, unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and speculative knowledge: though you know but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet that little being sanctified is of great value: though you know but little, time was when ye knew nothing of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, or the state of your own souls.

                     <p>First, Consider, whether this be not the ground of your <note place="margin">Sol.</note> fear and doubting, because you are fain to take pains in the way of meditation, prayer, and other duties to bring your hearts to sense and savour the things of God: whereas, it may be you expect your spiritual enlargements and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts should flow in upon you spontaneously, and drop from heaven immediately of their own accord; without any pains or industry of yours: here may be, (and probably is) a great mistake in this matter; for the spirit of God works in the natural method, wherein affections use to be raised; and makes use of such duties as meditation and prayer as instruments to do that work by, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 37. So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>David</hi> was forced to reason with, and chide his own heart: <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5. thy comfort and enlargement may nevertheless be the fruit of the spirit, because God makes it spring up, and grow upon thy duties.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take this as a sure rule, whatsoever rises from self alwayes aimes at and terminates in self: this stream cannot be carryed higher than the fountain, if therefore thy aim and end in striving for affections and enlargements in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be only to win applause from men, and appear to be what in reality thou art not, this indeed is the fruit of nature,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:54344:232"/>
and a very corrupt and hypocritical nature too; but if thy heart be not melted, or desire to be melted in the sense of the evil of sin in order to the farther mortification of it; and under the apprehensions of the free grace and mercy of God in the pardon of sin, in order to the engaging of thy soul more firmly to him: if these or such like be thy ends and designs, or be promoted and furthered by thine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements and spiritual comforts, never reject them as the meer fruits of nature; a carnal root cannot bring forth such fruits as these.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Contrary, Spiritual deadness, and indisposed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note> to duties, and to those especially which are more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, spiritual, and self-denying than others, is the ground upon which many thousand souls who are yet truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, do doubt the indwelling of the spirit in them. O saith such a soul, if the spirit of God be in me, Why is it thus? Could my heart be so dead, so backward, and averse to spiritual duties? no, no, these things would be my meat, and my drink; the delights and pleasures of my life.</p>
                     <p>First, These things indeed are very sad, and argue thy <note place="margin">Sol.</note> heart to be out of frame; as the body is when it cannot relish the most desireable meats, or drinks: but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will be <hi>how</hi> thy soul behaves it self in such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Qui bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Secondly, Know also that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt spiritual <hi>death,</hi> and spiritual <hi>deadness:</hi> the former is the <hi>state</hi> of the unregenerate; the latter is the <hi>disease</hi> and complaint of many thousand regenerate souls: If <hi>David</hi> had not felt it as well as thee, he would never have cryed out nine times in the compass of one <hi>Psalm, Quicken me, quicken me.</hi> Besides,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though it be <hi>often,</hi> it is not <hi>alwayes</hi> so with thee: there are seasons wherein the Lord breaks in upon
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:54344:232"/>
thy heart, enlarges thy affections; and sets thy soul at liberty: to which times thou wilt do well to have an eye, in these dark and cloudy dayes.</p>
                     <p>But the Spirit of God is a <hi>comforter</hi> as well as a <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> he doth not only enable men to believe, but after they believe he also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seals them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. but I walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and am a stranger to the sealing, and comforting work of the spirit: how therefore can I imagine the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God should dwell in me, who go from day to day in the bitterness of my soul, mourning as without the Sun?</p>
                     <p>There is a twofold sealing, and a twofold comfort: the <note place="margin">Sol.</note> spirit sealeth both <hi>objectively</hi> in the work of sanctification, and <hi>formally</hi> in giving clear evidence of that work: thou mayest be sealed in the first, whilest thou art not yet sealed in the second sense: if so, thy condition is safe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be at present uncomfortable. And as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that also is of two sorts, viz. <hi>seminal,</hi> or <hi>actual:</hi> in the root, or in the fruit: <hi>light is sown for the righteous,</hi> Psal. 97. 11. though the harvest to reap and gather in that Joy and Comfort be not yet come; and there are many other wayes beside that of joy and comfort, whereby the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the spirit may evidence it self in thy soul: if he do not enable thee to rejoyce, yet if he enable thee sincerely to mourn for sin; if he do not enlarge thy heart in Comfort, yet if he humble and purge thy heart by sorrows; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thee the <hi>assurance of faith,</hi> and yet give thee <hi>the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of faith,</hi> thou hast no reason to call in question, or deny the indwelling of the spirit in thee for that cause.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>they that walk in the spirit do not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Obj. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lusts of the flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 16. but I find my self entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and frequently overcome by them, therefore I doubt the spirit of God is not in me.</p>
                     <p>'Tis possible the ground of your doubting may be your <note place="margin">Sol.</note> mistake of the true sense and meaning of that Scripture: it is not the Apostles meaning in that place that sin in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers doth not work, tempt, and oftentimes overcome, and captivate them: for then he would contradict himself in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. where he thus complains, <hi>but I see another Law in my members warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of sin which is in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi>
                        <pb n="424" facs="tcp:54344:233"/>
but two things are meant by that expression, <hi>you shall not fulfil the Lusts of the flesh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, That the principle of grace will give cheque to sin in its first motions, and cause it to miscarry in the womb like an untimely birth, before it comes to its full maturity: it shall never be able to gain the full consent of the will as it doth in the unregenerate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if notwithstanding all the opposition grace makes to hinder the birth, or commission of it, it do yet prevail, and break forth into act; yet such acts of sin as they are not committed without <hi>regret,</hi> so they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with <hi>shame, sorrow,</hi> and true <hi>repentance:</hi> and those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry surprizals, and captivities of sin at one time, are made cautions, and warnings to prevent it at another time: if it be so with thee, thou dost not fulfill the Lusts of the flesh.</p>
                     <p>And now Reader, upon the whole; if upon examination of thy heart by these rules, the Lord shall help thee to discern the saving work of his spirit upon thy soul, and thereby thine interest in Christ, what a happy man or woman art thou! what pleasure will arise to thy soul from such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery! Look upon the frame of thine heart <hi>absolutely</hi> as it is in it self at present, or <hi>comparatively</hi> with what once it was and others still are, and thou wilt find enough to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and melt thy heart within thee: certainly this is the most glorious piece of Workmanship that ever God wrought in the world upon any man: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. the spirit of God is come down from heaven, and hath hallowed thy soul to be a Temple for himself to dwell in: as he hath said, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 16. Moreover this gift of the spirit is a sure pledge, and earnest of thy future glory: time was when there was no such work upon thy soul, and considering the frame and temper of it, the total aversation, strong opposition, and rooted enmity that was in it; it is the wonder of wonders that ever such a work as this should be wrought upon such an heart as thine: that ever the spirit of God whose nature is pure and perfect holiness, should choose such an unclean, pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, abominable heart to frame an habitation for himself
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54344:233"/>
there to dwell in: to say of thy soul (now his spiritual <hi>Temple)</hi> as he once said of the material <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Psal. 132. 13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath chosen it, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it for his habitation; this is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it.</hi> O what hath God done for thy soul!</p>
                     <p>Think Reader, and think again; are there not many thousands in the world of more ingenuous, sweet, and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposition than thy self, whom yet the spirit of God passeth by, and leaveth them as Tabernacles for <hi>Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </epigraph>
            <p>YOU have seen one tryal of an interest in Christ in our last discourse, namely by the donation of the Spirit: we have here another Tryal of the same matter, from one of the greatest, and most noble effects of the Spirit upon our souls; namely, his work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, or <hi>new creation: if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> scope in the immediate context is to disswade Christians from a carnal, sinful partiality, in their respects to men: not to dispense them after the manner of the world, according to the external diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but the real internal worth and excellency that is in men. This the Apostle presses by two arguments; one drawn from the end of Christs death, <hi>verse</hi> 15. which was to take us off from those selfish designs, and carnal ends by which the world is swayed. Secondly, from the <hi>new spirit</hi> by which believers are acted: they that are in Christ, are to judge
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54344:234"/>
and measure all things by a new rule: <hi>if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature: old things are passed away:</hi> q. d. we have done with that low selfish spirit of the world which was wholly governed by Carnal interest; we are now to judge by a new rule, to be acted from a new principle, aim at a new, and more noble end: <hi>behold all things are become new.</hi> In these words we have three general parts to be distinctly considered.</p>

                     </item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, We have here the great question to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Whether a man be in Christ? a question upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination <note place="margin">1.</note> whereof we must stand or fall for ever: by <hi>[be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christ]</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not here mean the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity which gives a man the <hi>reputation</hi> of an interest in him: but by being in Christ he means an interest in him by <hi>vital union</hi> with his person, and real parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his benefits: now this is the question to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, the matter to be tryed, than which nothing can be more solemn, and important in the whole world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The rule by which this great question may be <note place="margin">2.</note> determined, viz. <hi>The new Creation: if any man be in Christ he is a new Creature:</hi> by this rule all the titles and claims made to Christ in the professing world are to be examined <hi>[if any man]</hi> be he what he will, high, or low; great, or small; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or illiterate; young, or old; if he pretend interest in Christ: this is the standard by which he must be tryed: if he be in Christ, he is <hi>a new Creature;</hi> and if he be not a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he is not in <hi>Christ:</hi> let his endowments, gifts, confidence, and reputation be what it will be: <hi>[a new Creature]</hi> not new <hi>Physically,</hi> he is the same person he was, but a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, a creature renewed by gracious principles newly infused into him from above, which sway him and guide him in another manner, and to another end than ever he acted before: and these gracious principles not being educed
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:54344:235"/>
out of any thing which was preexistent in man, but infused <hi>de novo,</hi> from above, are therefore called in this place, a <hi>new Creature:</hi> this is the rule by which our claim to Christ must be determined.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This general rule is here more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>old things are passed away, behold all things are become new:</hi> he satisfies not himself to lay down this rule <hi>concisely,</hi> or express it in general terms by telling us the man in Christ must be a new Creature, but more particularly, he shews us what this new creature is, and what the parts thereof are, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>By old things he means all those carnal principles, self ends, fleshly lusts belonging to the carnal state, or the old man: all these are <hi>passed away;</hi> not simply, and perfectly, but only in <note place="margin">Non simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectè, sed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim re, partim spe. <hi>Estius in loc.</hi>
               </note> part at present, and wholly in hope, and expectation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So much briefly of the privative part of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>old things are passed away:</hi> a word or two must be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>positive part, all things are become new.</hi> He means not that the old faculties of the soul are abolished, and new ones created in their room: but as our bodies may be said to be new bodies by reason of their new endowments, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities super-induced and bestowed upon them in their resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; so our souls are now renewed by the infusion of new gracious principles into them in the work of regeneration. These two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>privative</hi> part, the passing away of old things; and the <hi>positive</hi> part, the renewing of all things, do betwixt them comprize the whole nature of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in other Scriptures is expressed by equivalent phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: sometimes by putting off the old, and putting on the new man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. sometimes by dying unto sin, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. which is the self-same thing the Apostle here intends by the passing away of old things, and making all things new: and because this is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, glorious, and admirable work of the spirit which is or can be wrought upon man in this world; therefore the Apostle asserts it with an <hi>Ecce,</hi> a note of special remarque and observation, <hi>behold all things are become new, q. d.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:54344:235"/>
and admire this surprizing marvellous change which God hath made upon men: they are come out of darkness into his marvellous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. out of the old, as it were, into a new world, <hi>behold all things are become new.</hi>

                  <item>6. And then Apply the whole in the proper uses of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, Why the regenerating work of the spirit is called a <note place="margin">1.</note> new Creation: this must be our first enquiry: and doubtless the reason of this appellation is the <hi>Analogy,</hi> proportion, and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:54344:236"/>
similitude which is found betwixt the work of regeneration, and Gods work in the first Creation: and their agreement, and proportion will be found in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, The same Almighty Author who created the world, createth also this work of grace in the soul of man, 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ:</hi> the same powerful word which created the natural, createth also the spiritual light: it is equally absurd for any man to say, I make my self <note place="margin">Minus el, te fecisse homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam sanctum.</note> to repent, or to believe, as it is to say, I made my self to exist and be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The first thing that God created in the natural world was light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. and the first thing which God createth in the new Creation is the light of spiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Col. 3. 10. <hi>And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that Created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Creation is out of nothing: it requires no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent matter: it doth not bring one thing out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but something out of nothing: it gives a being to that which before had no being. So it is also in the new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 1 Pet. 2. 9, 10. <hi>who hath called you out of darkness, into his marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy:</hi> the work of grace is not educed out of the power, and principles of nature; but is a pure work of creation. The heathen <hi>Philosophers</hi> could neither understand, nor acknowledge the creation of the world, because that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was repugnant to this maxime of reason, <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> out of nothing, nothing can be made: thus did they <hi>insanire cum ratione,</hi> befool themselves with their own reasonings: and after the same manner some great pretenders to reason among us, voting it an absurdity to affirm, that the work of grace is not virtually, and potentially contained in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the new Creation in the old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was the vertue, and efficacy of the spirit of God which gave the natural world its being by Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. the spirit of God moved upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; it hovered over the <hi>chaos;</hi> as the wings of a bird do over her eggs, as the same word is rendred, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54344:236"/>
cherishing as it were by incubation, that rude mass by a secret quickening influence, by which it drew all the Creatures into their several forms, and particular natures. So it is in the new Creation: a quickning influence must come from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or else the new creature can never be formed in us, Joh. 3. 8. <hi>So is every one that is born of the Spirit:</hi> and ver. 6. <hi>that which is born of the spirit is spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The word of God was the instrument of the first creation, Psal. 33. 6, 9. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth: for he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast:</hi> the word of God is also the instrument of the new Creation or work of Grace in man, 1 Pet. 1. 23. <hi>Being born again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible; by the word of God which liveth, and abideth for ever.</hi> So James 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will beg at he us, with the word of truth: of his own will,</hi> that was the <hi>impulsive cause;</hi> with the <hi>word of truth,</hi> that is the <hi>instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cause:</hi> great respect and honour, love and delight is due to the word upon this account, that it is the instrument of our regeneration, or new Creation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The same power which created the world, still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-props and supports it in its being: the world owes its conservation, as well as its existence to the power of God, without which it could not subsist one moment. Just so it is with the new Creation, which entirely depends upon the preserving power which first formed it, Jude ver. 1. <hi>Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Christ Jesus;</hi> and 1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Who were kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation:</hi> as in a natural way <hi>we live, move, and have our being in God,</hi> Acts 17. 28. so in a spiritual way, we continue believing, repenting, loving, and delighting in God; without whose continued influence upon our souls we could do neither.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In a word, God surveyed the first Creation with complacence and great delight: he beheld the work of his hands and approved them as very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. so is it also in the second creation; nothing pleaseth, and delights God more than the works of grace in the souls of his people: it is not any outward priviledge of nature, or gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which commends any man to God: <hi>circumcision is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but a new creature,</hi> Gal. 6. 15.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54344:237"/>
And thus you see, upon what grounds the work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in man is stiled a new Creature, which was the first thing to be opened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next we must enquire in what respects every soul that is in Christ is renewed, or made a new Creature: <note place="margin">2.</note> and here we shall find a threefold renovation of every man that is in Christ, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

               </list>
               <p>First, He is renewed in his state and condition, for he passeth from <hi>death to life, in his</hi> Justification, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, he is now Justified freely by grace through the redemption which is in Christ: he was under the curse of the first Covenant; he is under the blessing of the new Covenant: he was afar off, but is now made nigh unto God: an alien, a stranger once, now of the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12, 13. O blessed change from a sad, to a sweet and comfortable condition! <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every man in Christ is renewed in his frame, and constitution: all the faculties and affections of his soul are renewed by regeneration: his <hi>understanding</hi> was dark, but now is light in the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. his <hi>conscience</hi> was dead and secure, or full of guilt and horrour; but is now become tender, watchful, and full of peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. his <hi>will</hi> was rebellious, stubborn, and inflexible; but is now made obedient, and complying with the will of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 2. his <hi>desires</hi> did once pant, and spend themselves in the pursuit of vanities, now they are set upon God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 8. his <hi>Love</hi> did fondly dote upon ensnaring earthly objects, now it is swallowed up in the infinite excellencies of God, and Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. his <hi>joy</hi> was once in trifles, and things of nought; now his rejoycing is in Christ Jesus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. his <hi>fears</hi> once were versant about noxious creatures, now God is the object of the fear of <hi>reverence, Act.</hi> 9. 31. and sin the object of the fear of <hi>caution,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. his <hi>hopes</hi> and expectations were only from the world present, but now, from that to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. Thus the soul in its faculties, and affections is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:54344:237"/>
which being done, the members and senses of the body must needs be destinated, and imployed by it in new services: no more to be the weapons of unrighteousness, but instruments of service to Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. and thus all that are in Christ are renewed in their frame and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The man in Christ is renewed in his practice and <hi>Conversation:</hi> the manner of operation alwayes follows the nature of beings: now the regenerate not being what they were, cannot walk and act, as once they did: Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were once dead in trespasses and sins; wherein ye walked according to the course of this world,</hi> &amp;c. they were carryed away like water by the strength of the tyde, by the influence of their own corrupt natures, and the customes and examples of the world: but the case is now altered. So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. the Apostle shews believers their old companions in sin, and tells them <hi>such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> the world is now well altered with you, thanks be to the grace of God for it. This wonderful change of practice which is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and remarkable in all the regenerate, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately consequent to their conversion, sets the world a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at them: 1 Pet. 4. 4. <hi>Wherein they think it strange that</hi>

                  <hi>you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</hi> they think it strange, the word signifies to stand at gaze, as the hen doth which hath brooded, and hatched <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge Eggs,</hi> when she seeth the <hi>Chickens</hi> which she hath brought forth, take the wing and fly away from her: thus do the men of the world stand amazed to see their old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in sin, whose language once was vain, and earthly; it may be prophane, and filthy; now to be praying, speaking of God, Heaven, and things spiritual; having no more to do with them as to sin, except by way of reprehension and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: this amazes the world, and makes them look with a strange admiring eye upon the people of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the next place let us enquire into the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">3.</note> and qualities of this new creature, and shew you as we are able what they are: yet Reader, expect not here an exact and accurate account of that which is so great a mystery: for if questions may be moved about a silly fly, which may puzzle
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54344:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the greatest <hi>Philosopher</hi> to resolve them: how much more may we conceive this great and marvellous work of God, the most mysterious, and admirable of all his works, to surmount the understandings of the most illuminated Christians? O how little do we know of the nature, properties, and operations of this new Creature! so far as God hath revealed it to our weak understandings, we may speak of it. And</p>
               <p>First, The Scripture speaks of it as a thing of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be conceived by man: Joh. 3. 8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the spirit.</hi> The original of winds is a question of great difficulty in <hi>Philosophy:</hi> we hear the voice of the wind, feel its mighty force, and behold its strange effects; but neither know whence it comes, or whither it goes: ask a man, Do you hear the wind blow? yes: do you feel it blow? yes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sensibly: do you see the effects of it rending and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the trees? yes, very plainly: but can you describe its nature, or declare its original? no, that is a mystery which I do not understand: why fo; Just so it is with him that is born of the spirit: the holy spirit of God, whose nature and operations we understand but little of, comes from heaven, quickens, and influences our souls, beats down and mortifies our lusts by his almighty power: these effects of the spirit in us we experimentally feel, and sensibly discern; but how the spirit of God first entred into, and quickned our souls, and produced this new creature in them, we understand little more of it, than how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with Child, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 5. Therefore is the life of the new creature called a hidden life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. the nature of that life is not only hidden totally from all carnal men, but in a very great measure it is an hidden and unknown life unto spiritual men, though themselves be the subjects of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But though this life of the new Creature be a great mystery, and secret in some respects, yet so far as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

admirable <hi>Artist,</hi> upon the soul of man: holiness is the beauty and glory of God: and in holiness the new creature is created after Gods own image, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. the regenerate soul hereby becomes holy, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. not <hi>essentially</hi> holy as God is, nor yet <hi>efficiently</hi> holy: for the regenerate soul can neither make it self, nor others holy: but the life of the new creature may be said to resemble the life of God in this, that as God lives to himself, so the new creature wholly lives to God: as God loves holiness, and hates the contrary, so doth the new creature: 'tis in these things formed <hi>after the image of him that created it:</hi> when God creates this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the soul of man, we are said then to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. so that there can be nothing communicated unto men, which beautifies and adorns their souls as this new creation doth: men do not resemble God as they are noble, and as they are rich, but as they are holy: no gift, no endowment of nature imbelishes the soul, as this new creature doth: an awful Majesty sits upon the brow of the new creature, commanding the greatest, and worst of men to do homage to it, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. yea such is the beauty of the new creature that Christ its <hi>Author</hi> is also its <hi>admirer:</hi> Cant. 4. 9. <hi>Thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, This New Creature is created in man upon the highest design that ever any work of God was wrought: the end of its creation and infusion is high and noble: Salvation to the soul in which it is wrought: this is both the <hi>finis operis,</hi> and the <hi>finis operantis:</hi> it is the design both of the work, and of the workman that wrought it: when we receive the end of our faith, we receive the salvation of our souls. Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the end faith: as death is the end of sin, so life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is the end of grace. The new creature doth by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and steady direction of its own nature, take its course as directly to God, and to heaven the place of his full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Rivers do to the Ocean: it declares it self to be made for God, by its restless workings after him: and as salvation is the end of the new creature, so it is the express design and end of him that created it: 2 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God:</hi> by this workmanship of his upon our souls he is now polishing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54344:239"/>
and <hi>making them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The new Creation is the most necessary work that ever God wrought upon the soul of man: the eternal well-being of his soul depends upon it; and without it no man shall see God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3, 5. <hi>Except ye be regenerate, and born again, ye cannot see the Kingdom of God:</hi> can you be saved without Christ? you know you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: can you have interest in Christ without the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? my Text expressly tells you it can never be: <hi>for if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.</hi> O Reader, what ever slight thoughts of this matter, and with what a careless and unconcerned eye soever thou readest these lines; yet know thou must either be a new creature, or a miserable and damned creature for ever. If civility without the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could save thee, why are not the <hi>moral Heathens</hi> saved also? if strictness of life without the new creature could save thee, why did it not save the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees</hi> also? if an high profession of Religion without the new creature can save thee, why did it not save <hi>Judas, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus</hi> also? Nothing is more evident than this, that no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, obedience, self-denyal, prayers, tears, reformations, or ordinances without the new creation avail any thing to the salvation of thy soul: the very blood of Christ himself without the new creature never did, and never will save any man. Oh how necessary a work is the new creation! cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision avails nothing, and uncircumcision nothing, but a new creature.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The new Creature is a marvellous and wonderful creature: there are many wonders in the first creation: the works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 2. but there are no wonders in nature, like those in grace: is it not the greatest wonder that ever was seen in the world (except the incarnation of the Son of God) to see the nature, and temper of man, so altered and changed as it is by grace: to see <hi>Lascivious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Ephesians</hi> become mortified and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Christians: to see a fierce and cruel <hi>persecutor,</hi> become a glorious <hi>confessor</hi> and sufferer for Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. to see the carnal-mind of man which was lately fully set in a strong bent
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:54344:239"/>
to the world, to be wholly taken off from its lusts, and set upon things that are spiritual and heavenly: certainly it was not a greater miracle to see dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> come out of his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi> than it is to see the dead and carnal mind coming out of its Lusts, to embrace Jesus Christ. It was not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonder to see the dead dry bones in the vally to move, and come together, than it is to see a dead soul moving after God, and moving to Christ in the way of faith.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The new creature is an <hi>immortal creature,</hi> a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that shall never see death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. it is in the soul of man a well of water, springing up into eternal life. I will not adventure to say it is immortal in its own nature, for it is but a creature, as my Text calls it, and we know that essential interminability is the incommunicable property of God: the new creature hath both a beginning, and successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore might also have an end, as to any thing in it self, or its own nature: experience also shews us that it is capable both of increasing and decreasing; and may be brought nigh unto death: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. the works of the spirit in believers <hi>may be ready to dye:</hi> but though its perpetuity flow not out of its own <hi>nature,</hi> it flows out of Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and promises; which make it an immortal Creature: when all other excellencies in man go away, as at death they will, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 21. this excellency only remains: our gifts may leave us, our friends leave us, our estates leave us, but our graces will never leave us: they ascend with the soul (in which they inhere) into glory, when the stroke of death separates it from the body.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The new Creature is an <hi>heavenly creature: 'tis not born of flesh, nor of blood, or of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 13. its descent and original is heavenly, it is spirit born of spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6. its center is heaven, and thither are all its tendencies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 8. its proper food on which it lives are heavenly things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. it cannot feed as other creatures do upon earthly things: the object of all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and loves is in heaven, Psal. 73. 26. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> the hopes and expectations of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are all from heaven: it looks for little in this world, but waits for the coming of the Lord: the life of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon earth is a life of patient waiting for Christ: his
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54344:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
desires and longings are after Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. The flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed lingers and would delay, but the new creature hastens and would fain be gone: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. it is not at home while it is here; it came from Heaven and cannot be quiet nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the soul in which it dwells to be so until it comes thither again.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The new creature is an <hi>active</hi> and laborious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: no sooner it is born, but it is acting in the soul, Acts 9. 6. <hi>behold he prayeth;</hi> activity is its very nature, Gal. 5. 25. <hi>If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit.</hi> Nor is it to be admired that it should be always active and stirring in the soul, seeing activity in obedience was the very end for which it was created, <hi>for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2. 10. and he that is acted in the duties of Religion by this principle of the new creature or nature, will (so far as that principle acts him) delight to do the will of God; rejoice in the way of his Commandments; and find the sweetest pleasure in the paths of duty.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The new creature is a <hi>thriving creature,</hi> growing from strength to strength, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. and changing the soul in which it is subjected from glory unto glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. The vigorous tendencies and constant strivings of this new creature is to attain its just perfection and maturity; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11. it can endure no stints and limits to its desires short of perfection: every degree of strength it attains, doth but whet and sharpen his desires after higher degrees: upon this account it greatly delights in the Ordinances of God, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion and Society of the Saints; as they are helps and improvements to it in order to its great design.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The new creature is <hi>a creature of wonderful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations:</hi> there are many wonders of divine providences in <note place="margin">Gratia nec totaliter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittitur, nec finaliter amittitur: actus omitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, habitus non amittitur: actio perverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, fides no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which its being in us was wont to be discovered, may be, and often are darkned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. and the soul in which it is may draw very sad conclusions about the issue and event; concluding its life not only to be hazarded but quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10, 11, 12. but though it be ready to dye, God wonderfully preserves it from death: it hath as well its reviving as its fainting seasons: and thus you see what are the lovely and eximious properties of the new creature: In the next place,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We will demonstrate the <hi>necessity</hi> of this new creation to all that are in Christ, and by him expect to attain <note place="margin">4.</note> salvation: and the necessity of the new creature will appear divers ways.</p>
               <p>First, From the positive and express will of God revealed in Scripture touching this matter: search the Scriptures and you shall find God hath laid the whole stress and weight of your eternal happiness by Jesus Christ upon this work of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in your souls. So our Saviour tells <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 3. 5. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water, and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> agreeable whereunto are those words of the Apostle, Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.</hi> And whereas some may think that their birth right priviledges, injoyment of Ordinances and profession of Religion may commend them to Gods acceptance without this new creation; he shews them how fond and ungrounded all such hopes are, Gal. 6. 15. <hi>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature:</hi> Christ and Heaven are the gifts of God, and he is at liberty to bestow them upon what terms and conditions he pleaseth: and this is the way, the only way and stated method in which he will bring men by Christ unto glory: men may raze out the impressions of these things from their own hearts, but they can never alter the setled course and method of Salvation: either we must be new creatures, as the precepts of the word command us, or lost and damned creatures as the threatnings of the word plainly tell us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This new Creation is the inchoative part of that great Salvation which we expect through Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without this all hopes and expectations of Salvation must
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54344:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vanish: Salvation and renovation are inseparably connected. Our glory in Heaven, if we rightly understand its nature, consisteth in two things; namely our assimilation to God, and our fruition of God: and both these take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and rise from our renovation in this world: here we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be changed into his Image in some degree, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. for the new man is created <hi>after God,</hi> as was opened above. In the work of grace God is said <hi>to begin that good work</hi> which is to be <hi>finished</hi> or consummated in the day of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. Now nothing can be more irrational than to imagine that ever that design or work should be finished and perfected which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a beginning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, So necessary is the new creation to all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect salvation by Christ, that without this Heaven would be no Heaven, and the glory thereof no glory to us, by reason of the unsuitableness and aversation of our carnal minds thereunto: <hi>the carnal mind is enmity against God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. and enmity is exclusive of all complacency and delight: there is a necessity of a suitable and agreeable frame of heart to God in order to that complacential rest of our souls in him: and this agreeable temper is wrought by our new creation, 2 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God:</hi> renovation you see is the working or moulding of a mans spirit into an agreeable temper: or as it is in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. the making of us <hi>meet</hi> for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</p>
               <p>From all which it follows, that seeing there can be no complacence or delight in God without suitableness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him, as is plain from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. as well as from the reason and nature of the thing it self: either God must become like us suitable to our sinful, corrupt and vain hearts, which were but a rude blasphemy once to imagine; or else we must be made agreeable and suitable to God, which is the very thing I am now proving the necessity of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is an absolute necessity of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all that expect interest in Christ and the glory to come: since all the characters, marks and signs of such an interest are constantly taken from the new creature wrought in us. Look over all the marks and signs of interest in Christ or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him which are dispersed through the Scriptures,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54344:241"/>
and you shall still find purity of heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. holiness both in principle and practice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. mortification of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. longing for Christs appearance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. with multitudes more of the same nature, to be constantly made the marks and signs of our salvation by Christ. So that either we must have a <hi>new Bible</hi> or a <hi>new Heart:</hi> for if these Scriptures be the true and faithful words of God, no unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed creature can see his face; which was the fourth thing to be opened.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The last thing to be opened is how the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an infallible proof and evidence of the souls interest <note place="margin">5.</note> in Christ: and this will appear divers ways.</p>
               <p>First, Where all the saving graces of the spirit are, there interest in Christ must needs be certain; and where the new creature is, there all the saving graces of the spirit are: for what is the new creature but the frame or <hi>Systeme</hi> of all special saving graces: it is not this or that particular grace, as faith, or hope, or love to God, which constitutes the new creature, for these are but as so many particular limbs or branches of it: but the new creature is comprehensive of all the graces of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22, 23. <hi>The fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is love, peace, joy, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. any one of the saving special graces of the Spirit gives proof of our interest in Christ: how much more then the new creature which is the complex frame or <hi>Systeme</hi> of all the graces together?</p>
               <p>Secondly, To conclude, where all the causes of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Christ are found, and all the effects and fruits of an interest in Christ do appear; there undoubtedly a real inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Christ is found: but where-ever you find a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you find all the causes and all the effects of an interest in Christ: for there you shall find,</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>impulsive cause, viz.</hi> the electing love of God from which the new creature is inseparable, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. with the new creature also the <hi>meritorious, efficient</hi> and <hi>final</hi> causes of interest in Christ, and union with him are ever found, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All the effects and fruits of interest in Christ are found with the new creature: there are all the fruits of obedience, for we are created in Christ Jesus unto good
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54344:242"/>
works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. there is true spiritual oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to sin, 1 Joh. 5. 18. <hi>He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> there is love to the people of God, 1 Joh. 4. 7. <hi>every one that loveth is born of God:</hi> there is a conscientious respect to the duties of both Tables; for the new creature is created after God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and true holiness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. there is perseverance in the ways of God to the very end, and victory over all temptations: for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. It were easie to run over all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fruits of our union with Christ, and shew you every one of them in the new creature. And thus much of the Doctrinal part of this point.</p>

                     <p>First, Because the work of grace is wrought in diverse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and manners in the people of God. Some are changed from a state of notorious prophaneness unto serious godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: there the change is conspicuous and very evident; all the neighbourhood rings of it: But in others it is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54344:245"/>
distilled in their tender years by the blessing of God upon religious education, and there it is more indiscernable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though a great change be wrought, yet much natural corruption <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>till remains for their humiliation and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise; and this is a ground of fear and doubtings: they see not how such corruptions are consistent with the new Creature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In some the new Creature shews it self mostly in the affectionate part, in desires and breathings after God; and but little in the clearness of their understandings, and strength of their judgements: for want of which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and kept in darkness most of their dayes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Some Christians are more tryed and exercised by temptations from <hi>Satan</hi> than others are, and these clouds darken the work of grace in them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, There is great difference and variety found in the natural tempers and constitutions of the regenerate.

                     </gap>nge as hath been described, This may convince us how many of us deceive our selves, and run into dangerous and fatall mistakes in the greatest concernment we have in this world. But before I fall into this use I desire none may make a perverse and ill use of it: Let not the wicked conclude from hence that there is no such thing as true religion in the world, or that all who do profess it are but a pack of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: neither let the godly injure themselves by that which is designed for their benefit, let none conclude that seeing there are so many mistakes committed about this new creature, that therefore assurance must needs be impossible as the <hi>Papists</hi> affirm it to be. The proper use that should be made of this doctrine is, to undeceive false pretenders, and to awaken all to a more deep and thorough search of their own conditions; which being precautioned, let all men be convinced of the following truths.</p>
                  <p>First, That the change made by civility upon such as were lewd and prophane, is in its whole kind and nature a <note place="margin">1.</note> different thing from the new creature; the power and efficacy of moral vertue is one thing, the influence of the regenerating Spirit is quite another thing: however some have studied to confound them. The heathens excelled in moral, and <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> vertues. <hi>Plato, Aristides, Seneca,</hi> and multitudes more have outvied many professed Christians in justice, temperance, patience, &amp;c. yet were perfect strangers to the new creation. A man may be very strict and temperate, free from the gross pollutions of the world: and yet a perfect stranger to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration all the while. <hi>John</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That many strong convictions and troubles for <note place="margin">2.</note> sin may be found where the new creature is never formed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction indeed is an antecedent unto, and preparative for the new creature, as the blossomes of the tree are to the fruit that follows them; but as fruit doth not always follow where those blossoms and flowers appear, so neither doth the new creature follow all convictions and troubles for sin. Conviction is a common work of the Spirit both upon the elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates:
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:54344:246"/>
but the new creature is formed only in Gods elect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions may be blasted and vanish away, and the man that was under troubles for sin, may return again with the dog to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. but the new creature never perishes, nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with such a return unto sin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That excellent gifts and abilities fitting men for service in the Church of God, may be where the new creature <note place="margin">3.</note> is not, for these are promiscuously despensed by the Spirit, both to the regenerate, and ungenerate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?</hi> Gifts are attainable by study, prayer and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are reduced to an art. but regeneration is wholly super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. Sin in dominion is consistent with excellent gifts, but wholly incompatible with the new creature. In a word, these things are so different in nature from the new creature, that they oft times prove the greatest barrs, and obstacles in the world to the regenerating work of the spirit. Let no man therefore trust to things whereby multitudes deceive, and destroy their own souls. Reader, it may cost thee many <hi>an aking head</hi> to obtain gifts, but thou wilt finde <hi>an aking heart</hi> for sin, if ever God make thee a new creature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be convinced that multitudes of religious duties may be performed by men in whom the new creature was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver formed. Though all new creatures perform the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet all that perform the duties of religion are not new creatures: regeneration is not the only root from which the duties of religion spring. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 2. <hi>Yet they seek me day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of justice, they take delight in approaching to God.</hi> These are but weak and slippery foundations for men to build their confidence and hopes upon.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, weigh and consider well the <hi>Antecedents</hi> of the new creature: have those things past upon your souls which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily make way for the new creature in whomsoever the Lord forms it?</p>
                  <p>First, hath the Lord opened the eyes of your understanding in the knowledge of sin, and of Christ? hath he shewed you both your disease and remedy by a new light shining from heaven into your souls? Thus the Lord doth whereever he forms the new creature. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hath he brought home the word with mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy upon your hearts, to convince and humble them? this is the method in which the new creature is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, have these convictions overturned your vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, and brought you to a great pinch, and inward distress of soul, making you to cry <hi>what shall we doe to be saved?</hi> These are the ways of the spirit in the formation of the new creature. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. If no such antecedent works of the spirit have passed upon your hearts, you have no ground for your confidence, that the new creature is formed in you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider the <hi>concomitant</hi> frames and workings of spirit which ordinarily attend the production of the new creature, and judge impartially betwixt God and your own souls, whether they have been the very frames and workings of your hearts.</p>
                  <p>First, have your vain spirits been composed to the greatest seriousness, and most solemn consideration of things eternal, as the hearts of all those are whom God regenerates? When the Lord is about this great work upon the soul of man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vanity, levity, and sinful jollity was there before, it is banished from the heart at this time, for now heaven and hell, life and death, are before a mans eyes, and these are the most awful and solemn things that ever our thoughts conversed
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54344:247"/>
with in this world: now a man of the most airy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant constitution when brought to the sight and sense of those things, saith of <hi>laughter it is mad, and of mirth what doth it?</hi> Eccles. 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A lowly, meek, and humble frame of heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the new Creation: the soul is weary and heavy laden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. convictions of sin have plucked down the pride and loftiness of the spirit of man, emptied him of his vain conceits: those that were of lofty, proud, and blustring humours before, are meekened and brought down to the very dust now: it is with them (to speak allusively) as it was with <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that lofty City, Isa. 29. 1. 4. <hi>Wo to Ariel, to Ariel, the City where David dwelt; thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust. Ariel</hi> signifies the <hi>Lyon of God,</hi> so <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> in her prosperity was, other Cities trembled at her voice, but when God brought her down by humbling Judgements, then she whispered out of the dust: so it is in this case.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Alonging thirsting frame of spirit accompanies the new creation: the desires of the soul are ardent after Christ: never did the <hi>hireling</hi> long for the shadow, as the weary soul doth for Christ, and rest in him: if no such frames have accompanied that which you take for your new birth, you have the greatest reason in the world to suspect your selves under a cheat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Weigh well the effects and <hi>consequents</hi> of the new creature, and consider whether such fruits as these are found in your hearts and lives.</p>
                  <p>First, Whereever the new creature is formed, there a mans course, and conversation is changed, Eph. 4. 22. <hi>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of your mind:</hi> the new creature cannot but blush and be ashamed of the old Creatures conversation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The new Creature continually opposes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with the motions of sin in the heart, Gal. 5. 17. <hi>The spirit lusteth against the flesh:</hi> grace can no more incorporate with sin, than oyle with water: contraries cannot consist in the same subject longer than they are fighting with each other; if there be no conflict with sin in thy soul, or if that
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54344:247"/>
conflict be only betwixt the conscience and affections, <hi>light</hi> in the one strugling with <hi>lust</hi> in the other; thou wantest that fruit which should evidence thee to be a new creature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The mind and affections of the new Creature are set upon heavenly and spiritual things: <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. if therefore thy heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be habitually earthly, and wholly intent upon things below, driving eagerly after the world, as the great business and end of thy life: deceive not thy self, this is not the fruit of the New Creature, nor consistent with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The new Creature is a praying Creature, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its daily Communion with God, which is its live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood and subsistence: <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou be a prayerless soul, or if in all thy prayers, thou art a stranger to Communion with God; if there be no brokenness of heart for sin in thy confessions, no melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections for Christ and holiness in thy supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; surely <hi>Satan</hi> doth but baffle, and delude thy over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous soul; in perswading thee that thou art a new Creature.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The new Creature is restless after falls into sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it have recovered peace and pardon, it cannot endure it self in a state of defilement and pollution, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It is with the conscience of a new Creature under sin, as it is with the <hi>eye</hi> when any thing offends it, it cannot leave twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and watering till it have wept it out; and in the very same restless state it is under the hiding of Gods face, and divine withdrawments: <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. If therefore thou canst sin, and sin again, without such a burthensome sense of sin, or restlesness, or solicitude how to recover pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and peace, with the light of Gods countenance shining as in dayes past upon thy soul; delude not thy self, thou hast not the signs of a new Creature in thee.</p>

                  <p>The new Creature is <hi>born from above,</hi> all its tendencies are Heaven-ward; accordingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Earthly delights and sorrows are suitable enough to the unregenerate, and sensual men of the world: but exceedingly contrary unto that spirit by which you are renovated. If ever you will act becoming the principles and nature of new Creatures, then seek earthly things with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, enjoy them with fear and caution, resign them with cheerfulness and readiness: and thus <hi>let your moderation be known unto all men,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. Let your hearts daily meditate, and your tongues discourse about heavenly things, be exceeding tender of sin, strict and punctual in every duty; and hereby convince the world that you are men and women of another spirit.</p>

            <p>TWo great Tryals of our interest in Christ are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, we now proceed to a third, namely <hi>the mortification of sin: they that are Christs have crucified the flesh.</hi> The scope of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this context is to heal the unchristian breaches among the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> prevailing by the instigation of <hi>Satan,</hi> to the breach of brotherly love: to cure this he urges four weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, He disswades them from the consideration of the contrariety of these practices unto the Spirit of God, by whom they all profess themselves to be governed, from <hi>vers.</hi> 17, to the 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:54344:249"/>
Fourthly, He powerfully disswades them from these animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities from the inconsistency of these or any other lusts of the flesh with an interest in Christ: <hi>they that be Christs have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> you all profess your selves to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, to be followers of him; but how incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are these practices to such a profession?

               <p>First, What the mortification or crucifixion of sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. <note place="margin">1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And for clearness sake, I shall speak to it both <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>positively;</hi> shewing you what is not intended; and what is principally aimed at by the Spirit of God in this expression.</p>
               <p>First, The crucifying of the flesh doth not imply the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abolition of sin in Believers, or the destruction of its very <note place="margin">Neg. 1. Mortificari carnem non est eam ita perimi ut aut prorsus non sit, aut nulla prava in homine desideria commoveat, quod in corpore mortis bujus non contingit, &amp;c. <hi>Estius in loc.</hi>
                  </note> being and existence in them for the present: sanctified souls so put off their corruptions with their bodies at death: this will be the effect of our future glorification, not of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:54344:251"/>
sanctification: it doth exist in the most mortified Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. it still acteth and lusteth in the regenerate soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. yea notwithstanding its crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Believers, it still may in respect of single acts surprize and captivate them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. This therefore is not the intention of the spirit of God in this expression.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nor doth the crucifixion of sin consist in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the external acts of sin only, for sin may reign over the souls of men whilst it doth not break forth into their lives in gross and open actions, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43. <hi>Morality</hi> in the Heathens (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well observes) did <hi>abscondere, sed non abscindere vitia, hide</hi> them, when it could not <hi>kill</hi> them: many a man shews a white and fair hand, who yet hath a very foul and black heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The crucifixion of the flesh doth not consist in the cessation of the external acts of sin: for in that respect the lusts of men may dye of their own accord, even a kind of natural death. The members of the body are the weapons of unrighteousness as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls them: age or sickness may so blunt or break those weapons that the soul cannot use them to such sinful purposes and services as it was wont to do in the vigorous and healthful season of life: not that there is less sin in the heart, but because there is less strength and activity in the body. Just as it is with an old Soldier, who hath as much skill, policy and delight as ever in military acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but age and hard services have so infeebled him, that he can no longer follow the camp.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The crucifixion of sin doth not consist in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere castigations of the body and penancing it by stripes, fasting and tiresome pilgrimages. This may pass for mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among <hi>Papists,</hi> but never was any lust of the flesh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by this rigour. Christians indeed are bound not to indulge and pamper the body which is the instrument of sin, nor yet must we think that the spiritual corruptions of the soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eel those stripes which are inflicted upon the body: see <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. 'tis not the vanity of superstition, but the power of true religion which crucifies and destroys corruption: 'tis faith in Christs blood, not the spilling of our own blood, which gives sin the mortal wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:54344:251"/>
Secondly, But if you enquire what then is implied in the <note place="margin">Posit. 2.</note> mortification or crucifixion of sin, and wherein it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist? I answer,</p>
               <p>First, It necessarily implies the souls implantation into Christ and union with him; without which it is impossible <note place="margin">Errant in ipsa natura mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianae, nam cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris afflictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am reputant pro vera mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatione, cum illa non ad carnem praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pue aut inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem animae partem, sed ad mentem &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imè pertineat. <hi>Davenant in Coloss.</hi> 256.</note> that any one corruption should be mortified, <hi>they that are [Christs] have crucified the flesh:</hi> the attempts and endeavors of all others are vain and ineffectual: <hi>when we were in the flesh</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the motions of sin which were by the Law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death,</hi> Rom. 5. 7. sin was then in its full dominion, no abstinence, rigour, or outward severity; no purposes; promises or solemn vows could mortifie or destroy it: there must be an implantation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, before there can be any effectual crucifixion of sin: what Believer almost hath not in the days of his first convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tryed all external methods and means of mortifying sin, and found it in experience to be to as little purpose as the binding of <hi>Sampson</hi> with green Withs or Cords? But when he hath once come to act faith upon the death of Christ, then the design of mortification hath prospered and succeeded to good purpose.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mortification of sin implies the <hi>agency of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi> in that work, without whose assistances and aids all our endeavours must needs be fruitless: of this work we may say as it was said in another case, Zech. 4. 6. <hi>not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by might, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> by power; but by my spirit saith the Lord.</hi> When the <hi>Apostle</hi> therefore would shew by what hand this work of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is performed, he thus expresseth it, Rom. 8. 13. <hi>if ye through the spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body; ye shall live:</hi> the <hi>duty</hi> is ours, but the <hi>power</hi> whereby we perform it, is Gods: the spirit is the only successful Combatant against the lusts that war in our members, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. 'tis true, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not, but implies our endeavours; for it is we through the spirit that mortifie the deeds of the body; but yet all our endeavours without the Spirits aid and influence avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The crucifixion of sin necessarily implies <hi>the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of its dominion</hi> in the soul: a mortified sin cannot be a reigning sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14. Two things constitute the dominion of sin, <hi>viz.</hi> the fulness of its power, and the souls
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:54344:252"/>
subjection t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it. As to the fulness of its power, that rises from the suitableness it hath, and pleasure it gives to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart of man: it seems to be as necessary as the right hand, as useful and pleasant as the right eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29. but the mortified heart is dead to all pleasures and profits of sin: it hath no delight or pleasure in it: it becomes its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and daily complaint. Mortification presupposes the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the mind and conviction of the conscience; by reason whereof sin cannot deceive and blind the mind, or bewitch and ensnare the will and affections as it was wont to do, and consequently its dominion over the soul is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lost.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The crucifying of the flesh implies a <hi>gradual weakning of the power of sin</hi> in the soul. The death of the Cross was a slow and lingering death, and the crucified person grew weaker and weaker every hour; so it is in the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of sin: the soul is still <hi>cleansing it self from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the flesh and spirit, and perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. And as the body of sin is weakned more and more; so the inward man, or the new creature is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. for sanctification is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive work of the spirit: and as holiness increases, and roots it self deeper and deeper in the soul; so the power and interest of sin proportionably abates, and sinks lower and lower, until at length it be swallowed up in victory.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The crucifying of the flesh notes to us the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>designed application of all spiritual means</hi> and sanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for the destruction of it: there is nothing in this world which a gracious heart more vehemently desires and longs for, than the death of sin, and perfect deliverance from it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. the sincerity of which desires doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly manifest it self in the daily application of all Gods remedies, such are daily watching against the occasions of sin, Job 31. 1. <hi>I have made a Covenant with mine eyes;</hi> more than ordinary vigilancy over their special or proper sin, Psal. 18. 23. <hi>I kept my self from mine iniquity:</hi> earnest cries to Heaven for preventing grace, Psal. 19. 13. <hi>keep back thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me:</hi> deep humbling of soul for sins past, which is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preventive unto future sins, 2 Cor. 2. 11. <hi>in that he sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:54344:252"/>
                  <hi>after a Godly sort, what carefulness it wrought?</hi> care to give no furtherance, or advantage to the design of sin, by making provision for the flesh, to fulfill the Lusts thereof, as others do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14. willingness to bear the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of sin, Psal. 141. 5. <hi>Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness:</hi> these and such like means of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, regenerate souls are daily using; and applying in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the death of sin. And so much of the first particular what the mortification of sin, or Crucifying of the flesh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, we shall examine the reasons <note place="margin">2.</note> why this work of the spirit is expressed under that <hi>Trope</hi> or figurative expression of <hi>Crucifying the flesh.</hi> Now the ground and reason of the use of this expression, is the resemblance which the mortification of sin bears unto the death of the cross: and this appears in five particulars.</p>
               <p>First, The death of the cross was a <hi>painful death,</hi> and the mortification of sin is very painful work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29. 'tis the cutting off our right hands, and plucking out our right eyes: it will cost many thousand tears, and groans, prayers and strong cries to heaven before one sin will be mortified. Upon the account of the difficulty of this work, and mainly upon this account, the Scripture saith, <hi>narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it,</hi> Matth. 7. 14. and that the righteous themselves are <hi>scarcely saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The death of the cross was <hi>universally painful,</hi> every member, every sense, every sinew, every <hi>nerve</hi> was the seat, and subject of tormenting pain. So is it in the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of sin: 'tis not this or that particular member, or act; but the whole body of sin that is to be destroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. and accordingly the conflict is in every faculty of the soul; for the Spirit of God by whose hand sin is mortified, doth not combat with this or that particular Lust only, but with sin as sin: and for that reason with every sin, in every faculty of the soul. So that there are conflicts, and anguish in every part.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The death of the cross was a <hi>slow and lingering death:</hi> denying unto them that suffered it the favour of a quick dispatch. Just so it is in the death of sin, though the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:54344:253"/>
of God be mortifying it day by day; yet this is a truth <note place="margin">Mortificatio peccati non fit uno momento, sed opus est lucta assiduâ: p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ccatum lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guescit ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis nostrae, in progressu ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bescit; ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in ipsa morte nostra, abole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur. <hi>Origen in Epist. ad Rom.</hi>
                  </note> sealed by the sad experience of all believers in the world, <hi>that sin is long a dying:</hi> and if we ask a reason of this dispensation of God, among others, this seems to be one; corruptions in believers like the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> are left to prove, and to exercise the people of God, to keep us watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, mourning and believing; yea, wondering and admiring at the riches of pardoning, and preserving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy all our dayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The death of the Cross was a very <hi>opprobrious and shameful</hi> death: they that dyed upon the cross were load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ignominy: the crimes for which they dyed were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the publick view: after this manner dyeth sin, a very shameful and ignominious death. Every true believer draws up a charge against it in every prayer, aggravates and condemns it in every confession, bewailes the evil of it with multitudes of tears and groans, making sin as vile and odious as they can find words to express it, though not so vile as it is in its own nature. <hi>O my God</hi> (saith <hi>Ezra) I am ashamed, and even blush to look up unto thee,</hi> Ezra 9. 6. So <hi>Daniel</hi> in his confession: Dan. 9. 7. <hi>O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day.</hi> Nor can it grieve any believer in the world to accuse, condemn, and shame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for sin, whilest he remembers and considers that all that shame and confusion of face which he takes to himself, goes to the vindication, glory, and honour of his God: as <hi>David</hi> was content to be more vile still for God, so it pleaseth the heart of a Christian to magnifie and advance the name and glory of God by exposing his own shame, in humble and broken hearted confessions of sin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In a word, the death of the Cross <hi>was not a natural, but a violent death:</hi> such also is the death of sin: sin dyes not of its own accord, as nature dyeth in old men, in whom the <hi>Balsamum radicale</hi> or radical moisture is consumed: for if the Spirit of God did not kill it, it would live to eternity in the souls of men: 'tis not the everlasting burnings, and all the wrath of God which lies upon the damned for ever, that can destroy sin. Sin like a <hi>Salamander</hi> can live to eternity in the fire of Gods wrath: so that either it must dye a violent death by the hand of the Spirit, or never dyeth at all. And
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:54344:253"/>
thus you see, why the mortification of sin is <hi>Tropically</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the crucifying of the flesh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Why all that are in Christ must be so crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or mortified unto sin: and the necessity of this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear divers ways.</p>
               <p>First, From the inconsistency and contrariety that there is betwixt Christ and unmortified lust, Gal. 5. 17. <hi>these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other.</hi> There is a threefold inconsistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and such corruptions: they are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>holiness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> 1 John 3. 6. <hi>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him, (i. e.)</hi> whosoever is thus ingulphed and plunged into the lust of the flesh, can have no communion with the pure and holy Christ: but there is also an inconsistency betwixt such sin and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity:</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> said to a Soldier of his name, <hi>recordare nominis Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andri,</hi> remember thy name is <hi>Alexander,</hi> and do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that name. And unmortified lusts are also contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Dominion</hi> and government of <hi>Christ,</hi> Luke 9. 23. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross daily and follow me:</hi> these are the self-denying terms upon which all men are admitted into Christs service: and without mortification and self-denial he allows no man to call him Lord and Master.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The necessity of mortification appears from the necessity of conformity betwixt Christ the head, and all the members of his mystical body: for how incongruous and uncomely would it be to see a holy heavenly Christ, leading a company of unclean, carnal and sensual members? Mat. 11. 29. <hi>Take my yoak upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, q. d.</hi> it would be monstrous to the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a company of <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> following a meek and harmless <hi>Lamb:</hi> men of raging and unmortified lusts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and owning me for their head of government: and again, 1 John 2. 6. <hi>He that saith he abideth in him, ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also so to walk, even as he walked, q. d.</hi> either imitate Christ in your <hi>practice,</hi> or never make pretensions to Christ in your <hi>profession:</hi> this was what the <hi>Apostle</hi> complained of, Phil. 3. 18. for <hi>many walk of whom I have told you often, and</hi>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:54344:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ:</hi> men cannot study to put a greater dishonour and reproach upon Christ, than by making his name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, a cloak and cover to their filthy lusts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The necessity of crucifying the flesh appears from the method of Salvation as it is stated in the Gospel. God every where requires the practice of mortification under pain of damnation, Mat. 18. 8. <hi>Wherefore if thy hand, or thy foot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed; rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire:</hi> the Gospel legitimates no hopes of salvation, but such as are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with serious endeavours of mortification, 1 John 3. 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure:</hi> 'twas one special end of Christs coming into the world, <hi>to save his people from their sins,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. nor will he be a Saviour unto any who remain under the dominion of their own lusts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The whole stream and current of the Gospel put us under the necessity of mortification. Gospel <hi>precepts</hi> have respect unto this, Col. 3. 5. <hi>mortifie your members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which are upon the earth,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> Gospel <hi>presidents</hi> have respect unto this, Heb. 12. 1. <hi>wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,</hi> &amp;c. Gospel <hi>threatnings</hi> are written for this end, and do all press mortification in a thundring <hi>dialect,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the flesh ye shall dye,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and unrighteousness of men:</hi> the <hi>promises</hi> of the Gospel are written designedly to promote it, 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God:</hi> but in vain are all these precepts, presidents, threatnings and promises written in the Scripture, except mortification be the daily study and practice of professors.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Mortification is the very scope and aim of our regeneration and the infusion of the principles of grace: <hi>if we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. in vain were the habits of grace planted, if the fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:54344:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and mortification be not produced: yea, mortification is not only the design and aim, but it is a special part even the one half of our sanctification.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If mortification be not the daily practice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of Believers, then the way to Heaven no way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to Christs description of it in the Gospel: he tells us, Mat. 7. 13, 14. <hi>Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction; and many there be that go in thereat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it:</hi> well then, either Christ must be mistaken in the account he gave of the way to glory, or else all unmortified persons are out of the way: for what makes the way of salvation narrow, but the difficulties and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of mortification?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In a word, he that denies the necessity of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, confounds all discriminating marks betwixt Saints and Sinners; pulls down the Pale of distinction, and lets the world into the Church, and the Church into the World: 'tis a great design of the Gospel to preserve the boundaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one and the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 4, 5, 6, 13. but if men may be Christians without mortification, we may as well go into the <hi>Taverns, Ale-houses,</hi> or <hi>Brothel-houses,</hi> among the roaring or sottish crew of sinners, and say, here be those that are redeemed by the blood of Christ; here be his Disciples and Followers; as go to seek them in the purest Churches, or most strictly religious families: by all which the necessity of mortification unto all that are in Christ, is abundantly evidenced.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the next place we are to enquire into the true <hi>principle</hi> of mortification: 'tis true there are many ways at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted <note place="margin">4.</note> by men for the mortification of sin, and many rules laid down to guide men in that great work: some of which are very tristing and impertinent things; such are those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>popish votaries:</hi> but I shall lay down this as a sure conclusion, that <hi>the sanctifying spirit is the only effectual prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of mortification:</hi> and without him no resolutions, vows, abstinencies, castigations of the body, or any other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal endeavours can ever avail to the mortification of one sin: the <hi>moral Heathens</hi> have prescribed may pretty rules and helps for the suppression of vice. <hi>Aristides, Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:54344:255"/>
were renowned among them upon this account: but yet as <hi>Lactantius</hi> well observes, <hi>moral Philosophie</hi> did rather <hi>abscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere vitia, quam abscindere,</hi> hide it, rather than kill it: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Christians have also gone far in the reformation of their lives, but could never attain true mortification: formality pares off the excrescences of vice, but never kills the root of it: it usually recovers it self again, and their souls like a body not well purged, relapse into a worse condition than before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43, 44. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>This work of mortification is peculiar to the spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and the spirit becomes a principle of mortification in Believers two ways, namely
<list>
                     <item>1. By the implantation of contrary habits.</item>
                     <item>2. By assisting those implanted habits in all the times of need.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, The spirit of God implants habits of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are destructive to sin, and are purgative of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <note place="margin">1.</note> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. Grace is to corruption what water is to fire; betwixt which there is both a <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>effective opposition:</hi> a contrariety both in nature and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. There is a threefold remarkable advantage gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us by grace for the destruction and mortification of sin. For,</p>
               <p>First, Grace gives the mind and heart of man a contrary bent and inclination; by reason whereof spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things become connatural to the regenerate soul, Rom. 7. 22. <hi>For I delight in the Law of God, after the inner man:</hi> sanctification is in the soul as a living spring running with a kind of <hi>central force</hi> Heaven-ward, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Holy principles destroy the interest that sin once had in the love and delight of the soul: the sanctified soul cannot take pleasure in sin, or find delight in that which grieves God, as it was wont to do: but that which was the object of delight, hereby becomes the object of grief and hatred, Rom. 7. 15. <hi>What I hate, that I do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, From both these follow a third advantage for the mortification of sin, in as much as sin being contrary to the new nature, and the object of grief and hatred, cannot
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54344:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
possibly be committed without reluctancy, and very sensible regret of mind: and actions done with regret, are neither done frequently nor easily. The case of a regenerate soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the surprizals, and particular victories of temptation, <note place="margin">

                  </note> being like that of a captive in war, who marches not with delight, but by constraint among his enemies. So the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresseth himself, Rom. 7. 23. <hi>But I see another law in my members, warring against the Law of my mind; and bringing me into captivity unto the law of sin which is in my members:</hi> thus the spirit of God promotes the design of mortification by the implantation of contrary habits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By assisting those gracious habits in all the times <note place="margin">2.</note> of need, which he doth many ways: sometimes notably awakening and rouzing grace out of the dull and sleepy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and drawing forth the activity and power of it into actual and successful resistances of temptations, as Gen. 39. 9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> Holy fear awakens first, and raises all the powers of grace in the soul to make a vigorous resistance of temptation: the spirit also strengthens weak grace in the soul, 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness:</hi> and by reason of grace thus implanted, and thus assisted, <hi>he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The last query to be satisfied is, how mortification of sin solidly evinceth the souls interest in Christ; and this it <note place="margin">5.</note> doth divers ways, affording the mortified soul many sound evidences thereof. As,</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                  <p>Whatsoever evidences the indwelling of the holy spirit of God in us, must needs be evidential of a saving interest in Christ; as hath been fully proved before: but the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin doth plainly evidence the indwelling of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; for as we proved but now, it can proceed from no other principle: there is as strong and inseparable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection betwixt mortification and the spirit, as betwixt the effect, and its proper cause, and the self-same connection
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54344:256"/>
betwixt the inbeing of the spirit, and union with Christ. So that to reason from mortification to the inhabitation of the spirit, and from the inhabitation of the spirit to our union with Christ; is a strong scriptural way of reasoning.</p>

                  <p>That which proves a soul to be under the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> evidently proves its interest in Christ: for Christ is the head of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> and none but sound Believers are under the blessings and promises of it; but mortification of sin is a sound evidence of the souls being under the Covenant of Grace, as is plain from those words of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. 6. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lust thereof; neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield your selves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as instruments of righteousness unto God; sor sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the Law but under Grace:</hi> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> presseth Believers unto mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this incouragement, that it will be a good evidence unto them of a new Covenant interest: for all legal duties and endeavours can never mortifie sin: 'tis the spirit in the new Covenant which produces this: whoever therefore hath his corruptions mortified, hath his interest in the Covenant, and consequently in Christ, so far cleared unto him.</p>

                        <hi>of Christians is no idle, or easie life:</hi> the corruptions of his heart continually fill his hands with work, with work of the most difficult nature, sin-crucifying work, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls the cutting off the right hand, and plucking out of the right eye: sin-crucifying work is hard work; and it is constant work, throughout the life of a Christian: there is no time or place freed from this conflict: every occasion stirs corruption, and every stirring of corruption calls for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: corruptions work in our very best duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and put the Christian upon mortifying labours. The world and the Devil are great enemies and fountains of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations to Believers, but not like the corruptions of our own hearts: they only tempt <hi>objectively</hi> and <hi>externally;</hi> but this tempts <hi>internally,</hi> and therefore much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: they only tempt at times and seasons; this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, at all times and seasons: beside, what ever <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> or the <hi>world</hi> attempts upon us would be altogether inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, were it not for our own corruptions, <hi>John</hi> 14. 30. So that the corruptions of our own hearts as they give us most danger, so they must give us more labour: our life, and this labour must end together; for sin is long a dying in the best heart: those that have been many years exercised in the study of mortification may haply feel the same corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tempting and troubling them now, which put them into tears, and many times to their knees twenty or forty years ago. It may be said of sin as it was of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that active enemy: that it will never be quiet whether conquering or conquered: and until sin cease working, the Christian must not cease mortifying.</p>

                        <hi>certainly those that give the corruptions of Christians an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to revive, must needs do them a very ill office:</hi> they are not our best friends that stir the pride of our <hi>hearts</hi> by the flattery of their <hi>lips.</hi> The graces of God in others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, are thankfully to be owned, and under discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and contrary temptations to be wisely and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly spoken of: but the strongest Christians do scarcely shew their own weakness in any one thing more than they do in bearing their own praises. Christian, thou knowest thou carriest Gunpowder about thee, desire those that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fire to keep at a distance from thee: 'tis a dangerous <hi>Crisis</hi> when a proud heart meets with flattering lips, <hi>aufer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ignem, &amp;c.</hi> take away the fire (said a holy Divine of <hi>Germany</hi> when his friend commended him upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) for I have yet combustible matter about me: faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, seasonable, discreet reproofs are much more safe to us, and advantageous to our mortifying work; but alas, how few have the boldness or wisdom duly to administer them?

For O how many be there under the Christian name, that pamper and indulge their lusts, that secretly hate all that faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and really affect none but such as feed their lusts by praising and admiring them? How many that make provision for the flesh, to fulfil its lusts? who cannot endure to have their corruptions crost: how many are there that seem very meek and humble until an occasion be given to stir their passion, and then you shall see in what degree they are mortified: the flint is a cold stone, till it be struck, and then 'tis all fiery. I know the best of Christians are mortified but in part: and strong corruptions are oft-times found in very eminent Christians; but they love them not

The Apostle <hi>James</hi> propounds, and answers a very pertinent question unto this discourse, James 4. 1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you; come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</hi> O if all men did but study mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and self-denial, and live as much at home in the constant work of their own hearts, as some men do; what tranquillity and peace, what blessed halcyon days should we quickly see!

Mortification, one in the nature of the work, as it is a duty, a sweet Christian duty, another as it hath respect to Christ, and is evidential of our Union with him. In the first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there is a wonderful sweetness in Mortification, for dost thou not feel a blessed calmness, cheariness and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in thy conscience, when thou hast faithfully repelled tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, successfully resisted and overcome thy corruptions? Doth not God smile upon thee; conscience incourage, and approve thee? Hast thou not an heaven within thee? whilst others feel a kind of hell in the deadly gripes, and bitter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of their own consciences, are covered with shame, and filled with horrours. But then, consider it also as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the souls interest in Christ, as my Text considers it; and what an heaven upon earth must then be found in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication! These indeavours of mine to subdue and mortifie my corruptions, plainly speak the Spirit of God in me, and my being in Christ, and O what is this! What heart hath largeness and strength enough to receive and contain the joy and comfort which flowes from a cleared interest in Jesus Christ! Certainly Christians, the tranquillity and comfort of your whole life depends upon it: and what is life without the comfort of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live, (i. e.)</hi> you shall live a serene, placid, comfortable life, for it is corruption unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied which clouds the face of God, and breaks the peace of his people, and consequently imbitters the life of a Christian.</p>

It is not worth while to live sixty, or seventy years in the world, to eat and drink, to buy and sell, to laugh and cry, and then go down to the place of silence.

                  <head>4. Use for Examination.</head>
                  <p>In the next place this point naturally puts us upon the Examination and trial of our own hearts, whether we <note place="margin">Use 4.</note> who so confidently claim a special interest in Christ have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause two sorts of persons will be concerned in this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>viz.</hi> the weaker, and the stronger Christians; I shall therefore lay down two sorts of Evidences of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one respecting the sincerity, and truth, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the strength, and progress of that work in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and grown Christians, and both excluding false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders.</p>
                  <p>First, There are some things that are Evidential of the truth and sincerity of Mortification even in the weakest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: as</p>
                  <p>First, True tenderness of conscience in all known sins, one as well as another, is a good sign sin hath lost its Dominion in the soul? O 'tis a special mercy to have a heart that shall smite and reprove us for those things that others make nothing of: to check and admonish us for our secret sins which can never turn to our reproach among men: this is a good sign that we hate sin as sin: however through the weakness of the flesh we may be ensnared by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>What I hate that I do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The sincere and earnest desires of our souls to God in prayer for heart-purging and sin-mortifying grace, is a good sign our souls have no love for sin. Canst thou say, poor believer, in the truth of thy heart; that if God would give thee thy choice, it would please thee better to have sin cast out, than to have the world cast in; that thy heart is not so earnest with God for daily bread, as it is for heart-purging grace? this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable evidence that sin is nayled to the Cross of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, do you make conscience of guarding against the occasions of sin? Do you keep a daily watch over your hearts and senses, according to 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. This speaks a true design and purpose of Mortification also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:54344:267"/>
Fourthly, do you rejoyce and bless God from your hearts when the providence of God orders any means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of sin? Thus did <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 33. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>said to</hi> Abigail, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging my self with my own hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In a word, though the thoughts of death may be terrible in themselves, yet if the expectation and hope of your deliverance from sin thereby, do sweeten the thoughts of it to your souls, it will turn unto you for a testimony that you are not the servants and friends of sin. And so much briefly of the first sort of Evidences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are other signs of a more deep and through Mortification of sin in more grown and confirmed believers, and such are these.</p>
                  <p>First, The more submissive and quiet any man is under the will of God in smart and afflicting providences, the more that mans heart is mortified unto sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67, 71. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The more able any one is to bear the reproaches and rebukes of his sin, the more Mortification there is in that man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The more easily any man can resign and give up his dearest earthly comforts at the call and command of God, the more progress that man hath made in the work of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The more power any man hath to resist sin in the first motions of it, and stifle it in the birth; the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Mortification that man hath attained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If great changes upon our outward condition make no change for the worse upon our spirits, but we can bear prosperous and adverse providences with an equal mind; then Mortification is advanced far in our souls, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The more fixed and steady our hearts are with God in duty, and the less they are infested with wandring thoughts and earthly interpositions; the more Mortification there is in that soul. And so much briefly of the Evidences of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

                  <p>It only remains that I shut up all with a few words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation unto all that are under the Mortifying influence of the <note place="margin">Use 5.</note> spirit. Much might be said for the comfort of such. In brief,</p>
                  <p>First, Mortified sin shall never be your ruine: 'tis only <hi>raigning</hi> sin that is <hi>ruining</hi> sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. Mortified sins, and pardoned sins shall never lye down with us in the dust.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If sin be <hi>dying,</hi> your souls are <hi>living;</hi> for dying unto sin, and living unto God are inseparably connected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If sin be dying in you, it is certain that Christ died for you, and you cannot desire a better Evidence of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If sin be dying under the Mortifying influences of the spirit, and it be your daily labour to resist and overcome it, you are then in the direct way to heaven, and eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which few, very few in the world shall find, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To shut up all, if you through the spirit be daily mortifying the deeds of the body, then the death of Christ is effectually applied by the spirit unto your souls, and your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in him is unquestionable: for they that are Christs have Crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, and they that have so Crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts, are Christs.</p>

            <p>THe express and principal design of the Apostle in this Chapter, is to propound marks and signs both <hi>Negative</hi> and <hi>Positive,</hi> for the trial and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of mens claims to Christ; amongst which (not to spend time about the Coherence) my Text is a principal one: a trial of mens interest in Christ by their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christ.

First, We have here a claim to Christ supposed; <hi>if any</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>man say he abideth in him:</hi> abiding in Christ is an expression denoting proper and real interest in Christ, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him: for it is put in opposition to those tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, light and transient effects of the Gospel, which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a morning dew, or an early cloud: such a receiving of Christ as that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. which is but a present flash, a sudden vanishing pang: abiding in Christ notes a solid, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and effectual work of the Spirit, throughly and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly joyning the soul to Christ. Now, if any man who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he be (for this indefinite is equivalent to an universal term) let him never think his claim to be good and valid, except he take this course to adjust it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The only way to have this claim warranted, <note place="margin">2.</note> and that must be by <hi>so walking even as he walked:</hi> which words carry in them the necessity of our imitation of Christ. But it is not to be understood indifferently and universally of all the works or actions of Christ, some of which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and miraculous; some purely mediatory and not imitable by us: in these paths no Christian can follow Christ; nor may so much as attempt to walk as he walked. But the words point at the ordinary and imitable ways and works of Christ: therein it must be the care of all to follow him, that profess and claim interest in him: they must so walk as he walked: this [so] is a very bearing word in this place; the emphasis of the Text seems to lie in it: however, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that this <hi>so walking</hi> doth not imply an equality with Christ in holiness and obedience: for as he was filled with the spirit without measure, and anointed with that oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above his fellows, so the purity, holiness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his life is never to be matched and equallized by any of the Saints. But this <hi>so walking</hi> only notes a sincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, design and endeavour to imitate and follow him in all the paths of holiness and obedience according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent measures of grace received. The life of Christ is the Believers copy, and though the Believer cannot draw one line or letter exact as his copy is, yet his eye is still upon it, he is looking unto Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and labouring to draw all the lines of his life as agreeably as he is able unto Christ his pattern.</p>

Now to state the method of this Discourse, it will be needful to discuss and open three things in the doctrinal part.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What the Saints imitation of Christ supposes and comprizes.</item>
                  <item>2. In what particulars they are especially bound to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christ.</item>

               </list>
               <p>And then apply the whole in divers Uses.</p>
               <p>First, What the Saints imitation of Christ supposeth and comprizeth. Now there are divers great and weighty truths <note place="margin">1.</note> supposed and implyed in this imitation of Christ; or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he walked, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, It supposes that no Christian is or may pretend to be a rule to himself, to act according to the dictates of his own will and pleasure: for as no man hath wisdom enough to direct and govern himself; so if his own will were made the rule of his own actions, it would be the highest invasion of the divine prerogative that could be imagined: <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi> (saith <hi>Jeremy) that the way of man is not in himself, it is not in him that walketh to direct his own steps,</hi> Jer. 10. 23. We may as well pretend to be our own makers as our own
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:54344:270"/>
guides. It is a pretty observation of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that if the workmans hand were the rule of his work, it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he should ever err in working: and if the will of man were the only law and guide of his way, we might then say no man would sin in his walking. The Apostle indeed saith of the Heathens, Rom. 2. 14. <hi>that they are a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> but it is not his meaning that their will is their law, but the law of God engraven upon their hearts: the light and dictates of their own Consciences, did oblige and bind them as a law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This imitation of Christ implies, that as no man is or may pretend to be his own guide, so no meer man how wise or holy soever he be, may pretend to be a rule to other men: but Christ is the rule of every mans way and walking. 'Tis true indeed, the Apostle saith, <hi>We should be followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises,</hi> Heb. 6. 12. And again, James 5. 10. <hi>Take my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience:</hi> but you must always remember that there is a twofold rule.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Regula regulans,</hi> the rule, ruling.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Regula regulata,</hi> the rule ruled.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The wisest and holiest among men may pretend no higher than <hi>a ruled rule.</hi> The great Apostle, though filled with as great a measure of the spirit of wisdom and holiness as ever was possessed by any meer man; yet goes no higher than this, 1 Cor. 11. 1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</hi> The best of men are but men at best: they have their errors and defects which they freely acknowledge: and where they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Christ, 'tis our duty to differ from them: we may not pin our faith upon any mans sleeve, for we know not where he will carry it. It was the commendation which <hi>Paul</hi> gave of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 6. <hi>And ye became fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of us, and of the Lord.</hi> The noble <hi>Bereans</hi> were also commended for searching the Scriptures and examining the <note place="margin">Nec ego te, nec t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> me, sed am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Apostles</hi> doctrine by it: and it was a good reply of the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to a clamorous disputant crying hear me, hear me, I will
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:54344:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither hear thee, nor do thou hear me; but let us both hear Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The imitation of Christ implies the necessity of sanctification in all his followers: for as much as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there should be a practical conformity in point of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where there is not a conformity in spirit and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; all external conformity to Christs practice, depends upon an internal conformity to Christ in the principle and spirit of holiness. 'Tis very plain from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19, 20. that a new heart must be given us, and a new spirit put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, before we can walk in Gods statutes: we must first live in the spirit, before we can walk in the spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The imitation of Christ plainly holds forth this, that Christian religion is a very precise and strict religion; no way countenancing licentiousness, or indulging men in their lusts: it allows no man to walk loosely and inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but rejects every mans claim to Christ who studies and labours not to tread exactly in the footsteps of his holy and heavenly example. Prophaneness and licentiousness therefore can find no shelter or protection under the wing of the Gospel: this is the universal rule laid upon all the professors of the Christian Religion: <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> let him either put on the life of Christ, or put off the name of Christ: let him shew the hand of a Christian in works of holiness and obedience, or else the tongue and language of a Christian must gain no belief or credit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The imitation of Christ necessarily implies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiveness and imperfection of the best men in this life: for if the life of Christ be our pattern; the best and holiest of men must confess they come short in every thing of the rule of their duty. Our pattern is still above us; the best of men are ashamed when they compare their lives with the life of Christ. 'Tis true, a vain heart may swell with pride when a man compares himself with other men: thus measuring our selves by our selves, and comparing our selves among our selves we shew our folly, and nourish our pride: but if any man will compare his own life with Christs, he will find abundant cause at every time, and in every thing to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. <hi>Paul</hi> was a great proficient in holiness and obedience;
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:54344:271"/>
he had been long striving to come up to the top of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet when he looks up and sees the life of Christ, and rule of duty so far above him, he reckons himself still but at the foot of the Hill, Phil. 3. 12. <hi>Not as though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend, that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. q. d.</hi> Alas I am not come up to my duty; I am a a great way behind, but I am following after, if at last I may attain it: perfection is in my expectation and hope at last, not in my attainment here.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The imitation of Christ as our general rule and pattern, necessarily implies the transcending holiness of <note place="margin">Primum &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum in uno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoque genere est regula &amp; mensura caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum.</note> the Lord Jesus. His holiness is greater than the holiness of all creatures: for only that which is first and best in every kind, is the rule and measure of all the rest. 'Tis the height of Saints ambition to be made conformable to Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. Christ hath a double perfection, a perfection of <hi>being,</hi> and a perfection of <hi>working:</hi> his life was a perfect rule, no blot or error could be found therein; for he was <hi>holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, undefiled, separate from sinners:</hi> and such an High-Priest became us as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. The conformity of professors to Christs example is the test and measure of all their graces: the nearer any man comes to this pattern, the nearer he approaches towards perfection.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Christians imitation of Christ, under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of losing his claim to Christ, necessarily implies san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and obedience to be the evidences of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interest in Christ: assurance is unattainable without obedience, we can never be comfortable Christians except we be strict and regular Christians, Gal. 6. 16. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy; and upon the Israel of God.</hi> A loose and careless conversation can never be productive of true peace and consolation, 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>This is our rejoicing, the testimony of our Conscience; that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God; we have had our conversation in the world.</hi> Let men talk what they will of the immediate seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and comforts of the spirit without any regard to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or respect to obedience; Sure I am, whatever delusion they meet with in that way; true peace and consolation is
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:54344:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only to be expected and found here: <hi>The fruit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness, and assurance for ever:</hi> We have it not for our holiness, but we always have it in the way of holiness. And so much of the first particular, namely, what the imitation of Christ implies and comprizes in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place we are to enquire in what <note place="margin">2.</note> things all that profess Christ are obliged to the imitation of him; or what those excellent graces in the life of Christ were, which are propounded as patterns to the Saints.</p>
               <p>The life of Christ was a living law; all the graces and <note place="margin">Quid vobis cum virtutibus qui virtutem Christi ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis? Ubinam, quaeso, vera prudentia, nisi in Christi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina? Ubi vera temperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, nisi in Christi vita? Ubi vera forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo, nisi in Christi passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne? <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                  </note> vertues of the Spirit were represented in their glory, and brightest luster in his conversation upon earth: never man spake as he spake; never any lived as he lived: <hi>we beheld his glory</hi> (saith the Evangelist) <hi>as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,</hi> John 1. 14. But to descend to the particular imitable excellencies in the life of Christ, which are high patterns and excellent rules for the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his people, we shall from among many others single out the ten following Particulars which we are obliged to imitate.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Pattern 1.</head>
                  <p>And first of all, the purity and holiness of the life of Christ is proposed as a glorious pattern for the Saints imitation, 1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in every creek and turning of your lives. There is a twofold holiness in Christ; the holiness of his <hi>nature</hi> and the holiness of his <hi>practice;</hi> his holy being, and his holy working: this obligeth all that profess interest in him, to a twofold holiness, <hi>viz.</hi> holiness <hi>in actu primo,</hi> in the principles of it in their hearts; and holiness <hi>in actu secundo,</hi> in the practice and exercise of it in their conversations: 'tis very true, we cannot in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects imitate the holiness of Christ; for he is <hi>essentially</hi> holy; proceeding by nature, as a pure beam of holiness from the Father: and when he was incarnate he came into the world immaculate, and pure from the least stain of pollution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was said, Luke 1. 25. <hi>That holy thing which shall be</hi>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:54344:272"/>
                     <hi>born of thee, shall be called the Son of God:</hi> in this we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be like Christ in the way of our production: for <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean? not one.</hi> The Lord Jesus was also <hi>efficiently</hi> holy, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he makes others holy: therefore his sufferings and blood are called a fountain opened <hi>for sin and for uncleanness, (i. e.)</hi> to cleanse other mens souls, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. in this Christ also is inimitable: no man can make himself or others holy. That's a great truth though it will hardly go down with proud nature, <hi>minus est te fecisse hominem, quam sanctum,</hi> we may sooner make our selves to be men than to be Saints. Beside, Christ is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy as he is <hi>God,</hi> and there are no stints or measures set to his holiness as <hi>Mediator,</hi> John 3. 34. <hi>for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him.</hi> But notwithstanding these excepted respects, the holiness of Christ is propounded as a pattern for our imitation six ways.</p>
                  <p>First, He was <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> holy, without fiction or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: and this appeared in the greatest trial of the truth of holiness that ever was made in this world, John 14. 30. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me:</hi> when he was agitated and shaken with the greatest temptations, no <note place="margin">Galaxia est maxima fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum stella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quae prae exiguitate ad nostrum aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum distinctè pervenire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The hypocrite makes shew of more holiness than he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there was more holiness in Christ, than ever appeared to the view of men. We may say of the way of Christ, what the <hi>Philosopher</hi> saith of the <hi>milky way</hi> in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; that those faint streams of light which we see there, are nothing else but the reflection of innumerable Stars which shine there, though they be invisible to us: there was much inward beauty in him, and so there ought to be in all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; our holiness, like Christs, must be sincere and real, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. shining with inward beauty towards God rather than towards men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ was <hi>uniformly</hi> holy, at one time as well as another; in one place and company as well as another; he was still like himself, an holy Christ: one and the same tenour of holiness ran thoughout his whole life, from first to last: so must it be with all his people: holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Christians, look to your copy, and be sure to imitate Christ in this; write fair after your Copy; let there

not be here a word and there a blot; one part of your life heavenly, and pure, and another earthly, and dreggy: or (as one expresses it) now an heavenly rapture, and by and by a fleshly frolick.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ was <hi>exemplarily</hi> holy: a pattern of holiness to all that came nigh him, and conversed with him. O imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christ in this. It was the commendation of the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that they <hi>were ensamples to all that believed in Macedonia, and Achaia, and that in every place their faith to God-ward was spread abroad,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 7, 8. Let no man go out of your company without conviction or edification; so exemplary were the primitive Christians, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ was <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>precisely</hi> holy; <hi>which of you convinceth me of sin?</hi> The most envious and observing eyes of his greatest enemies could not pick a hole, or find a flaw in any of his words or actions: 'tis our duty to imitate Christ in this, Phil. 2. 15. <hi>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, among whom ye shine</hi> (or as the word may be rendred imperatively, <hi>among whom shine ye,) as lights in the world.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> it becomes the followers of Christ to walk circumspectly or precisely, <hi>for so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Christ was perseveringly holy, holy to the last breath; as he began, so he finished his whole life in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of holiness: in this also he is our great pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: it becomes not any of his people to begin in the spirit, and end in the flesh: but on the contrary, their last works should be more than their first; <hi>let him that is holy be holy still,</hi> Rev. 22. 11.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In a word, the delight of Christ was only in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and holy persons; they were his chosen compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: even so it becometh his people to have all their delights in the saints and in the excellent of the earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 3. Thus Christians, be ye followers of Christ in his holiness: God hath decreed this conformity to Christ in all that shall be saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. he banisheth all unholy ones from his gracious presence for ever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. The design of Christ in dying for you was to make you pure and holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. O then study holiness; eye your pattern; and as

                  <p>The <hi>obedience</hi> of Christ to his Fathers will is a pattern for the imitation of all Christians: 'tis said of Christ, Heb. 5. 8. <hi>that he learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</hi> a Text which labours under some difficulties: Christ learned obedience, and yet was not ignorant before of what he learned afterward: he was perfect in knowledge; and yet the Apostle speaks of him as a proficient in the School of Wisdom.

                  <p>Christ as God was perfect in knowledge; nothing could be added to him: but when he became man, then he came to understand or learn by sufferings as the Apostle here speaks; which though it added nothing to his knowledge, yet it was a new method and way of knowing. Now the obedience of Christ is our pattern whereunto we are obliged (as ever we will warrant our claim of interest in him) to conform our selves in the following properties of it.</p>
                  <p>First, Christs obedience was free and voluntary, not forced or compulsory: it was so from the very first undertakement of the work of our redemption, Prov. 8. 30, 31. <hi>Then was I by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing always before him: rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</hi> And when the fulness of time was come for executing that blessed design which had been in prospect from all eternity, how chearfully did the will of Christ echo to his Fathers call, Psal. 40. 7. <hi>Then said I, Loe I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God, yea, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Nor was this a flourish before he came into the field, and saw the enemy; for he laid down his life with the greatest chearfulness and spontaneity that could be,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:54344:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, because I lay down my life that I might take it again; no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self:</hi> and indeed the voluntariness of Christ in his obedience unto death gave his death the nature and sormality of a sacrifice, for so all sacrifices ought to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 3. and so Christs sacrifice was offered unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. It was as grateful a work to Christ to dye for us, as it was to <hi>Moses</hi> his mother to take him to nurse from the hand of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter. O Christians, tread in the steps of Christs example: do nothing grudgingly for God, let not his commands be grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. If you do any thing for God willingly, you have a reward; if otherwise, a dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only is committed to you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. Obedience in Christ was an abasement to him, but in you a very great honour and advancement, you have reason therefore to obey with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The obedience of Christ was universal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, he was obedient to all the will of God, making no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur to the hardest service imposed by the will of God upon him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross:</hi> and though it's true the humanity of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyled and staggered when that bitter cup of the wrath of God was given him to drink; yet how soon was that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent aversation overcome in him by a perfect submission? <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless not my will, but thine be done, Mat.</hi> 26. 39. Christians here is your pattern: happy art thou Reader, if thou canst say when God calls thee to suffering, and self denying work, I am filled with the will of God. Such was <hi>Pauls</hi> obedience. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but to die at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The obedience of Christ was sincere and pure, without any base or by end, purely aiming at the glory of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work thou gavest me to do.</hi> He sought not honour of men. This was the great desire of his soul, <hi>John</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Father glorifie thy name:</hi> and truly the choicest part of your obedience consists in the purity of your ends, and in this Christ is propounded as your pattern, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The streams of Christs obedience flowed from the spring and fountain of ardent love to God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 31.
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:54344:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave me commandment, even so I do:</hi> Thus let all your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God turn upon the hinge of love. For <hi>love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law, Rom.</hi> 13. 10. Not as if no other duty but love were required in the law; but because no act of obedience is acceptable to God, but that which is performed in love.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In a word, The obedience of Christ was constant, he was obedient unto the death, he was not weary of his work to the last. Such a patient continuance in well doing is one part of your conformity to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. 'tis laid upon you by his own express command, and a command back'd with the most incouraging promise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>self-denial</hi> of Christ is the pattern of believers, and their Conformity unto it is their indispensable duty. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <note place="margin">Vulpibus in saltu rupes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisa latebr as Praebet &amp; aereis avibus dat syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va quietem: Ast hominis nato nullis succede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re tectis Est licitum. <hi>Heinsius.</hi>
                     </note> 4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> Jesus Christ for the glory of God, and the love he bare to the elect, denied himself all the delights and pleasures of this world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many,</hi> he was all his life long in the world <hi>a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, Isa.</hi> 53. 3. more unprovided of comfortable accommodations, than the birds of the air, or beasts of the earth. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 58. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Yet this was the least part of Christs self-denial: what did he not deny when he left the bosom of his Father with the ineffable delights and pleasures he there enjoyed from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and instead thereof to drink the cup, the bitter cup of his Fathers wrath for our sakes? O Christians, look to your pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; and imitate your self-denying Saviour. There is a threesold self you are to deny for Christ.</p>
                  <p>First, Deny your <hi>natural self</hi> for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. Hate your own life in competition with his glory as well as your natural lusts, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Deny your <hi>Civil self</hi> for Christ: whether they
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:54344:274"/>
be gifts of the mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. or your dearest relations in the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, deny your <hi>moral and religious self</hi> for Christ, your own righteousness, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. deny sinful self <hi>absolutely, Col.</hi> 3. 4, 5. Deny natural self <hi>conditionally (i. e.)</hi> be ready to forsake its interests at the call of God. Deny your religious self, even your own graces <hi>comparatively,</hi> not in the notion of <hi>duties,</hi> but in the notion of <hi>righteousness:</hi> and to encourage you in this difficult work consider,</p>
                  <p>First, what great things Christ denied for you, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>at small matters you have to deny for him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how readily he denied all for your sakes, making no objections against the difficultest commands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How uncapable you are to put any obligation upon Christ to deny himself in the least for you, and what strong obligations Christ hath put you under to deny your selves in your greatest interests upon earth for him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Remember that your self-denial is a condition consented to, and subscribed by your selves, if ever you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ aright.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In a word, Consider how much your self-denial for Christ makes for your advantage in both worlds, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 29. O therefore look not every man upon his own things, but upon the things that are of Christ, let not that be justly charged upon you which was charged upon them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>All seek their own, not the things which are Christs.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> of Christ in finishing the work of God which was committed to him as a pattern for all believers to imitate. 'Tis said of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38. <hi>He went about doing good.</hi> O what a great and glorious work did Christ finish in a little time! a work to be celebrated to all Eternity by the praises of the redeemed. Six things were very remarkable in the diligence of Christ about his Fathers work.</p>
                  <p>First, That his heart was intently set upon it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Thy Law is in the midst of my heart,</hi> or bowels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he never sainted under the many great discouragements he frequently met withal in that work. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 4. <hi>He shall not fail, nor be discouraged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="508" facs="tcp:54344:275"/>
Thirdly, That the shortness of his time provoked him to the greatest diligence. <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. <hi>I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he improved all opportunities, companies, and occurrences to further the great work which was under his hand. <hi>John</hi> 4. 6, 10.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, nothing more displeased him than when he met with disswasions, and discouragements in his work; upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t it was that he gave <hi>Peter</hi> so sharp a check, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Nothing rejoyced his soul more than the prosperity and success of his work. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20, 21. When the Disciples made the report of the success of their Ministry, it is said, <hi>in that hour Jesus rejoyced in spirit.</hi> And O what a triumphant shout was that upon the cross at the accomplishment of his work, <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. <hi>It is finished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Christians, eye your Pattern, look unto Jesus, trifle not away your lives in vanity. Christ was diligent, be not you slothful. And to encourage you in your imitation of Christ in labour, and diligence, consider,</p>
                  <p>First, How great an honour God puts upon you in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying you for his service: Every vessel of service is a vessel of honour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. The <hi>Apostle</hi> was very ambitious of that honour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 20. It was the glory of <hi>Eliakim</hi> to <note place="margin">

                        </gap>, ambio, dictum verbum ab a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more honoris. <hi>Zanch.</hi>
                     </note> be fastned as a nail in a sure place, and to have many people hang upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 33.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Your diligence in the work of God will be your great security in the hour of temptation, for <hi>the Lord is with you, while you are with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> put the question: How the saints in heaven become impeccable? and resolve it thus, that they are therefore freed from sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are continually employed and swallowed up in the blessed visions of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Diligence in the work of God is an excellent help to the improvement of grace. For though gracious habits are not <hi>acquired,</hi> yet they are greatly <hi>improved</hi> by frequent acts. <hi>To him that hath shall be given, Mat.</hi> 25. 29. It is a good note of <hi>Luther, Fides pinguescit oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="509" facs="tcp:54344:275"/>
Fourthly, Diligence in the work of God is the direct way to the assurance of the love of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 15. 10. This path leads you into heaven upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Diligence in obedience is a great security against backsliding: Small remissions in duty, and little neglects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by degrees unto great Apostasies, you may see how that disease is bred, by the method prescribed for its cure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Do thy first works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In a word, laborious diligence in the day of life will be your singular comfort when the night of death over takes you. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 3.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Delight in God</hi> and in his service was eminently conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the life of Christ, and is a rare pattern for believers imitation. <hi>John</hi> 4. 32, 34. <hi>But he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.</hi> The delights of Christ were all in heaven. The Son of man was in heaven in respect of delight in God, while he conversed here among men. And if you be Christs, heavenly things will be the delight of your souls also. Now spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual delight is nothing else but <hi>the complacency, and well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness of a renewed heart in conversing with God, and the things of God: resulting from the agreeableness of them to the spiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his mind.</hi> Four things are considerable about spiritual delights.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>nature</hi> of it, which consisteth in the complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, rest, and satisfaction of the mind in God, and spiritual things. The heart of a Christian is centred, it is where it would be; it is gratified in the highest in the actings forth of faith and love upon God; as the tast is gratified with a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delicious relish, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 5, 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 14, 24. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>object</hi> of spiritual delight which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the things which relate to him. He is the blessed Ocean into which all the streams of spiritual delight do pour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and on earth there is none that I desire incomparison of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>subject</hi> of spiritual delight, which is a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:54344:276"/>
heart, and that only so far as it is renewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>principle</hi> and spring of this delight which is the agreeable ess of spiritual things to the temper and frame of a renewed mind. A sensitive pleasure arises from the suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the faculty, and object. So it is here, no delicious sweetness can be so pleasant to the taste, or beautiful colours to the eye, or melodious sounds to the ear, as spiritual things to the renewed souls, because spiritual senses are delicate, and the objects more excellent.</p>
                  <p>But my business here is not so much to open its nature, as press you to the practice thereof in conformity to your great pattern, whose life was a life of delight in God, and whose work was performed with the greatest delight for God. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will O my God.</hi> O Christians strive to imitate your pattern in this; and to encourage you, I will briefly hint a few things.</p>
                  <p>First, Scarce any thing can be more evidential of sincerity than a heart delighting in God, and the will of God. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites go as far as others in the material part of duties, but here they are defective, they have no delight in God and things spiritual; but do whatsoever they do in Religion from the compulsions of conscience, or accommodations of self ends.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An heart delighting in God will be a choice help and means to perseverance. The reason why many so easily part with Religion is, because their souls never tasted the sweetness of it: they never delighted in it, but the Christian who delights in the Law of God, will be meditating day and night, and shall be like a tree planted by a river of water whose leaf fadeth not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This will represent Religion very beautifully, and takingly to such as are yet strangers to it: you will then be able to invite them to Christ by your example, the language whereof will be like that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>O taste and see that God is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This will make all your services to God very pleasing and acceptable through Christ, you will now begin to do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven, your duties are so far <hi>Angelical</hi> as they are performed in the strength of delight in God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:54344:276"/>
But may not a sincere Christian act in duty without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? <note place="margin">Obj.</note> yea, may he not feel some kind of weariness in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                  <p>Yes, doubtless he may, but then we must distinguish betwixt the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Distemper</hi> of a renewed heart, the best hearts <note place="margin">Sol.</note> are not always in their right frame.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>inoffensiveness</hi> of the life of Christ upon earth is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern to all his people: he injured none, offended none, but was holy and harmless, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. He denied his own liberty to avoid occasion of offence; as in the case of the Tribute Mony, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 27. <hi>The children are free, notwithstanding lest we should offend them go, &amp;c.</hi> So circumspect was Christ, and inoffensive among all men, that though his enemies sought occasion against him, yet could they find none, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 7. Look unto Jesus, O ye professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, imitate him in this gracious excellency of his life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his command, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>That ye may be harmless and blameless, the Sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.</hi> You are indeed allowed the exercise of your <hi>prudence,</hi> but not a jot farther than will consist with your <hi>innocence. Be ye wise as Serpents, and harmless as Doves.</hi> 'Tis the rule of Christ that you offend none, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. And to engage you to the imitation of Christ in this I will briefly press it with a few encouragements, which methinks should prevail with any heart that's truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p>First, For the honour of Jesus Christ be you inoffensive, his name is called upon you, his honour is concerned in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment: if your carriage in the world give just matter of offence, Christs worthy name will be blasphemed thereby, <hi>James</hi> 2. 7. Your inoffensive carriage is the only means to stop the mouths of detractours, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the sake of souls, the precious immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal souls of others be wary that you give no offence: <hi>wo to the world</hi> saith Christ <hi>because of offences, Mat.</hi> 13. 7. Nothing was more commonly objected against Christ and religion by

                  <p>Thirdly, In a word, answer the ends of God in your san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and providential dispose in the world this way; by the holiness and harmlesness of your lives, many may be won to Christ. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. What the heathens said of moral vertue (which they called <hi>verticordia</hi> turn-heart) that if it were but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to mortal eyes, all men would be enamoured upon it, will be much more true of Religion when you shall represent the beauty of it in your conversations.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>humility</hi> and lowliness of Christ is propounded by himself as a pattern for his peoples imitation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi> He could abase and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty himself of all his glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7.

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:54344:277"/>
your meek and humble Saviour, and tread in his steps, be you <hi>clothed with humility,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. Whoever are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be the worlds <hi>great ones,</hi> let it be enough for you to be Christs <hi>little ones.</hi> Convince the world that since you knew God, and your selves, your pride hath been dying from that day.

In your <hi>language,</hi> that <hi>dialect</hi> befits your lips, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>less than the least of all Saints;</hi> but especially in the low value, and humble thoughts you have of your selves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. And to press this I beseech you to consider,</p>
                  <p>First, From how vile a root pride springs. Ignorance of God and of your selves gives rise and being to this sin: they that know God will be humble, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 5. and they that know themselves cannot be proud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider the mischievous effects it produces: it estrangeth the soul from God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 6. it provokes God to lay you low, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 11, 12. it goes before destruction, and a dreadful fall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 18.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how unsuitable it is to the sense you have, and the complaints you make of your own corruptions, and spiritual wants, and above all, how contrary it is to your <hi>pattern,</hi> and example; did Christ speak, act, or think as you do? O learn humility from Jesus Christ; it will make you precious in the eyes of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>

                  <p>The Contentation of Christ in a low and mean condition in the world is an excellent pattern for his peoples imitation. His lot in this world fell upon a condition of deepest poverty and contempt, yet how well was he satisfied and contented with it! hear him expressing himself about it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heritage.</hi> The contentation of his heart with a suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition evidenced it self in his silence under the greatest suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 7. <hi>He was oppressed and he was afflicted; yet he</hi>

                     <hi>opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</hi> O that in this also the poorest Christians would imitate their Saviour, and learn to manage an afflicted condition with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented spirit: let there be no murmurs, complaints or foolish charges of God heard from you, whatever straits and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he bring you into: For</p>
                  <p>First, The meanest and most afflicted Christian is owner of many rich invaluable mercies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Is sin pardoned and God reconciled? then never open your mouths any more, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You have many precious promises that God will not forsake you in your straits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 17. and your whole life hath been a life of experiences of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in his promises. Which of you cannot say with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>His mercies are new every morning, and great is his faithfulness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How useful, and beneficial are all your afflictions to you! they purge your sins, prevent your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wean you from the world, and turn to your salvation: and how unreasonable then must your discontentedness at them be?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The time of your relief, and full deliverance from all your troubles is at hand: the time is but short that you shall have any concernment about these things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. If the candle of your earthly comfort be blown out, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is but a little while to the break of day, and then there will be no need of candles. Besides,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Your lot falls by Divine direction upon you, and as bad as it is, it is much easier and sweeter than the condition of Christ in this world was. Yet he was contented, and why cannot you? O that we could learn contentment from Christ in every condition.

               <head>DOCT.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That every man is bound to the imitation of Christ, under penalty of forfeiting his claim to Christ. <note place="margin">Doct.</note>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>In prosecution of this point we have already shewn what the imitation of Christ imports, and what the imitable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the life of Christ are: it now remains that I show you in the next place, why all that profess Christ, are bound to imitate his example, and then apply the whole. Now the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of this imitation of Christ will convincingly appear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse ways.</p>
               <p>First, From the established order of salvation which is fixed and unalterable: God that hath appointed the end, hath also <note place="margin">1.</note> established the means and order by which men shall attain the ultimate end. Now Conformity to Christ is the established me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:54344:279"/>
in which God will bring souls to glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate, to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</hi> The same God who hath predestinated men to salvation, hath in order thereunto predestinated them unto Conformity to Christ, and this order of heaven is never to be reversed, we may as well hope to be saved without Christ, as to be saved without Conformity to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The nature of Christ mystical requires this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <note place="margin">2.</note> and renders it indispensably necessary. Otherwise, the body of Christ must be <hi>heterogeneous;</hi> of a nature different from the head: and how monstrous, and uncomely would this be? This would represent Christ to the world in an image, or <hi>Idea,</hi> much like that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 32, 33. <hi>The head of fine gold, the breast and arms of silver, the thighs of brass, the legs of iron, the feet part of iron, part of clay.</hi> Christ the head is pure and holy, and therefore very unsuitable to sensual and earthly members. And therefore the Apostle in his description of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Christ describes the members of Christ (as they ought to be) of the same nature and quality with the head. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 48. <hi>As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly; and as we have born the image of the earthy, so we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</hi> That image or resemblance of Christ which shall be compleat and perfect after the Resurrection, must be begun in its first draught here, by the work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This resemblance and conformity to Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <note place="margin">3.</note> necessary from the communion which all believers have with Christ in the same Spirit of grace and holiness. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are called Christs <hi>fellows</hi> or copartners, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. from their participation with him of the same spirit, as it is, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 8. God giveth the same spirit unto us which he more plentifully poured out upon Christ. Now where the same spirit and principle is, there the same fruits and operations must be produced, according to the proportions and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the spirit of grace communicated; and this reason is farther enforced by the very design and end of God in the infusion of the spirit of grace: for it is plain from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. that practical holiness, and obedience is the scope, and design of that infusion of the spirit. The very inna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:54344:279"/>
of the spirit of God in men is to elevate their minds, and set their affections upon heavenly things, to purge their hearts from earthly dross, and fit them for a life of holiness and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: its nature also is assimilating and changeth them in whom it is into the same image with Jesus Christ their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly head, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The necessity of this imitation of Christ may be argued from the design and end of Christs exhibition to the <note place="margin">4.</note> world in a body of flesh. For though we detest that doctrine of the <hi>Socinians</hi> which makes the exemplary life of Christ to be upon the matter, the whole end of his incarnation: yet we must not run so far from an error as to lose a precious truth. We say the satisfaction of his blood was a main and principal end of his Incarnation, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. We affirm also that it was a great design and end of the Incarnation of Christ to set before us a pattern of holiness for our imitation. For so speaks the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>He hath left us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we should follow his steps.</hi> And this example of Christ greatly obliges believers to his imitation. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, our imitation of Christ is one of those great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which every man is to subscribe, whom Christ will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">5.</note> into the number of his disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth not come after me, cannot be my disciple.</hi> And again <hi>John</hi> 12. 26. <hi>If any man serve me, let him follow me.</hi> To this condition we have submitted if we be sincere believers, and therefore are strictly bound to the imitation of Christ, not only by Gods <hi>command,</hi> but by our own <hi>consent.</hi> But if we profess interest in Christ, when our hearts never consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow and imitate his example; then are we self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving hypocrites, wholly disagreeing from the scripture character of believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. They that are Christs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there described to be such as walk not after the flesh but after the spirit: and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The honour of Christ necessitates the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christians to his example, else what way is there left <note place="margin">6.</note> to stop detracting mouths, and vindicate the name of Christ from the reproaches of the world? how can wisdom be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:54344:280"/>
of her children, except it be this way? by what means shall we cut off occasion from such as desire occasion, but by regulating our lives by Christs example? The world hath eyes to see what we <hi>practise,</hi> as well as ears to hear what we <hi>profess.</hi> Therefore either shew the consistency betwixt your profession and practice, or you can never hope to vindicate the name and honour of the Lord Jesus.

                        <note place="margin">Inference 1.</note> 
                        <hi>by the world with the scandals, and evils of them that profess it.</hi> Nothing can be more unjust, and irrational if we consider</p>
                     <p>First, That Christian Religion severely censures loose and scandalous actions in all professors: and therefore is not to be censured for them. 'Tis absurd to condemn Religion, for what it self condemns: Looseness no way flowes from the principles of Christianity, but is most opposite, and contrary to it, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath appeared to all men: teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is an argument of the excellency of Christian Religion, that even wicked men themselves covet the name, and profession of it, though they only cloak, and cover their evils under it. I confess it is a great abuse of such an excellent thing as Religion is, but yet if it had not an awful reverence paid it by the consciences of all men, it would never be abused to this purpose by hypocrites, as it is.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, According to this reasoning there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world, for name me that Religion which is not scandalized by the practices of some that profess it. So that this

                        <hi>him in the holiness of his life, then how small a number of real Christians are there in the world?</hi> Indeed if liberal talking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accurate walking, if common profession without holy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices were enough to constitute a Christian: then this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world would abound with Christians. But if Christ owns none for such, but those that tread in the steps of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, then the number of real Christians is very small. The generality of men that live under the Christian name are such as walk after the flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. according to the course of this world, they yield their members as instruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness unto sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. strict godliness is a meer bondage to them; narrow is the way, and few there be that walk therein.</p>

                        <hi>Hence it also follows, That real Christians are the sweetest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi> 'Tis a comfortable thing to walk with them that walk <note place="margin">Inference 4.</note> after the example of Christ. The holiness, heavenliness, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, self-denial, and diligence in obedience which was in Christ, is in some measure to be found in all sincere Christians. They shew forth the vertues of him that calleth them. The graces of the spirit do more or less shine forth in them. And Oh how endearing, sweet and engaging are these things? upon this very account the <hi>Apostle</hi> invited others into the fellowship of the saints, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>That ye may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Christ Jesus:</hi> And is it not sweet to have fellowship with them, who have fellowship with Christ? O let all your delights be in the Saints, and in the excellent of the earth who excel in vertue, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 3. Yet mistake not, there is a great deal of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt one Christian and another, and even the best of Christians are sanctified but in part.

            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Scripture represents unto us the miserable and lamentable state of the unregenerate, as being under the power of spiritual death, which is the cause and in-let of all other miseries. From hence therefore I shall make the first discovery of the woful and wretched state of them that apply not Jesus Christ to their own souls.</p>
            <p>The scope of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this <hi>Context,</hi> is to press believers to a circumspect and holy life; to <hi>walk as children of light.</hi> This exhortation is laid down in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and pressed by diverse arguments in the following verses.</p>
            <p>First, from the tendency of holy principles unto holy fruits and practices, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the convincing efficacy of practical godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon the consciences of the wicked, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. It awes and convinces their consciences.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the co incidence of such a conversation with the great design and drift of the scriptures: which is to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken men by regeneration out of that spiritual sleep, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death which sin hath cast them into: And this is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:54344:285"/>
of the Text: <hi>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, &amp;c.</hi> There is some difficulty in the reference of these words. Some think it refers to <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust.</hi> Others to <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 1. <hi>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, &amp;c.</hi> But most probably the words neither refer to this or that particularly, but to the drift and scope of the whole Scriptures, which were inspired and written upon this great design to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and quicken souls out of the state of spiritual death. And in them we are to consider these three things more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and particularly.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The miserable state of the unregenerate, they are <hi>asleep and dead.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Their duty, which is to <hi>awake, and stand up from the dead.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The power enabling them thereunto: <hi>Christ shall give thee light.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, The miserable state of the unregenerate, represented under the Notions of <hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> both expressions intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1.</note> one and the same thing, though with some variety of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Christless and unregenerate world is in a deep sleep; a spirit of slumber, senselesness and security is fallen upon them, though they lie exposed immediately to eternal wrath and misery, ready to drop into hell every moment. Just as a man that is fast asleep in a house on fire, and whilst the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming flames are round about him, his fancy is sporting it self in some pleasant dream, this is a very lively resemblance of the unregenerate soul. But yet he that sleeps hath the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life entire in him though his senses be bound, and the actions of life suspended by sleep. Lest therefore we should think it is only so with the unregenerate, the expression is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly varied, and those that were said to be <hi>asleep,</hi> are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirmed to be <hi>dead;</hi> on purpose to inform us that it is not a simple <hi>suspension</hi> of the acts and exercise, but a total <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the principle of spiritual life which is the misery of the unregenerate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have here the duty of the unregenerate which is to <hi>awake out of sleep, and arise from the dead.</hi> This is their great <note place="margin">2.</note> concernment: no duty in the world is of greater necessity and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:54344:285"/>
importance to them. <hi>Strive</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>to enter in at the strait gate, Luke</hi> 13. 24. And the order of these duties is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural. First awake, then arise. Startling and rousing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions make way for spiritual life: till God awake us by convictions of our misery, we will never be perswaded to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, and move towards Christ, for remedy and safety.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But you will say, if unregenerate men be dead men, to what purpose is it to perswade them to arise and stand up? <note place="margin">3.</note> The very exhortation supposes some power or ability in the <note place="margin">Quamvis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba videntur velle primum excitari, &amp; surgere, deinde illuminari: tamen intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum est, vi lucis Christi excitari eum, &amp; surgere. <hi>Roll. in Loc.</hi>
               </note> unregenerate; else in vain are they commanded to arise. This difficulty is solved in this very Text, though the duty be ours, yet the power is Gods. God commands that in his word, which only his grace can perform. <hi>Christ shall give thee light.</hi> Popish Commentators would build the power of free will upon this Scripture, by a very weak argument drawn from the order wherein these things are here expressed: which is but a weak foundation to build upon, for it is very usual in Scripture to put the effect before, and the cause after, as it is here, so in <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust.</hi> But I will not here intangle my discourse with that controversie, that which I aim at is plain in the words, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>Multitudes of testimonies are given in Scripture to this truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 5. <hi>You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins.</hi> Col. 2. 13. <hi>And you being dead in your sint, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him:</hi> with many other places of the same importance. But the method in which I shall discourse this point will be this.</p>
               <p>First, I will shew you in what sence Christless and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are said to be dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what the state of spiritual death is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how it appears that all unregenerate men are in this sad state. And then apply it.</p>

               <p>Natural death is nothing else but the privation of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of natural life, or the separation of the soul from the body, <hi>James</hi> 2. 26. <hi>The body without the spirit is dead.</hi> Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death is the privation of the principle of spiritual life, or the want and absence of the quickening spirit of God in the foul: the soul is the life of the body, and Christ is the life of the soul: the absence of the foul is death to the body, and the absence or want of Christ is death to the soul. Eternal death is the separation both of body and soul from God, which is the misery of the damned. Now Christless and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men are not dead in the first sense: they are naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, though they are dead while they live: Nor are they yet dead in the last sense, eternally separated from God, by an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable sentence as the damned are: but they are dead in the second sense, they are spiritually dead, whilst they are naturally alive, and this spiritual death is the fore-runner of eternal death. Now spiritual death is put in scripture in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to a two-fold spiritual life.</p>

               <p>Spiritual death in opposition to the life of Justification is nothing else but the guilt of sin, bringing us under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death. Spiritual death in opposition to the life of sanctification is the pollution or dominion of sin. In both these fen ses unregenerate men are dead men but: it is the last which I am properly concerned to speak to in this place, and therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us briefly consider what this spiritual death is, which as before was hinted is the absence of the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2.</note> spirit of Christ from the soul of any man. That soul is a dead soul into which the spirit of Christ is not infused in the work of regeneration, and all its works are dead works, as
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54344:286"/>
they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. For look how it is with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they live, they have sense and motion, and an immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in all these, yet because they are eternally separated from God, the life which they live, deserves not the name of life, but is every where in scripture stiled death: So the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they are naturally alive: they eat, and drink, they buy, and sell, they talk, and laugh, they rejoyce in the creatures; and many of them spend their days in pleasures, and then go down to the grave. This is the life they live, but yet the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather calls it death than life, because though they live, yet it is without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Though they live, yet it is a life alienated from the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. And therefore while they remain naturally alive, they are in scripture said <hi>to remain in death,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. and to be <hi>dead while they live;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. And there is great reason why a Christless and unregenerate state should be represented in scripture under the notion of death, for there is nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which more aptly represents that miserable state of the soul than natural death doth. The dead see and discern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the natural man perceiveth not the things that are of God. The dead have no beauty or desirableness in them, <hi>Bury my dead,</hi> said <hi>Abraham, out of my sight:</hi> neither is there any spiritual loveliness in the unregenerate. True it is some of them have sweet natural qualities, and moral excellencies which are taking things; but these are as so many flowers decking and adorning a dead corpse. The dead are Objects of pity, and great lamentation, men use to mourn for the dead, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.</hi> But unregenerate, and Christless souls are much more the Objects of pity and lamentation. How are all the people of God (especially those that are naturally related to them) concerned to mourn over them, and for them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did for <hi>Ishmael, Gen.</hi> 17. 18. <hi>O that Ishmael might live before thee.</hi> Upon these, and many other accounts the state of unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is represented to us in the notion of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And that this is the state of all Christless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified persons will undeniably appear two ways. <note place="margin">3.</note>

them, and therefore they are in the state, and under the power of spiritual death.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, The causes of spiritual life have not wrought upon them. There are two causes of spiritual life.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Principal and internal.</item>
                  <item>2. Subordinate and external.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The principal internal cause of spiritual life is the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</hi> 'Tis the spirit as a regenerating spirit that unites us with Christ in whom all spiritual life originally is, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25, 26. <hi>Verily I say unto you that the hour is coming, and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; for as the father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself.</hi> As all the members of the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receive animation, sense, and motion by their Union with their natural head; so all believers the members of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive spiritual life and animation by their Union with Christ their mystical head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16. Except we come to him and be united with him in the way of faith, we can have no life in us, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life.</hi> Now the spirit of God hath yet exerted no regenerating, quickening influences, nor begotten any special saving faith in natural unsanctified men; whatever he hath done for them in the way of natural, or spiritual common gifts, yet he hath not quickened them with the life of Christ. And as for the subordinate external means of life, <hi>viz.</hi> the preaching of the Gospel which is the instrument of the spirit in this glorious work, and is therefore called <hi>the word of life, Phil.</hi> 2. 16. this word hath not yet been made a regenerating quickening word to their souls. Possibly it hath enlightned them, and convinced them: it hath wrought upon their minds in the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illumination, and upon their consciences in the way of conviction; but not upon their hearts and wills by way of effectual conversion: To this day the Lord hath not given them an heart opening it self in the way of faith to receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:54344:287"/>
Secondly, The effects, and signs of spiritual life do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them: for</p>
               <p>First, They have no <hi>feeling</hi> or sense of misery and danger. I mean no such sense as throwly awakens them to apply Christ their remedy. That spiritual judgment lies upon them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>And he said go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, and see ye indeed, but perceive not, make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They have no spiritual <hi>motions</hi> towards Christ, or after things that are spiritual, all the Arguments in the world cannot perswade their wills to move one step towards Christ in the way of faith, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me:</hi> Were there a principle of spiritual life in their souls, they would move Christ-ward, and heaven-ward, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. it would be in them a well of water springing up into eternal life. The natural tendency of the spiritual life is upward.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The unregenerate have no <hi>appetite</hi> unto spiritual food, they savour not things that are spiritual; they can go from week to week, and from year to year, all their life time without any communion betwixt God and their souls, and feel no need of it, nor any hungerings, nor thirstings after it, which could never be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> a principle of spiritual life were in them, for then they would <hi>esteem the words of Gods mouth more than their necessary food,</hi> Job 30. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They have no <hi>heat,</hi> or spiritual <hi>warmth</hi> in their affections to God, and things above, their hearts are as cold as a stone to spiritual Objects. They are heated indeed by their lusts and affections to the world, and the things of the world; But O how cold and dead are they towards Jesus Christ and spiritual excellencies!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They <hi>breathe</hi> not spiritually, therefore they live not spiritually: were there a spiritual principle of life in them, their souls would breath after God in spiritual prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi> The lips of the unregenerate may move in prayer, but their hearts and desires do not breath and pant after God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They have no cares or fears for <hi>self-preservation</hi> which is always the effect of life, the poorest fly or silliest worm will shun danger: the wrath of God hangs over them in the threatnings, but they tremble not at it: Hell is but a little
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:54344:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before them, they are upon the very precipice of eternal ruine; yet will use no means to avoid it. How plain therefore is this sad case which I have undertaken here to demonstrate, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that Christless and unregenerate souls are dead souls? The uses follow.</p>

'Tis true, there is a necessary civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse which we must have with the ungodly here, or else (as the Apostle speaks) we must go out of the world.

Just thus stands the case with false and hypocritical prosessours, who though they were still under the power of spiritual death, yet in the beginning of their profession they seemed to be alive. They shewed the world the fragrant leaves of a fair profession: many hopeful buddings of affection towards spiritual things were seen in them, but wanting a root of regeneration, they quickly began to wither, and cast their untimely fruit. However, by the help of ordinances, or some rouzing and awakening providences they seem to recover themselves again: but all will not do, the fault is <hi>ab intra</hi> from the want of a good root, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at last they who were always <hi>once dead,</hi> for want of a principle of regeneration; are now become <hi>twice dead,</hi> by the withering and decay of their vain profession.

Neither doth Christ cure any but those that believingly apply him to their own souls. The result and conclusion of all you have in my Text, <hi>He that believeth in him is not condemned: but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is condemned already, &amp;c.</hi> In this clause which I have pitched upon, we find these three parts.</p>

               <item>2. The punishment inflicted, <hi>viz.</hi> Condemnation.</item>
               <item>3. The immediate relation of the one to the other; he is condemned already.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="540" facs="tcp:54344:291"/>
First, Let us take into consideration the sin which is here threatned, <hi>viz. unbelief.</hi> The neglecting or refusing of an <note place="margin">1.</note> exalted and offered Jesus. Unbelief is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> Negative, or Positive. <hi>Negative</hi> unbelief is the sin of the heathens, who never had the Gospel among them, nor the offers of Christ made to them: these cannot believe on him of whom they have not heard. <hi>Positive</hi> unbelief is the sin of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under the Gospel, to whom Christ is actually opened and offered by the preaching of the Gospel, but they make light of it, neglect the great salvation; receive not Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, nor consent to the severe, and self denying terms upon which he is offered. This is the sin threatned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The punishment inflicted, and that is <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> a word of deep and dreadful signification, appearing in this Text as the hand-writing upon the plaister of the wall unto <hi>Belteshazzar, Dan.</hi> 5. 5. A word whose deep sense and Emphasis is fully understood in hell. <hi>Condemnation</hi> is the Judgment or Sentence of God condemning a man to bear the punishment of his eternal wrath for sin, the most terrible of all sentences.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The immediate relation, or respect this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">3.</note> hath to that sin of unbelief. The unbeliever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he is virtually condemned by the law of God: His <hi>mittimus</hi> is already made for hell, he is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>sinner,</hi> by the breach o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the first Covenant; but that condemnation had never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n his ruine, except it had been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the sentence of God, condemning him as an <hi>unbeliever,</hi> for slighting and rejecting the grace offered in the second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. So that the unbeliever is already virtually condemned by both, as he is a sinner, and as he is an unbeliever, as he hath transgressed the law, and as he hath refused the gospel, as he hath contracted sin the mortal <hi>disease,</hi> and refused Christ the only effectual <hi>remedy.</hi> He is virtually condemned now, and will be sententially condemned in the Judgment of the great day. Unbelief is his great sin, and condemnation is his great misery. Hence the observation will be this.</p>

                  <p>That all unbelievers are presently and immediately under the <note place="margin">Doct.</note> just and dreadful sentence of Gods Condemnation. <hi>John</hi> 12. 48.

He that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Three things are to be opened in the Doctrinal part of this point.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What unbelief or the not receiving of Jesus Christ is.</item>
                  <item>2. What condemnation the punishment of this sin is.</item>
                  <item>3. Why this punishment unavoidably follows that sin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, What the sin of unbelief or not receiving Christ is. By unbelief we are not here to understand the reliques or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <note place="margin">1.</note> of that sin in the people of God which is mixed with their imperfect faith, for there is some unbelief still mingled with faith in the best hearts. He that can say <hi>Lord I believe,</hi> hath cause enough to cry out with tears <hi>help thou my unbelief.</hi> However, this doth not bring the soul under condemnation or into the state of wrath. The word condemns this unbelief in them, but doth not condemn their persons for this unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But the unbelief here spoken of is the neglecting or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to take Christ upon the terms of the Gospel, and so is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of the saving act or effects of faith.</p>
               <p>First, It is exclusive of the saving act of faith which (as hath been already declared) is the due receiving of Christ offered in the Gospel, consenting to take him upon his own terms. This the unbeliever will by no means be perswaded to do. He will be perswaded to accept the promises of Christ, but not to accept the person of Christ: he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept Christ in part, a divided Christ, but not to accept Christ entirely in all his offices. He will accept the righteousness of Christ, in conjunction with his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but he will not accept the righteousness of Christ as the sole matter of his Justification exclusive of his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; he is willing to wear the Crown of Christ, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:54344:292"/>
be perswaded to bear the cross of Christ. Thus Christ and unbelievers part upon terms, God will come down no lower, and the unbeliever will come up no higher. God will not alter his terms, and the unbeliever will not alter his resolution, and so Christ is refused, Salvation neglected, and in effect the unbeliever chooseth rather to be damned, than to comply with the severe terms of self-denial, mortification, and bearing the cross of Christ. Thus it excludes the saving act of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is exclusive of the saving fruits and effects of faith. Faith produces love to God, but the unbeliever doth not truly love him. <hi>But I know you</hi> (saith Christ to unbelievers) <hi>that the love of God is not in you, John</hi> 5. 42. Faith purifies the heart of a believer, but the hearts of unbelievers are full of all impurity. The believer overcomes the world, the world overcomes the unbeliever: Faith makes the Cross of Christ sweet and easie to the believer, Unbelief makes Christ because of the Cross bitter and distastful to the unbeliever. Thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief excludes both the saving act and fruits of faith, and consequently bars the soul from the saving benefits and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification, and peace with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next let us consider the punishment of this sin which is condemnation. Condemnation in the general is the <note place="margin">2.</note> sentence of a Judge awarding a mulct, or penalty to be inflicted upon the guilty person. There is a twofold Condemnation.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Respectu culp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> in respect of the fault.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Respectu poenae,</hi> in respect of the punishment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, Condemnation with respect to the fault is the casting of the person as guilty of the crime charged upon him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with respect to the punishment is the sentencing of the convicted offender to undergo such a punishment for such a fault, to bear a penal for a moral evil. This <hi>forensick</hi> word Condemnation is here applied unto the case of a guilty sinner cast at the bar of God, where the fact is clearly proved, and the punishment righteously awarded. Thou art an unbeliever, for this sin thou shalt die eternally. Condemnation with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the fault stands opposed to Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16.
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:54344:292"/>
Condemnation with respect to the punishment stands opposed to Salvation, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. More particularly,</p>
               <p>First, Condemnation is the sentence of God: the great and terrible God, the omniscient, omnipotent, supream, and impartial Judge, at whose b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r the guilty sinner stands. 'Tis the Law of God that condemns him now. He hath one that judgeth him, a great and terrible one too. 'Tis a dreadful thing to be condemned at mans bar. But the Courts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Judicature, how awful and solemn soever they are, are but trifles, and childrens play to this Court of heaven and conscience; wherein the unbeliever is arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis the sentence of God adjudging the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to eternal death: than which nothing is more terrible. What is a prison to hell? what is a Scaffold, and an Ax, to <hi>go ye cursed into everlasting fire?</hi> What is a Gallows and a Halter to everlasting burnings?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Condemnation is the final sentence of God, the Supream Judge, from whose Bar and Judgment there lies no appeal for the unbeliever, but Execution certainly follows Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. If man condemn, God may justifie, and save: But if God condemn, no man can save or deliver. If the law cast a man as a sinner, the Gospel may save him as a believer: But if the Gospel cast him as an unbeliever, a man that finally rejects Jesus Christ whom it offers to him; all the world cannot save that man. O then what a dreadful word is Condemnation! All the evils and miseries of this life are nothing to it: put all afflictions, calamities, sufferings, and miseries of this world into one scale, and this sentence of God into the other, and they will all be lighter than a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the next place, I shall shew you that this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, <hi>viz.</hi> Condemnation, must unavoidably follow that sin of unbelief. So many unbelieving persons as be in the world, so many condemned persons there are in the world, and this will appear two ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By considering what unbelief excludes a man from.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="544" facs="tcp:54344:293"/>
First, Let us consider what unbelief excludes a man from, and it will be found that it excludes him from all that may help and save him: for</p>
               <p>First, it excludes him from the pardon of sin. <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</hi> Now he that dies under the guilt of all his sins must needs die in a state of wrath and condemnation for ever. <hi>For the wages of sin is death, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> If a man may be saved without a pardon, then may the unbeliever hope to be saved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Unbelief excludes a man from all the saving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that come by the sacrifice or death of Christ. For if faith be the only instrument that applies and brings home to the soul the benefits of the blood of Christ, as unquestionably it is: then unbelief must of necessity exclude a man from all those benefits, and consequently leave him in the state of death and condemnation. Faith is the applying cause, the instrument by which we receive the special saving benefit of the blood of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>By grace are ye saved through faith.</hi> So then if the unbeliever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and saved, it must be without the benefit of Christs death and sacrifice, which is utterly impossible.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unbelief excludes a man from the saving efficacy and operation of the Gospel, by shutting up the heart against it, and crossing the main drift and scope of it, which is to bring up men to the terms of salvation: to perswade them to believe, this is its great design, the scope of all its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>John</hi> 12. 36. 'Tis the scope of all its promises, they are written to encourage men to believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35, 37. So then, if the unbeliever escape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, it must be in a way unknown to us by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: Yea, contrary to the established order therein. For the unbeliever obeyeth not the great command of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. Nor is he under any one saving promise of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14, 22.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Unbelief excludes a man from Union with Christ: faith being the bond of that Union, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. The unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore may as reasonably expect to be saved without Christ, as to be saved without faith. Thus you see what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief excludes a man from.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:54344:293"/>
Secondly, Let us next see what guilt and misery unbelief includes men under, and certainly it will be found to be the greatest guilt and misery in the world: For</p>
               <p>First, It is a sin which reflects the greatest dishonour upon God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself. He that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record which God gave of his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Unbelief makes a man guilty of the vilest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Christ and the whole design of Redemption ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by him. All the glorious attributes of God were signally manifested in the work of Redemption by Christ, therefore the Apostle calls him <hi>the wisdom of God, and the power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 24. But what doth the careless neglect, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rejection of Christ speak, but the weakness and folly of that design of Redemption by him?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unbelief includes in it the sorest spiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is or can be inflicted in this world upon the soul of man: Even spiritual blindness, and the fatal darkening of the understanding by Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. of which, more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Unbelief includes a man under the curse, and shuts him up under all the threatnings that are written in the book of God, amongst which that is an express and terrible one, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 10. <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident than this, that condemnation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows unbelief. This sin and that punishment are fastned together, with chains of Adamant.</p>

the conscience, as some other sins do, but it kills the soul more certainly than any of those sins could do: for indeed other sins could not damn us, were it not for unbelief, which fixes the guilt of them all upon our persons. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Unbelief is the sin of sins, and when the spirit comes to convince men of sin, he begins with this as the capital sin, <hi>John</hi> 16. 9. But more particularly,</p>
                     <p>First, Estimate the evil of unbelief from its Object. It is the slighting and refusing of the most excellent and wonderful person in heaven or earth. The <hi>fiducial</hi> vision of Christ is the joy of Saints on earth; the <hi>facial</hi> vision of Christ, is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Saints in heaven.

                     <p>Secondly, Let the evil of unbelief be valued by the offer of Christ to our souls in the Gospel: 'tis one part of the great mystery of godliness, that Christ should be preached to the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. That the word of this salvation should be sent to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 26.

First, We have here the aggravation of sin by the abuse of Gospel Light, <hi>Light is come.</hi> By Light we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <note place="margin">1.</note> the knowledge, discovery and manifestation of Christ, and Redemption by him in the Gospel. He is the Son of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness that arises in the Gospel upon the nations, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. When he came in the flesh, then did <hi>the day-spring from on high visit us, Luke</hi> 1. 78. And the light may be said to come two ways, either</p>
            <p>First, In the means by which it is conveyed to us, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the efficacy of it upon our minds, when it actually shines into our souls. Light may come among a people in the means, and yet they actually remain in darkness all the while. As it is in nature, The sun may be up and a very glorious morning far advanced, whilst many thousands are drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon their beds with their curtains drawn about them. Light in the <hi>means,</hi> we may call <hi>potential Light.</hi> Light in the <hi>mind</hi> we may cali <hi>actual light.</hi> It<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but seldom that light comes in the means, and continues long among men, but some light must needs actually shine into their souls also: but this actual light is twofold,
<list>
                  <item>1. Common and intellectual only to <hi>conviction,</hi> or</item>
                  <item>2. Special and efficacious light, bringing the foul to Christ, by real <hi>conversion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
call'd in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.—Gods <hi>shining into the heart.</hi> Where ever light comes in this last sense, it is impossible that such men should prefer darkness before it; but it may come in the means, yea, it may actually shine into the consciences of men by those means and convince them of their sins, and yet men may hate it, and choose darkness rather than light. And this is the sense of this place, Light was come in the Gospel dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, yea, it hath shined into many of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, gauled, and reproved them for sin, but they hated it, and had rather be without such a troublesome inmate. In a word, by the coming of light, we are here to understand a more clear and open manifestation of Christ by the Gospel than ever was made to the world before: for we are not to think that there was
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:54344:297"/>
no light in the world till Christ came, and the Gospel was published in the world by the Apostles ministry. For <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> saw Christ's day, <hi>John</hi> 8. 56. and all the faithful before Christ saw the promises <hi>(i. e.)</hi> their accomplishment in Christ afar off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. for it was with Christ the Son of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness as it is with the natural Sun, which illuminates the <hi>hemisphere</hi> before it actually rises, or shews its body above the <hi>Horizon:</hi> but when it rises and shews it self, the light is much <note place="margin">Sol nondu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> conspectus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat orbem.</note> clearer; so it was in this case. The greater therefore was their sin, that rebelled against it, and preferred darkness to light: this was their sin, with its fearful aggravation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In a most just proportion to this sin we have <note place="margin">2.</note> here the aggravated condemnation of them who sinned against such clear Gospel-light: <hi>This is the condemnation,</hi> this is the judgement of all judgements, the greatest and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable judgement: a severer sentence of condemnation than ever did pass against any others that sinned in the times of ignorance and darkness: they that live and dye impenitent and unregenerate how few soever the means of salvation have been which they have enjoyed, must be condemned: yea, the <hi>Pagan</hi> world who have no more but natural light to help them, will be condemned by that light: but <hi>this is the condemnation (i. e.)</hi> such sinning as this is the cause of the greatest condemnation, and sorest punishment, as it's called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The cause and occasion drawing men into this sin and misery: <hi>because their deeds were evil, (i. e.)</hi> the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <note place="margin">3.</note> light of truth put a great deal of vigour and activity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Consciences which they could not endure. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations and condemnations of Conscience are very irksome and troublesome things to men: to avoid this they were willing to be ignorant. An enlightned Conscience gives an interruption also unto men in their sinful courses and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: they cannot sin at so easie a rate in the light as they did in darkness; and this made them hate the light as a very troublesom thing to them. Thus you see what was the sin, and what the punishment, and what the cause of both.</p>

               </list>
               <p>First, We will enquire into the grounds and reasons why greater and clearer light greatens and aggravates proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably <note place="margin">2.</note> the sins that are committed under it: and it will appear that it doth so upon divers accounts.</p>
               <p>First, All light (especially Evangelical-light) is a great preservative from sin; and an excellent means to prevent it: 'tis the property of light to inform the judgement and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the mistakes and errors of it, and thereby to give check to the affections in the pursuit of sinful designs and courses: 'tis a plain case, that many men would never do as they do if their understandings were better informed, 1 Cor. 2. 8. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> It was want of light and better information which drew them under that horrid and unparallel'd guilt. Our Saviour also supposes in the place before cited: that if <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> had enjoyed the same light and means of grace that <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida</hi> did; they would never have been so sinful as they were:
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:54344:298"/>
light discovers danger, and thereby overaws and stops men from proceeding farther in those paths and courses that will run them into it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, sinning under and against the light, supposes and involves in it a greater contempt and despight of Gods authority than sinning in ignorance and darkness doth: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that breaks the law of God doth not in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree despise and slight the authority of the Law maker: but when a man hath light to discover the evil and danger of what he doth, and yet will dare to do it; what is this but the tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods authority under foot? the casting of his word behind our backs? Wilfull sinning is a despightful sinning against God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. it argues a low and vile esteem of the law of God which is reverent and holy: and by so much the more it maketh sin to be exceeding sinful.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sinning under, and against the light admits not of those excuses and pleas to extenuate the offence, which sins of pure ignorance do. Those that live without the sound of the Gospel may say, Lord, we never heard of Christ and the great redemption wrought by him: if we had, we would never have lived and acted as we did: and therefore Christ saith, Joh. 15. 22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is, that if the Gospel-light had not shined among them, their sin had not been of that deep guilt that now it is: for now it is so foul and heinous by reason of the light under, and against which it is committed, that they have no pretence or excuse to extenuate or mitigate it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Evangelical light is a very rich favour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to men: one of the choicest gifts bestowed upon the Nations of the world; and therefore it's said, Psal. 147. 19, 20. <hi>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgements unto Israel: he hath not dealt so with any nation, and as for his judgements they have not known them</hi> Other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have Corn and Wine, Gold and Silver, abundance of earthly delights and pleasures: but they have not a beam of heavenly light shining upon them. We may account this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy small, but God who is best able to value the worth of it, accounts it great, Hos. 8. 12. <hi>I have written unto them the great things of my Law.</hi> Christ reckoned <hi>Capernaum</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:54344:299"/>
unto Heaven by the Ministry of the Gospel in that place. Now the greater the mercy is which the light of truth brings with it, by so much the more horrid and heinous must the abusing and despising of it be.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Sinning against the light argues a love to sin as sin: to naked sin without any disguise or covert. It is nothing so bad for a man to sin through a mistake of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when he thinks that to be lawful which is indeed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he doth not now close with sin as sin: but he either closes with it as his duty, or at least his liberty. 'Tis hard for Satan to perswade many men to embrace a naked sin, and therefore he cloaths it in the habit of a duty or liberty, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and draws men to the commission of it. But if a man have light shining into his Conscience, and convincing him that the way he is in is the way of sin quite contrary to the revealed will of God; stripping the sin naked before the eye of his Conscience, so that he hath no covert or excuse, and yet will persist in it: this, I say, argues a soul to be in love with sin as sin. Now as for a man to love grace as grace, is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid argument to prove the truth of his grace; so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for a man to love sin as sin, doth not only argue him to be in the state of sin, but to be in the forefront, and among the highest rank of sinners.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The greater and clearer the light is, under and against which men continue in sin, the more must the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of such sinners be supposed to be wasted and violated by such a way of sinning: for this is a sure rule, that the <note place="margin">Maxima vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                     </gap>m.</note> greatest violation of Conscience is the greatest sin. Conscience is a noble and tender part of the soul of man, it is in the soul as the eye in the body, very sensible of the least injury, and a wound in the Conscience is like a blow in the eye: but nothing gives a greater blow to Conscience, nothing so much wastes it and destroys it as sins against the light do: this puts a plain force upon the Conscience, and gives a dreadful stab to that noble power: Gods vicegerent in the soul. And thus you see the first thing made good, that light puts deep guilt and aggravation into sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place let us examine why sin so ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the light, makes men liable to the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: <note place="margin">2.</note> for that it doth so is beyond all debate or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:54344:299"/>
else the <hi>Apostle Peter</hi> would not have said of those sinners against light as he doth, 2 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>That it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness:</hi> nor would Christ have told the Inhabitants of <hi>Chorazin</hi> or <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> that it should be more tolerable for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> in the day of Judgement than for them. There is a twofold reason of this.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Ex parte Dei,</hi> on Gods part.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Ex parte Peccatoris,</hi> on the Sinners part.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>Ex parte Dei,</hi> on Gods part, who is the righteous Judge of the whole earth, and will therefore render unto every man according as his works shall be: for shall not the Judge of the whole earth do right? he will judge the world in righteousness, and righteousness requires that difference be made in the punishment of Sinners according to the different degrees of their sins. Now that there are different degrees of sin is abundantly clear from what we have lately discoursed under the former head: where we have shewed that the light under which men sin, puts extraordinary aggravations upon their sins: answerable whereunto will the degrees of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be awarded by the righteous Judge of Heaven and earth. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> who had no other light but that dim light of nature, will be condemned for disobeying the law of God written upon their hearts: but yet greater wrath is reserved for them who sin both against the light of nature, and the light of the Gospel also: and therefore it is said, Rom. 2. 9. <hi>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.</hi> Impenitent Jews and Gentiles will all be condemned at the Bar of God: but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the Jew first, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> principally and especially because the light and mercy which he abused and violated were far greater than those bestowed upon the Gentiles, <hi>because unto them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> and God had not dealt with any Nation as with that Nation. Indeed in the rewards of obedience the same reason doth not hold: he that came into the Vineyard at the last hour of the day may be equal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with him that bare the heat and burthen of the whole
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:54344:300"/>
day, because the reward is of grace and bounty, not of debt and merit: but it is not so here, justice observes an exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in distributing punishments according to the degrees, deserts and measures of sin; and therefore it is said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18. 7. <hi>How much she had glorified her self and lived deliciously; so much torment and sorrow give her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ex parte Peccatoris,</hi> upon the account of sinners it must needs be, that the heaviest wrath and most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments should be the portion of them who have sinned under and against the clearest light and means of grace: for we find in the Scripture account, that a principal and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of the torment of the damned will arise from their own Consciences, Mark 9. 44. <hi>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched:</hi> and nothing is more manifest than this, that if Conscience be the tormentor of the damned, then sinners against light must needs have the greatest torments. For,</p>
               <p>First, The more knowledge any man had in this world, the more was his Conscience violated and abused here, by sinning against it: and O what work will these violations and abuses make for a tormenting Conscience in Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With what rage and fury will it then avenge it self upon the most stout, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and impudent sinner! the more guilt now, the more rage and fury then.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The more knowledge or means of knowledge any man hath enjoyed in this world, so much the more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is prepared and laid up for Conscience to <hi>upbraid</hi> us with in the place of torments: and the upbraidings of Conscience are a special part of the torments of the damned. O what a peal will Conscience ring in the ears of such sinners! Did not I warn thee of the issue of such sins, undone wretch? How often did I strive with thee, if it had been possible to take thee off from thy course of sinning, and to escape this wrath? Did not I osten cry out in thy bosom, stop thy course sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Hearken to my counsel, turn and live; but thou wouldst not hearken to my voice. I forewarned thee of this danger but thou slightedst all my warnings: thy lusts were too strong for my light: and now thou seest whither thy way tended, but alas too late!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="559" facs="tcp:54344:300"/>
Thirdly, The more knowledge or means of knowledge any man hath abused and neglected in this world, so many fair opportunities and great advantages he hath lost for Heaven: and the more opportunities and advantages he hath had for Heaven, the more intolerable will Hell be to that man: as the mercy was great which was offered by them, so the torment will be unspeakable that will arise from the loss of them. Sinners, you have now a wide and open door, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blessed opportunities of salvation under the Gospel, it hath put you in a fair way for everlasting happiness: many of you are not far from the kingdom of God: there will be time enough in Hell to reflect upon this loss. What think you, will it not be sad to think there, O how fair was I once for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! to have been with God and among yonder Saints! My Conscience was once convinced, and my affections melted under the Gospel. I was almost perswaded to be a Christian indeed: the bargain was almost made betwixt Christ and my soul: there were but a few points in difference betwixt us: but wretch that I was, at those points the bargain stuck, and there the treaty ended to my eternal ruine: I could not deny my lusts: I could not live under the strict yoak of Christs government: but now I must live under the insupportable wrath of the righteous and terrible God for ever: and this torment will be peculiar to such as perish under the Gospel. The Heathen who enjoyed no such means, can therefore have no such reflections, nay, the very Devils themselves who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had such a plank after their shipwrack, I mean a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in their nature, or such terms of reconciliation offered them, will not reflect upon their lost opportunities of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering as such sinners must, and will: this therefore <hi>is the condemnation, that light is come into the world; but men loved darkness rather than light.</hi>

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:54344:301"/>
of the best mercies brings forth the greatest miseries. Alas, Christians, your duty is but half learnt when you know it: obedience to light makes light a blessing indeed, Joh. 13. 17. <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye if you do them.</hi> Happiness is not entailed upon simple knowing, but upon doing; upon obedience to our knowledge: otherwise he that increaseth knowledge doth but increase sorrow; <hi>for that servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himself, nor did according to his will; shall be beaten with many stripes,</hi> Luke 13. 47. <hi>And to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin,</hi> Jam. 4. 17. We are bound with all thankfulness to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the bounty of Heaven to this sinful generation in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing us with so many excellent means of light beyond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other nations and generations that are past: but yet we ought to rejoice with trembling when we consider the abuses of light in this wanton age, and what a dismal event is like to happen unto many thousands among us. I fear the time is coming when many among us will wish they had never set foot upon English ground.

You may know much more than others, but if ever you come to Heaven, it must be in the same way of faith and obedience, mortification and self-denial in which the weakest Christian comes thither: whatever knowledge you have, to be sure you have no wisdom, if you expect salvation upon any other or easier terms, than the most illiterate Christian finds it.

            <p>THe aversations of men from Jesus Christ their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy, is as much to be admired, as lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: one would think the news of deliverance should make the hearts of <hi>captives</hi> leap for joy: the tydings of a Saviour should transport the heart of a lost sinner. A man would think a little <hi>Rhetorick</hi> might suffice to perswade the naked soul of a sinner to put on the rich robes of Christs righteousness, which cost him nothing but accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: or the perishing starving sinner to accept the bread of God which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world. This is the great design I have managed in this whole discourse; the centre to which all these lines are drawn: many arguments have been used; and many ways attempted to prevail with men to <hi>apply</hi> and put on
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:54344:304"/>
Christ, and I am afraid all too little. I have but laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought; all these discourses are but the beating of the air, and few if any will be perswaded to come unto Christ, who is clearly opened, and freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Gospel to them. For alas, whilst I am <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Satan is <hi>blinding</hi> their minds with false reasonings and contrary perswasions: the God of this world turns away the ears, and draws away the hearts of almost the whole world from Christ: <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</hi> Satan is a great and jealous Prince; and is well aware that so many of his subjects as shall be brought to see the misery of their condition, will never endure to abide any longer in subjection to him: 'tis therefore his great policy to put out their eyes, that he may secure their souls; to darken their understandings, that he may keep his interest firm and intire in their wills and affections: and this makes <hi>the effectual application of Christ</hi> so great a difficulty: that upon the contrary, it is just matter of admiration that any soul is perswaded and prevailed with to quit the service of Satan, and come to Christ. And therefore in the last place, to discover the great difficulty of conversion, and shew you where it is that all our endeavours stick and set, so that we can move the design no farther, with all our tugging and striving, reasoning and perswading; as also to mourn over and bewail the misery of Christless and unregenerate souls, with whom we must part upon the saddest terms; I have chosen this Scripture, which is of a most awakening nature; if haply the Lord at last may perswade any soul to come over to Christ thereby.</p>
            <p>These words come into the <hi>Apostles</hi> discourse, by way of <hi>prolepsis:</hi> he had been speaking in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> of the transcendent excellency of the Gospel above the Law: and among other respects he prefers it to the Law in point of clearness. The Law was an obscure and cloudy dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, there was a veil upon the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the hearts of the people, that they could not see to the end of that which is abolished: but under the Gospel we all with open face behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord.
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:54344:304"/>
Against this discourse the <hi>Apostle</hi> foresaw and obviated this objection. If your Gospel be so clear, what is the reason that many who live under the ministration of it (and they none of the meanest neither, for wisdom and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) do yet see no glory nor excellency in it? To this he returns in the words I have read; <hi>if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 'Tis true, multitudes there are who see no glory in Christ or the gospel, but the fault is not in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in the minds of them that believe not. The Sun shines forth in its glory, but the blind see no glory in it: the fault is not in the Sun but in the eye. In the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves we have three parts to consider.</p>

            </list>
            <p>First, We have here a very dreadful Spiritual Judgement inflicted upon the souls of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the hiding of the Gospel <note place="margin">1.</note> from them: if our Gospel be hid. For these words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are a concession, that so it is; a very sad, but undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth. Many there are that see no beauty in Christ, nor necessity of him; though both are so plainly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently revealed in our Gospel: <hi>if our Gospel be hid:</hi> 'tis called <hi>our Gospel;</hi> not as if <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Preachers of it were the <hi>Authors</hi> and Inventers of it; but our Gospel, because we are the Preachers and Dispensers of it. We are put in trust with the Gospel, and though we Preach it in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, using all plainness of speech, to make men understand it: yet it is hid from many under our ministry: 'tis hid from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, they see no glory in it; and hid from their hearts, they feel no power in it. Our Gospel notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our endeavours is a hidden Gospel unto some: this is the sorest and most dreadful Judgement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have here an account of that wicked <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> by whom this judgement is inflicted, <hi>viz. Satan:</hi>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:54344:305"/>
called here (by a <hi>Mimesis) the god of this world:</hi> not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and properly, but because he challenges to himself the honour of a God: rules over a vast <hi>Empire,</hi> and hath multitudes of souls, even the far greater part of the world in subjection and blind obedience to his government.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here also we have an account of the politick manner of his government, how he maintains his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3.</note> among men, and keeps the world in quiet subjection to him: namely, by blinding the minds of all them that believe not: putting out the eyes of all his subjects, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that noble faculty, the mind or understanding: the thinking, considering and reasoning power of the soul which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> truly call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the leading and directing faculty: for it is to the soul what eyes are to the body, and it is therefore called <hi>the eyes of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> Eph. 1. 18. These eyes Satan blinds, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he darkens the mind and understanding with ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; so that when men come to see and consider spiritual things, <hi>they see indeed, but perceive not,</hi> Isa. 6. 9, 10. They have some general confused notions, but no distinct, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and effectual apprehensions of those things: and this is the way indeed, none like it, to bar men effectually from Jesus Christ, and hinder the <hi>application of the benefits of redemption</hi> to their souls. 'Tis true, the righteous God permits all this to be done by Satan upon the souls of men; but wheresoever he finally prevails thus to blind them, it is as the Text speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in them that are lost,</hi> or appointed of God unto perdition. The elect of God are all blinded for a time, but Christ applieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them his <hi>Eye salve:</hi> effectually opens the eyes of their understandings, and recovers them thereby out of Satans power and dominion: but as for those who still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus blinded, the <hi>Symptoms</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death appear upon their souls; they are a company of lost men.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Four things must be opened in the Doctrinal part of this point.</p>
               <p>First, what the blinding of the understanding or hiding of the Gospel from the understanding is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I shall demonstrate that the understandings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are thus blinded, and the Gospel hidden from them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shall shew what policies Satan uses to blind the minds of men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this blindness is the sorest judgement, and in order to mens everlasting perdition.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And then apply the whole.</p>
               <p>First, we shall enquire what the blinding of the mind, or hiding <note place="margin">1.</note> of the Gospel from it is. Two sorts of men are thus blinded in the world.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Those that want the means of illumination.</item>
                  <item>2. Those that have the means, but are denied the blessing and efficacy of them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The former is the case of the <hi>Pagan world,</hi> who are in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night darkness, for want of the Gospel. The later is the case of the <hi>Christian world.</hi> The greatest part of them that live within the sound of the Gospel, being blinded by the God of this world, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>And he said Go, and tell this people; hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not: make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy; and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</hi> Thus when the Son of righteousness actually rose in the world it is said, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The light shined in darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not.</hi> So we may say of all that light which is in the understanding of all unbelievers what <hi>Job</hi> speaks of the grave,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54344:306"/>
                  <hi>Job</hi> 10. 22. <hi>That the light there is as darkness.</hi> But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to open the nature of this Spiritual blindness, I will show you,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is not opposed unto.</item>
                  <item>2. What it is opposed unto.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, Let us examine what Spiritual blindness or the hiding of the Gospel from the minds of men is not opposed unto, and we shall find,</p>
               <p>First, That it is not opposed unto natural wisdom, a man may be of an acute and clear understanding; Eagle-eyed to discern the mysteries of nature, and yet the Gospel may be hidden from him. Who were more sagacious and quick-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in natural things, than the heathen <hi>Philosophers,</hi> renowned for wisdom in their generation: Yet unto them the Gospel was but <hi>foolishness,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20, 21. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth that before his conversion, he was filled with offence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the simplicity of the Gospel. <hi>Dedignabar esse parvulus,</hi> saith he: I scorned to become a child again. And that great <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine,</hi> the profound <hi>Doctor,</hi> who was learned <hi>usque ad stupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> even to a wonder; professed that when he first read <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> he despised them, because he found not in them <hi>Metaphysicum ingenium,</hi> those Metaphysical Notions which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Upon this account it was that Christ brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Pathetical gratulation of his fathers love to the elect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>At that time Jesus answered, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth; because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not opposed to all light and knowledge in Spiritual truths. A man may have a true understanding of the Scriptures, give an Orthodox exposition of them, and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the minds of others by them: and yet the Gospel may be hidden from himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name?</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Aid art confident that thou thy self art a guide of the blind, a light to them that sit in darkness, &amp;c.</hi> A man may shew others
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:54344:306"/>
the way to Christ and Salvation, whilst both are hid from himself.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is not opposed to all kind of influences upon the affections, for it is possible the Gospel may touch the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections themselves, and cause some sweet Motions and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in them; and yet be an hidden Gospel to the soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5, 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But if these three things may consist with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blindness, unto what then is it opposed? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that Spiritual blindness stands only opposed unto that saving Manifestation of Jesus Christ in the Gospel, by the Spirit, whereby the soul is regenerated, and effectually changed by a real conversion unto God: Where-ever the Gospel thus comes in the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing such an effect as this in the soul; it is no longer an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Gospel to that soul, though such persons do not see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all that glory which is revealed by the Gospel: though they know but in part, and see darkly as through a glass; yet the eyes of their understandings are opened, and the things which belong to their peace are not hidden from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But though this be the happiness of some men, <note place="margin">2.</note> yet it is demonstrable, that the eyes of many are blinded by the God of this world, and the Gospel is an hidden Gospel from them: for,</p>
               <p>First, Many that live under the Gospel are so entirely swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the affairs of this world, that they allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no time to ponder the great concernments of their souls in the world to come, and judge you, whatever the gifts and knowledge of these men are, whether the God of this world hath not blinded their eyes. If it were not so, it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that ever they should thus wast the most precious oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of salvation, upon which their everlasting well-being depends, and spend time at the door of eternity about trifles which so little concern them. Yet this is the case of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est number that go under the Christian name. The earth hath opened her mouth, and swallowed up their time, thoughts, studies, and strength as it did the bodies of <hi>Corah,</hi> and his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices.</hi> The first, the freest, and upon the matter the whole
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:54344:307"/>
of their time is devoted to the service of the world: for even at that very time when they present their bodies before the Lord in the duties of his worship, their hearts are wandering after vanities, and <hi>going after their covetousness, Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. Judge whether the God of this world hath blinded these men or no, who can see so much beauty in the world, but none in Christ, and put such an absolute necessity upon the vanities of this world, but none upon their own salvation. If this be not spiritual blindness, what is?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The great stilness and quietness of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences under the most rouzing and awakening truths of the Gospel, plainly proves that the God of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes. For did men see and apprehend the dangerous condition they are in, as the word represents it; nothing in the world could quiet them but Christ. As soon as mens eyes come to be opened, the next enquiry they make is, <hi>What shall we do to be saved?</hi> It is not possible that a man should hang over hell, see Christ and the hopes of salvation going, and the day of patience ending, and yet be quiet. O it cannot be, that conscience should let them be quiet in such a case, if it were not blinded and stupified; but whilst the God of this world <hi>that strong man armed keepeth the house, all his goods are in peace, Luke</hi> 11. 21. If once your eyes were opened by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, a man may then say, Be quiet if you can; sit still, and let the hopes and seasons of salvation pass quietly away if you can. Suppose one should come into the Congregation, and whisper but such a word as this in your ear, your child is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the fire, and is dying, since you came from home; would it be in the power of all the friends you have, to quiet you, and make you sit still after such an information? much less, when a man apprehends his own soul in immediate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the everlasting burnings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The strong confidences and presumptuous hopes men have of salvation, whilst they remain in the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unregeneracy, plainly shews their minds to be blinded by the policy of Satan. This presumption is one of those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, false reasonings by which Satan deludes the understanding, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22. 'Tis the cunning Sophistry of the Devil, farthered by self-love, <hi>Prov.</hi>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:54344:307"/>
21. 2. <hi>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,</hi> and partly by self-ignorance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Thou saidst I am rich and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art poor.</hi> You have no fears, no doubts, no case to propound that concerns your future state, and why so? but because you have no sight, your consciences are quieted because your eyes are blinded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The trifling of men with the duties of Religion plainly discovers the blinding power of Satan upon their minds and understandings, else they would never play and dally with the serious and solemn ordinances of God, at that rate they do; if their eyes were once opened they would be in earnest in prayer, and apply themselves with the closest attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind in hearing the Gospel. There are two sorts of thoughts about any subject of meditation. Some think at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and others think close to the subject. Never do the thoughts of men come so close to Christ, to heaven and to hell, as they do immediately upon their illumination. When <hi>Johns</hi> Ministry enlightned the peoples minds, it is said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>From the days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptist until now, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> Surely these men were more in good earnest that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no repulse, take no denial; but even force themselves through all difficulties into heaven, and so would it be with you. If the God of this world had not blinded your minds, you would never pray with so much unconcernedness, nor hear with so much oscitancy and carelesness; pray as if you pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and hear as if you heard not. It is with many of our hearers as it was with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who after a quaint Oration made before him, was asked how he liked it: Truly said he, I did not hear it; for I was thinking all the while of another matter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This also is a plain evidence that the God of this world hath blinded many mens eyes among us, for that they fear not to commit great sins, to avoid small hazards and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which all the world could never perswade them to do, if they were not hoodwink'd by the God of this world. Those that have seen sin as sin in the glass of Gods Law, <hi>will choose as</hi> Moses <hi>did, to suffer any affliction with the people of God, rather than</hi>
                  <pb n="574" facs="tcp:54344:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>enjoy the pleasures of sin which are but for a season, Heb.</hi> 11. 25. Those that have seen and felt the evil of sin in the deep troubles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their spirits sor it, will account all reproaches, all losses, all sufferings from men, to be but flea-bitings to the burthen of sin.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The pride and self-conceitedness of many thousands who profess Christianity, plainly shews their minds to be blinded, by the <hi>Sophistry of Satan,</hi> and that they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand themselves, and the woful state of their own souls. Those that see God in the clearest light, abhor themselves in the deepest humility, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5. If ever the Lord had effectually opened your eyes by a clear discovery of your state by nature, and the course of your life under the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and influence of continual temptations and corruptions; how would your plumes fall? None in the world would rate you lower, than your selves would. By all which it appears, that multitudes are blinded by the God of this world:</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the third place, we are to consider what poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Satan useth to blind the minds of them that believe not, <note place="margin">3.</note> and we shall find there are three sorts of policies practised by the God of this world upon the minds and understandings of men, which he darkens,</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First, It is a great policy of Satan to blind the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men by hindering and preventing the reception of Gospel light, which he doth especially these five ways.</p>
               <p>First, By tempting the dispensers of the Gospel to darken the truths thereof in their delivering of them, to shoot over the heads of their hearers, in lofty language and terms of art, so that common understandings can give no account when the Sermon is done, what the preacher would have, but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commend him for a good Scholar, and an excellent Orator. I make no doubt but the Devil is very busie with Ministers in
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:54344:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Studies, tempting them by the pride of their own hearts to gratifie his design herein, he teaches them how to paint the glass, that he may keep out the light.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge a proper, grave and comely stile befits the lips of Christs <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> they should not be rude and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in their language or method. But this affectation of great swelling words of vanity is but too like the proud <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> is supposed to tax for this evil, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 16. <hi>This is to darken counsel, by words without knowledge, Job</hi> 31. 2. To amuse and bemist poor ignorant souls; and nullifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of preaching: for every thing is accounted so far good, as it is good to the end it is ordained for. A sword that hath an hilt of Gold, set thick with Diamonds, is no good sword if it have no edge to cut, or want a good back to follow home the stroke. O that the Ministers of Christ would choose rather sound than great words, such as are apt to pierce the heart, <note place="margin">Qui populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pueriliter, trivialiter, &amp; simplicissime docent, optimi ad vulgus sunt concionatores. <hi>Bucholtz.</hi>
                  </note> rather than such as tickle the fancy, and let people beware of furthering the design of Satan against their own souls, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a temptation upon their Ministers, by despising plain preaching. The more popular, plain, and intelligible our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are, so much the more probable they are to be success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that is the most excellent Oratory that perswades men to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Satan hinders the access of light to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of men, by imploying their minds about imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things; while they are attending upon the Ordinances of God. Thus he tempted them in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. <hi>And they come unto thee as thy people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people; and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. And lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice.</hi> The modulation of the Prophets voice was very pleasing to their ears, but mean while their fancies and thoughts were wandring after their lusts, their hearts were full of earthly projects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Satan hinders the access of light to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of men by raising Objections, and picking quarrels with the word on purpose to shake its authority, and hinder the assent of the understanding to it, and so the word makes
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:54344:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no more impression, than a fable or <hi>Romance</hi> would do. And never did this design of Satan obtain more than in this Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical age, wherein the main pillars and foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are shaken in the minds of multitudes. The Devil hath perswaded many that the Gospel is but a cunningly devised fable. <hi>Fabula Christi,</hi> as that blaspheming <hi>Pope</hi> called it: That Ministers must say somewhat to get a living. That heaven and hell are but fancies, or at most things of great uncertainty and doubtsul credit. This being once obtained, the door of the soul is shut against truth. And this design of Satan hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered the more in this generation, by the corrupt doctrines of seducing spirits, <hi>which have overthrown the faith of some,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. And partly from the scandalous lives of loose and vain professors, the Gospel hath been brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but especially by Satans artificial improvement of the corrupt natures of men, in an age wherein conscience hath been so much debauched, and Atheism thereby spread as a gangreen in the body <hi>politick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Satan hinders the access of light by helping er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous minds to draw false conclusions, and perverse infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the great and precious truths of the Gospel; and thereby bringing them under prejudice and contempt: thus he assists the errors of mens minds about the doctrine of <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> when he either perswades them that it is an unreasonable doctrine, and not worthy of credit, that God should choose some, and refuse others every way as good as those he hath chosen: or if there be any certainty in that doctrine, then men may throw the reins upon the neck of their lusts, and live at what rate they list. For if God have chosen them to salvation, their wickedness shall not hinder it; and if he have appointed them unto wrath, their diligence and self-denial cannot prevent it.</p>
               <p>Thus the Doctrine of free grace is by the like Sophistry of Satan turned into lasciviousness. If grace abound, men may sin the more freely; and the shortness of our time upon earth which in its own nature awakens all men to diligence, is by the subtilty of Satan turned to a quite contrary purpose, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Satan darkens the minds of men, and shuts them
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:54344:309"/>
against the light; by blowing them up with pride and self-conceitedness, perswading them that they know all these things already: and causing them to contemn the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and precious truths of God, as trite and vulgar notions. The word cannot be received without meekness, and humility of mind, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 8, 9. and pride is the nurse of ignorance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. The Devil is aware of this, and therefore blows up the pride and conceitedness of mens hearts all that he can: and this temptation of his generally prevails whereever it meets with a knowing head, matched with a graceless and unsanctified heart. And thus we see by what wiles and policies Satan keeps out the light, and prevents the access of it to the minds of men.</p>
               <p>But if he miss his design here, and truth gets into the mind, Then</p>
               <p>Secondly, he labours to obstruct the <hi>efficacy</hi> and operation of the light, that though it do shine into the understanding, yet it shall be imprisoned there; and send down no convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences upon the will and affections: and this design he promotes and manages diverse ways.</p>
               <p>First, By hastening to quench convictions betime, and nip them in the bud. Satan knows how dangerous a thing it is, and destructive to his interest, to suffer convictions to continue long; and therefore it is said of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.</hi> Satan is compared in this Scripture to the fowls of the air, which pick up the seed before it take any root in the earth. The Devil is very jealous of this, and therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours all he can to destroy the word before it comes to operate upon the heart, which he doth sometimes by the cares of the world, and sometimes by vain companions who prove meer quench coals unto beginning convictions. One sinner destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No sooner doth the God of this world observe the light of truth begin to operate upon the heart, but he obstructeth that design by <hi>procrastinations</hi> and delays, which delude and baffle the convinced soul; he perswades them if
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:54344:310"/>
they will alter their course, it will be time enough hereafter, when such incumbrances, and troubles in the world are over; is he prevail here, 'tis a thousand to one but the work mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries, <hi>James</hi> 1. 23, 24. if the hearer of the word be not a doer <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent doer while the impressions of it are fresh upon the soul, <hi>he doth but deceive himself.</hi> For it is with the heart as it is with melted wax, if the seal be clapt to it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will receive a fair impression; but if it be let alone but for a little while, you can make none at all; it was therefore <hi>Davids</hi> great care and wisdom to set about the work of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the first <hi>impetus</hi> or vigorous motion of his heart and affections, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 60. <hi>I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</hi> Multitudes of souls have perished by these delays. 'Tis a temptation incident to all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beginning convictions, especially young persons, whom the Devil perswades that it were no better than mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them to abridge and deny themselves so much delight and pleasure, and steep their youthful thoughts in such a melancholy subject as Religion is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If all this will not do, but convictions still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and get ground in the conscience, then he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to scare, and fright them out of their convictions, by representing to them the inward terrours, troubles and despairs into which they are about to plunge themselves, and that henceforth they must never expect a pleasant day or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hour. Thus doth the God of this world blind the minds of them that believe not, both by hindering the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of light to the mind, and the influence of it upon the heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is yet one policy of Satan to keep souls in <note place="margin">3.</note> darkness, and that is by the mis-application of truth; perswading them that whatsoever they read or hear of the misery and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Christless and unregenerate persons, doth not in the least touch or concern them, but the more notorious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane part of the world; and by this policy he blinds the minds of all civil and moral persons. Thus the <hi>Pharisees trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.</hi> And so the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> thought themselves <hi>rich, and increased with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See my Touchs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>one of sincerity, upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>goods;</hi> that is, in a very safe and good condition. Now there
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:54344:310"/>
are diverse things notably improved by Satans policy, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to these misapplications of truth: as</p>
               <p>First, The freedom of their lives from the most gross pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20. <hi>All these things have I kept from my youth up:</hi> A civil, sober course of life is a most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual blind before the eyes of many a mans conscience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the policy of Satan to prevent conviction, by conviction. I mean effectual convictions, by convictions that have been ineffectual, and are now vanished away. Thus the troubles that some persons have been under, must pass for their conversion, though the temper of their heart be the same it was: their ineffectual troubles are made use of by the Devil to blind them in the true knowledge and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of their condition. For these men and women can speak of the troubles they have had for sin, and the many tears they have shed for it; whereby thorough conviction is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevented.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gifts and knowledge are improved by the policy of Satan against the true knowlege of Jesus Christ, and our own estate by nature. As conviction is improved by Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy against conviction, so is knowledge, against knowledge. This was the case of them in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17, 18. <hi>Thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent; being instructed out of the law, and art confident that thou thy self art a guide to the blind, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the temptation and delusion of knowing persons, who are so far from being blind in their own account, that they account themselves the guides of the blind: yet who blinder than such men?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, External reformation is improved by the policy of Satan against true Spiritual reformation, and passes current up and down the world. For conversion, though it serves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to strengthen Satans interest in the soul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. and for want of a real change of heart doth but increase their sin and misery, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. This is the generation that is pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. The <hi>cleanness</hi> of their hands blinds them in discovering the <hi>foulness</hi> of their hearts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The policy of Satan improves diligence in some
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:54344:311"/>
duties, against the convictions of other duties. The external duties of Religion, as hearing, praying, fasting, against the great duties of repenting and believing. This was their case, <hi>Isa</hi> 58. 2, 3. <hi>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness; and forsook not the Ordinances of their God. They ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they take delight in approching to God. Wherefore have we fasted say they, and thou seest not, wherefore have we afflicted our souls, and thou takest no knowledge?</hi> Thus duty is improved against duty, the externals against the internals of Religion, and multitudes are blinded this way.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The policy of Satan improves zeal against zeal; and thereby blinds a great part of the world: he allows men to be zealous against a false religion, if thereby he may prevent them from being zealous in the true Religion. He diverts their zeal against their own sins, by spending it against other mens. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was once blinded by his own zeal for the law, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 3. And many men at this day satisfie themselves in their own zeal against the corruptions of Gods worship, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions of others; who never felt the power of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon their own hearts: a dangerous blind of Satan.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The policy of Satan improves the esteem and respect men have from the people of God, against their great duty and interest to become such themselves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Thou hast a name that thou livest, but thou art dead.</hi> It is enough to many men that they obtain acceptation among the Saints, though they be none of that number; the good opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers begets and confirms their good opinion of themselves.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The policy of Satan improves soundness of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> against soundness of <hi>heart.</hi> An Orthodox head, against an Orthodox heart and life; Dogmatical faith, against justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying saith. This was the case of them before mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 18, 19. Men satisfie themselves that they have a sound understanding, though mean while they have a very rotten heart. 'Tis enough for them that their heads are regular, though their hearts and lives be very irre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>gular.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The policy of Satan improves the <hi>blessings</hi> of God, against the <hi>blessings</hi> of God, blinding us by the blessings of providence, so as not to discern the want of spiritual blessings,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:54344:311"/>
perswading men that the smiles of providence in their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, and thriving designs in the world, are good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the love of God to their souls, not at all discerning how the prosperity of fools deceives them, and that riches are often given to the hurt of the owners thereof.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The policy of Satan improves comforts against comfort, false and ungrounded comforts under the word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the real grounds of comfort, lying in the souls interest in Christ. Thus many men finding a great deal of comfort in the promises, are so blinded thereby, as never to look after Union with Christ the only solid ground of all true comfort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5, 9.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, how the God of this world blindeth the minds of them that believe not, and how the Gospel is hid to them that are lost.</p>

                  <p>That the understandings of all unbelievers are blinded by Satans <note place="margin">Doct.</note> policies, in order to their everlasting perdition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>We have shewn already what the blinding of the mind, or hiding of the Gospel from it is, it hath also been demonstrated that the Gospel is hid, and the minds of many blinded under it; you have also seen what policies Satan uses to blind the minds of men, even in the clearest light of the Gospel. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now that <hi>I</hi> open to you the dreadful nature of this judgement of God upon the souls of men, and then make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the whole.</p>
               <p>There are many Judgements of God inflicted upon the souls and bodies of men in this world, but none of them are so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as those Spiritual Judgements are, which God inflicts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:54344:312"/>
upon the soul; and among Spiritual Judgements few or none are of more dreadful nature and consequence, than this of spiritual blindness; which will appear by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Subject</hi> of this Judgement which is the soul, and the principal power of the soul, which is the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing faculty: the soul is the most precious and invaluable part of man, and the mind is the superiour and most noble power of the soul: it is to the soul what the eye is to the body, the directive faculty. The bodily eye is a curious, tender, and most precious part of the body. When we would express the value of a thing, we say, we prize it as our eyes. The loss of the eyes is a sore loss, we lose a great part of the comfort of this world by it. Yet such an affliction (speaking compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) is but a trifle to this. If our bodily eyes be blinded we cannot see the sun, but if our spiritual eye be blinded we cannot see God, we wander in the paths of sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 11. we are led blindfold to hell by Satan, as the <hi>Syrians</hi> were into <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 19, 20. and then our eyes like theirs will be opened to see our misery, when it is too late, <hi>The light of the body is the eye</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! Mat.</hi> 6. 22, 23. By the eye he means the practical judgment, the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, which is the seat of principles, the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of rules for practice, according unto which a mans life is formed, and his way directed. If therefore this power of the soul be darkened, how great must that darkness be! for now the blind lead the blind, and both fall into the ditch. The blind judgement misguides the blind affections; and both fall into hell. O what a sad thing is it that the Devil should lead that, that leads thee? That he should sit at the <hi>helm,</hi> and steer thy course to damnation? The blinding of this noble faculty preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates the soul into the most dangerous courses, persecution by this means seems to be true zeal for God. <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. <hi>They that persecute you shall think that they do God service.</hi> Paul <hi>once thought verily with himself, that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Acts 26. 9. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> He thought he had pleased God, when he was imprisoning
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:54344:313"/>
and persecuting his people; as many do at this day: it will make a man to sin conscientiously, which is a very dangerous way of sinning, and difficult to be reclaimed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a dreadful Judgement if we consider the <hi>Object</hi> about which the understanding is blinded, which is Jesus Christ, and Union with him; Regeneration and the nature and necessity thereof. For this blindness is not universal, but respective and particular. A man may have abundance of light and knowledge in things natural, and moral: but spiritual things are hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>den from his eyes. Yea, a man may know spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things in a natural way, which increaseth his blindness; but he cannot discern them spiritually: this is a sore judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and greatly to be bewailed. <hi>Thou hast hid these things</hi> (said Christ) <hi>from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes, Mat.</hi> 11. 25. Learned and knowing men are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of those things which very <hi>babes</hi> in Christ understand. They are prudent in the management of earthly affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to save their own souls they have no knowledge. They are able with <hi>Berengarius</hi> to dispute <hi>De omni scibili,</hi> of every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigable by the light of nature: yea, to open the scripture solidly, and defend the doctrines, and truths of Christ against his adversaries successfully; and yet blinded in the greatmystery of regeneration. <hi>Blindness in part</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto Israel:</hi> and that indeed was the principal part of knowledg, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of Jesus Christ and him crucified, we see farther than they. The literal knowledge of Christ shines clearly in our understandings. We are only blinded about those things which should give us saving inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in him, about the <hi>effectual application</hi> of Christ to our own souls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The dreadful nature of this spiritual blindness farther appears from the consideration of the season in which it befalls men, which is the very time of Gods patience, and the only opportunity they have for salvation: after these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities are over, their eyes will be opened to see their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, but alas, too late, too late. Upon this account Christ shed those tears over <hi>Jerusalem, Luke</hi> 19. 42. <hi>O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> Now the season of grace is past and gone: opportunities are the golden spots of time,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:54344:313"/>
and there is much time in a short opportunity, as there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pieces of silver in one piece of gold. Time signifies nothing when opportunities are gone, to be blinded in the very season of salvation is the Judgement of all Judgements, the greatest misery incident to man; to have our eyes opened, when the seasons of salvation are past, is but an aggravation of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: There is a twofold opening of mens eyes to see their danger.</p>

               <p>They whose eyes are not opened graciously in this world to see their disease and remedy in Christ, shall have their eyes opened judicially in the world to come, to see their disease without any remedy. If God open them now, it is by way of <hi>prevention;</hi> if they be not opened until then, it will produce <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The horrible nature of this Judgement farther appears, from the exceeding difficulty of curing it, especially in men of excellent natural indowments and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 40, 41. <hi>And some of the Pharisees which were with him, heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say we see, therefore your sin remaineth, q. d.</hi> The pride and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of your hearts adds obstinacy and incurableness to your blindness, these are <hi>the blind people that have eyes, Isa.</hi> 43. 8. <hi>in seeing they see not.</hi> The conviction of such men is next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The design and end of this blindness under the Gospel is most dreadful, so saith my Text, <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</hi> Answerable whereunto are those words, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ira est Dei non intelligere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licta, ne sequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, <hi>Cyp. Ep.</hi> 3. Percussi sunt animi caecitane ut nec intelligant delicta, nec plangant: indignantis Dei major haec est ira, <hi>Cypr.</hi> de lapsis.</note> 
                  <hi>shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart; and convert, and be healed.</hi>
                  <pb n="586" facs="tcp:54344:314"/>
So that it is plain, this blinding is a <hi>praeludium</hi> to damnation, as the covering of <hi>Hamans</hi> face was to his destruction. When the Lord hath no purpose of grace and mercy to a mans soul, then to bring about the damnation of that man by a righteous permission; many occasions of blindness befal him, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan improves effectually unto his eternal ruine, among which fatal occasions, blind guides, and scandalous professors are none of the least, they shall be fitted with Ministers suitable to their humours, who shall speak smooth things: <hi>if a man walk in the Spirit, and falshood</hi> (i. e. by an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—the spirit of falshood) <hi>do lie saying, I will prophesie to thee of wine and strong drink. he shall even be the prophet of this people:</hi> and the slips and falls of professors shall do the Devil not a little ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this his fatal design. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Wo to the world because of offences:</hi> This shall blind them, and harden them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Thus you see what a dreadful Judgement this is, a stroak of God upon the soul which cuts off all the present comforts of Christ and Religion from it, takes away the bridle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from sin, and makes way for the final ruine of the soul. A far greater Judgement it is, than the greatest calamity or affliction, which can befal us in this world. If our names suffer by the greatest reproaches, our bodies by the most painful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, our estates by the greatest losses; if God strike every comfort we have in this world dead by affliction: all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing compared with this blinding Judgement of God upon the soul. For they may come from the tender love of God to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. But this is the effect of his wrath, they may cleanse sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 9. but this increases it; they often prove occasions of conversion, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 8, 9. but this is the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to it. In a word, they only wound the flesh, and that with a curable wound; but this stabs the soul, and that with a mortal wound.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, Labour to get a deep sense of the misery of such a condition; for till you be awakened by conviction, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be healed. O that you did but know the true difference betwixt common and saving light, the want of this keeps you in darkness: you think because you know the same things that the most sanctified man doth, that therefore there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt his knowledge and yours; and are therefore ready to say to them as <hi>Job</hi> to his friends, <hi>Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard, and understood it: What ye know, the same do I know also; I am not inferiour unto you, Job</hi> 13. 1, 2. But O that you would be convinced that your knowledge vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differs from the knowledge of believers. Though you know the same things that they do, it is a knowledge of another kind and nature. You know spiritual things in another way, meerly by the light of reason assisted and improved by the common light of the Gospel: they know the same things by spiritual illumination, and in an experimental way. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things.</hi> Their knowledge is practical, yours is idle. They are working out their salvation by that light which God hath given them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 10. Their knowledge of God and Christ produces the fruits of faith, obedience, mortification, and heavenly mindedness in them: It hath no such fruits in you: whatever light there be in your understandings, it makes no alteration at all upon your hearts. Their light brings them to heaven, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. Yours shall be blown out by death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. and your selves left in the mists of eternal darkness: except your eyes be opened seasonably by the anointing of the holy Ghost. Conviction is a great part of your cure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to get a remedy for this dangerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of your minds: <hi>Awake to righteousness and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34. These things speak incouragement to you: though it be a sore Judgement that lies upon you, and very difficult to be removed: yet remember Jesus Christ is put into Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:54344:316"/>
by God the Father to open the blind eyes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. and this excellent <hi>Physician</hi> bespeaks you for his patients, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Anoint thine eyes</hi> (saith he) <hi>with eye-salve that thou mayest see.</hi> Yea, the most enlightned Christians were once as dark and blind in spiritual things as you are, and Christ hath cured them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Once were you darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Attend therefore upon the Ordinances of the Gospel diligently; that's Gods enlightning instrument, by which he couches those <hi>Cataracts</hi> which blind the eyes of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And if ever you will have your eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, allow your selves time to ponder, and consider what you hear. The duty of Meditation is a very enlightning du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Above all cry to the Lord Jesus Christ as that poor man did, <hi>Lord that mine eyes may be opened, that I may receive my sight.</hi> Say, Lord, this is my disease and danger, that in seeing I see not: others see natural things in a spiritual way, whilst I see spiritual things only in a natural way: their light is operative upon their hearts, mine is but an idle impractical notion of Religion, which brings forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>no fruit of holiness. Their knowledge sets their hands a work in duties of obedience: mine only sets my tongue a work in discourses of those things which my heart never felt. Lord, open mine eyes and make me to see out of this obscurity: All the light that is in me is but darkness. O Lord enlighten my darkness, enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let it be a word of counsel and exhortation to such as once were blind, but do now see.</p>
                  <p>First, I beseech you bless God for the least degree of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual illumination. <hi>Truly light is sweet, and 'tis a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun, Eccles.</hi> 11. 7. But Oh how sweet is spiritual light! and what a pleasant thing to behold the Son of Righteousness! Blessed are your eyes for they see. God hath brought you out of darkness into marvellous light. And marvellous indeed it must needs be, when you consider how many wise and prudent men are under the power of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual darkness, whilst such babes as you, are enlightened. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. It greatly affected the heart of Christ, O let it affect yours also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to get a clearer sight of spiritual things every day. For all spiritual light is encreasing light, <hi>which</hi>
                     <pb n="592" facs="tcp:54344:317"/>
                     <hi>shineth more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18. O if a little spiritual light be so comfortable, what would more be? The wisdom of God is <hi>a manifold wisdom, Eph.</hi> 3. 16. The best of us see but little of it. Labour therefore to know spiritual things more <hi>extensively,</hi> and more experimentally, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. be still encreasing in the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Walk as men whose eyes are opened. <hi>Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children of the light, Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Else your light will but aggravate your sin. Remember how it displeased God that <hi>Solomons</hi> heart was turned from the Lord God of <hi>Israel which had appeared to him twice,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9. Remember how angry God was with the <hi>Heathens</hi> for abusing the dim common light of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. how much more evil is it in you to abuse the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light that shineth in this world? and what mischievous effects the abuse of your light will have upon this blind world. It was a smart rebuke given once by an <hi>Atheist</hi> to a good man, who being asked by him how he could satisfie his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to live as he did? nay rather said the <hi>Atheist,</hi> I wonder how you can satisfie your self to live as you do; for did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as you do, that there is such a Christ, and such a glory as you believe there is; I would pray and live at another rate than you do.</p>

which is justly called <hi>the great mystery of Godliness,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. That mystery which the <hi>Prophets</hi> enquired diligently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea, which the <hi>Angels desire to look into,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 12. In this glorious mystery of Redemption tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> manifold wisdom of God, or that wisdom which hath such curious and admirable variety in it, is illustriously displayed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. Yea, the contrivement of our Redemption this way, is the most glorious display of Divine <hi>Love</hi> that ever was made, or can be made in this world to the children of men: for so the Apostle will be understood when he saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>—God hath set forth or presented his love to man in the most taking manner, in a way that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it beyond all compare, to the acceptation of men. <hi>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. It might be justly expected, that when this glorious mystery should come to be published by the Gospel in the ears of sinners, all eyes should be withdrawn from all other objects, and fixed with admiration upon Christ, all hearts should be ravished with these glad tidings; and every man pressing to Christ with greatest zeal and diligence. But behold, instead thereof,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The desperate wickedness of the world in rejecting the only remedy prepared for them. This was long since foretold by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. 3. <hi>He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised,</hi>

                     <hi>and we esteemed him not:</hi> His poor and mean appearance, which should endear him beyond all considerations to the souls of men (since it was for their sakes that he emptied himself of all his glory,) yet this lays him under contempt, he is looked on as the very offcast of men; when his own love to man had emptied him of all his riches, the wickedness of men loaded him with contempt, and as it was prophesied of him, so it was, and at this day is sadly verified all the world over. For</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Pagan</hi> world hath no knowledge of him, they are lost in darkness. <hi>God hath suffered them to walk in their own ways,</hi> Acts 14. 16.</p>

                     <pb n="594" facs="tcp:54344:318"/>
Secondly, The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> which overspread so great a part of the world reject him, and instead os the blessed Gospel which they hiss out with abhorrence, embrace the blasphemous and ridiculous <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which they confidently affirm to have come down srom God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in that <hi>laylatto Hanzili</hi> (as they call it) the night of demission, calling all Christians <hi>Cafirouna</hi> (i. e.) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Jews</hi> reject him with abhorrence, and spit at his very name, and being blindfolded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, they call <hi>Jesus Anathema,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. And in a blind zeal for <hi>Moses,</hi> blaspheme him as an Impostor. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not, John</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The far greater part of the Christianized world reject him: those that are called after his name, will not <note place="margin">

To work thy heart to this frame these things are written, which the Lord prosper upon thy soul by the blessing of his good Spirit upon them.</p>
