            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His vnhappie controuersie, about the receiued ceremonies and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church of England, which hath so long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne so many of her Ministers from their principall worke, and imployed their studies in contentious oppositions: hath by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall growth and daungerous fruites thereof, made knowne to the world, that it neuer receiued blessing from the father of peace. For whose experience doth not finde, what confusion of order, and breach of the sacred bond of loue hath sprung from this dissention; how it hath rent the bodie of the Church into diuers parts, and diuided her people into diuers Sects; how it hath taught the sheepe to despise their pastors, and alienated the Pastors from the loue of their flockes: how it hath strengthened the irreligious in their impieties, and hath raised the hopes of the sacrilegious deuourers of the remaines of Christs patrimony; and giuen way to the common aduersary of Gods truth and our prosperity, to grow great in our land without resistance; who seeth not how it hath distracted the mindes of the multitude, and shaken their faith, and scandalized their weakeness, and hath generally killed the very hart of true pietie and religious deuotion, by changing our zeale towards Christes glory, into the fire of enuie and malice, and hart-burning, and Zeale to euery mans priuate cause? This is the summe of all the gaines which the tedious contentions of so many yeares haue brought in, by the ruine of Christs kingdome, the encrease of Satans, partly in superstition, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in impietie. So much better were it in these our dwellings of peace, to endure any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience whatsoeuer in the outward frame, then in desire of alteration, thus to set the whole house on fire. Which moued the religious hart of this learned writer, in Zeale of Gods truth, and in compassion to his Church, the mother of vs all, which gaue vs both the first breath of spirituall life, and from her breasts hath fed vs vnto this whatsoeuer measure of growth we haue in Christ, to stand vp and take vpon him a generall defence both of her selfe, and of her established lawes; and by force of demonstration, so farre as the nature of the present matter could beare, to make knowne to the world, and these oppugners of her, that all those bitter accusations laid to her charge, are not the faultes of her lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but either their owne mistakes in the misvnderstanding, or the abuses of men in the ill execution of them. A worke subiect to manifold reprehensions and oppositions, and not sutable to his soft and milde disposition, desirous of a quiet priuate life, wherein hee might bring forth the fruits of peace in peace. But the loue of God and of his countrey, whose greatest daunger grew from this diuision, made his hart hot within him, and at length the fire kindled, and amongst many other most reuerend and learned men, he also presumed to speake with his pen. And the rather, because he sawe that none of these ordinary obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of partialities could eleuate the authoritie of his writing, who alwayes affected a priuate state, and neither enioyed nor expected any the least dignitie in our Church. What admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable height of learning, and depth of iudgement dwelled within the lowly minde of this true humble man, great in all wise mens eyes, except his owne; with what grauitie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of speach his tongue and pen vttered heauenly mysteries, whose eyes in the humility of his hart were alwayes cast downe to the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how all things that proceeded from him
<pb facs="tcp:19711:4"/>
were breathed as from the spirit of loue, as if he like the bird of the holy Ghost, the Doue, had wanted gall; let them that knew him not in his person, iudge by the these liuing Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his soule, his writings. For out of these, euen those who otherwise agree not with him in opinion, do affoord him the testimony of a milde and a louing spirit: and of his learning what greater proofe can we haue then this, that his writings are most admired by those who themselues do most excell in iudicious learning, and by them the more often they are read, the more highly they are extolled and desired. Which is the cause of this second edition of his former bookes, and that without any addition or diminution whatsoeuer. For who will put a pencile to such a worke, from which such a workeman hath taken his? There is a purpose of setting forth the three last books also, their fathers <hi>Posthumi.</hi> For as in the great decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his bodie, spent out with study, it was his ordinary petition to almightie God, that if he might liue to see the finishing of these bookes, then <hi>Lord let thy seruant depart in peace</hi> (to vse his owne words) so it pleased God to grant him his desire. For he liued till he sawe them perfected; and though like <hi>Rachel</hi> he dyed as it were in the trauell of them, and hastened death vpon himselfe, by hastening to giue them life: yet he held out to behold with his eyes these <hi>partus ingenii,</hi> these <hi>Beniamins,</hi> sonnes of his right hand, though to him they were <hi>Benonies,</hi> sonnes of paine and sorrowe. But some euill disposed mindes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of malice, or couetousnesse, or wicked blinde Zeale, it is vncerteine, as if they had beene Egyptian Mid-wiues, as soone as they were borne, and their father dead, smothered them, and by conueying away the perfect Copies, left vnto vs nothing but certaine olde vnperfect and mangled draughts, dismembred into peeces, and scattered like <hi>Medeas Abyrtus,</hi> no fauour, no grace, not the shadowes of themselues almost remaining in them. Had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liued to see them brought forth thus defaced, he might rightfully haue named them <hi>Benonies,</hi> the sonnes of sorrowe. But seeing the importunities of many great and worthy persons will not suffer them quietly to dye and to be buried, it is intended that they shall see them as they are. The learned and iudicious eye will yet perhaps delight it selfe in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the goodly lineaments of their well set bodies, and in finding out some shadowes and resemblances of their fathers face. God grant that as they were with their bretheren dedica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to the Church for messengers of peace: so in the strength of that little breath of life that remaineth in them, they may prosper in their worke; and by satisfying the doubtes of such as are willing to learne, may helpe to giue an end to the calamities of these our ciuill wars.</p>

At your hands beloued in our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ (for in him the loue which we beare vnto all that would but seeme to be borne of him, it is not the sea of your gall and bitternes that shall euer drowne) I haue no great cause to looke for other then the selfesame portion &amp; lot, which your maner hath bene hitherto to lay on them that concur not in opinion and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with you. But our hope is, that the God of peace shal (notwithstanding mans nature too impatient of contumelious maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) inable vs quietly and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gladly to suffer al things, for that worke sake which we couet to perform. The wonderful zeale and feruour wherewith ye haue withstood the receiued orders of this Church, was the first thing which caused me to enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, whether (as all your published bookes and writings peremptorily maintain) euery Christian man fearing God, stand bound to ioyne with you for the furtherance of that which ye tearme <hi>the Lords Discipline.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

I must plainly confesse vnto you, that before I examined your sundrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations in that behalfe, it could not settle in my head to thinke, but that vndoubtedly such nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of otherwise right wel affected &amp; most religiously enclined minds, had some maruellous reasonable inducementes which led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with so great earnestnes that way. But when once, as near as my slender abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie would serue, I had with trauell &amp; care performed that part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles aduise &amp; counsel in such cases, whereby he willeth to <hi>try al things;</hi> and was come at the length so far, that there remained onely the other clause to be satisfied, wherein he concludeth that <hi>what good is must bee held:</hi> there was in my poore vnderstanding no remedie, but to set downe this as my finall resolute perswasion; <hi>Surely the present forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which the lawes of this land haue established, is such, as no lawe of God, nor reason of man hath hitherto bene alleaged, of force sufficient to proue they do ill, who to the vttermost of their power withstand the alteration thereof:</hi> Contrariwise, <hi>The other which instead of it we are required to accept, is only by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror &amp; misconceipt named the ordinance of Iesus Christ, no one proofe as yet brought forth, whereby it may clearely appeare to be so in very deede.</hi> The explication of which two thinges I haue here thought good to offer into your owne hands: hartily beseeching you euen by the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Iesus Christ, whome I trust ye loue; that, as ye tender the peace and quietnesse of this Church, if there bee in you that gracious humilitie which hath euer bene the crowne and glory of a christianly disposed minde, if your owne soules, hearts and consciences, (the sound integritie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can but hardly stand with the refusall of truth in personall respects) be, as I doubt not but they are, things most deare and precious vnto you, <hi>Let not the faith which ye haue in our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> be blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>with partialities,</hi>

For though thousands were debters to him, as touching knowledge in that kinde; yet he to none but onely to God, the author of that most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fountaine the booke of life, and of the admirable dexteritie of wit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the helpes of other learning which were his guides: till being occasioned to leaue Fraunce, he fell at the length vpon Geneua: Which Citie, the Bishop and Cleargie thereof had a little before (as some doe affirme) forsaken, being of likelihood frighted with the peoples sudden attempt for abolishment of popish religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the euent of which enterprise they thought it not safe for themselues to wait for in that place. At the comming of Caluin thither, the forme of their ciuill regiment was popular, as it continueth at this day: neither King, nor Duke, nor Noble man of any authoritie or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer them, but officers chosen by the people yearely out of themselues, to order all things with publique consent. For spirituall gouernment, they had no lawes at all agreed vpon, but did what the pastors of their soules by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion could win them vnto. Caluin being admitted one of their Preachers &amp; a diuinitie Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it was that the whole estate of that Church should hang stil on so slender a thred, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if it haue power to change whatsoeuer it selfe listeth. Wherefore taking vnto him two of the other ministers for more countenance of the action, (albeit the rest were all against it) they moued, and in the end perswaded with much adoe, the people to bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by solemne oath, first neuer to admit the Papacie amongst them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and secondly, to liue in obedience vnto such orders concerning the exercise of their religion, and the forme of their ecclesiasticall gouernment, as those their true and faithfull Ministers of Gods word had agreeablie to Scripture set downe for that end and purpose. When these thinges began to bee put in vre, the people also (what causes mouing them thereunto, themselues best know) began to repent them of that they had done, and irefully to champe vpon the bit they had taken into their mouthes, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they grew by meanes of this innouation into dislike with some Churches neare about them, the benefite of whose good friendship their state could not well lacke. It was the manner of those times (whether through mens desire to enioy alone the glory of their owne enterprises, or else because the quicknesse of their occasions required present dispatch,)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19711:6"/>
so it was, that euery particular Church did that within it selfe, which some fewe of their owne thought good, by whome the rest were all directed. Such nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Churches the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being, though free within themselues, yet smal, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conference before hand might haue eased them of much aftertrouble. But a greater inconuenience it bred, that euery later endeuoured to bee certaine degrees more remoued from conformitie with the Church of Rome, then the rest before had bene: whereupon grew maruellous great dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and by reason thereof, iealousies, hartburnings, iarres and discords amongst them. Which notwithstanding might haue easily bene preuented, if the orders which each Church did thinke fit and conuenient for it selfe, had not so peremptorily bene established vnder that high commaunding forme, which tendered them vnto the people, as things euerlastingly required by the law of that Lord of Lords, against whose statutes there is no exception to be taken. For by this meane it came to passe, that one Church could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse &amp; condemne another of disobedience to the wil of Christ, in those things where manifest difference was betweene them: whereas the selfesame orders allowed, but yet established in more warie and suspense maner, as being to stand in force till God should giue the opportunitie of some general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference what might be best for euery of them afterwards to doe; this I say had both preuented all occasion of iust dislik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which others might take, and reserued a greater libertie vnto the authors themselues of entring into farther consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards. Which though neuer so necessary they could not easily now admit, without some feare of derogation from their credit: and therfore that which once they had done, they became for euer after resolute to maintaine. Caluin therfore &amp; the other two his associats stiffely refusing to administer the holy Communion to such as would not quietly without contradiction and murmur submit themselues vnto the orders which their solemne oath had bound them to obey, were in that quarell banished the towne. A fewe yeares after (such was the leuitie of that people) the places of one or two of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters being fallen voyde, they were not before so willing to be rid of their learned Pastor, as now importunate to obtaine him againe from them who had giuen him entertainment, and which were loath to part with him, had not vnresistable earnestnes bene vsed. One of the towne ministers that sawe in what manner the people were bent for the reuocation of Caluin, gaue him notize of their affection in this sort. <hi>The Senate of two hundred being assembled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. Cal. 24.</note> 
               <hi>they all craue Caluin. The next day a generall conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. They crye in like sort againe all: VVe will haue Caluin that good and learned man Christs Minister. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19711:6"/>
I vnderstood I could not choose but praise God, nor was I able to iudge otherwise, then that this was the Lordes doing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 20.17.</note> 
               <hi>and that it was maruellous in our eyes,</hi> and <hi>That the stone which the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refused, was now made the head of the corner.</hi> The other two whom they had throwne out (together with Caluin) they were content should enioy their exile. Many causes might lead them to bee more desirous of him. First, his yeelding vnto them in one thing, might happily put them in hope, that time would breed the like easines of condescending further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For in his absence he had perswaded them, with whome he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preuaile, that albeit himselfe did better like of common bread to bee vsed in the Eucharist, yet the other they rather should accept, then cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble in the Church about it. Againe, they saw that the name of Caluin waxed euery day greater abroad, and that together with his fame their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy was spread, who had so rashly and childishly eiected him. Besides it was not vnlikely but that his credite in the world, might many wayes stand the poore towne in great stead: as the truth is, their ministers forrein esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hitherto hath bene the best stake in their hedge. But whatsoeuer secret respects were likely to moue them, for contenting of their mindes Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin returned (as it had bene an other Tully) to his olde home. He ripely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered how grosse a thing it were for men of his qualitie, wise and graue men, to liue with such a multitude, and to be tenants at will vnder them, as their ministers, both himselfe and others, had bene. For the remedie of which inconuenience, hee gaue them plainely to vnderstand, that if he did become their teacher againe, they must be content to admit a complet forme of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which both they and also their pastors should now be solemnely sworne to obserue for euer after. Of which discipline the maine and principall partes were these: A standing ecclesiasticall Court to be established: perpetuall Iudges in that Court to be their ministers; others of the people annually cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen (twise so many in number as they) to be iudges together with them in the same Court: these two sorts to haue the care of all mens manners, power of determining all kind of Ecclesiasticall causes, and authoritie to conuent, to controll, to punish, as farre as with exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, whomsoeuer they should thinke worthy, none eyther small or great excepted, This deuise I see not how the wisest at that time liuing could haue bettered, if we duly consider what the present estate of Geneua did then require. For their Bishop and his Clergie being (as it is said) departed from them by moonelight, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, being departed; to choose in his roome any other Bishop, had beene a thing altogether impossible. And for their ministers to seeke that themselues alone might haue coerciue power ouer the whole Church, would perhaps
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19711:7"/>
haue bene hardly construed at that time. But when so franke an offer was made, that for euery one minister there should be two of the people to sit and giue voyce in the Ecclesiasticall Consistory, what inconuenience could they easily find which themselues might not be able alwayes to remedy? Howbeit (as euermore the simpler sort are, euen when they see no apparant cause, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous notwithstanding ouer the secret intents and purposes of wiser men) this proposition of his did somewhat trouble them. Of the Ministers themselues which had stayed behinde in the Citie when Caluin was gone, some, vpon knowledge of the peoples earnest intent to recall him to his place againe, had beforehand written their letters of submission, and assured him of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance for euer after, if it should like him to harken vnto that publique suite. But yet misdoubting what might happen, if this discipline did goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde; they obiected against it the example of other reformed Churches, liuing quietly and orderly without it. Some of chiefest place and countenance amongst the laitie professed with greater stomacke their iudgements, that such a discipline was little better then popish tyrannie disguised and tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them vnder a new forme. This sort, it may be, had some feare that the filling vp of the seates in the Consistorie, with so great a number of lay men, was but to please the mindes of the people, to the ende they might thinke their owne swaye somewhat; but when things came to triall of practise, their Pastors learning would bee at all times of force to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswade simple men, who knowing the time of their owne President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to bee but short, would alwayes stand in feare of their ministers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall authoritie: and among the ministers themselues, one being so farre in estimation aboue the rest, the voyces of the rest were likely to be giuen for the most part respectiuely with a kinde of secret dependencie and awe: so that in shewe a maruellous indifferently composed Senate Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call was to gouerne, but in effect one onely man should, as the Spirite and soule of the residue, doe all in all. But what did these vaine sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises boote? Brought they were now to so straight an issue, that of two thinges they must choose one; namely, whether they would to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse disgrace, with ridiculous lightnes, dismisse him, whose restitution they had in so impotent maner desired: or else condescende vnto that demaund, wherein hee was resolute eyther to haue it, or to leaue them. They thought it better to be somewhat hardly yoked at home, then for euer abroad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited. Wherefore in the ende those orders were on all sides assented vnto:<note place="margin">An. D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1541.</note> with no lesse alacritie of minde, then Cities vnable to holde out lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger are wont to shewe, when they take conditions such as it liketh him to offer them which hath them in the narrow streightes of aduantage. Not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19711:7"/>
many yeares were ouerpassed, before these twice sworne men aduentured to giue their last and hotest assault to the fortresse of the same discipline, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly graunting by comon consent of their whole Senate, &amp; that vnder their towne seale, a relaxation to one Bertelier whom the Eldership had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; further also decreeing, with strange absurditie, that to the same Senate it should belong to giue finall iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in matter of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and to absolue whom it pleased them; cleane contrary to their owne former deedes and oaths. The report of which decree being forth with brought vnto Caluin; <hi>Before</hi> (sayth he) <hi>this decree take place, either my bloud or banishment shall signe it.</hi> Againe two dayes before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion should be celebrated, his speech was publiquely to like effect, <hi>Kill me if euer this hand do reach forth the things that are holy, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom</hi> THE CHVRCH <hi>hath iudged despisers.</hi> Whereupon, for feare of tumult, the forenamed Bertelier was by his friends aduised for that time not to vse the liberty granted him by the Senate, nor to present himselfe in the Church, till they saw somewhat further what would ensue. After the Communion quietly ministred, and some likelihood of peaceable ending these troubles without any more ado, that very day in the afternoone, besides all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, concluding his ordinary sermon, he telleth them, that because he neither had learned nor taught to striue with such as are in authority, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (sayth he) <hi>the case so standing as now it doth, let me vse these words of the Apostle vnto you, I commend you vnto God &amp; the word of his grace,</hi> and so bad them hartily all <hi>A dew.</hi> It sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that the readiest way which a wise man hath to conquer, is to flie. This voluntarie and vnexpected mention of sudden departure, caused presently the Senate (for according to their woonted maner they still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued onely constant in vnconstancy) to gather themselues together, and for a time to suspend their own decree, leauing things to proceed as before, till they had heard the iudgement of foure Heluetian Cities concerning the matter which was in strife. This to haue done at the first before they gaue asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any order, had shewed some wit &amp; discretion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but now to do it, was as much as to say in effect, that they would play their parts on stage. Caluin therfore dispatcheth with all expedition his letters vnto some principall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in euery of those cities, crauing earnestly at their hands, to respect this cause as a thing whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole state of religion &amp; piety in that church did so much depend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God &amp; all good men were now ineuitably certaine to be trampled vnder foot, vnlesse those foure Cities by their good means might be brought to giue sentence with the ministers of Geneua, when the cause should be brought before them: yea so to giue it, that two things it might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19711:8"/>
effectually containe; the one an absolute approbation of the discipline of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua, as consonant vnto the word of God, without any cautions, qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ifs or ands; the other an earnest admonition not to innouate or change the same. His veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t request herein as touching both points was satisfied. For albeit the sayd Heluetian Churches did neuer as yet obserue that disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,<note place="margin">Ep. 166.</note> neuerthelesse the Senate of Geneua hauing required their iudgement concerning these three questions: First, <hi>after what manner, by Gods commaundement, according to the Scripture and vnspotted reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, excommunication is to be exercised:</hi> Secondly, <hi>whether it may not be exercised some other way then by the Consistorie:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>what the vse of their Churches was to do in this case:</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was returned from the sayd Churches, <hi>That they had heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of those consistoriall lawes, and did acknowledge them to be</hi> godly <hi>ordinances</hi> drawing towards <hi>the prescript of the word of God, for which cause that they did not thinke it good for</hi> the Church of Geneua <hi>by innouation to change the same, but rather to keepe them as they were.</hi> Which aunswer, although not aunswering vnto the former demaunds, but respecting what Maister Caluin had iudged requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for them to aunswere, was notwithstanding accepted without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reply: in as much as they plainely saw, that when stomacke doth striue with wit, the match is not equall. And so the heat of their former contentions began to flake. The present inhabitants of Geneua, J hope, will not take it in euill part, that the faltinesse of their people heretofore, is by vs so farre forth layd open, as their owne learned guides and Pastors haue thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to discouer it vnto the world. For out of their bookes and writings it is that I haue collected this whole narration, to the end it might thereby appeare in what sort amongst them that discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst our selues. The reasons which mooued Caluin herein to be so earnest,<note place="margin">Quod eam vrbem videret omnino his frenis indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</note> was, as Beza himselfe testifieth, <hi>for that he saw how needfull these bridles were to be put in the iawes of that Citie.</hi> That which by wisedome he saw to be requisite for that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was by as great wisedome compassed. But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which Caluin did for establishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in vs all a loue to our owne counsels. The contradiction of others is a fanne to inflame that loue. Our loue set on fire to maintaine that which once we haue done, sharpeneth the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all meanes to reason for it. Wherefore a maruaile it were if a man of so great capacitie, hauing such incitements to make him desirous of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19711:8"/>
all kind of furtherances vnto his cause, could espie in the whole Scripture of God nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that diuine authority it selfe was the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the wit euen of Caluin was able from thence to draw, by sifting the very vtmost sentence and syllable, is no more then that certaine speeches there are which to him did seeme to intimate, that all Christian Churches ought to haue their Elderships indued with power of excommunication, and that a part of those Elderships euery where should be chosen out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongst the laitie after that forme which himselfe had framed Geneua vnto. But what argument are ye able to shew, whereby it was euer prooued by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, that any one sentence of Scripture doth necessarily enforce these things, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his against the orders of your owne Church? We should be iniurious vnto vertue it selfe, if we did derogate from them whom their industrie hath made great. Two things of principall moment there are which haue deseruedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him honour throughout the world: the one his exceeding paynes in composing the Institutions of Christian Religion; the other his no lesse industrious trauailes for exposition of holy Scripture according vnto the same institutions. In which two things who soeuer they were that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him bestowed their labour; he gayned the aduantage of preiudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, if they gaine said; and of glorie aboue them, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. His writings published after the question about that discipline was once begunne, omit not any the least occasion of extolling the vse and singular necessitie thereof. Of what accompt the Maister of sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and more amongest the Preachers of reformed Churches Caluin had purchased: so that the perfectest diuines were iudged they, which were skilfullest in Caluins writings. His bookes almost the very Canon to iudge both doctrine and discipline by French Churches, both vnder others abroad, and at home in their owne Countrey, all cast according vnto that mould which Caluin had made. The Church of Scotland in erecting the fabricke of their reformation tooke the selfe same paterne. Till at length the discipline, which was at the first so weake, that without the staffe of their approbation, who were not subiect vnto it themselues, it had not brought others vnder subiection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne now to challenge vniuersall obedience, and to enter into open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with those very Churches, which in desperate extremitie had bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers of it. To one of those Churches which liued in most peaceable sort, and abounded as well with men for their learning in other professions sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as also with diuines whose equals were not elsewhere to be found;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19711:9"/>
a Church ordered by Gualters discipline, and not by that which Geneua ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: vnto this Church, the Church of Heidelberge, there commeth one who crauing leaue to dispute publiquely, defendeth with open disdaine of their gouernement, that <hi>To a Minister with his Eldership power is giuen by the law of God to excommunicate whomsoeuer, yea euen kings and princes themselues.</hi> Here were the seedes sowne of that controuersie which sprang vp betweene Beza and Erastus about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of excommunication, whether there ought to be in all Churches an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership hauing power to excommunicate, and a part of that Eldership to be of necessitie certaine chosen out from amongest the laity for that purpose. In which disputation they haue, as to me it seemeth, deuided very equally the truth betweene them; Beza most truly maintaining the necessitie of excommunication; Erastus as truly the nonnecessitie of layelders to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof. Amongest our selues, there was in King Edwards dayes some question moued by reason of a few mens scrupulositie touching certaine things. And beyond Seas, of them which fled in the dayes of Queene Mary, some contenting themselues abroad with the vse of their owne Seruice booke at home authorised before their departure out of the Realme; others liking better the Common prayer booke of the Church of Geneua translated; those smaller contentions before begun were by this meane somewhat increased. Vnder the happy raigne of her Maiesty which now is, the greatest matter a while contended for was the wearing of the Cap and Surplesse, till there came Admonitions directed vnto the high Court of Parliament, by men who concealing their names thought it glory inough to discouer their minds and affections, which now were vniuersally bent euen against all the orders and lawes wherein this Church is found vnconformable to the platforme of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua. Concerning the defendor of which admonitions, all that I meane to say is but this: <hi>There will come a time when three words vttered with charitie and meeknesse, shall receiue a farre more blessed reward, then three thousand volumes written with disdainefull sharpnes of wit.</hi> But the maner of mens writing must not alienate our hearts from the truth, if it appeare they haue the truth: as the followers of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor do thinke he hath, and in that perswasion they follow him, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then himselfe doth Calvin, Beza, and others, with the like perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that they in this cause had the truth.

Which thing, though in it selfe most true, is in your defence notwithstanding weake: because the matter, wherein ye thinke that yee see and imagine that your wayes are sincere, is of farre deeper consideration then any one amongest fiue hundred of you conceiueth. Let the vulgar sort amongst you know, that there is not the least branch of the cause wherin they are so resolute, but to the triall of it a great deale more appertaineth then their conceipt doth reach vnto.

If it be graunted a thing vnlawfull for priuate men, not called vnto publique consultation, to dispute which is the best state of ciuill Policie (with a desire of bringing in some other kind then that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they already liue, for of such disputes I take it his meaning was;) if it be a thing confest that of such questions they cannot determine without rashnesse, in as much as a great part of them consisteth in speciall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and for one kind as many reasons may be brought as for another; is there any reason in the world, why they should better iudge what kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall is the fittest? For in the Ciuill state more insight, and in those affaires more experience a great deale must needes be graunted them, then in this they can possibly haue? When they which write in defence of your discipline,<note place="margin">The author of the petition directed to her Maiestie p. 3.</note> and commend it vnto the <hi>Highest</hi> not in the least cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manner, are forced notwithstanding to acknowledge, that <hi>with whom the truth is they knowe not,</hi> they are not certaine; what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or knowledge can the multitude haue thereof? Waigh what doth mooue the common sort so much to fauour this innouation, and it shall soone appeare vnto you, that the force of particular reasons which for your seuerall opinions are alleaged, is a thing whereof the multitude neuer did, nor could so consider as to be there with wholly caried; but certaine generall induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vsed to make saleable your Cause in grosse: and when once men haue cast a phancie towards it, any slight declaration of specialties will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19711:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
serue to lead forward mens inclinable and prepared minds. The methode of winning the peoples affection vnto a generall liking of <hi>the Cause</hi> (for so ye terme it) hath bene this. First in the hearing of the multitude, the faults especially of higher callings are ripped vp with maruellous excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding seuerity and sharpnesse of reproofe; which being oftentimes done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth a great good opinion of integritie, zeale &amp; holinesse, to such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant reproouers of sinne, as by likelihood would neuer be so much offended at that which is euill, vnlesse themselues were singularly good. The next thing hereunto is to impute all faults and corruptions wherewith the world aboundeth, vnto the kind of Ecclesiasticall gouernement established. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as before by reprouing faults, they purchased vnto themselues with the multitude a name to be vertuous; so by finding out this kind of cause, they obtaine to be iudged wise aboue others: whereas in truth vnto the forme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Iewish gouernement, which the Lord himselfe (they all confesse) did establish, with like shew of reason they might impute those faults which the Prophets condemne in the gouernors of that common wealth; as to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall (whereof also God himselfe though in other sort is author) the staines and blemishes found in our State; which springing from the root of humaine frailty and corruption, not only are, but haue bene alwaies more or lesse, yea and (for any thing we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) will be till the worlds end complained of, what forme of gouernement soeuer take place. Hauing gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose their owne forme of Church gouernement, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soueraigne remedy of all euils; and to adorne it with all the glorious titles that may be. And the nature, as of men that haue sicke bodies, so likewise of the people in the crazednes of their minds possest with dislike and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment at things present, is to imagine that any thing (the vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they here commended) would helpe them; but that most, which they least haue tried. The fourth degree of inducements, is by fashioning the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; conceipts of mens minds in such sort, that when they read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may thinke that euery thing soundeth towards the aduancement of that discipline, and to the vtter disgrace of the contrary. Pythagoras,<note place="margin">Arist. Metaph. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> by bringing vp his Schollers in the speculatiue knowledge of numbers, made their conceipts therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation of things naturall, they imagined that in euery particular thing they euen beheld as it were with their eyes, how the elements of number gaue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and being to the workes of nature. A thing in reason impossible: which notwithstanding through their misfashioned preconceipt, appeared vnto them no lesse certaine, then if nature had written it in the very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19711:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foreheads of all the creatures of God. When they of the family of loue haue it once in their heads, that <hi>Christ</hi> doth not signifie any one person, but a qualitie whereof many are partakers; that to be <hi>raised</hi> is nothing else but to be regenerated or indued with the said quality; and that when separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them which haue it from them which haue it not is here made, this is <hi>iudgement;</hi> how plainely do they imagine that the Scripture euery where speaketh in the fauour of that sect? And assuredly the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to thinke they euen see how the word of God runneth currantly on your side, is that their minds are forestalled and their conceits peruerted before hand, by being taught that an <hi>Elder</hi> doth signifie a lay man admitted onely to the office of rule or gouernement in the Church; a <hi>Doctor</hi> one which may only teach and neither preach nor admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Sacraments; a <hi>Deacon</hi> one which hath charge of the almes boxe and of nothing else: that the <hi>Scepter,</hi> the <hi>rod,</hi> the <hi>throne</hi> &amp; <hi>kingdome</hi> of Christ, are a forme of regiment, onely by Pastors, Elders, Doctors and Deacons: that by mysticall resemblance mount Sion and Jerusalem are the Churches which admit, Samaria and Babylon the Churches which oppugne the said forme of regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And in like sort they are taught to apply al things spoken of repairing the wals and decayed parts of the city &amp; temple of God, by Esdras, Nehemias, &amp; the rest: as if purposely the holy Ghost had therein ment to foresignifie, what the authors of admonitions to the Parliament, of supplications to the Councell, of petitions to her Maiesty, and of such other like writs, should either do or suffer in behalfe of this their cause. From hence they proceed to an higher point, which is the perswading of men cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous &amp; ouer capable of such pleasing errors, that it is the speciall illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghost, whereby they discerne those things in the word, which others reading yet discerne them not. <hi>Dearly beloued</hi> saith S.

Otherwise

how can it be but that some other sinewes there are from which that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of strength in perswasion doth arise? Most sure it is, that when mens affections do frame their opinions, they are in defence of error more earnest a great deale, then (for the most part) sound belieuers in the maintenance of truth apprehended according to the nature of that euidence which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yeeldeth: which being in some things plaine, as in the principles of Christian doctrine; in some things, as in these matters of discipline, more darke and doubtfull, frameth correspondently that inward assent which Gods most gracious Spirit worketh by it as by his effectuall instrument. It is not therefore the feruent earnestnes of their perswasion, but the soundnes of those reasons whereupon the same is built, which must declare their opinions in these things to haue bene wrought by the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">2.

After that the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the common sort hath once throughly apprehended the Spirit to be author of their perswasion concerning discipline, then is instilled into their hearts, that the same Spirit leading men into this opinion, doth thereby seale them to be Gods children; and that as the state of the times now standeth, the most speciall token to know them that are Gods owne from others, is an earnest affection that way. This hath bred high termes of separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene such and the rest of the world; whereby the one sort are named <hi>The</hi>

From hence, they are easily drawne on to thinke it exceeding necessarie, for feare of quenching that good Spirit, to vse all meanes whereby the same may be both strengthned in themselues, and made manifest vnto others. This maketh them diligent hearers of such as are knowne that way to incline; this maketh them eager to take and to seeke all occasions of secret conference with such; this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them glad to vse such as Counsellors and directors in all their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which are of waight, as contracts, testaments, and the like; this maketh them, through an vnweariable desire of receiuing instruction from the maisters of that companie, to cast off the care of those verie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires which do most concerne their estate, and to thinke that then they are like vnto Marie, commendable for making choyce of the better part.

               <hi>as how to abound,</hi> are a most fit episcopall emprese. The Church of Christ is a body mysticall. A body cannot stand, vnlesse the parts thereof be proportionable. Let it therefore be required on both parts, at the hands of the Cleargie, to be in meannesse of state like the Apostles; at the hands of the laitie, to be as they were who liued vnder the Apostles: and in this reformation there will bee though little wisedome, yet some indifferencie. But your reformation which are of the Cleargie (if yet it displease ye not that I should say ye are of the Cleargie) seemeth to aime at a broader marke. Ye thinke that he which will perfectly reforme, must bring the forme of Church discipline vnto the state which then it was at. A thing neither possible, nor certaine, nor absolutely conuenient. Concerning the first, what was vsed in the Apostles times, the scripture fully declareth not; so that making their times the rule and Canon of Church politie, ye make a rule which being not possible to be fully knowne, is as impossible to be kept. Againe, sith the later euen of the Apostles owne times, had that which in the former was not thought vpon; in this generall proposing of the Apostolicall times, there is no certaintie which should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, especially seeing that ye giue vs great cause to doubt how far ye allow those times.

Thirdly, whereas it is the error of the common multitude, to consider onely what hath bene of olde, and if the same were well, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther still it continue; if not, to condemne that presently which is, and neuer to search vpon what ground or consideration the change might growe: such rudenes cannot be in you so well borne with, whom learning and iudgement

What man is there of vnderstanding, vnto whom it is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, how the way of prouiding for the Cleargie by tithes, the deuise of almes-houses for the poore, the sorting out of the people into their seuerall parishes, together with sundrie other things which the Apostles times could not haue, (being now established) are much more conuenient and fit for the Church of Christ, then if the same should be taken away for conformities sake with the auncientest and first times? The orders therefore which were obserued in the Apostles times, are not to be vrged as a rule vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, either sufficient or necessary. If they bee, neuerthelesse on your part it still remaineth to bee better prooued, that the forme of discipline which ye intitle apostolicall, was in the Apostles times exercised. For of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ye faile euen touching that which ye make most account of, as being matter of substance in discipline, I meane the power of your lay-elders, and the difference of your Doctors from the Pastors in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. So that in summe, we may be bold to conclude, that besides these last times, which for insolencie, pride, and egregious contempt of all good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are the worst, there are none wherein ye can truly affirme, that the complete forme of your discipline, or the substance thereof was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The euidence therefore of antiquitie failing you, yee flie to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such learned men, as seeme by their writings to be of opinion that all Christian Churches should receiue your discipline, and abandon ours. Wherein, as ye heape vp the names of a number of men not vnworthy to be had in honor; so there are a number whom when ye mention, although it serue ye to purpose with the ignorant and vulgar sort, who measure by tale &amp; not by waight, yet surely they who know what qualitie and value the men are of, will thinke ye drawe very neare the dregs. But were they all of as great account as the best and chiefest amongst them, with vs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding neither are they, neither ought they to be of such reckening, that their opinion or coniecture should cause the lawes of the Church of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19711:14"/>
England to giue place. Much lesse when they neither do all agree in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are at agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the most part through a courteous induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue followed one man as their guide, finally, that one therein not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to haue swarued. If any chance to say it is probable that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles times there were layelders, or not to mislike the continuance of them in the Church; or to affirme that Bishops at the first were a name, but not a power distinct from presbyters; or to speake any thing in praise of those Churches which are without episcopall regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or to reproue the fault of such as abuse that calling; all these ye register for men, perswaded as you are, that euery christian Church sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth bound by the law of God to put downe Bishops, and in their roomes to erect an eldership so authorized as you would haue it for the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of each parish. Deceiued greatly they are therfore, who think that all they whose names are cited amongst the fauourers of this cause, are on any such verdict agreed. Yet touching some materiall points of your disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, a kind of agreement we grant there is amongst many diuines of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad. For first to do as the Church of Geneua did, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in some other churches must needs be the more willing, who hauing vsed in like maner not the slow &amp; tedious help of proceeding by publike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the peoples more quick endeuor for alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in such an exigent I see not well how they could haue staied to deliberat about any other regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which already was deuised to their hands, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which in like case had bene take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that which was easiest to be established without delay, that which was likeliest to content the people by reason of some kind of sway which it giueth them. When therfore the example of one Church was thus at the first almost through a kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straint or necessitie followed by many, their concurrence in perswasion about some materiall points belonging to the same policie is not strange. For we are not to maruell greatly, if they which haue all done the same thing, do easily embrace the same opinion as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

But if two, or three, or foure, agree all in the same tale, they iudge it then to be out of controuersie, and so are many times ouertaken, for want of due consideration; eyther some common cause leading them all in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

and to haue spred it selfe from hand to hand, they all are in force but as one testimony. Nor is it otherwise here where the daughter Churches do speake their mothers dialect; here where so many sing one song, by reason that hee is the guide of the quier concerning whose deserued authoritie amongst euen the grauest diuines, we haue already spoken at large.

Yet are we not able to define, whether the wisedome of that God (who setteth before vs in holy Scripture so many admirable paternes of vertue, and no one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out somewhat noted wherin they were culpable, to the end that to him alone it might alwayes be acknowledged, <hi>Thou onely art holy, thou onely art iust</hi>) might not permit those worthy vessels of his glory to be in some thinges blemished with the staine of humaine frailtie, euen for this cause, least wee should esteeme of any man aboue that which behoueth.</p>

Ye will perhaps make answere, that being perswaded already as touching the truth of your cause, ye are not to harken vnto any sentence, no not though Angels should define otherwise, as the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostles owne example teacheth: againe that men, yea Councels may erre; and that vnlesse the iudgement giuen do satisfie your minds, vnlesse it be such as ye can by no further argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t oppugne, in a word, vnlesse you perceiue and acknowledge it your selues consonant with Gods word, to stand vnto it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it, were to sinne against your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences.

in the eye of his vnderstanding, that sometime an erroneous sentence defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue should preuaile, till the same authoritie perceiuing such ouersight, might afterwardes correct or reuerse it, then that strifes should haue respit to growe, and not come speedily vnto some end. Neither wish we that men should do any thing which in their hearts they are perswaded they ought not to doe, but this perswasion ought (we say) to be fully setled in their harts, that in litigious and controuersed causes of such qualitie, the will of God is to haue them to do whatsoeuer the sentence of iudiciall and finall decision shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, yea though it seeme in their priuate opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to swarue vtterly from that which is right: as no doubt many times the sentence amongst the Iewes did seeme vnto one part or other contending; and yet in this case God did then allow them to doe that which in their priuate iudgement it seemed (yea and perhaps truly seemed) that the lawe did disallow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if God be not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confusion, but of peace; then can he not be the author of our refusall, but of our contentment, to stand vnto some definitiue sentence; without which almost impossible it is, that eyther wee should auoyd confusion, or euer hope to attaine peace. To small purpose had the Councell of Ierusalem bene assembled, if once their determination being set downe, men might afterwards haue defended their former opinions. When therefore they had giuen their definitiue sentence, all controuersie was at an ende. Things were disputed before they came to be determined; men afterwardes were not to dispute any longer, but to obey. The sentence of iudgement finished their strife, which their disputes before iudgement could not doe. This was ground sufficient for any reasonable mans conscience to build the dutie of obedience vpon, whatsoeuer his owne opinion were as touching the matter before in question. So full of wilfulnes and selfeliking is our nature, that without some definitiue sentence, which being giuen may stand, and a necessitie of silence on both sides afterward imposed; small hope there is that strifes thus far prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will in short time quietly end. Now it were in vaine to aske you whether ye could be content that the sentence of any Court already erected, should bee so farre authorized, as that among the Iewes established by God himselfe, for the determining of all controuersies: <hi>That man which wil do presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously, not harkning vnto the Priest that standeth before the Lord to minister there, nor vnto the Iudge, let him dye.</hi> Ye haue giuen vs already to vnderstand, what your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in part concerning her sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Court of high Commission, the nature whereof is the same with that amongst the Iewes, albeit the power be not so great.

Will ye blame any man for doing that of his owne accord, which all men should be compelled to do that are not willing of themselues? When God commandeth, shall we answer that we will obey, if so be Caesar will graunt vs leaue? Is discipline an Ecclesiasticall matter or a Ciuill? If an Ecclesiasticall, it must of necessitie belong to the duty of the Minister.

And if such by your owne acknowledgement be persons dangerous, although as yet the alterations which they haue made are of small and tender groath; the changes likely to insue throughout all states and vocations within this land, in case your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire should take place, must be thought vpon. First concerning the supreme power of the highest, they are no small prerogatiues which now thereunto belonging the forme of your discipline will constraine it to resigne, as in the last booke of this treatise we haue shewed at large. Againe it may iustly be feared, whether our English Nobility, when the matter came in tryall, would contentedly suffer themselues to be alwayes at the call, and to stand to the sentence of a number of meane persons, assisted with the presence of their poore teacher, a man (as sometimes it hapneth) though better able to speake, yet little or no whit apter to iudge then the rest: from whom, be their dealings neuer so absurd (vnlesse it be by way of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint to a Synod) no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale may be made vnto any one of higher power, in as much as the order of your discipline admitteth no standing inequalitie of Courts, no spirituall iudge to haue any ordinary superiour on earth, but as many supremacies as there are parishes &amp; seuerall Congregations. Neither is it altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause that so many do feare the ouerthrow of all learning, as a threatned sequell of this your intended discipline.

Those degrees which their statutes bind them to take, are by your lawes taken away; your selues who haue sought them ye so excuse, as that ye would haue men to thinke ye iudge them not allowable, but tollerable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to be borne with for some helpe which ye find in them vnto the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of your purposes, till the corrupt estate of the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your lawes forbidding Ecclesiasticall persons vtterly the exercise of Ciuill power, must needs depriue the Heads and Maisters in the same Colledges of all such authoritie as now they exercise, either at home, by puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the faults of those, who not as children to their parents by the law of Nature, but altogether by ciuill authority are subiect vnto them; or abroad, by keeping Courts amongst their tenants. Your lawes making permanent inequalitie amongst Ministers a thing repugnant to the word of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force those Colledges, the Seniors whereof are all or any part of them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vnder the gouernment of a maister in the same vocation, to choose as oft as they meet together a new president. For if so ye iudge it necessary to do in Synods, for the auoyding of permanent inequality amongst Ministers, the same cause must needs euen in these Collegiate assemblies enforce the like. Except per aduenture ye meane to auoid all such absurdities, by dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing those Corporations, and by bringing the Vniuersities vnto the forme of the Schoole of Geneua. Which thing men the rather are inclined to looke for, in as much as the Ministery, whereinto their founders with singular prouidence haue by the same statutes appointed them necessarily to enter at a certaine time, your lawes bind them much more necessarily to forbeare, till some parish abroad call for them. Your opinion concerning the law Ciuill is,<note place="margin">Humb.

Professors in that kind being few, ye are the bolder to spurne at them, and not to dissemble your minds as concerning their remoouall: in whose studies although my selfe haue not much bene conuersant, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse exceeding great cause I see there is to wish that thereunto more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement were giuen, as well for the singular treasures of wisedome therein conteined, as also for the great vse we haue thereof both in decision of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinds of causes arising daily within our selues, and especially for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Nations abroad, whereunto that knowledge is most requisite.

For whereas the name of diuine authority is vsed to countenance these things, which are not the commaundements of God, but your owne erronious collections; on him ye must father whatsoeuer ye shall afterwards be led, either to do in withstanding the aduersaries of your cause, or to thinke in maintenance of your doings.

Nothing more cleare vnto their seeming, then that a new Jerusalem being often spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Scripture, they vndoubtedly were themselues that newe Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and the old did by way of a certaine figuratiue resemblance signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what they should both be and do. Here they drewe in a Sea of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by applying all things vnto their owne companie, which are any where spoken concerning diuine fauours and benefits bestowed vppon the old Common-wealth of Israell; concluding that as Israell was deliuered out of Aegypt, so they spiritually out of the Aegypt of this worldes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile thraldome vnto sinne and superstition; as Israell was to roote out the Idolatrous nations, and to plant in steede of them a people which feared God, so the same Lords goodwill and pleasure was nowe, that these new Israelites should vnder the conduct of other Iosuaes, Sampsons, and Gedeons, performe a worke no lesse miraculous in casting out violently the wicked from the earth, and establishing the kingdome of Christ with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect libertie: and therefore as the cause why the children of Israell tooke vnto one man many wiues, might be least the casualties of warre should any way hinder the promise of God concerning their multitude from taking effect in them; so it was not vnlike that for the necessarie propagation of Christes kingdome vnder the Gospell, the Lord was content to allowe as much. Now whatsoeuer they did in such sort collect out of Scripture, when they came to iustifie or perswade it vnto others, all was the heauenly fathers

appointment, his commandement, his will and charge. Which thing is the very point in regard whereof I haue gathered this declaration. For my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose herein is to shew, that when the minds of men are once erroniously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that it is the will of God to haue those things done which they phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; their opinions are as thornes in their sides, neuer suffering them to take rest till they haue brought their speculations into practise: the lets and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of which practise their restlesse desire and study to remoue, leadeth them euery day forth by the hand into other more dangerous opinions, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quite &amp; cleane contrary to their first pretended meanings: so as what will grow out of such errors as go masked vnder the cloake of diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, impossible it is that euer the wit of man should imagine, till time haue brought forth the fruits of them: for which cause it behoueth wisedome to feare the sequels thereof, euen beyond all apparant cause of feare. These men in whose mouthes at the first, sounded nothing but onely mortification of the flesh; were come at the length to thinke they might lawfully haue their sixe or seuen wiues apeece: they which at the first thought iudgement and iustice it selfe to be mercilesse cruelty; accompted at the length their owne hands sanctified with being imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But howsoever these and the like speeches be accompted as arrowes idly shot at randon, without either eye had to any marke, or regard to their lighting place: hath not your longing desire for the practise of your discipline, brought the matter already vnto this demurrer amongst you, whether the people and their godly pastors that way affected, ought not to make separation from the rest, and to begin the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of discipline without the licence of Ciuill powers, which licence they haue sought for, and are not heard? Vpon which question as ye haue now deuided your selues, the warier sort of you taking the one part, and the forwarder in zeale the other; so in case these earnest ones should preuaile, what other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell can any wise man imagine but this, that hauing first resolued that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for discipline without superiors are lawfull, it will follow in the next place to be disputed what may be attempted against superiors which will not haue the scepter of that discipline to rule ouer them? Yea euen by you which haue stayed your selues from running headlong with the other sort, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what notwithstanding there hath bene done without the leaue or liking of your lawfull superiors, for the exercise of a part of your discipline amongst the Cleargy thereunto addicted. And least examination of principall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein should bring those things to light, which might hinder and let your proceedings; behold for a barre against that impediment, one opinion ye haue newly added vnto the rest euen vpon this occasion, an opinion to exempt you from taking oathes which may turne to the molestation of your brethren in that cause. The next neighbour opinion whereunto, when occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, may follow for dispensation with oathes already taken, if they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be found to import a necessity of detecting ought which may bring such good men into trouble or damage, whatsoeuer the cause be. O mercifull God, what mans wit is there able to found the depth of those daungerous and fearefull euils, whereinto our weake and impotent nature is inclinable to sinke itselfe, rather then to shew an acknowledgement of error in that which once we haue vnaduisedly taken vpon vs to defend, against the streame as it were of a contrary publique resolution!

good and currant. That which wanteth in the waight of their speech, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the aptnes of mens minds to accept and beleeue it. Whereas on the other side, if we maintaine thinges that are established, wee haue not onely to striue with a number of heauie preiudices deepely rooted in the hearts of men, who thinke that herein we serue the time, and speake in fauour of the present state, because thereby we eyther hold or seeke preferment; but also to beare such exceptions as minds so auerted before hand vsually take against that which they are loath should be powred into them. Albeit therefore much of that we are to speake in this present cause, may seeme to a number perhaps tedious, perhaps obscure, darke, and intricate, (for many talke of the truth, which neuer soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the depth from whence it springeth, and therfore when they are led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are soone weary, as men drawne from those beaten pathes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue bene inured): yet this may not so farre preuaile, as to cut off that which the matter it selfe requireth, howsoeuer the nice humour of some be therewith pleased or no. They vnto whom we shall seeme tedious, are in no wise iniuried by vs, because it is in their owne hands to spare that labour which they are not willing to endure. And if any complaine of obscuritie, they must consider, that in these matters it commeth no otherwise to passe, then in sundry the workes both of art and also of nature, where that which hath greatest force in the very things we see, is notwithstanding it selfe oftentimes not seene. The statelinesse of houses, the goodlines of trees, when we behold them delighteth the eye; but that foundation which beareth vp the one, that roote which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth vnto the other nourishment and life, is in the bosome of the earth concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; &amp; if there be at any time occasion to search into it, such labour is then more necessary then pleasant, both to them which vndertake it, and for the lookers on. In like manner the vse and benefite of good lawes, all that liue vnder them may enioy with delight and comfort, albeit the groundes and first originall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from whence they haue sprung be vnknowne, as to the greatest part of men they are. But when they who withdraw their obedience, pretend that the lawes which they should obey are corrupt and vitious; for better examination of their qualitie, it behoueth the very foundation and roote, the highest welspring and fountaine of them to be discouered. Which because wee are not oftentimes accustomed to doe, when wee doe it, the paines wee take are more needefull a great deale then acceptable, and the matters which wee handle seeme by reason of newnesse, (till the minde grow better acquainted with them) darke, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and vnfamiliar. For as much helpe whereof as may be in this case, I haue endeuoured throughout the body of this whole discourse, that euery former part might giue strength vnto all that followe, and euery later bring some light vnto all before. So that if the iudgements of men doe but holde themselues in suspence as touching these first more generall meditations, till in order they haue perused the rest that ensue: what may seeme darke at the first will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes be founde more plaine, euen as the later particular decisions will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare I doubt not more strong, when the other haue beene read before. The lawes of the Church, whereby for so many ages together wee haue bene guided in the exercise of Christian religion and the seruice of the true God, our rites, customes, and orders of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, are called in

question; wee are accused as men that will not haue Christ Iesus to rule ouer them, but haue wilfully cast his statutes behinde their backes, hating to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and made subiect vnto the scepter of his discipline. Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee offer the lawes whereby wee liue vnto the generall triall and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole world; hartily beseeching almightie God, whome wee desire to serue according to his owne will, that both wee and others (all kinde of partiall affection being cleane laide aside) may haue eyes to see, and hearts to embrace, the things that in his sight are most acceptable. And because the point about which wee striue is the qualitie of our lawes, our first entrance hereinto cannot better be made, then with consideration of the nature of lawe in generall, and of that lawe which giueth life vnto all the rest which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable iust and good, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All thinges therefore doe worke after a sort according to lawe: all other thinges according to a lawe, whereof some superiours vnto whome they are subiect is author; onely the workes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of God, haue him both for their worker, and for the lawe whereby they are wrought. The being of God, is a kinde of lawe to his working: for that perfection which God is, giueth perfection to that hee doth. Those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, necessary, and internall operations of God, the <hi>generation</hi> of the Sonne, the <hi>proceeding</hi> of the Spirit, are without the compasse of my present intent: which is to touch onely such operations as haue their beginning and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a voluntary purpose, wherewith God hath eternally decreed when and how they should bee. Which eternall decree is that wee tearme an eternall lawe. Dangerous it were for the feeble braine of man to wade farre into the doings of the most High; whome although to knowe bee life, and ioy to make mention of his name; yet our soundest knowledge is, to know that wee know him not as indeede hee is, neither can know him; and our safest eloquence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him is our silence when we confesse without confession, that his glory is inexplicable, his greatnesse aboue our capacitie and reach. Hee is aboue, and wee vpon earth; therefore it behoueth our wordes to bee warie and fewe, Our God is one, or rather very <hi>onenesse,</hi> and meere vnitie, hauing nothing but it selfe in it selfe, and not consisting (as all things doe besides God) of many things.

Wherfore to come to the law of nature, albeit therby we sometimes meane that manner of working which God hath set for each created thing to keepe: yet for as much as those things are tearmed most properly naturall agents, which keepe the lawe of their kind vnwittingly, as the heauens and elements of the world, which can do no otherwise then they doe; and for as much as we giue vnto intellectuall natures the name of <hi>voluntary</hi> agents, that so we may distinguish them from the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expedient it will be, that we seuer the law of nature obserued by the one, from that which the other is tied vnto.

Surely it seemeth that <hi>Moses</hi> had herein besides this a further purpose, namely, first to teach that God did not worke as a necessary, but a voluntary agent, intending before hand and decreeing with himselfe that which did outwardly proceed from him: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to shew that God did then institute a law natural to be obserued by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore according to the manner of lawes, the institution thereof is described, as being established by solemne iniunction. His commaunding those things to be which are, and to be in such sort as they are, to keep that tenure and course which they do, importeth the establishment of natures law.

That which agreeth to the one now, the other shall attaine vnto in the end; they are not so farre dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned and seuered, but that they come at length to meete. The soule of man being therefore at the first as a booke, wherein nothing is, and yet all thinges may be imprinted; we are to search by what steppes and degrees it riseth vnto perfection of knowledge. Vnto that which hath bene alreadie set downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning naturall agents this we must adde, that albeit therein we haue compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as well creatures liuing, as void of life, if they be in degree of nature beneath men; neuerthelesse a difference we must obserue betweene those naturall agents that worke altogether vnwittingly, and those which haue though weake, yet some vnderstanding what they do, as fishes, foules, and beasts haue. Beasts are in sensible capacitie as ripe euen as men themselues, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more ripe. For as stones, though in dignitie of nature inferior vnto plants, yet exceed them in firmenesse of strength or durability of being; and plants though beneath the excellency of creatures indued with sense, yet exceed them in the faculty of vegetation and of fertility: so beasts though otherwise behind men, may notwithstanding in actions of sense and phancie go beyond them; because the endeuors of nature, when it hath an higher perfection to seeke, are in lower the more remisse, not esteeming thereof so much as those things do, which haue no better proposed vnto them.

Till we grow to some ripenesse of yeares, the soule of man doth only store it selfe with conceipts of things of inferiour and more open qualitie, which afterwards do serue as instruments vnto that which is greater: in the meane while aboue the reach of meaner creatures it ascendeth not. When once it comprehendeth any thing aboue this, as the differences of time, affirmations, negations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contradictions in speech; we then count it to haue some vse of naturall reason. Whereunto if afterwards there might be added the right helpes of true art and learning, (which helpes I must plainely confesse this age of the world, carying the name of a learned age, doth neither much know nor greatly regard) there would vndoubtedly be almost as great difference in maturitie of iudgement betweene men therewith inured, and that which now men are, as betweene men that are now and innocents. Which speech if any condemne, as being ouer hyperbolicall, let them consider but this one thing. No art is at the first finding out so perfect as industrie may after make it. Yet the very first man that to any purpose knew the way we speake of and followed it, hath alone thereby performed more very neere in all parts of naturall knowledge, then sithence in any one part thereof, the whole world besides hath done.

But at what time a man may be sayd to haue attained so farre foorth the vse of reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those lawes, whereby he is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bound to guide his actions; this is a great deale more easie for common sense to discerne, then for any man by skill and learning to determine: euen as it is not in Philosophers, who best know the nature both of fire and of gold, to teach what degree of the one will serue to purifie the other, so well as the artisan (who doth this by fire) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth by sense when the fire hath that degree of heate which sufficeth for his purpose.</p>

The end for which we are moued to worke, is somtimes the goodnes which we conceiue of the very working it selfe, without any further respect at all; and the cause that procureth action is the meere desire of action, no other good besides being thereby intended.<note place="margin">Salust.</note> Of certaine turbulent wits it is said, <hi>Illis quieta mouere magna merces videbatur,</hi> They thought the very disturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of things established an hyre sufficient to set them on worke.

The good which either is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by doing, or which consisteth in the very doing it selfe, causeth not action, vnlesse apprehending it as good, we so like and desire it. That we do vnto any such ende, the same we choose and preferre before the leauing of it vndone. Choice there is not, vnlesse the thing which we take, be so in our power that we might haue refused and left it. If fire consume the stubble, it chooseth not so to do, because the nature thereof is such that it can do no other. To choose is to will one thing before another. And to will is to bend our soules to the hauing or doing of that which they see to be good. Goodnesse is seene with the eye of the vnderstanding. And the light of that eye, is reason. So that two principall fountaines there are of humaine action, <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; which will in things
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19711:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tending towards any end is termed <hi>Choice.</hi> Concerning knowledge, Behold sayth <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30.19.</note> 
               <hi>I haue set before you this day good and euill, life and death.</hi> Concerning Will, he addeth immediatly, <hi>Choose life</hi>; that is to say, the things that tend vnto life, them choose. But of one thing we must haue speciall care, as being a matter of no small moment, and that is, how the will properly and strictly taken, as it is of things which are referred vnto the end that man desireth, differeth greatly from that inferiour naturall desire which we call appetite. The obiect of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is whatsoeuer sensible good may be wished for; the obiect of wil is that good which reason doth leade vs to seeke. Affections, as ioy, and griefe, and feare, and anger, with such like, being as it were the sundry fashions and formes of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, can neither rise at the conceipt of a thing indifferent, nor yet choose but rise at the sight of some things. Wherefore it is not altogether in our power, whether we will be stirred with affections or no: whereas actions which issue from the dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wil, are in the power therof to be performed or staied. Finally appetite is the wils sollicitor, and the will is appetites controller; what we couet according to the one, by the other we often reiect: neither is any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire termed properly will, but that where reason and vnderstanding, or the shew of reason, prescribeth the thing desired. It may be therfore a question, whether those operations of men are to be counted voluntary, wherein that good which is sensible prouoketh appetite, and appetite causeth action, reason being neuer called to councell; as when we eate or drinke, or betake our selues vnto rest, and such like. The truth is, that such actions in men hauing attained to the vse of reason are voluntary. For as the authoritie of higher powers hath force euen in those things which are done without their priuitie, and are of so meane reckening that to acquaint them therewith it needeth not: in like sort voluntarily we are said to do that also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the will if it listed might hinder from being done, although about the doing thereof we do not expressely vse our reason or vnderstanding, and so immediatly apply our wils thereunto. In cases therefore of such facility, the will doth yeeld her assent, as it were with a kind of silence, by not dissenting; in which respect her force is not so apparant, as in expresse mandates or prohibitions, especially vpon aduice and consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going before. Where vnderstanding therefore needeth, in those things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is the director of mans will, by discouering in action what is good. For the lawes of well doing are the dictates of right reason. Children which are not as yet come vnto those yeares whereat they may haue; againe innocentes which are excluded by naturall defect from euer hauing; thirdly mad men which for the present cannot possibly haue the vse of right reason to guide themselues, haue for their guide the reason that guideth other men, which are tutors ouer them to seeke and to procure their good for them. In the rest there is that light of reason, whereby good may be knowne from euill, and which discouering the same rightly is termed right. The will notwithstanding doth not incline to haue or do that which reason teacheth to be good, vnlesse the same do also teach it to be possible. For albeit the appetite, being more generall, may wish any thing which seemeth good,<note place="margin">O mihi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our felicitie therefore being the obiect and accomplishment of our desire, we cannot choose but wish and couet it. All particular things which are subiect vnto action, the will doth so farre foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto, as reason iudgeth them the better for vs, and consequently the more auaileable to our blisse. If reason erre, we fall into euill, and are so farre forth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the generall perfection we seeke. Seeing therefore that for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of mens actions the knowledge of good from euill is necessarie; it onely resteth that we search how this may be had.

For he that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth what is straight, doth euen thereby discerne what is crooked, because the absence of straightnesse in bodies capable thereof is crookednesse. Goodnesse in actions is like vnto straitnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherfore that which is done well we terme right. For as the straight way is most acceptable to him that trauaileth, because by it he commeth soonest to his iourneys end: so in action, that which doth lye the euenest betweene vs and the end we desire, must needes be the fittest for our vse. Besides which fitnes for vse, there is also in rectitude, beauty; as contrariwise in obliquity, deformity. And that which is good in the actions of men, doth not onely delight as profitable, but as amiable also. In which consideration the Grecians most diuinely haue giuen to the actiue perfection of men, a name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing both beauty and goodnesse,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> because goodnesse in ordinary speech is for the most part applied onely to that which is beneficiall. But we in the name of goodnesse, do here imploy both. And of discerning goodnes there are but these two wayes; the one the knowledge of the causes whereby it is made such; the other the obseruation of those signes and tokens, which being annexed alwaies vnto goodnes, argue that where they are found, there also goodnes is, although we know not the cause by force whereof it is there. The former of these is the most sure &amp; infallible way, but so hard that all shunne it, and had rather walke as men do in the darke by hap hazard, then tread so long and intricate mazes for knowledge sake. As therefore Physitians are many times forced to leaue such methods of curing as themselues know to be the fittest, and being ouerruled by their patients impatiency are fame to try the best they can, in taking that way of cure, which the cured will yeeld vnto: in like sort, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering how the case doth sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with this present age full of tongue &amp; weake of braine, behold we yeeld to the streame thereof; into the causes of goodnes we will not make any curious or deepe inquiry; to touch them now &amp; then it shalbe sufficient, when they are so neere at hand that easily they may be conceiued without any farre remoued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: that way we are contented to proue, which being the worse in it selfe, is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19711:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
notwithstanding now by reason of common imbecillity the fitter &amp; likelier to be brookt. Signes and tokens to know good by, are of sundry kinds: some more certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some lesse. The most certaine token of euident goodnesse is, if the generall perswasion of all men do so account it. And therefore a common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued error is neuer vtterly ouerthrowne, till such time as we go from signes vnto causes, and shew some manifest root or fountaine thereof common vnto all, whereby it may clearly appeare how it hath come to passe that so many haue bene ouerseene. In which case surmises and sleight probabilities will not serue; because the vniuersall consent of men is the perfectest and strongest in this kind which comprehendeth onely the signes and tokens of goodnesse. Things ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall do varie, and that which a man doth but chaunce to thinke well of, cannot still haue the like hap. Wherefore although we know not the cause, yet thus much we may know, that some necessary cause there is, whensoeuer the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all men generally or for the most part run one &amp; the same way, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matters of naturall discourse.

Eth. 10. cap. 2.</note> For that which all men haue at all times learned, nature her selfe must needes haue taught; and God being the author of nature, her voyce is but his instrument. By her from him we receiue whatsoeuer in such sort we learne. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite duties there are, the goodnes wherof is by this rule sufficiently manifested, although we had no other warrant besides to approue them. The Apostle S. Paul hauing speech co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Heathen saith of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note>

A law therefore generally taken, is a directiue rule vnto goodnesse of operation. The rule of diuine operations outward, is the definitiue appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods owne wisedome set downe within himselfe. The rule of naturall agents that worke by simple necessity, is the determination of the wisedome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> known to God himselfe the principall director of them, but not vnto them that are directed to execute the same. The rule of naturall agents which worke after a sort of their owne accord, as the beasts do, is the iudgement of common sense or phancy concerning the sensible goodnes of those obiects wherwith they are moued. The rule of ghostly or immateriall natures, as spirits &amp; Angels, is their intuitiue intellectual iudgement concerning the amiable beauty &amp; high good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that obiect, which with vnspeakeable ioy and delight doth set them on worke. The rule of voluntary agents on earth, is the sentence that reason giueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the goodnes of those things which they are to do. And the sentences which reason giueth, are some more, some lesse general, before it come to define in particular actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s what is good.

Notwithstanding whatsoeuer such principle there is, it was at the first found out by discourse, &amp; drawne from out of the very bowels of heauen and earth. For we are to note, that things in the world are to vs discernable, not onely so farre forth as serueth for our vitall preseruation, but further also in a twofold higher respect. For first if all other vses were vtterly taken away; yet the mind of man being by nature speculatiue and delighted with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation in it selfe, they were to be known euen for meere knowledge and vnderstandings sake. Yea further besides this, the knowledge of euery the least thing in the whole world, hath in it a seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d peculiar benefit vnto vs, in as much as it serueth to minister rules, Canons, and lawes for men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect those actions by, which we properly terme humane. This did the very Heathens themselues obscurely insinuate, by making <hi>Themis</hi> which we call <hi>Ius</hi> or Right to be the daughter of heauen and earth. Wee knowe things either as they are in themselues, or as they are in mutuall relation one to another. The knowledge of that which man is in reference vnto himselfe, and other things in relation vnto man, I may iustly terme the mother of al those principles, which are as it were edicts, statutes, and decrees in that law of nature, wherby humaine actions are framed. First therefore hauing obserued that the best things, where they are not hindered, do still produce the best operations; (for which cause where many things are to concurre vnto one effect, the best is in all congruity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19711:35"/>
of reason to guide the residue, that it preuailing most, the worke principally done by it may haue greatest perfection:) when hereupon we come to obserue in our selues, of what excellencie our soules are in comparison of our bodies, and the diuiner part in relation vnto the baser of our soules; seeing that all these concurre in producing humaine actions, it cannot be well vnlesse the chiefest do commaund and direct the rest.<note place="margin">Arist.

This is therefore the first lawe, whereby the highest power of the minde requireth generall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the hands of all the rest concurring with it vnto action. Touching the seuerall graund mandates, which being imposed by the vnderstanding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the minde, must be obeyed by the will of man, they are by the same method found out, whether they import our dutie towardes God or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man. Touching the one, I may not here stand to open, by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of discourse the mindes euen of meere naturall men, haue attained to knowe, not onely that there is a God, but also what power, force, wisedome, and other properties that God hath, and how all thinges depend on him.

For seeing those things which are equall, must needes all haue one measure: if I cannot but wish to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue al good, euen as much at euery mans hand as any man can wish vnto his owne soule; how should I looke to haue any part of my desire herein satisfied, vnlesse my self be careful to satisfie the like desire, which is vndoubtedly in other men, we all being of one and the same nature? To haue any thing offered them repugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieue them as much as me: so that if I do harme, I must looke to suffer; there being no reason that others should shew greater measure of loue to me, then they haue by me shewed vnto them. My desire therefore to be loued of my equals in nature as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible may be, imposeth vpon me a naturall dutie of bearing to them-ward fully the like affection.

Lawes of reason haue these markes to be knowne by.

If then it be here demaunded, by what meanes it should come to passe (the greatest part of the law morall being so easie for all men to know) that so many thousands of men notwithstanding haue bene ignorant euen of principall morall duties, not imagining the breach of them to be sinne: I deny not but lewd and wicked custome; beginning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the first amongst few, afterwards spreading into greater multitudes, and so continuing from time to time, may be of force euen in plaine things to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the light of naturall vnderstanding, because men will not bend their wits to examine, whether things wherewith they haue bene accustomed, be good or euill.

Howbeit not this the only kind of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath bene receiued in the world. The inconueniences of one kinde haue caused sundry other to be deuised. So that in a word all publike regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of what kind soeuer, seemeth euidently to haue risen from deliberate aduice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, &amp; compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene men, iudging it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient &amp; behoueful; there being no impossibilitie in nature considered by it self, but that men might haue liued without any publike regiment.

In lawes that which is naturall bindeth vniuersally, that which is posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue not so.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as by vow vnto God, contract with men, or such like; somewhat it will make vnto our purpose a little more fully to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, what things are incident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the making of the positiue lawes for the gouernment of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liue vnited in publique societie. Lawes do not onely teach what is good, but they inioyne it, they haue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straining force. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straine me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto any thing inconuenient doth seeme vnreasonable. Most requisite therefore it is, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise lawes which all men shal be forced to obey, none but wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be admitted. Lawes are matters of principall consequence; men of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon capacitie &amp; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are not able (for how should they?) to discerne what things are fittest for each kind and state of regiment. Wee cannot be ignorant how much our obedience vnto lawes dependeth vpon this point. Let a man though neuer so iustly, oppose himselfe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are disordered in their waies, &amp; what one amongst them commonly doth not stomacke at such contradiction, storme at reproofe, and hate such as would reforme them? Notwithstanding euen they which brooke it worst that men should tell them of their duties, when they are told the same by a lawe, thinke very wel &amp; reasonably of it. For why? They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that the lawe doth speake with all indifferencie, that the lawe hath no side respect to their persons, that the law is as it were an oracle proceeded from wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderstanding. Howbeit laws do not take their constraining force fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the qualitie of such as deuise them, but from that power which doth giue them the strength of lawes. That which we spake before concerning the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, must here be applyed vnto the power of making lawes wherby to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne; which power God hath ouer all; and by the naturall lawe whereunto hee hath made all subiect, the lawfull power of making lawes to commaund whole politique societies of men, belongeth so properly vnto the same intire societies, that for any Prince or potentate of what kinde soeuer vpon earth to exercise the same of himselfe, and not either by expresse commission immediatly and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally receiued from God, or else by authoritie deriued at the first fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vpon whose persons they impose lawes, it is no better then meere tyrannie. Lawes they are not therefore which publique approbation hath not made so. But approbation not only they giue who personally declare their assent by voice
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19711:40"/>
sign or act, but also whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others do it in their names by right originally at the least deriued from them. As in parliaments, councels, &amp; the like assemblies, although we be not personally our selues present, notwithstanding our assent is by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others agents there in our behalfe. And what we do by others, no reason but that it should stand as our deede, no lesse effectually to binde vs then if our selues had done it in person. In many things assent is giuen, they that giue it not imagining they do so, because the manner of their assenting is not apparent. As for example, when an absolute Monark commandeth his subiects that which seemeth good in his owne discretion, hath not his edict the force of a law, whether they approue or dislike it? Againe that which hath bene receiued long sithence and is by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome now established, we keep as a law which we may not transgresse; yet what consent was euer thereunto sought or required at our hands? Of this point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to note, that sith men naturally haue no ful &amp; perfect power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund whole politique mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itudes of men; therefore vtterly without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent we could in such sort be at no mans commandement liuing. And to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded we do consent, when that societie wherof we are part, hath at any time before consented, without reuoking the same after by the like vniuersall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherfore as any mans deed past is good as long as himself continueth: so the act of a publique societie of men done fiue hundred yeares sithence, standeth as theirs, who presently are of the same societies, because corporations are immortall: we were then aliue in our predecessors, and they in their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors do liue stil. Lawes therefore humaine of what kinde soeuer are auaileable by consent. If here it be demaunded how it commeth to passe, that this being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto all lawes which are made, there should be found euen in good lawes so great varietie as there is: wee must note the reason hereof to bee, the sundry particular endes, whereunto the different disposition of that subiect or matter for which lawes are prouided, causeth them to haue especiall respect in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes.<note place="margin">Arist. polit. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These things are linked and as it were chained one to another, we labour to eate, and we eate to liue, and we liue to do good, &amp; the good which we do is as seede sowne <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 6.8.

For if euery thing were to bee desired for some other without any stint, there could be no certaine end proposed vnto our actions, we should go on we know not whether, yea whatsoeuer we do were in vaine, or rather nothing at all were possible to be done.

thing there must be desired for it selfe simply and for no other. That is simply for it selfe desirable, vnto the nature wherof it is opposite &amp; repugnant to be desired with relation vnto any other. The oxe and the asse desire their food, neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they vnto themselues any end wherfore; so that of them this is desired for it selfe; but why? By reason of their imperfection which cannot otherwise desire it: whereas that which is desired simply for it selfe, the excellencie thereof is such as permitteth it not in any sort to be referred to a further end. Now that which man doth desire with reference to a further end, the same he desireth in such measure as is vnto that end conuenient: but what he coueteth as good in it selfe, towardes that his desire is euer infinite. So that vnlesse the last good of all which is desired altogether for it selfe, be also infinite; we doe euill in making it our end: euen as they who placed their felicitie in wealth or honour or pleasure or any thing here attained; because in desiring any thing as our finall perfection which is not so, we do amisse. Nothing may be infinitly desired, but that good which in deed is infinite. For the better, the more desirable; that therefore most desirable,<note place="margin">Vide Arist Eth 10. cap. 10. &amp; Metaph. 12. ca 6. &amp; cap. 4. &amp; cap. 30.</note> wherin there is infinitie of goodnes; so that if any thing desirable may be infinit, that must needes be the highest of all things that are desired. No good is infinite but onely God: therefore he our felicitie and blisse. Moreouer desire tendeth vnto vnion with that it desireth. If then in him we be blessed, it is by force of participation &amp; coniunction with him. Againe, it is not the possession of any good thing can make them happie which haue it, vnlesse they inioy the thing wherewith they are possessed. Then are we happie therfore, when fully we enioy God, as an obiect wherein the powers of our soules are satisfied euen with euerlasting delight: so that although we be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet by being vnto God vnited, we liue as it were the life of God.

Our naturall meanes therefore vnto blessednesse are our workes: nor is it possible that nature should euer find any other way to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then onely this. But examine the workes which we do, and since the first foundation of the world what one can say, My wayes are pure? Seeing then all flesh is guilty of that for which God hath threatned eternally to punish, what possibility is there this way to be saued? There resteth therefore either no way vnto saluation, or if any, then surely a way which is supernaturall, a way which could neuer haue entred into the heart of man as much as once to conceiue or imagine, if God himself had not reuealed it extraordinarily. For which cause we terme it the mystery or secret way of saluation. And therfore S. Ambrose in this matter appealeth iustly from man to God, <note n="b" place="margin">Ambros. contra Sym.</note>

               <hi>When men of excellent wit</hi> (saith Lactantius) <hi>had wholly betaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto study, after farewell bidden vnto all kind as well of priuate as publique action, they spared no labour that might be spent in the search of truth; holding it a thing of much more price to seeke and to find out the reason of all affaires as well diuine as humaine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to stick fast in the toile of piling vp riches and gathering together heapes of honors. Howbeit they bothe did faile of their purpose, and got not as much as to quite their charges; because truth which is the secret of the most high God, whose proper handiworke all things are, cannot be compassed with that wit and those senses which are our owne. For God and man should be very neere neighbors, if mans cogitations were able to take a suracy of the counsels and appointments of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie euerlasting. Which being vtterly impossible, that the eye of man by it selfe should looke into the bosome of diuine reason; God did not suffer him being desirous of the light of wisedome, to stray any longer vp &amp; downe, and with bootlesse expense of trauaile to wander in darknesse that had no passage to get out by. His eyes at the length God did open; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon him the knowledge of the truth by way of Donatiue; to the end that man might both be clearly conuicted of folly, and being through error out of the way, haue the path that leadeth vnto immortality layd plaine before him.</hi> Thus far <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> to shew that God himselfe is the teacher of the truth, wherby is made knowne the supernaturall way of saluation &amp; law for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue in that shall be saued.

But be it that God of his great liberality had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in lieu of mans endeuors to bestow the same, by the rule of that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which best beseemeth him, namely the iustice of one that requiteth no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing mincingly, but all with pressed and heaped and euen ouer-inlarged mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: yet could it neuer hereupon necessarily bee gathered, that such iustice should adde to the nature of that reward the property of euerlasting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; sith possession of blisse, though it should be but for a moment, were an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant retribution. But we are not now to enter into this consideration, how gratious and bountifull our good God might still appeare in so rewarding the sonnes of men, albeit they should exactly performe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoeuer duty their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto. Howsoeuer God did propose this reward, we that were to be rewarded must haue done that which is required at our hands; we failing in the one, it were in nature an impossibility that the other should be looked for. The light of nature is neuer able to find out any way of obtaining the reward of blisse, but by performing exactly the duties and works of righteousnes. From saluation therefore and life all flesh being excluded this way, behold how the wisedome of God hath reuealed a way mysticall and supernaturall, a way dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vnto the same end of life by a course which groundeth it selfe vpon the guiltinesse of sinne, and through sinne desert of condemnation and death. For in this way the first thing is the tender compassion of God respecting vs drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and swallowed vp in miserie; the next is redemption out of the same by the pretious death and merite of a mighty Sauiour, which hath witnessed of himselfe saying <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn. 14.6.</note> 
               <hi>I am the way,</hi> the way that leadeth vs from miserie into blisse. This supernaturall way had God in himselfe prepared before all worlds. The way of supernaturall dutie which to vs he hath prescribed, our Sauiour in the Gospell of Saint Iohn doth note, terming it by an excellency the worke of God: <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 6.29.</note> 
               <hi>This is the worke of God that ye beleeue in him whom he hath sent.</hi> Not that God doth require nothing vnto happinesse at the hands of men sauing onely a naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, (for hope and Charity we may not exclude:) but that without beliefe all other things are as nothing, &amp; it the ground of those other diuine vertues. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith, the principall obiect whereof is that eternall veritie which hath discouered the treasures of hidden wisedome in Christ; concerning hope, the highest obiect wherof is that euerlasting goodnesse which in Christ doth quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the dead; concerning charity, the finall obiect whereof is that incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the sonne of the liuing God; concerning these vertues, the first of which beginning here with a weake apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things not seene, endeth with the intuitiue vision of God in the world to come; the second beginning here with a trembling expectation of things far remoued, and as yet but onely heard of, endeth with reall and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fruition of that which no tongue can expresse; the third beginning here with a weake inclination of heart towards him vnto whom we are not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, endeth with endlesse vnion, the mistery wherof is higher then the reach of the thoughts of men; concerning that faith hope &amp; charity without which

There is not in the world a syllable muttered with certaine truth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning any of these three, more then hath bene supernaturally receiued from the mouth of the eternall God. Lawes therefore concerning these things are supernaturall, both in respect of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deliuering them which is diuine, and also in regard of the things deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which are such as haue not in nature any cause from which they flow, but were by the voluntary appointment of God ordeined besides the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to rectifie natures obliquity withall.</p>

They are, sayth Saint Augustine, but a few and they indued with great ripenes of wit and iudgement, free from all such affaires as might trouble their meditations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the sharpest and the subtlest points of learning, who haue, and that very hardly, bene able to find out but onely the immortality of the soule. The resurrection of the flesh what man did euer at any time dreame of, hauing not heard it otherwise then from the schoole of nature? Whereby it appeareth how much we are bound to yeeld vnto our creator the father of all mercy eternall thankes, for that he hath deliuered his law vnto the world, a law wherein so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are laid open cleere and manifest; as a light which otherwise would haue bene buried in darknesse, not without the hazard, or rather not with the hazard, but with the certaine losse of infinite thousands of soules most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly now saued. We see therefore that our soueraigne good is desired natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; that God the author of that naturall desire had appointed naturall meanes whereby to fulfill it; that man hauing vtterly disabled his nature vnto those meanes, hath had other reuealed from God, and hath receaued from heauen a law to teach him how that which is desired naturally must now supernaturally be attained, finally we see that because those later exclude not the former quite and cleane as vnnecessary, therefore together with such supernaturall duties as could not possibly haue beene otherwise knowne to the world, the same lawe that teacheth them, teacheth also with them such naturall duties as could not by light of nature easily haue bene knowne.</p>

Whereunto wee may aunswere with truth, that there is not in the world any Arte or Science, which proposing vnto it selfe an ende (as euery one doth some ende or other) hath bene therefore thought defectiue, if it haue not deliuered simply what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is needfull to the same ende: but all kinds of knowledge haue their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bounds and limits; each of them presupposeth many necessary things learned in other sciences and knowne before hand. He that should take vpon him to teach men how to be eloquent in pleading causes, must needes deliuer vnto them whatsoeuer precepts are requisite vnto that end, otherwise he doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the thing which he taketh vpon him. Seeing then no man can pleade elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, vnlesse he be able first to speake, it followeth that habilitie of speech is in this case a thing most necessary. Notwithstanding euery man would thinke it ridiculous, that he which vndertaketh by writing to instruct an Orator, should therfore deliuer all the precepts of Grammar; because his profession is to deliuer precepts necessarie vnto eloquent speech, yet so, that they which are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them bee taugt before hand, so much of that which is thereunto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie as comprehendeth the skill of speaking. In like sort, albeit Scripture do professe to conteine in it all thinges which are necessarie vnto saluation; yet the meaning cannot bee simply of all things which are necessarie, but all things that are necessary in some certaine kind or forme; as all things that are necessarie, and either could not at all, or could not easilie be knowne by the light of naturall discourse; all things which are necessarie to be knowne that we may be saued, but knowne with presupposall of knowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning certaine principles, wherof it receaueth vs already perswaded, and then instructeth vs in all the residue that are necessary. In the number of these principles one is the sacred authority of Scripture. Being therefore perswaded by other meanes that these Scriptures are the oracles of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themselues do then teach vs the rest, and lay before vs all the duties which God requireth at our hands as necessary vnto saluation. Further, there hath bene some doubt likewise, whether <hi>conteining in scripture</hi> do import expresse setting downe in plaine tearmes, or else <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in such sort that by reason we may fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence conclude all things which are necessary. Against the former of these two constructions, instance hath sundrie wayes bene geuen. For our beliefe in the Trinity, the Coeternity of the Sonne
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19711:46"/>
of God with his Father, the proceeding of the Spirite from the Father and the Sonne, the duty of baptizing infants, these with such other principall points, the necessity wherof is by none denied, are notwithstanding in Scripture no where to be found by expresse literall mention, only deduced they are out of scripture by collection. This kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehension in scripture being therefore receiued, still there is no doubt how far we are to proceed by collection, before the full and complete measure of things necessary be made vp. For let vs not thinke that as long as the world doth endure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wit of man shalbe able to found the bottome of that which may be concluded out of the scripture; especially if things contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by collection do so far extend, as to draw in whatsoeuer may be at any time out of scripture but probably and coniecturally surmised. But let necessary col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection be made requisite, and we may boldly deny, that of all those things which at this day are with so great necessitie vrged vpon this Church vnder the name of reformed Church discipline, there is any one which their bookes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto haue made manifest to be conteined in the Scripture. Let them if they can alleage but one properly belonging to their cause, and not common to them and vs, and shew the deduction thereof out of scripture to be necessarie. It hath beene already shewed, how all things necessarie vnto saluation in such sort as before we haue maintained, must needes be possible for men to knowe; and that many things are in such sort necessarie, the knowledge whereof is by the light of nature impossible to be attained. Whereupon it followeth, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all flesh is excluded from possibility of saluation, which to thinke were most barbarous; or else that God hath by supernaturall meanes reuealed the way of life so far forth as doth suffice. For this cause God hath so many times and waies spoken to the sonnes of men. Neither hath he by speech only, but by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also instructed and taught his Church. The cause of writing hath bene to the end that things by him reuealed vnto the world, might haue the longer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and the greater certainty of assurance; by how much that which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on record, hath in both those respects preeminence aboue that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from hand to hand, and hath no pennes but the toongs, no bookes but the eares of men to record it. The seueral bookes of scripture hauing had each some seuerall occasion and particular purpose which caused them to be written, the contents thereof are according to the exigence of that speciall end whereunto they are intended. Hereupon it groweth, that euery booke of holy scripture doth take out of all kinds of truth, <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note> naturall, <note n="b" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.8.</note> historicall, <note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 1.12.</note> forreine, <note n="d" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.4.</note> supernaturall, so much as the matter handled requireth. Now for as much as there hath bene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alleaged sufficient to conclude, that all things necessary vnto saluation must be made knowne, and that God himselfe hath therefore reuealed his will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise men could not haue knowne so much as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as his words concerning the bookes of auncient Scripture, do not take place but with presupposall of the Gospell of Christ embraced: so our owne wordes also when wee extoll the complete sufficiency of the whole intire body of the Scripture, must in like sorte bee vnderstood with this caution, that the benefite of natures light be not thought excluded as vnnecessarie, because the necessitie of a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner light is magnified. There is in Scripture therefore no defect, but that any man what place or calling soeuer he hold in the Church of God, may haue thereby the light of his naturall vnderstanding so perfected, that the one being relieued by the other, there can want no part of needfull instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto any good worke which God himselfe requireth, be it naturall or supernaturall, belonging simply vnto men as men, or vnto men as they are vnited in whatsoeuer kinde of societie. It sufficeth therefore that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Scripture do serue in such full sort, that they both ioyntly, and not seuerally either of them, be so complete, that vnto euerlasting felicitie we need not the knowledge of any thing more then these two may easily furnish our mindes with on all sides: and therefore they which adde tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as a part of supernaturall necessarie truth, haue not the truth, but are in errour. For they onely pleade, that whatsoeuer God reuealeth as necessary for all Christian men to do or beleeue, the same we ought to embrace, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue receiued it by writing or otherwise; which no man deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: when that which they should confirme who claime so great reuerence vnto traditions is, that the same traditions are necessarily to bee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged diuine and holy.

Impossible it is but that they should fall into a number of grosse errors, who onely take such lawes for positiue, as haue bene made or inuented of men, and holding this position hold also, that all posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and none but positiue lawes are mutable.

The Church being a supernaturall societie, doth differ from naturall societies in this; that the persons vnto whom wee asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate our selues, in the one are men simply considered as men; but they to whom we bee ioyned in the other, are God, Angels, and holy men. Againe the Church being both a society, and a society supernaturall; although as it is a society, it haue the selfe same originall grounds which other politique societes haue, namely the naturall inclination which all men haue vnto so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable life, and consent to some certaine bond of association, which bond is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19711:48"/>
the law that appointeth what kind of order they shall be associated in: yet vnto the Church as it is a societie supernaturall this is peculiar, that part of the bond of their association which belong to the Church of God, must be a lawe supernaturall, which God himselfe hath reuealed concerning that kind of worship which his people shall do vnto him. The substance of the seruice of God therefore, so farre forth as it hath in it any thing more then the lawe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doth teach, may not be inuented of men, as it is amongst the Heathens; but must be receiued from God himselfe, as alwaies it hath bene in the Church, sauing only when the Church hath bene forgetfull of her dutie.

The reason is, because the subiect or matter of lawes in generall is thus farre foorth constant: which matter is that for the ordering whereof lawes were instituted, and being instituted are not chaungeable without cause, neither can they haue cause of chaunge, when that which gaue them their first institution, remaineth for euer one and the same.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19711:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we professe all submission and awe? Surely there must be very manifest iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in lawes, against which we shall be able to iustifie our contumelious inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. The chiefest roote whereof, when we vse them without cause, is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance how lawes inferiour are deriued from that supreme or highest lawe. The first that receiue impression from thence are naturall agents. The lawe of whose operations might be happily thought lesse pertinent, when the question is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout lawes for humane actions, but that in those very actions which most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and supernaturally concerne men, the rules and axiomes of naturall operations haue their force. What can be more immediate to our saluation, then our perswasion concerning the lawe of Christ towardes his Church? What greater assurance of loue towards his Church, then the knowledge of that mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vnion whereby the Church is become as neare vnto Christ, as any one part of his flesh is vnto other? That the Church being in such sort his, he must needes protect it; what proofe more strong, then if a manifest lawe so require, which law it is not possible for Christ to violate? And what other lawe doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for this alleage, but such as is both common vnto Christ with vs, and vnto vs with other things naturall, <hi>No man hateth his owne flesh, but doth loue and cherish it?</hi> The axiomes of that lawe therefore, whereby naturall agentes are guided,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note> haue their vse in the morall, yea euen in the spirituall actions of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in all lawes belonging vnto men howsoeuer. Neither are the Angels themselues, so farre seuered from vs in their kind and manner of working, but that betweene the lawe of their heauenly operations, and the actions of men in this our state of mortalitie, such correspondence there is, as maketh it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to know in some sort the one, for the others more perfect direction.<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.10.</note> Would Angels acknowledge themselues fellow seruants with the sonnes of men, but that both hauing one Lord, there must be some kinde of lawe which is one and the same to both, whereunto their obedience being perfecter, is to our weaker both a paterne and a spurre?<note place="margin">1.

Yea so farre hath the Apostle S. Paule proceeded,<note place="margin">1.

Our largenesse of speech how men do finde out what thinges reason bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them of necessitie to obserue, and what is guideth them to choose in things which are left as arbitrary; the care we haue had to declare the different nature of lawes which seuerally concerne all men, from such as belong vnto men ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuilly or spiritually associated, such as pertaine to the fellowship which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or which Christian nations haue amongst themselues, and in the last place such as concerning euery or any of these, God himselfe hath reuealed by his holy wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, all serueth but to make manifest, that as the actions of men are of sundry distinct kindes, so the lawes thereof must accordingly be distinguished. There are in men operations some naturall, some rationall, some supernaturall,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19711:50"/>
some politique, some finally Ecclesiasticall. Which if we measure not each by his owne proper law, whereas the things themselues are so different; there will be in our vnderstanding and iudgement of them confusion. As that first error sheweth whereon our opposites in this cause haue grounded themselues. For as they rightly maintaine, that God must be glorified in all thinges, and that the actions of men cannot tend vnto his glory, vnlesse they be framed after his law: So it is their error, to thinke that the only law which God hath appointed vnto men in that behalfe is the sacred Scripture. By that which we worke naturally, as when we breath,<note place="margin">Ps. 148.7, 8, 9.</note> sleepe, mooue, we set forth the glory of God as naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents doe, albeit we haue no expresse purpose to make that our end, nor any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised determination therein to follow a law, but doe that we doe (for the most part) not as much as thinking thereon. In reasonable and morall actions ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law taketh place,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> a law by the obseruation whereof we glorifie God in such sort, as no creature else vnder man is able to doe; because other creatures haue not iudgement to examine the qualitie of that which is done by them, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that they doe, they neither can accuse nor approue themselues. Men doe bothe,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> as the Apostle teacheth; yea those men which haue no written lawe of God to shewe what is good or euill, carrie written in their hearts the vniuersall lawe of mankind, the law of reason, whereby they iudge as by a rule which God hath giuen vnto all men for that purpose. The lawe of reason doth somewhat direct men how to honour God as their Creator; but how to glorifie God in such sort as is required, to the end he may be an euerlasting Sauiour, this we are taught by diuine law, which law both ascertaineth the truth and supplieth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the want of that other lawe. So that in morall actions, diuine law helpeth exceedingly the lawe of reason to guide mans life; but in supernaturall it alone guideth. Proceed wee further, let vs place man in some publique societie with others, whether Ciuill or Spirituall: and in this case there is no remedie but we must adde yet a further lawe. For although euen here likewise the lawes of nature and reason be of necessary vse; yet somewhat ouer and besides them is necessary, namely humane and positiue lawe, together with that lawe which is of commerce betweene grand societies, the law of nations and of nations Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. For which cause the lawe of God hath likewise said, <hi>Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> The publique power of all societies is aboue euery soule contained in the same societies. And the principall vse of that power is to giue lawes vnto all that are vnder it; which lawes in such case we must obey, vnlesse there be reason shewed which may necessarily enforce, that the lawe or reason or of God doth enioyne the contrarie. Because except our owne priuate, and but probable resolutions, be by the lawe of publique determinations ouerruled; we take away all possibilitie of sociable life in the worlde. A plainer example whereof then our selues we cannot haue. How commeth it to passe that wee are at this present day so rent with mutuall contentions, and that the Church is so much troubled about the politie of the Church? No doubt if men had bene willing to learne how many lawes their actions in this life are subiect vnto, and what the true force of each lawe is, all these controuersies might haue dyed the very day they were first brought forth. It is both commonly said, and truly, that the best men otherwise are not alwayes the best in regard of societie. The
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19711:50"/>
reason wherof is, for that the law of mens actions is one, if they be respected on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as men; and another, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are considered as parts of a politique body.<note place="margin">

And yet in societie with others, none lesse fit to answere the duties which are looked for at their handes. Yea I am perswaded, that of them with whom in this cause we striue, there are whose betters among men would bee hardly found, if they did not liue amongst men, but in some wildernesse by themselues. The cause of which their disposition so vnframable vnto socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein they liue, is for that they discerne not aright: what place and force these seuerall kindes of lawes ought to haue in all their actions. Is there que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion eyther concerning the regiment of the Church in generall, or about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie betweene one Church and another, or of ceremonies, offices, powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> iurisdictions in our owne Church?

haue bene (as wee perswade our selues) iniuriously blamed, by them who endeuour to ouerthrow the same, and in stead therof to establish a much worse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely through a strong misconceipt they haue, that the same is grounded on diuine authoritie. Now whether it be that through an earnest longing desire to see things brought to a peaceable end, I do but imagine the matters whereof we contend, to be fewer then indeed they are; or else for that in truth they are fewer when they come to be discust by reason, then otherwise they seeme, when by heate of contention they are deuided into many slippes, and of euery branch an heape is made: surely as now wee haue drawne them together, choosing out those things which are requisite to bee seuerally all discust, and omitting such meane specialties as are likely (without any great labour) to fall afterwardes of themselues; I knowe no cause why either the number or the length of these controuersies should diminish our hope, of seeing them end with concord and loue on all sides; which of his infinite loue and goodnes the father of all peace and vnitie graunt. Vnto which scope that our endeuour may the more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend, it seemeth fittest that first those thinges be examined, which are as seedes from whence the rest that ensue haue growne. And of such the most generall is that, wherewith we are here to make our entrance; a question not mooued (I thinke) any where in other Churches, and therefore in ours the more likely to be soone (I trust) determined. The rather for that it hath grown from no other roote, then only a desire to enlarge the necessarie vse of the word of God; which desire hath begotten an error enlarging it further then (as we are perswaded) soundnesse of truth will beare.

Albeit therefore euery cause admit not such infallible eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of proofe, as leaueth no possibilitie of doubt or scruple behind it; yet they who claime the generall assent of the whole world vnto that which they teach, and doe not feare to giue very hard and heauie sentence vpon as many as refuse to embrace the same, must haue speciall regard that their first foundations and grounds be more then slender probabilities. This whole question which hath bene mooued about the kinde of Church regiment, we could not but for our owne resolutions sake, endeuour to vnrip and sift; following therein as neare as we might, the conduct of that iudiciall method which serueth best for inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth. By meanes whereof hauing found this the head theoreme of all their discourses, who pleade for the chaunge of Ecclesiasticall gouernment in England, namely, <hi>That the Scripture of God is in such sort the rule of humane actions, that simply whatsoeuer we doe, and are not by it directed thereunto, the same is sinne</hi>; wee hold it necessarie that the proofes hereof be waighed: be they of waight suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or otherwise it is not ours to iudge and determine: onely what difficulties there are, which as yet withhold our assent, till we be further and better satisfied, I hope no indifferent amongst them will scorne or refuse to heare. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas they alleage <hi>that wisedome</hi> doth teach men <hi>euery good way</hi>; and haue thereupon inferred, that no way is good in any kind of action, vnlesse wisedome do by scripture leade vnto it: see they not plainely how they restraine the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold wayes which wisedome hath to teach men by, vnto one only way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which is by scripture? The boundes of wisedome are large, and within them much is contayned. Wisdome was <hi>Adams</hi> instructor in Paradise: wisdome indued the fathers, who liued before the law, with the knowledge of holy things by the wisedome of the lawe of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> attained to excell others in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> likewise to excell <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.95.</note> by the selfe same wisdome of God teaching him many things besides the law. The waies of well-doing are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber euen as many, as are the kindes of voluntarie actions: so that whatsoeuer we do in this world and may do it ill, we shew our selues therein by well doing to be wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if wisedome did teach men by scripture not onely all the wayes that are right and good in some certaine kind, according to that of <note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 3 16. <hi>The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnes, that the man of God may be absolute being made perfect vnto all good works.</hi> He meaneth all and only those good workes, which belong vnto vs as we are men of God, and which vnto saluation are necessary. Or if we vnderstand by men of God, Gods Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is not required in them an vniuersall skill of euery good worke or way, but an habilitie to teach whatsoeuer men are bound to doe that they may be saued.

To teach men therefore wisedome professeth, and to teach them euery good way: but not euery good way by one way of teaching. Whatsoeuer either men on earth, or the Angels of heauen do know, it is as a drop of that vnemptiable fountaine of wisdom; which wisdom hath diuersly imparted her treasures vnto the world. As her waies are of sundry kindes, so her maner of teaching is not meerely one and the same.

               <note place="margin">The second proofe out of Scripture. 1. Cor. 10.31. T.C. l. 1. p. 16. <hi>S. Paul saith that whether we eat or drink or whatsoeuer we do, we must do it to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. But no man can glorifie God in any thing but by obedience; and there is no obedience but in respect of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and word of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is followeth that the word of God direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man in all his actions.</hi>
               </note>2 That <hi>all things be done to the glory of God,</hi> the blessed Apostle (it is true) exhorteth. The glory of God is the admirable excellencie of that vertue diuine, which being made manifest, causeth men and Angels to extoll his greatnes, and in regard thereof to feare him. By beeing glorified, it is not meant that he doth receiue any augmentation of glory at our hands; but his name we glorifie, when we testifie our acknowledgement of his glorie. Which albeit we most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do by the vertue of obedience: neuerthelesse it may be perhaps a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether S. Paule did meane that wee sinne as oft as euer wee goe about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, without an expresse intent and purpose to obey God therein. He saith of himselfe, <hi>I do in all things please all men, seeking not mine owne commoditie, but</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the good <hi>of many, that they may be saued.</hi> Shall it hereupon be thought, that S. Paule did not moue eyther hand or foote, but with expresse intent euen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to further the common saluation of men? We moue, we sleepe, wee take the cuppe at the hand of our friend, a number of thinges we oftentimes doe, onely to satisfie some naturall desire, without present expresse and actuall reference vnto any commaundement of God. Vnto his glory euen these thinges are done which we naturally performe, and not onely that which morally and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we doe. For by euery effect proceeding from the most concealed instincts of nature, his power is made manifest. But it doth not therefore follow, that of necessitie we shall sinne, vnlesse we expressely intend this in euery such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But be it a thing which requireth no more then onely our generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed willingnesse to please God in all things; or be it a matter wherein wee cannot so glorifie the name of God as we should, without an actuall intent to doe him in that particular some speciall obedience: yet for any thing there is in this sentence alleaged to the contrarie, God may be glorified by obedience, and obeyed by performance of his will, and his will be performed with an actuall intelligent desire to fulfill that lawe which maketh knowne what his will is, although no speciall clause or sentence of scripture bee in euery such action set before mens eyes to warrant it. For scripture is not the onely lawe whereby God hath opened his will touching all thinges that may be done; but there are other kindes of lawes which notifie the will of God, as in the former booke hath beene prooued at large: Nor is there any law of God, whereunto he doth not account our obedience his glory. <hi>Doe therefore all thinges vnto the glory of God</hi> (saith the Apostle), <hi>be inoffensiue both to the Iewes and Graecians, and the Church of God; euen as I please all men in all thinges, not seeking mine owne commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but manies that they may be saued.</hi> In the least thing done disobediently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, or offensiuely against the good of men, whose benefite wee ought to seeke for as for our owne, we plainely shew that we doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be such as indeede he is, and consequently that we glorifie him not. This the blessed Apostle teacheth: but doth any Apostle teach, that we cannot glorifie God otherwise, then onely in doing what wee finde that God in Scripture commaundeth vs to doe? The Churches dispersed amongest the

               <hi>Ergo in euery action not commaunded, there is sinne:</hi> I would demaund of them, first for as much as the nature of things indifferent is neither to be commaunded nor forbidden, but left free and arbitrarie; how there can be any thing indifferent, if for want of faith sinne be committed, when any thing not commaunded is done. So that of necessitie they must adde somewhat, and at leastwise thus set it downe: In euery action not commaunded of God, or permitted with approbation, faith is wanting, and for want of faith there is sinne. The next thing we are to enquire is, what those things be which God permitteth with approbation, and how we may know them to be so permitted. When there are vnto one ende sundrie meanes, as for example, for the sustenance of our bodies many kindes of foode, many sorts of rayment to cloathe our nakednesse, and so in other things of like condition: here the end it selfe being necessary, but not so any one meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; necessarie that our bodies should be both fed and cloathed, howbeit no one kinde of foode or rayment necessary; therefore we hold these things free in their owne nature and indifferent. The choice is left to our owne discretion, except a principall bond of some higher dutie remoue the indifferencie that such thinges haue in themselues. Their indifferencie is remoued, if eyther wee take away our owne libertie, as <hi>Anantas</hi> did,<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> for whome to haue solde or helde his possesions it was indifferent, till his solemne vow and promise vnto God had strictly bound him one onely way: or if God himselfe haue precisely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged the same, by restraining vs vnto, or by barring vs from, some one or moe things of many, which otherwise were in themselues altogether indifferent. Many fashions of Priestly attire there were, wherof <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes might haue had their free choice without sinne, but that God expressely tied them vnto one. All meates indifferent vnto the Iewe,<note place="margin">Exod 28.4.43. Leuit. 11.</note> were it not that God by name excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some, as swines flesh. Impossible therefore it is we should otherwise thinke, then that what thinges God doth neither commaund nor forbid, the same he permitteth with approbation either to be done or left vndone. <hi>All thinges are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto mee,</hi> saith the Apostle, speaking as it seemeth, in the person of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gentile for maintenance of libertie in thinges indifferent:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.12.</note> whereunto his answere is, that neuerthelesse <hi>All thinges are not expedient</hi>; in thinges indifferent there is a choice, they are not alwayes equally expedient. Now in thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not commaunded of God, yet lawfull because they are permitted, the question is, what light shall shewe vs the conueniencie which one hath aboue another. For answere, their finall determination is, that <hi>whereas the Heathen did send men for the difference of good &amp; euill to the light of reason, in such things the Apostle sendeth vs to the schoole of Christ in his word, which onely is able through faith to giue vs
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19711:55"/>
assurance and resolution in our doings.</hi> Which word <hi>Only,</hi> is vtterly without possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of euer being proued. For what if it were true concerning things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that vnlesse the word of the Lord had determined of the free vse of them, there could haue bene no lawfull vse of them at all; which notwithstanding is vntrue, because it is not the Scriptures setting downe such thinges as indifferent, but their not setting downe as necessarie that doth make them to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: yet this to our present purpose serueth nothing at all. Wee inquire not now whether any thing be free to be vsed, which scripture hath not set downe as free: but concerning things knowne and acknowledged to be indifferent, whether particularly in choosing any one of them before another we sinne, if any thing but scripture direct vs in this our choice. When many meates are set before me, all are indifferent, none vnlawfull; I take one as most conuenient. If scripture require me so to do, then is not the thing indifferent, because I must do what scripture requireth. They are all indifferent, I might take any, scripture doth not require of me to make any speciall choice of one: I doe notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding make choice of one, my discretion teaching me so to doe. A hard case, that hereupon I should be iustly condemned of sinne. Nor let any man thinke, that following the iudgement of naturall discretion in such cases, we can haue no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that we please God. For to the author and God of our nature, how shall any operation proceeding in naturall sort bee in that respect vnacceptable? The nature which himselfe hath giuen to worke by, he cannot but be delighted with, when wee exercise the same any way with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut commaundement of his to the contrarie. My desire is to make this cause so manifest, that if it were possible, no doubt or scruple concerning the same might remaine in any mans cogitation. Some truthes there are, the veritie whereof time doth alter: as it is now true that Christ is risen from the dead; which thing was not true at such time as Christ was liuing on earth, and had not suffered. It would be knowne therefore, whether this which they teach concerning the sinfull staine of all actions not commanded of God, be a truth that doth now appertaine vnto vs only, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall truth, in such sort that from the first beginning of the world vnto the last consummation thereof, it neither hath bene, nor can be otherwise. I see not how they can restraine this vnto any particular time, how they can thinke it true now and not alwaies true, that in euery action not commanded there is for want of faith sinne. Then let them cast backe their eyes vnto former generations of men, and marke what was done in the prime of the world. <hi>Seth, Enoch, Noah, Sem, Abraham, Iob,</hi> and the rest that liued before any syllable of the lawe of God was written, did they not sinne as much as we doe in euery action not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? That which God is vnto vs by his sacred word, the same he was vnto them by such like meanes as <hi>Eliphas</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi> describeth.<note place="margin">Iob. 4.19.</note> If therefore we sinne in euery action which the scripture commaundeth vs not, it followeth that they did the like in all such actions as were not by reuelation from heauen exacted at their hands. Vnlesse God from heauen did by vision still shew them what to doe, they might do nothing, not eate, not drinke, not sleepe, not moue. Yea but euen as in darkenes candle light may serue to guide mens steps, which to vse in the day were madnes; so when God had once deliuered his lawe in writing, it may bee they are of opinion, that then it must needes bee sinne for men to doe any thing,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19711:55"/>
which was not there commaunded them to do, whatsoeuer they might do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Let this be graunted, and it shall here upon plainely ensue, either that the light of Scripture once shining in the world, all other light of nature is ther with in such sort drowned, that now we need it not, neither may we longer vse it;<note place="margin">Arist. Pol. 1.</note> or if it stand vs in any stead, yet as <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaketh of men whom nature hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the state of seruitude, saying <hi>They haue reason so farre forth as to conceiue when others direct them,</hi> but litle or none in directing themselues by themselues, so likewise our naturall capacity and iudgement must serue vs only for the right vnderstanding of that which the sacred Scripture teacheth. Had the Prophets who succeeded <hi>Moses,</hi> or the blessed Apostles which followed them, bene setled in this perswasion, neuer would they haue taken so great paines in gathering together naturall arguments, thereby to teach the faithfull their duties.

For if it stand with reason thus to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Such a thing is not taught vs in Scripture, therefore we may not receiue or allow it; how should it seeme vnreasonable to thinke, that whatsoeuer we may lawfully do, the Scripture by commanding it must make it lawful. But how far such arguments do reach, it shall the better appeare by considering the matter wherein they haue bene vrged. First therefore this we constantly deny, that of so many testimonies as they are able to produce for the strength of negatiue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, any one doth generally (which is the point in question) condemne either all opinions as false, or all actions as vnlawfull, which the scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs not. The most that can be collected out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is onely, that in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a negatiue argument taken from scripture is strong; whereof no man indued with iudgement can doubt. But doth the strength of some negatiue argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to tye the one then the other vnto scripture, bothe being thereunto equally tyed, as far as each is required in the same kind of necessitie vnto saluation. If therefore it be not vnlawful to know, and with full perswasion to belieue, much more then scripture alone doth teach; if it be against all sense and reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the knowledge of so many arts and sciences as are otherwise learned then in holy scripture, notwithstanding the manifest speeches of auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike fathers, which seeme to close vp within the bosome thereof all manner good and lawfull knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore should their words be thought more effectuall, to shew that we may not in deedes and practise, then they are to proue that in speculation and knowledge, we ought not to go any farther then the scripture?

Might they not hereby euen as well proue, that one commandement of Scripture is the onely rule of all things, and so exclude the rest of the Scripture, as now they do all meanes besides Scripture? But thus it fareth when too much desire of contradiction causeth our speech rather to passe by number, then to stay for waight. Well, but <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth in this case speake yet more plainely:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Monog. T. C. l. 2. p. 81.</hi> And in another place <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> sayth, that the scripture denieth that which it noteth not.</note> 
               <hi>The scripture</hi>

For in as much as the scripture did propose to recken vp all, if there were moe it would haue named them. In this case <hi>the scripture doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the thing it noteth not.</hi> Howbeit I could not but thinke that man to do me some peece of manifest iniury, which would hereby fasten vpon me a generall opinion, as if I did thinke the scripture to deny the very raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, because it no where noteth that any such King did raigne. <hi>Tertullians</hi> speech is probable concerning such matter as he there speaketh of. There was, saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> no second <hi>Lamech</hi> like to him that had two wiues; the scripture denieth what it noteth not. As therefore it noteth one such to haue bene in that age of the world; so had there beene moe, it would by likelihood as well haue noted many as one. What infer we now hereupon? <hi>There was no second Lamech; the scripture denieth what it noteth not.</hi> Were it consonant vnto reason to diuorce these two sentences, the former of which doth shew how the later is restrained; and not marking the former, to conclude by the later of them, that simply what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any man at this day doth thinke true, is by the scripture denied, vnlesse it be there affirmed to be true? I wonder that a cause so weake and feeble hath bene so much persisted in.

Whereby appeareth, that the argument of the scriptures negatiuely holdeth, not onely in the doctrine and ecclesiasticall discipline, but euen in matters arbitrary and variable by the aduise of the Church. Where it is not inough that they be not forbidden, vnlesse there be some word which doth permit the vse of them: it is not enough that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh not against them, vnlesse it speake for them: and finally where it displeaseth the Lord which pleaseth him not, we must of necessitie haue the word of his mouth to declare his pleasure.</note> wearing garlands vpon their heads.

Which exulceration of mind made him apt to take all occasions of contradiction. Wherefore in honour of that action, and to gall their minds who did not so much commend it, he wrote his booke <hi>De corona militis,</hi> not dissembling the stomacke wherewith he wrote it. For first the man he commendeth as one more constant then the rest of his brethren, <hi>Who presumed,</hi> sayth he, <hi>that they might well enough serue two Lords.</hi>

They mutter that their good and long peace is now in hazard. I doubt not but some of them send the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before, trusse vp bagge and baggage, make themselues in a readinesse, that they may flye from Citie to Citie. For that is the only point of the Gospell which they are carefull not to forget. I knowe euen their Pastors very well what men they are, in peace Lions, Harts in time of trouble and feare.</hi> Now these men, saith <hi>Tertullian, They must be aunswered where we do find it written in Scripture</hi> that a Christian man may not weare a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And as mens speeches vttered in heate of distempered affection, haue often times much more egernes then waight; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o he that shall marke the proofes alleaged, and the answers to things obiected in the booke, will now and then perhaps espie the like imbecillity. Such is that argument whereby they that wore on their heads garlands, are charged as transgressors of natures lawe, and guilty of sacrilege against God the Lord of nature, in as much as flowers in such sort worne, can neither be smelt nor seene well by those that weare them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God made flowers sweet and beautifull, that being seene and smelt vnto, they might so delight. Neither doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> bewray this weaknes in striking only, but also in repelling their strokes with whom he contendeth. They aske sayth he, <hi>What scripture is there which doth teach that we should not be crowned? And what scripture is there which doth teach that we should? For in requiring on the contrary part the aide of scripture, they do giue sentence before hand that their part ought also by scripture to be aided.</hi> Which answer is of no great force. There is no necessitie, that if I confesse I ought not to do that which the scripture forbiddeth me, I should thereby acknowledge my selfe bound to do nothing which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commandeth me not. For many inducements besides Scripture may leade me to that, which if scripture be against, they all giue place, and are of no value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet otherwise are strong and effectuall to perswade. VVhich thing himselfe well enough vnderstanding, and being not ignorant that Scripture in many things doth neither commaund nor forbid, but vse silence; his resolution in fine is; that in the Church a number of things are strictly obserued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof no law of scripture maketh mention one way or other; that of things once receiued and confirmed by vse, long vsage is a law sufficient; that in ciuill affaires when there is no other law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> custome it selfe doth stand for lawe; that in as much as law doth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19711:58"/>
stand vpon reason, to alleage reason serueth as well as to cite scripture; that whatsoeuer is reasonable, the same is lawfull whosoeuer is author of it; that the authoritie of Custome is great; finally that the custome of Christians was then and had bene a long time not to weare garlands, and therefore that vndoubtedly they did offend, who presumed to violate such a custome by not obseruing that thing, the very inueterate obseruation whereof was a law sufficient to bind all men to obserue it, vnlesse they could shew some higher law, some law of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. This presupposed, it may stand then very well with strength and soundnesse of reason, euen thus to answer; <hi>Whereas they aske what scripture forbiddeth them to weare a garland, we are in this case rather to demaund what scripture commandeth them. They cannot here alleage that it is permitted which is not forbidden them: no, that is forbidden them which is not permitted.</hi> For long receiued Custome forbidding them to do as they did (if so be it did forbid them) there was no excuse in the world to iustifie their act, vnlesse in the scripture they could shewe some lawe, that did licence them thus to breake a receiued custome. Now whereas in all the bookes of <hi>Tertullian</hi> besides, there is not so much found as in that one, to proue not onely that we may do, but that we ought to do sundry things which the Scripture commaundeth not; out of that verie booke these sentences are brought to make vs belieue that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was of a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minde. We cannot therefore hereupon yeeld, we cannot graunt, that hereby is made manifest the argument of Scripture negatiuely to be of force, not only in doctrine and ecclesiasticall discipline, but euen in matters arbitrary. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth plainely hold euen in that booke, that neither the matter which he intreateth of was arbitrary but necessarie, in as much as the receaued custome of the Church did tye and bind them not to weare garlands as the Heathens did; yea and further also he reckoneth vp particularly a number of things, whereof he expresly concludeth; <hi>Harum &amp; aliarum eiusmodi disciplinarum si legem expostules scripturarum, nullam inuenies</hi>; which is as much as if he had sayd in expresse words, Many things there are which concerne the discipline of the Church and the duties of men, which to abrogate and take away, the scriptures negatiuely vrged may not in any case perswade vs, but they must be obserued, yea although no scripture be found which requireth any such thing. <hi>Tertullian</hi> therefore vndoubtedly doth not in this booke shew himselfe to be of the same mind with them by whom his name is pretended.</p>

For when the Lord hath once himselfe precisely set downe a forme of executing that wherein we are to serue him, the fault appeareth greater to do that which we are not, then not to do that which we are commaunded.

No, it was that peoples singular priuiledge, a fauour which God vouchfafed them aboue the rest of the world, that in the affaires of their estate, which were not determinable one way or other by the scripture, himselfe gaue them extraordinarily direction and counsell as oft as they sought it at his hands. Thus God did first by speech vnto <hi>Moses</hi>; after by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> vnto Priests; lastly by dreames and visions vnto Prophets, from whom in such cases they were to receiue the aunswere of God.

Much lesse when the like are taken from the sacred authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if the matter it selfe do beare them. For in truth the question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an argument from scripture negatiuely may be good, but whether it be so generally good, that in all actions men may vrge it. The fathers I graunt do vse very generall and large tearmes, euen as <hi>Hiero</hi> the King did in speaking of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes, From henceforward whatsoeuer Archimedes speaketh, it must be belieued.</hi> His meaning was not that <hi>Archimedes</hi> could simply in nothing be deceiued, but that he had in such sort approued his skill, that he seemed worthy of credit for euer after in matters appertaining vnto the science he was skilfull in. In speaking thus largely it is presumed, that mens speeches will be taken according to the matter whereof they speake. Let any man therefore that carieth indifferency of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, peruse the Bishops speeches, and consider well of those negatiues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning scripture, which he produceth out of <hi>Irenaeus, Chrysostome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leo</hi>; which three are chosen from amongst the residue, because the sentences of the others (euen as one of theirs also) do make for defence of negatiue arguments taken from humane authority,<note place="margin">Their opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from humane authority for the ordering of mens actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nor doth the Bishop either say or proue any more, then that an argument in some kinds of matter may be good, although taken negatiuely from Scripture.</p>

                  <hi>T. C. l. 1. p. 25.</hi> When the question is of the authority of a man, it holdeth neither affirmatiuely nor negatiuely. The reason is, because the infirmitie of man can neither attaine to the perfection of any thing whereby he might speake all things that are to be spoken of it; neither yet be free from error in those things which he speaketh or giueth out. And therefore this argument neither affirmatiuely nor nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely compelleth the hearer, but only induceth him to some liking or disliking of that for which it is brought, and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an Orator to perswade the simpler sort, then for a disputer to enforce him that is learned.</note>7 An earnest desire to draw all things vnto the determination of bare and naked Scripture, hath caused here much paines to be taken in abating the estimation and credite of man. Which if we labour to maintaine as farre as truth and reason will beare, let not any thinke that we trauaile about a matter not greatly needful. For the scope of all their pleading against mans authoritie is, to ouerthrowe such orders, lawes, and constitutions in the Church, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon if they should therefore be taken away, would peradueture leaue neither face nor memory of Church to continue long in the world, the world especially being such as now it is. That which they haue in this case spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I would for breuities sake let passe, but that the drift of their speech being so dangerous, their words are not to be neglected. Wherefore to say that simply an argument taken from mans authority doth hold no way, neither affirmatiuely nor negatiuely, is hard. By a mans authority we here vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the force which his word hath for the assurance of anothers mind that buildeth vpon it; as the Apostle somewhat did vpon their report of the house of <hi>Cloe,</hi>

And if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that in matter of fact there is some credite to be giuen to the testimonie of man, but not in matter of opinion and iudgement; we see the contrary both acknowledged and vniuersally practised also throughout the world. The sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of wise and expert men were neuer but highly esteemed. Let the title of a mans right be called in question; are we not bold to relie and build vpon the iudgement of such as are famous for their skill in the lawes of this land? In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of state, the waight many times of some one mans authority is thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sufficient, euen to sway ouer whole nations. And this not onely with the simpler sort; but the learneder and wiser we are, the more such arguments in some cases preuaile with vs. The reason why the simpler sort are mooued with authority, is the conscience of their owne ignorance; whereby it commeth to passe, that hauing learned men in admiration, they rather feare to dislike them, then know wherefore they should allow and follow their iudgements. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise with them that are skilfull, authority is much more strong and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; because they only are able to discerne how iust cause there is, why to some mens authority so much should be attributed. For which cause the name of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (no doubt) were more effectuall to perswade euen such men as <hi>Galen</hi> himselfe, then to moue a silly Empiricke. So that the very selfe same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kind which doth but induce the vulga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sort to like, may constraine the wiser to yeeld. And therefore not Orators only with the people, but euen the very profoundest disputers in all faculties haue hereby often with the best learned preuailed most. As for arguments taken from humaine authority and that negatiuely; for example sake, if we should thinke the assembling of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God together by the sound of a bell, the presenting of infants at the holy font by such as commonly we call their Godfathers, or any other the like recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued custome to be impious, because some men of whom we thinke very reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendly, haue in their bookes and writings no where mentioned nor taught that such things should be in the Church; this reasoning were subiect vnto iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, it were but feeble, weake and vnsound. Notwithstanding euen nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely an argument from humaine authority may be strong, as namely thus; The Chronicles of England mention no moe then onely sixe kings bearing the name of <hi>Edward,</hi> since the time of the last conquest; therefore it cannot be there should be moe. So that if the question be of the authority of a mans testimony, we cannot simply auouch, either that affirmatiuely it doth not any way hold, or that it hath only force to induce the simpler sort, and not to constraine men of vnderstanding and ripe iudgement to yeeld assent, or that negatiuely it hath in it no strength at all. For vnto e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uery of these the contrary is most plaine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth that which is alleaged concerning the infirmitie of men, ouerthrow or disproue this. Men are blinded with ignorance and errour; many things may
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19711:61"/>
escape them, and in many things they may bee deceiued; yea those things which they do knowe, they may either forget, or vpon sundry indirect consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations let passe; and although themselues do not erre, yet may they through malice or vanity, euen of purpose deceiue others. Howbeit infinite cases there are wherein all these impediments and lets are so manifestly excluded, that there is no shew or colour whereby any such exception may be taken, but that the testimony of man will stand as a ground of infallible assurance. That there is a City of Rome, that <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. and others haue beene Popes of Rome, I suppose we are certainely enough perswaded. The ground of our perswasion, who neuer saw the place nor persons before named, can be nothing but mans testimony. Will any man here notwithstanding alleage those mentioned humaine infirmities, as reasons why these things should be mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted or doubted of? Yea that which is more, vtterly to infringe the force and strength of mans testimony, were to shake the very fortresse of Gods truth. For whatsoeuer we beleeue concerning saluation by Christ, although the scripture be therein the ground of our beliefe; yet the authority of man is if we marke it the key, which openeth the dore of entrance into the knowledge of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The scripture could not teach vs the things that are of God, vnlesse we did credite men who haue taught vs that the words of Scripture do signifie those things. Some way therefore, notwithstanding mans infirmitie, yet his authority may enforce assent.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. C. l. 1. p. 10.</hi> Although that kind of argument of authoritie of men is good, neither in humaine nor diuine sciences; yet it hath some small force in humaine sciences, for as much as naturally, &amp; in that he is a man, he may come to some ripenes of iudgement in those sciences; which in diuine matters hath no force at all, as of him which naturally, and as he is a man, can no more iudge of them shew a blind man of colours. Yea so farre is it from drawing credit if it be barely spoken without reason and testimony of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it carieth also a suspition of vntruth whatsoeuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from him, which the Apostle did well note when to signifie a thing corruptly spoken and against the truth, he saith, that it is spoken according vnto man. Rom. 3. He saith not as a wicked and lying man, but simply as a man. And although this corruption be reformed in many; yet for so much as in whome the knowledge of the truth is most aduanced, there remaineth both ignorance and disordered affections (whereof either of them turneth him from speaking of the truth;) no mans authority, with the Church especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and those that are called and perswaded of the authority of the word of God, can bring any assurance vnto the conscience.</note> Vpon better aduise and deliberation so much is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and at the length confest, that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from the authority of men may not onely so farre forth as hath bene declared, but further also be of some force in <hi>humaine sciences</hi>; which force be it neuer so smal, doth shew that they are not vtterly naught.

Howbeit the very selfe same reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which causeth to yeeld that they are of some force in the one, will at the length constraine also to acknowledge, that they are not in the other altogether vnforcible. For if the naturall strength of mans wit may by experience and study attaine vnto such ripenes in the knowledge of things humaine, that men in this respect may presume to build somewhat vpon their iudgement; what reason haue we to thinke but that euen in matters diuine, the like wits furnisht with necessary helpes, exercised in scripture with like diligence, and assisted with the grace of almighty God, may growe vnto so much perfection of knowledge, that men shall haue iust cause, when any thing pertinent vnto faith and religion is doubted of, the more willingly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their mindes towards that which the sentence of so graue, wise, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that faculty shal iudge most sound. For the controuersie is of the waight of such mens iudgements. Let it therefore be suspected, let it be taken as grosse, corrupt, repugnant vnto the truth, whatsoeuer concerning things diuine aboue

nature shall at any time be spoken as out of the mouthes of meere naturall men, which haue not the eyes wherwith heauenly thinges are discerned. For this we contend not.

For mine owne part I dare not so lightly esteeme of the Church, and of the principall pillars therein. The truth is, that the minde of man desireth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore to knowe the truth according to the most infallible certaintie which the nature of thinges can yeeld. The greatest assurance generally with all men, is that which we haue by plaine aspect and intuitiue beholding. Where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine vnto this; there what appeareth to bee true by strong and inuincible demonstration, such as wherein it is not by any way possible to be deceiued, thereunto the minde doth necessarily assent, neither is it in the choice thereof to do otherwise. And in case these bothe do faile; then which way greatest proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie leadeth, thither the mind doth euermore incline. Scripture with Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men being receiued as the word of God, that for which we haue probable, yea that which we haue necessary reason for, yea that which wee see with our eyes is not thought so sure, as that which the scripture of God teacheth; because wee hold that his speech reuealeth there what himselfe seeth, &amp; therefore the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest proofe of all, and the most necessarily assented vnto by vs (which do thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the scripture,) is the scripture. Now it is not required or can bee exacted at our handes, that we should yeeld vnto any thing other assent, then such as doth answere the euidence which is to be had of that we assent vnto. For which cause euen in matters diuine, concerning some thinges we may lawfully doubt and suspend our iudgement, inclining neither to one side or other, as namely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the time of the fall both of man and Angels; of some thinges we may very well retaine an opinion that they are probable &amp; not vnlikely to be true, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we hold that men haue their soules rather by creation then propagation, or that the mother of our Lord liued alwaies in the state of virginitie as well after his birth as before (for of these two, the one her virginitie before, is a thing which of necessitie we must belieue; the other her continuance in the same state alwaies, hath more likelihood of truth then the contrary;) finally in all things then are our consciences best resolued, and in most agreeable sort vnto God and nature fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which thing I doe so much the rather set downe, for that I see how a number of soules are, for want of right informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this point, oftentimes grieuously vexed. When bare and vnbuilded conclusions are put into their mindes, they finding not themselues to haue therof any great certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, imagine that this proceedeth only from lacke of faith, and that the spirite of God doth not worke in them, as it doth in true beleeuers; by this meanes their hearts are much troubled, they fall into anguish &amp; perplexitie: wheras the truth is, that how bold and confident soeuer we may be in words, when it commeth to the point of triall, such as the euidence is which the truth hath eyther in it selfe or through proofe, such is the hearts assent thereunto, neither can it bee stronger, being grounded as it should be. I grant that proofe deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19711:62"/>
of mans iudgement, is not able to worke that assurance which doth grow by a stronger proofe; and therfore although ten thousand generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels would set downe one &amp; the same definitiue sentence concerning any point of religion whatsoeuer, yet one demonstratiue reason alleaged, or one mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest testimonie cited from the mouth of God himself to the contrary, could not choose but ouerweigh them all; in as much as for them to haue bene deceiued, it is not impossible; it is, that demonstratiue reason or testimonie diuine should deceiue. Howbeit in defect of proofe infallible, because the minde doth rather follow probable perswasions, then approue the things that haue in them no likelihood of truth at all; surely if a question co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning matter of doctrine were proposed, and on the one side no kind of proofe appearing, there should on the other be alleaged and shewed that so a number of the learnedest diuines in the world haue euer thought; although it did not appeare what reason or what scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture led them to be of that iudgement, yet to their very bare iudgement some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a reasonable man would attribute, notwithstanding the common imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities which are incident into our nature. And whereas it is thought, that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the Church, and those that are called &amp; perswaded of thauthority of the word of God, mans authoritie with them especially should not preuaile; it must &amp; doth preuaile euen with them, yea with them especially as far as equitie requireth, &amp; farther we maintain it not.

Againe that authoritie of men should preuaile with men either against or aboue reason, is no part of our beliefe. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of learned men be they neuer so great and reuerend, are to yeeld vnto reason; the waight whereof is no whit preiudiced by the simplicitie of his person which doth alleage it, but being found to be sound and good, the bare opinion of men to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, must of necessitie stoope and giue place. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writing against <hi>Marcion,</hi> which held one God author of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and another of the new, to proue that the Apostles preached the same God which was knowne before to the Iewes, hee copiously alleageth sundry their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and speeches vttered concerning that matter, and recorded in Scripture. And least any should be wearied with such store of allegations, in the ende hee concludeth. <hi>While we labour for these demonstrations out of Scripture, and doe sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily declare the thinges which many wayes haue beene spoken, bee contented quietly to heare, and doe not thinke my speech tedious: Quoniam ostensiones quae sunt in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19711:62"/>
non possunt ostendi nisi ex ipsis scripturis; Because demonstrations that are in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may not otherwise be shewed, then by citing them out of the scriptures themselues where they are.</hi> Which wordes make so little vnto the purpose, that they seeme as it were offended at him which hath called them thus solemnely foorth to say nothing. And concerning the verdict of Ierome, If no man, be he neuer so well learned, haue after the Apostles any authoritie to publish new doctrine as from heauen, and to require the worldes assent as vnto truth receiued by propheticall reuelation; doth this preiudice the credite of learned mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in opening that truth, which by being conuersant in the Apostles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, they haue themselues from thence learned? Saint Augustine exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to heare men, but to hearken what God speaketh. His purpose is not (I thinke) that wee should stop our eares against his owne exhortation, and therefore hee cannot meane simply that audience should altogether bee denied vnto men; but eyther that if men speake one thing and God himselfe teach an other, then hee, not they to bee obeyed; or if they both speake the same thing, yet then also mans speech vnworthy of hearing, not simply, but in comparison of that which proceedeth from the mouth of God. Yea but wee doubt what the will of God is. Are wee in this case forbidden to heare what men of iudgement thinke it to be? If not, then this allegation also might very well haue beene spared. In that auncient strife which was betweene the Catholique fathers and Arrians, Donatistes, and others of like peruerse and frowarde disposition, as long as to fathers or Councells alleaged on the one side, the like by the contrarie side were opposed, impossible it was that euer the question should by this meane growe vnto any issue or ende. The scripture they both beleeued, the scripture they knew could not giue sentence on both sides, by scripture the controuersie betweene them was such as might be determined. In this case what madnesse was it with such kindes of proofes to nourish their contention, when there were such effectuall meanes to end all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie that was betweene them? Hereby therefore it doth not as yet appeare, that an argument of authoritie of man affirmatiuely is in matters diuine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. Which opinion being once inserted into the mindes of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort, what it may growe vnto God knoweth. Thus much wee see, it hath alreadie made thousandes so headstrong euen in grosse and palpable errors, that a man whose capacitie will scarce serue him to vtter fiue wordes in sensible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, blusheth not in any doubt concerning matter of scripture to think his owne bare <hi>Yea</hi> as good as the <hi>Nay</hi> of all the wise, graue, and learned iudgements that are in the whole world. Which insolencie must be represt, or it will be the very bane of Christian religion. Our Lordes Disciples marking what speech hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnto them, and at the same time calling to minde a common opinion held by the Scribes, betweene which opinion and the wordes of their Maister, it seemed vnto them that there was some contradiction, which they could not themselues aunswere with full satisfaction of their owne mindes; the doubt they propose to our Sauiour saying, <hi>Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?</hi> They knew that the Scribes did erre greatly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 17.10.</note> and that many waies euen in matters of their owne profession. They notwithstanding thought the iudgement of the very Scribes in matters diuine to bee of some value;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19711:63"/>
some probabilitie they thought there was that <hi>Elias</hi> should come, in as much as the Scribes said it. Now no truth can contradict any truth; desirous therefore they were to be taught, how bothe might stand together, that which they knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not be false, because Christ spake it; and this which to them did seeme true, onely because the Scribes had said it. For the scripture from whence the Scribes did gather it, was not then in their heads. Wee doe not finde that our Sauiour reprooued them of error, for thinking the iudgement of Scribes to be worth the obiecting, for esteeming it to be of any moment or value in matters concerning God. We cannot therefore be perswaded that the will of God is, we should so farre reiect the authoritie of men, as to recken it nothing. No, it may be a question, whether they that vrge vs vnto this, be themselues so perswaded indeede. Men do sometimes bewray that by deedes, which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse they are hardly drawne. Marke then if this be not generall with all men for the most part. When the iudgements of learned men are alleaged against them; what do they but eyther eleuate their credite, or oppose vnto them the iudgements of others as learned? Which thing doth argue that all men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in them some force and waight, for which they are loath the cause they maintaine should be so much weakened as their testimony is auaileable. Againe what reason is there why alleaging testimonies as proofes, men giue them some title of credite, honour, and estimation whom they alleage, vnlesse before hand it be sufficiently knowne who they are; what reason hereof but only a common in grafted perswasion, that in some men there may be found such qualities as are able to counteruaile those exceptions which might be taken against them, and that such mens authoritie is not lightly to be shaken off? Shall I adde further, that the force of arguments drawne from the authoritie of scripture it selfe, as scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures commonly are alleaged, shall (being sifted) be found to depende vpon the strength of this so much despised and debased authoritie of man? Surely it doth, and that oftner then we are aware of. For although scripture be of God, and therefore the proofe which is taken from thence must needes be of all other most inuincible; yet this strength it hath not, vnlesse it auouch the selfe same thing for which it is brought. If there be eyther vndeniable apparance that so it doth, or reason such as cannot deceiue, then scripture-proofe (no doubt) in strength and value exceedeth all. But for the most part, euen such as are readiest to cite for one thing fiue hundred sentences of holy scripture; what warrant haue they, that any one of them doth meane the thing for which it is alleaged? Is not their surest ground most commonly, eyther some probable coniecture of their owne, or the iudgement of others taking those Scriptures as they doe? Which notwithstanding to meane otherwise then they take them, it is not still altogether imposible. So that now and then they ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues on humane authoritie, euen when they most pretend diuine. Thus it fareth euen cleane throughout the whole controuersie about that discipline which is so earnestly vrged and laboured for. Scriptures are plentifully allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to proue, that the whole Christian worlde for euer ought to embrace it. Hereupon men terme it <hi>The discipline of God.</hi> Howbeit examine, sift, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue their alleaged proofes, till you come to the very roote from whence they spring, the heart wherein their strength lyeth; and it shall clearely
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19711:63"/>
appeare vnto any man of iudgement, that the most which can be inferred vpon such plentie of diuine testimonies is onely this, That <hi>some thinges</hi> which they maintaine, as far as <hi>some men</hi> can <hi>probably coniecture,</hi> doe <hi>seeme</hi> to haue bene out of scripture <hi>not absurdly</hi> gathered.

But to conclude, I would gladly vnderstand how it commeth to passe, that they which so peremptorily doe maintaine that humane authoritie is nothing worth, are in the cause which they fauour so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue the common sort of men perswaded, that the wisest, the godliest, and the best learned in all Christendome are that way giuen, seeing they iudge this to make nothing in the world for them. Againe how commeth it to passe, they cannot abide that authoritie should be alleaged on the other side, if there be no force at all in authorities on one side or other? Wherefore labour they to strip their aduersaries of such furniture as doth not helpe? Why take they such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse paines to furnish also their owne cause with the like? If it be voyd and to no purpose that the names of men are so frequent in their bookes; what did moue them to bring them in, or doth to suffer them there remaining?

Where no doubt is, deliberation is not excluded as impertinent vnto the thing, but as needlesse in regard of the agent, which seeth already what to resolue vpon. It hath no apparent absurditie therefore in it to thinke, that all actions of men indued with the vse of reason, are generally either good or euill. Whatsoeuer is good; the same is also approued of God: and according vnto the sundrie degrees of goodnesse, the kindes of diuine approbation are in like sort multiplyed. Some things are good, yet in so meane a degree of goodnesse, that men are only nor disproued nor disalowed of God for them. No man hateth his owne flesh. If ye doe good vnto them that doe so to you, the very Publicans themselues doe as much. They are worse then Infidels that haue no care to prouide for their owne.<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.29.

In actions of this kind, our chiefest direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from scripture, for nature is no sufficient teacher what we should do that we may attaine vnto life euerlasting. The vnsufficiencie of the light of nature, is by the light of scripture so fully and so perfectly herein supplied, that further light then this hath added there doth not neede vnto that ende. Finally some thinges although not so required of necessitie, that to leaue them vndone exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from saluation, are notwithstanding of so great dignitie and acceptation with God, that most ample rewarde in heauen is laide vp for them.

And euen hereby it commeth to passe, that first such as imagine the generall and maine drift of the body of sacred scripture not to be so large as it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor that God did thereby intend to deliuer, as in truth he doth, a full instruction in al things vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> necessary, the knowledge wherof man by nature could not otherwise in this life attaine vnto: they are by this very mean induced, either still to looke for new reuelations from heauen, or else daungerously to ad to the word of God vncertaine tradition, that so the doctrine of mans saluation may be compleate, which doctrine we constantly hold in all respectes without any such thing added to be so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleat, that we vtterly refuse as much as once to acquaint our selues with any thing further.

Two opinions therefore there are concerning suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of holy scripture, each extreamly opposite vnto the other, &amp; bothe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto truth. The schooles of Rome teach scripture to be so vnsufficient, as if, except traditions were added, it did not conteine all reuealed and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall truth, which absolutely is necessary for the children of men in this life to know that they may in the next be saued. Others iustly condemning this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, growe likewise vnto a dangerous extremitie, as if scripture did not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all thinges in that kinde necessary, but all thinges simply, and in such sorte that to doe any thing according to any other lawe, were not onely vnnecessary, but euen opposite vnto saluation, vnlawfull and sinfull. Whatsoeuer is spoken of God, or thinges appertaining to God, otherwise then as the truth is; though it seeme an honour, it is an iniurie. And as incredible praises giuen vnto men, doe often abate and impaire the credit of their deserued commendation; so we must likewise take great heed, least in attributing vnto scripture more then it can haue, the incredibilitie of that do cause euen those thinges which indeed it hath most aboundantly, to be lesse reuerendly esteemed. I therefore leaue it to themselues to consider, whether they haue in this first point or not ouershot themselues; which God doth knowe is quickly done, euen when our meaning is most sincere, as I am verily perswaded theirs in this case was.</p>

That Church of Christ which we properly terme his body mysticall, can be but one; neither can that one be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly discerned by any man, in as much as the parts thereof are some in heauen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie with Christ, and the rest that are on earth (albeit their naturall persons be visible) we do not discerne vnder this propertie whereby they are truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly of that body.

Whatsoeuer we read in scripture concerning the endlesse loue and the sauing mercie, which God sheweth towards his Church; the onely proper subiect thereof is this Church. Concerning this flocke it is that our Lord and Sauiour hath promised, <hi>I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perish,</hi>

And as those euerlasting promises of loue, mercy, &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes, belong to the mysticall church; euen so on the other side when we reade of any dutie which the Church of God is bound vnto, the Church whom this doth concerne is a sensibly knowne company. And this visible Church in like sorte is but one, continued from the first beginning of the world to the last end. Which company being deuided into two moieties; the one before, the other since the comming of Christ: that part which since the comming of Christ, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath embraced, and partly shall hereafter embrace the Christian Religion, wee terme as by a more proper name the Church of Christ.

Now although wee know the Christian faith and allow of it, yet in this respect wee are but entring; entered wee are not into the visible Church, before our admittance by the doore of baptisme. Wherfore immediatly vpon the acknowledgement of christian faith,<note place="margin">Act. 8.38. Act. 22.16.</note> the Eunuch (we see) was baptized by Philip; Paule by Ananias;<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.</note> by Peter an huge multitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining three thousand soules, which being once baptized, were reckoned in the number of soules added to the visible Church. As for those vertues that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto morall righteousnesse and honestie of life, we doe not mention them, because they are not proper vnto Christian men, as they are Christian, but doe concerne them, as they are men. True it is, the want of these vertues exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from saluation. So doth much more the absence of inward beliefe of heart; so doth despaire and lacke of hope; so emptines of Christian loue and charitie. But wee speake now of the visible Church, whose children are signed with this marke, <hi>One Lord, one faith, one baptisme.</hi> In whomsoeuer these thinges are, the church doth acknowledge them for her children; them onely she holdeth for aliens and strangers, in whom these things are not found. For want of these it is that Saracens, Iewes, and Infidels, are excluded out of the bounds of the church. Others we may not denie to be of the visible church, as long as these thinges are not wanting in them. For apparent it is, that all men are of necessitie either Christians or not Christians. If by externall profession they be Christians, then
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19711:67"/>
are they of the visible Church of Christ: And Christians by externall professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are all, whose marke of recognisance hath in it those things which wee haue mentioned, yea although they be impious idolaters, wicked heretiques, persons excommunicable, yea and cast out for notorious improbitie. Such withall we denie not to be the imps and limmes of Satan, euen as long as they continue such. Is it then possible that the selfe same men should belong both to the synagogue of Satan, and to the Church of Iesus Christ? Vnto that Church which is his mysticall body, not possible; because that body consisteth of none but onely true Israelites, true sonnes of Abraham, true seruantes and Saints of God. Howbeit of the visible body and Church of Iesus Christ, those may be and oftentimes are, in respect of the maine partes of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profession; who in regard of their inward disposition of minde, yea of externall conuersation, yea euen of some parts of their very profession, are most worthily both hatefull in the sight of God himselfe, and in the eyes of the sounder partes of the visible Church most execrable.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.47.</note> Our Sauiour therefore compareth the kingdome of Heauen to a net,<note place="margin">Math. 13.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithstanding so farre as lawfully we may, we haue held, and do hold fellowship with them. For euen as the Apostle doth say of Israell,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.28.</note> that they are in one respect eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but in another beloued of God: In like sort with Rome we dare not communicate concerning sundrie her grosse and grieuous abominations; yet touching those maine parts of Christian truth wherein they constantly still persist, we gladly acknowledge them to bee of the familie of Iesus Christ; and our hearty prayer vnto God almighty is, that being conioyned so farre foorth with them, they may at the length, (if it be his will) so yeeld to frame and reforme themselues, that no distraction remaine in any thing, but that we all may with one heart and one mouth, glorifie God the father of our Lord and Sauiour, whose Church we are. As there are which make the Church of Rome vtterly no Church at all, by reason of so many, so greeuous errors in their doctrines: so we haue them amongst vs, who vnder pretence of imagined cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in our discipline, do giue euen as hard a iudgement of the Church of England it selfe. But whatsoeuer either the one sort or the other teach, we must acknowledge euen heretikes themselues to be though a maimed part, yet a part of the visible Church. If an Infidell should pursue to death an heretique professing Christianitie, only for Christian profession sake: could we deny vnto him the honor of martyrdome? Yet this honor all men know to be proper vnto the Church. Heretikes therefore are not vtterly cut off from the visible Church of Christ. If the fathers do any where, as oftentimes they do, make the true visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Christ and hereticall companies opposite, they are to be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as separating heretikes not altogether from the company of beleeuers, but from the fellowship of sound beleeuers. For where profest vnbeleefe is, there can be no visible Church of Christ; there may be, where sound beliefe wanteth. Infidels being cleane without the Church, deny directly and vtterly reiect the very principles of Christianity; which heretikes embrace, and erre onely by misconstruction; whereupon their opinions although repugnant indeed to the principles of Christian faith, are notwithstanding by them held otherwise, and maintained as most consonant thereunto. Wherfore being Christians in regard of the generall truth of Christ which they openly professe; yet they are by the fathers euery where spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, as men cleane excluded out of the right belieuing

Church by reason of their particular errors, for which all that are of a sound beleefe must needes condemne them. In this consideration the aunswere of <hi>Caluin</hi> vnto <hi>Farell</hi> concerning the children of Popish parents doth seeme cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; <hi>Whereas</hi> sayth he, <hi>you aske our iudgement about a matter,</hi>

For the reason which they yeeld of their sentence is this; <hi>The promise which God doth make to the faithfull concerning their seede, reacheth vnto a thousand generations; it resteth not onely in the first degree of descent. Infants therefore whose great graund fathers haue bene holy and godly, do in that respect belong to the bodie of the Church, although the fathers and graundfathers of whom they descend haue bene Apostates: Because the tenure of the grace of God which did adopt them three hundred years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>agoe and more in their auncient predecessors, cannot with iustice be defeated and broken off by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit not euerie error and fault, yet heresies and crimes which are not actually repented of and forsaken, exclude quite and cleane from that saluation, which belongeth vnto the misticall body of Christ; yea they also make a separation from the visible sound Church of Christ; altogether from the visible Church neither the one nor the other dothe seuer. As for the act of excommunication, it neither shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out from the misticall, nor cleane from the visible, but only from fellowship
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19711:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the visible in holy duties. With what congruity then doth the Church of Rome deny, that her enemies, whom she holdeth alwayes for heretikes, do at all appertaine to the Church of Christ; when her owne do freely grant, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Pope (as they say) cannot teach heresie nor propound error, he may notwithstanding himselfe worship idols, thinke amisse concerning matters of faith, yea giue himselfe vnto acts diabolicall, euen being Pope? How exclude they vs from being any part of the Church of Christ vnder the colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of heresie, when they cannot but graunt it possible euen for him to be as touching his owne personal perswasion hereticall, who in their opinion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of the Church, but holdeth the chiefest place of authority ouer the same? But of these things we are not now to dispute. That which already we haue set downe, is for our present purpose sufficient. By the Church therefore in this question we vnderstand no other then onely the visible Church. For preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christianity there is not any thing more needfull, then that such as are of the visible Church, haue mutuall fellowship and societie one with another. In which consideration, as the maine body of the sea being one, yet within diuers precincts hath diuers names; so the Catholike Church is in like sort deuided into a number of distinct societies, euery of which is termed a Church within it selfe. In this sense the Church is alwaies a visible society of men; not an assembly, but a society. For although the name of the Church be giuen vnto Christian as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, although any multitude of Christian men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregated may be termed by the name of a Church; yet assemblies properly are rather things that belong to a Church.

               <hi>Instruction, Breaking of bread,</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are of the misticall body of Christ, haue those inward graces and vertues, whereby they differ from all others which are not of the same body; againe whosoeuer appertaine to the visible body of the Church, they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the notes of externall profession, whereby the world knoweth what they are: after the same manner euen the seuerall societies of Christian men, vnto euery of which the name of a Church is giuen with addition betokening seuerally, as the Church of Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, England, and so the rest, must bee indued with correspondent generall properties belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as they are publique Christian societies. And of such properties common vnto all societies Christian, it may not be denied, that one of the very chiefest is Ecclesiasticall Politie. Which word I therefore the rather vse, because the name of gouernement as commonly men vnderstand it in ordinary speech, doth not comprise the largenes of that whereunto in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it is applied. For when we speake of gouernment, what doth the greatest part conceiue thereby, but onely the exercise of superiority peculiar vnto rulers

               <note place="margin">That matters of discipline are different from matters of faith and saluation, and that they them selues so teach which are our reproouers.</note>3 The mixture of those things by speech, which by nature are diuided, is the mother of all error.

When they blame that in vs, which themselues followe, they giue men great cause to doubt that some other thing then iudgement doth guide their speech. What the Church of God standeth bound to knowe or do, the same in part nature teacheth. And because nature can teach them but onely in part, neither so fully, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for mans saluation; nor so easily, as to make the way plaine and expedite enough, that many may come to the knowledge of it and so be saued; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture hath God both collected the most necessarie things, that the Schoole of nature teacheth vnto that end; and reuealeth also whatsoeuer we neither could with safety bee ignorant of, nor at all be instructed in but by supernaturall reuelation from him. So that Scripture conteining all things that are in this kind any way needfull for the Church, and the principall of the other sort, this is the next thing wherewith we are charged as with an errour: we teach that whatsoeuer is vnto saluation termed <hi>necessarie</hi> by way of excellencie, whatsoeuer it standeth all men vppon to knowe or do that they may be saued, whatsoeuer there is whereof it may truely be sayd, <hi>This not to beleeue is eternall death and damnation,</hi> or, <hi>This euery soule that will liue must duly obserue,</hi> of which sort the Articles of Christian faith, and the Sacraments of the Church of Christ are; all such things if Scripture did not comprehend, the Church of God should not bee able to measure out the length and the breadth of that way wherein for euer she is to walke. Heretiques and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques neuer ceasing, some to abridge, some to enlarge, all to peruert and obscure the same. But as for those things that are accessorie hereunto, those things that so belong to the way of saluation, as to alter them is no otherwise to chaunge that way, then a path is chaunged by altering onely the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most face thereof, which be it layd with grauell, or set with grasse, or paued with stone, remaineth still the same path; in such things because discretion may teach the Church what is conuenient, we hold not the Church further tied herein vnto Scripture, then that against Scripture nothing be admitted in the Church, least that path which ought alwayes to be kept euen, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by come to be ouer-growne with brambles and thornes.

               </note>7 Well, yet a glosse there is to colour that paradoxe, and notwithstanding all this, still to make it appeare in shew not to be altogether vnreasonable. And therefore till further reply come, the cause is held by a feeble distinction; that the commandements of God being either generall or speciall, although there be no expresse word for euery thing in specialtie, yet there are generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements for all things, to the end that euen such cases as are not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture particularly mentioned, might not be left to any to order at their pleasure, onely with caution that nothing be done against the word of God: and that for this cause the Apostle hath set downe in scripture foure generall rules, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring such things alone to be receiued in the Church, as do best and neerest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the same rules, that so all things in the Church may be appointed, not onely <hi>not against,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> and <hi>according</hi> to the word of God. The rules are these, <hi>Nothing scandalous</hi> or offensiue vnto any, especially vnto the Church of God; <hi>All things</hi> in order and with seemelinesse; <hi>All vnto edification</hi>; finally <hi>All to the glory of God.</hi> Of which kind how many might be gathered out of the Scripture, if it were necessary to take so much paines? Which rules they that vrge, minding thereby to proue that nothing may be done in the Church but what Scripture commaundeth, must needs hold that they tye the Church of Christ no otherwise, then onely because we find them there set downe by the finger of the holy Ghost. So that vnlesse the Apostle by writing had deliuered those rules to the Church, we should by obseruing them haue sinned, as now by not obseruing them.<note place="margin">T.

S. <hi>Paule</hi> would then of likelihood haue cited them out of the Law, which we see he doth not. The truth is, they are rules and Canons of that law, which is written in all men hearts; the Church had for euer no lesse then now stood bound to obserue them, whether the Apostle had mentioned them or no. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore those Canons do bind as they are edicts of nature, which the Iewes obseruing as yet vnwritten, and thereby framing such Church-orders as in their lawe were not prescribed, are notwithstanding in that respect vncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; it followeth that sundry things may be lawfully done in the Church, so as they be not done against the Scripture, although no Scripture do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them, but the Church only following the light of reason, iudge them to be in discretion meete. Secondly vnto our purpose and for the question in hand, whether the commaundements of God in Scripture be generall or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, it skilleth not. For if being particularly applied, they haue in regard of such particulars a force constraining vs to take some one certaine thing of many, and to leaue the rest, whereby it would come to passe, that any other particular but that one being established, the generall rules themselues in that case would be broken; then is it vtterly impossible that God should leaue any thing great or small free for the Church to establish or not. Thirdly if so be they shall graunt, as they cannot otherwise do, that these rules are no such lawes as require any one particular thing to be done; but serue rather to direct the Church in all things which she doth, so that free and lawfull it is to deuise any Ceremony, to receiue any order, and to authorize any kind of regiment, no speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement being thereby violated, and the same being thought such by them to whom the iudgement thereof appertaineth, as that it is not scandalous, but decent, tending vnto edification, and setting forth the glory of God, that is to say agreeable vnto the generall rules of holy Scripture; this doth them no good in the world for the furtherance of their purpose. That which should make for them, must proue that men ought not to make lawes for Church regiment, but onely keepe those lawes which in Scripture they find made. The plaine intent of the booke of Ecclesiasticall discipline is to shew, that men may not deuise lawes of Church gouernment; but are bound for euer to vse and to execute only those, which God himselfe hath already deuised and deliuered in the Scripture. The selfe same drift the Admonitioners also had, in vrging that nothing ought to be done in the Church according vnto any lawe of mans deuising, but all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which God in his word hath commanded. Which not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, they gather out of Scripture generall rules to bee followed in making lawes; and so in effect they plainely graunt, that we our selues may lawfully make lawes for the Church, and are not bound out of Scripture onely to take lawes already made, as they meant who first alleaged that principle whereof we speake. One particular platforme it is which they respected, and which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored thereby to force vpon all Churches; whereas these generall rules do not let, but that there may well enough be sundrie. It is the particular order establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church of England, which thereby they did intend to alter, as being not commanded of God; whereas vnto those generall rules they know we do not defend that we may hold any thing vncomfortable. Obscure it is not what meaning they had, who first gaue out that graund axiome: and according vnto
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19711:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that meaning it doth preuaile farre and wide with the fauourers of that part. Demaund of them, wherefore they conforme not themselues vnto the order of our Church, and in euery particular their answer for the most part is, <hi>We find no such thing commaunded in the word.</hi> Whereby they plainely require some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commaundement for that which is exacted at their hands, neither are they content to haue matters of the Church examined by generall rules and Canons. As therefore in controuersies betweene vs and the Church of Rome, that which they practise is many times euen according to the very grosnesse of that which the vulgar sort conceiueth; when that which they teach to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is so nice and subtle, that hold can very hardly be taken thereupon; in which cases we should do the Church of God small benefite, by disputing with them according vnto the finest points of their darke conueyances, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that sense of their doctrine to go vncontrolled, wherein by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort it is ordinarily receiued and practised: So considering what distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance hath growne in the Church amongst our selues, and how the authors thereof do commonly build altogether on this as a sure foundation, <hi>Nothing ought to be established in the Church which in the word of God is not commanded</hi>; were it reason that we should suffer the same to passe without controulement, in that currant meaning whereby euery where it preuaileth, and still till some strange construction were made thereof, which no man would lightly haue thought on but being driuen thereunto for a shift?</p>

VVhich is in effect as much as to say, <hi>We knowe not what to say well in defence of this position; and therefore least we should say it is false, there is no remedie but to say that in some sense or other it may be true, if we could tell howe.</hi> First that Scholie had neede of a very fauourable Reader and a tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that should thinke it plaine construction, when to be <hi>commaunded in the word</hi> and <hi>grounded vpon the word</hi> are made all one.

Secondly whereas no man in iustice and reason can be reproued, for those actions which are framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto that knowne will of God, whereby they are to bee iudged; and the will of God which wee are to iudge our actions by, no sound Diuine in the world euer denied to bee in parte made manifest euen by

debased, either in comparison with that of God, or in regard of some speciall thing exceeding the reach and compasse thereof, it seemeth to them (not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so much) as if simply it were condemned: an other, that learning, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or wisdome falsely so tearmed, vsurping a name wherof they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and being vnder that name controlled, their reproofe is by so much the more easily misapplied, and through equiuocation wrested against those things wherunto so pretious names do properly and of right belong.

Of such things sometime spake the Apostle S. Paul, declaring how Christ had called him to be a witnesse of his death and resurrection from the dead, according to that which the Prophets and Moses had foreshewed. Festus a meere naturall man, an Infidell, a Romane, one whose eares were vnacquainted with such matter, heard him, but could not reach vnto that whereof he spake; the suffering and the rising of Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he reiecteth as idle superstitious phancies not worth the hearing.<note place="margin">Act. 25.19.</note> The Apostle that knew them by the spirit, &amp; spake of them with power of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Act. 26.24.</note> seemed in his eyes but learnedly mad.

Philosophie we are warned to take heed of: Not that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, which is true and sound knowledge attained by naturall discourse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but that Philosophie which to bolster heresie or error, casteth a fraudulent shew of reason vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things which are indeed vnreasonable, and by that meane as by a stratagem spoileth the simple which are not able to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such cunning. <hi>Take heed least any spoile you through philosophie and vain deceit.</hi> He that exhorteth to beware of an enemies policie,<note place="margin">Col. 2.8.</note> doth not giue counsell to be impolitique; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vse all prouident foresight and circumspection, least our simplicitie be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerreacht by cunning sleights. The way not to be inueigled by them that are so guilefull through skill, is thorowly to be instructed in that which maketh skilfull against guile, and to be armed with that true and sincere philosophy, which doth teach, against that deceiptfull and vaine, which spoileth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. But many great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers haue bene very vnsound in beliefe. And many sound in beliefe, haue bene also great Philosophers. Could secular knowledge bring the one sort vnto the loue of Christian faith? Nor Christian faith the other sort out of loue with secular knowledge. The harme that heretiques did, they did it vnto such, as were vnable to discerne betweene sound and deceiptfull reasoning; and the remedie against it, was euer the skill which the auncient Fathers had to discrie and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer such deceipt. In so much that <hi>Cresconius</hi> the heretique complained greatly of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> as being too full of logicall subtilties.

For there are some things euen knowne by nature, as the immortalitie of the soule vnto many, our God vnto all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my selfe also vse the sentence of some such as Plato, pronouncing euery soule immortall.

But when I heare men alleage, That which is dead is dead; and, while thou art aliue be aliue; and, After death an end of all euen of death it selfe: then will I call to minde both that the heart of the people with God is accounted dust, and that the very wisdome of the world is pronounced folly. If then an heretique flye also vnto such vitious popular and secular conceipts, my answere vnto him shalbe; Thou heretique auoyd the heathen; although in this ye be one, that ye both bely God; yet thou that doest this vnder the name of Christ, differest fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heathen, in that thou seemest to thy selfe a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle haue armed thee, why doest thou borrow a straungers shield? Let him rather learne of thee to acknowledge, then thou of him to renounce the resurrection of the flesh.</hi> In a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Catholique Fathers did good vnto all by that knowledge, whereby here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques hindering the truth in many, might haue furthered therwith themselues, but that obstinately following their owne ambitious or otherwise corrupted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in stead of framing their wills to maintaine that which reason taught, they bent their wits to finde how reason might seeme to teach that which their wills were set to maintaine. For which cause the Apostle saith of them iustly,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.11.</note> that they are for the most part <gap reason="foreign">

For though they be not all perswaded that it is truth which they withstand; yet that to be error which they vphold, they might vndoubtedly the sooner a great deale attaine to know, but that their studie is more to defend what once they haue stood in, then to finde out sincerely and simply what truth they ought to persist in for euer. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. There is in the world no kinde of knowledge, whereby any part of truth is seene, but wee iustly account it pretious; yea that principall truth, in comparison whereof all other knowledge is vile, may receiue from it some kinde of light.

To our purpose it is sufficient, that whosoeuer doth serue, honor &amp; obey God, whosoeuer beleeueth in him, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would no more do this then innocents &amp; infants do, but for the light of natural reason that shineth in him, &amp; maketh him apt to apprehend those things of God, which being by grace discouered,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> are effectuall to perswade reasonable mindes and none other, that honour obedience and credit belong aright vnto God. No man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto God to offer him sacrifice, to poure out supplications &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before him, or to do him any seruice, which doth not first beleeue him both to be, &amp; to be a rewarder of them who in such sort seeke vnto him. Let men bee taught this either by reuelation from heauen, or by instruction vpon earth, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, studie and meditation, or by the onely secret inspiration of the holy Ghost; whatsoeuer the meane be they know it by, if the knowledge therof were possible without discourse of natural reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why should none be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d capable therof but only me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> til such time as they come vnto ripe &amp; full habilitie to work by

               <hi>Theologie</hi> what is it but the science of things diuine? What science can be attained vnto without the help of natural discourse &amp; reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? <hi>Iudge you of that which I speake,</hi> saith the Apostle. In vaine it were to speake any thing of God, but that by reason me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are able somewhat to iudge of that they heare, &amp; by discourse to discerne how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is to truth. Scripture indeed teacheth things aboue nature, things which our reason by it selfe could not reach vnto. Yet those things also we beleeue, knowing by reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the scripture is the word of God. In the presence of <hi>Festus</hi> a Romane, and of King <hi>Agrippa</hi> a Iew, S. Paul omitting the one, who neither knew the Iewes religion, nor the books wherby they were taught it, speaketh vnto the other of things foreshewed by Moses &amp; the Prophets, &amp; performed in Iesus Christ; intending therby to proue himselfe so vniustly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,<note place="margin">Act. 26.22.</note> that vnlesse his iudges did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne both Moses &amp; the Prophets, him they could not choose but acquite, who taught only that fulfilled, which they so long since had foretolde. His cause was easie to be discerned; what was done their eies were witnesses; what Moses &amp; the Prophets did speake, their bookes could quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew; it was no hard thing for him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare them, which knew the one, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the other. <hi>King Agrippa beleeuest thou the Prophets? I know thou dost.</hi> The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is how the bookes of the Prophets came to be credited of king Agrippa. For what with him did authorize the Prophets, the like with vs doth cause the rest of the scripture of God to be of credit. Because we maintain that in scripture we are taught all things necessary vnto saluation, hereupon very childishly it is by some demanded, what scripture can teach vs the sacred authoritie of the scripture, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledge wherof our whole faith &amp; saluation dependeth. As though there were any kind of science in the world, which leadeth men into knowledge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out presupposing a number of thinges alreadie knowne. No science doth make knowne the first principles whereon it buildeth; but they are alwaies either taken as plaine and manifest in themselues, or as proued and granted already, some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledge hauing made them euident. Scripture teacheth al supernaturally reuealed truth, without the knowledge wherof saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot be attained. The maine principle wherupon our beliefe of al things therin contained dependeth, is that the scriptures are the oracles of God himselfe. This in it selfe wee cannot say is euident. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all men that heare it would acknowledge it in hart, as they do when they heare that <hi>euery whole is more then any part of that whole,</hi> because this in it selfe is euident. The other we know that all do not acknowledge when they heare it. There must be therefore some former knowledge presupposed, which doth herein assure the hearts of all beleeuers. Scripture teacheth vs that sauing truth which God hath discouered vnto the world by reuelation; &amp; it presumeth vs taught otherwise that it self is diuine &amp; sacred. The questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being by what meanes we are taught this; some answere that to learne it we haue no other way then only traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as namely that so we beleeue, because both we from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, &amp; they from theirs haue so receiued. But is this inough? That which al mens experience teacheth them, may not in any wise be denied. And by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we all know, that the first outward motiue leading men so to esteeme of the scripture, is the authority of Gods church. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know the whole church of God hath that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the scripture, we iudge it euen at the first an impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing for any man bredde and brought vp in the Church, to bee of a contrary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19711:76"/>
mind without cause. Afterwards the more we bestow our labor in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or hearing the misteries thereof, the more we find that the thing it selfe doth answer our receiued opinion concerning it. So that the former inducement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing somwhat with vs before, doth now much more preuaile, when the very thing hath ministred farther reason. If Infidels or Atheists chance at any time to call it in question, this giueth vs occasion to sift what reason there is, whereby the testimony of the church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning scripture, &amp; our own perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe hath confirmed, may be proued a truth infallible. In which case the ancient fathers being often constrained to shew, what warrant they had so much to relie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scriptures, endeuored still to maintain the authority of the books of God, by arguments such as vnbeleeuers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues must needs think reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they iudged therof as they shuld. Neither is it a thing impossible or greatly hard, euen by such kind of proofes so to manifest &amp; cleere that point, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing shalbe able to deny it, without denying some apparent principle such as al men acknowledge to be true. Wherefore if I beleeue the gospell, yet is reason of singular vse, for that it confirmeth me in this my beleefe the more: If I do not as yet beleeue, neuertheles to bring me to the number of beleeuers except reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did somwhat helpe, &amp; were an instrument which God doth vse vnto such purposes, what should it boote to dispute with Infidels or godles persons for their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; perswasion in that point? Neither can I thinke that when graue &amp; learned men do sometime hold, that of this principle there is no proofe but by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the spirit, which assureth our harts therin, it is their meaning to exclude vtterly all force which any kind of reason may haue in that behalfe: but I rather iucline to interpret such their speeches, as if they had more expresly set downe, that other motiues &amp; induceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, be they neuer so strong &amp; consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, are notwithstanding vneffectual of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to worke faith concerning this principle, if the special grace of the holy ghost concur not to the inlightning of our minds. For otherwise I doubt not but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wisdom &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wil grant, that the Church in this point especially is furnished with reason, to stop the mouthes of her impious aduersaries: and that as it were altogether bootles to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what the spirit hath taught vs; so likewise that euen to our owne selues it needeth caution and explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how the testimony of the spirit may be discerned, by what meanes it may be known, least me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think that the spirit of God doth testifie those things, which the spirit of error suggesteth. The operations of the spirit, especially these ordinary which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnto all true christian men, are as we know, things secret &amp; vndiscernable euen to the very soule where they are, because their nature is of an other &amp; an higher kind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be by vs perceiued in this life. Wherfore albeit the spirit lead vs into all truth, &amp; direct vs in all goodnes; yet because these workings of the spirit in vs are so priuy &amp; secret, we therfore stand on a plainer ground, when we gather by reason fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quality of things beleeued or done, that the spirit of God hath directed vs in both; then if we settle our selues to beleeue, or to do any certaine particular thing, as being moued thereto by the spirit. But of this enough. To go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the books of scripture to the sense &amp; meaning therof; because the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which are by the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited out of the Psalms to proue the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iesus Christ, did not proue it,<note place="margin">Act. 13.36. &amp; cap. 2.34.</note> if so be the prophet Dauid meant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of himsef; this expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disproue, &amp; shew by manifest reason, that of Dauid the words of Dauid could
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19711:77"/>
not possibly be meant. Exclude the vse of naturall reasoning about the sense of holy scripture concerning the articles of our faith, &amp; then that the scripture doth concerne the articles of our faith, who can assure vs? That which by right expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition buildeth vp Christian faith, being misconstrued breedeth error: between true and false construction, the difference reason must shew. Can Christian men perform that which Peter requireth at their hands;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.15.</note> is it possible they should both beleeue, &amp; be able, without the vse of reason, to render a reason of their beleefe, a reason sound and sufficient to answer them that demaund it, be they of the same faith with vs or enemies therunto? may we cause our faith without reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare reasonable in the eyes of men? This being required euen of learners in the schoole of Christ; the duty of their teachers in bringing them vnto such ripenes, must needes be somewhat more, then only to read the sentences of scripture, and then paraphrastically to scholie them, to vary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with sundry formes of speech, without arguing or disputing about anything which they contain. This method of teaching may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it selfe vnto the world by that easines &amp; facilitie which is in it: but a law or a patterne it is not, as some do imagine, for all men to follow that will do good in the Church of Christ. Our Lord and Sauiour himselfe did hope by disputation to do some good, yea by disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onely of, but against the truth, albeit with purpose for the truth. That Christ should be the sonne of Dauid was truth; yet against this truth our Lorde in the Gospell obiecteth, If Christ be the son of Dauid,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.43.</note> how doth Dauid call him Lord? There is as yet no way knowne how to dispute, or to determine of things disputed, without the vse of naturall reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we please to adde vnto Christ their example, who followed him as neere in all thinges as they could, the Sermon of Paule and Barnabas set downe in the Actes, where the people would haue offered vnto them sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Sermon what is there but onely naturall reason to disproue their acte? <hi>O men why doe you these thinges?

In that great and solemne assembly of beleeuing Iewes, how doth Peter proue that the Gentiles were partakers of the grace of God as well as they, but by reason drawne from those effectes, which were apparently knowne amongst them?<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> 
               <hi>God which knoweth hearts, hath borne them witnesse in giuing vnto them the holy Ghost as vnto vs.</hi> The light therefore which the starre of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and wisedome casteth, is too bright to be obscured by the mist of a word or two, vttered to diminish that opinion which iustly hath beene receiued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the force and vertue thereof, euen in matters that touch most nearely the principall duties of men, and the glory of the eternall God. In all which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath beene spoken touching the force and vse of mans reason in thinges diuine, I must craue that I be not so vnderstood or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strued, as if any such thing by vertue thereof could be done without the aide and assistance of Gods most blessed spirit.

the names of humane lawes; so that such other conditions be therein kept as the making of lawes doth require,</hi> that is, if they whose authoritie is thereunto required do esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish and publish them as lawes. And the truth is, that all our controuersie in this cause concerning the orders of the Church, is what particulars the Church may appoint. That which doth finde them out, is the force of mans reason. That which doth guide and direct his reason, is first the generall law of nature, which law of nature and the morall law of scripture are in the substance of law all one. But because there are also in scripture a number of lawes particular and positiue, which being in force may not by any law of man be violated: we are in making lawes to haue thereunto an especiall eie. As for example, it might perhaps seeme reasonable vnto the Church of God, following the generall laws concerning the nature of mariage, to ordaine in particular that cosen germains shall not marry. Which law notwithstanding ought not to be receiued in the Church, if there should be in the scripture a law particular to the contrary, forbidding vtterly the bonds of mariage to be so far forth abridged. The same Thomas therfore whose definition of humane lawes we mentioned before, doth adde thereunto his caution concerning the rule and canon whereby to make them: <hi>Humane lawes are measures</hi> in respect of men whose actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they must direct; howbeit such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they are,<note place="margin">1.2. q. 95. art. 3.</note> as haue also their higher rules to be measured by, <hi>which rules are two, the law of God, and the law of nature.</hi> So that laws humane must be made according to the generall lawes of nature, &amp; without contradiction vnto any positiue lawe in scripture. Otherwise they are ill made. Vnto lawes thus made and receiued by a whole Church, they which liue within the bosome of that Church, must not think it a matter indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t either to yeeld or not to yeeld obedience. Is it a small offence to despise the Church of God?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.22.</note> 
               <hi>My sonne keepe thy fathers comaundement,</hi> saith Salomon,<note place="margin">Prou. 6.20.</note>

Let vs not say we keepe the commandements of the one, when we breake the law of the other: For vnlesse we obserue bothe, we obey neither. And what doth let but that we may obserue both, when they are not the one to the other in any sort repugnant? For of such lawes only we speake, as being made in forme and maner already declared, can haue in them no contradiction vnto the lawes of almighty God. Yea that which is more, the lawes thus made God himselfe doth in such sort authorize, that to despise them is to despise in them him. It is a loose &amp; licentious opinion which the Anabaptists haue embraced, holding that a Christian mans libertie is lost, and the soule which Christ hath redeemed vnto himselfe iniuriously drawne into seruitude vnder the yoke of humane power, if any law be now imposed besides the Gospell of Iesus Christ: in obedience whereunto the spirite of God, and not the constraint of men is to leade vs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the blessed Apostle, <hi>Such as are led by the spirits of God they are the sonnes of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.14.</note> and not such as liue in thraldome vnto men. Their iudgement is therefore that the Church of Christ should admit no law makers but the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists. The author of that which causeth another thing to be, is author of that thing also which thereby is caused. The light of naturall vnderstanding, wit and reason is from God; he it is which thereby doth illuminate euery man entering
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19711:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the world. If there proceede from vs any thing afterwardes corrupt and naught, the mother thereof is our owne darknes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.5.</note> neither doth it proceed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such cause whereof God is the author. He is the author of all that we think or doe by vertue of that light which himselfe hath giuen. And therefore the lawes which the very Heathens did gather direct their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.19. &amp; 2.15.</note> so far forth as they proceeded from the light of nature, God himselfe doth acknowledge to haue proceeded euen from himselfe, and that he was the writer of them in the tables of their hearts. How much more then he the author of those lawes, which haue bene made by his Saints, endued furder with the heauenly grace of his spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and directed as much as might be with such instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as his sacred word doth yeeld? Surely if we haue vnto those lawes that dutifull regard which their dignitie doth require, it will not greatly need, that we should be exhorted to liue in obedience vnto them. If they haue God himselfe for their author, contempt which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them cannot choose but redound vnto him. The safest and vnto God the most acceptable way of framing our liues therfore is, with all humilitie lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and singlenes of hart to studie, which way our willing obedience both vnto God and man may be yeelded euen to the vtmost of that which is due.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Touching the mutabilitie of lawes that concerne the regiment &amp; politie of the church, changed they are, when either altogether abrogated,<note place="margin">That neither Gods being the author of laws, nor his committing them to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor the continuance of the end for which they were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sufficient to proue that they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</note> or in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed or augmented with farther additions. Wherein wee are to note, that this question about changing of lawes, concerneth onely such lawes as are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and do make that now good or euill by being commanded or forbidden, which otherwise of it selfe were not simply the one or the other. Vnto such lawes it is expressely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes added, how long they are to continue in force. If this be no where exprest, then haue we no light to direct our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts concerning the chaungeablenes or immutabilitie of them, but by considering the nature and qualitie of such lawes. The nature of euery lawe must be iudged of by the ende for which it was made, and by the aptnes of thinges therein prescribed vnto the same end. It may so fall out, that the reason why some lawes of God were giuen, is neither opened nor possible to be gathered by wit of man. As why God should forbid <hi>Adam</hi> that one tree, there was no way for <hi>Adam</hi> euer to haue certainely vnderstood. And at <hi>Adams</hi> ignorance of this point Satan tooke aduantage, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the more securely a false cause, because the true was vnto <hi>Adam</hi> vnknowne.<note place="margin">Deut. 22.10. Deut. 22.11.</note> Why the Iewes were forbidden to plow their ground with an oxe and an asse, why to cloath themselues with mingled attire of wooll and linnen, both it was vnto them, &amp; vnto vs it remaineth obscure. Such lawes perhaps cannot be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, sauing onely by whom they were made: because the intent of them being knowne vnto none but the author, he alone can iudge how long it is requisite they should endure. But if the reason why things were instituted may be known, and being knowne do appeare manifestly to be of perpetuall necessitie, then are those things also perpetuall, vnlesse they cease to be effectuall vnto that purpose for which they were at the first instituted. Because when a thing doth cease to be auaileable vnto the end which gaue it being, the continuance of it must then of necessitie appeare superfluous. And of this we cannot be ignorant, how some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that hath done great good, which afterwardes when time hath chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the auncient course of thinges, doth growe to be either very hurtfull, or not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19711:79"/>
so greatly profitable and necessary. If therefore the end for which a lawe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth be perpetually necessary, &amp; the way whereby it prouideth perpetually also most apt, no doubt but that euery such law ought for euer to remain vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Whether God be the author of lawes, by authorizing that power of men wherby they are made, or by deliuering them made immediately from himselfe, by word only, or in writing also, or howsoeuer; notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the authority of their maker, the mutabilitie of that end for which they are made doth also make them changeable. The law of ceremonies came from God. Moses had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to commit it vnto the sacred records of scripture, where it continueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto this very day and houre; in force still as the Iewe surmiseth, because God himselfe was author of it, and for vs to abolish what hee hath established were presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most intollerable. But (that which they in the blindnes of their obdurate hearts are not able to discerne) sith the end for which that lawe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained is now fulfilled past and gone; how should it but cease any longer to bee, which hath no longer any cause of being in force as before?<note place="margin">Quod pro ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris statutum est, cessante necessitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet cessare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter quod vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebat. 1. q. 1.

It was of God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because God gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power wherby they might make lawes, but for that it proceeded euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy motion &amp; suggestion of that secret diuine spirit, whose sentence they did but only pronounce. Notwithstanding as the law of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies deliuered vnto the Iews, so this very law which the Gentiles receiued from the mouth of the holy Ghost, is in like respect abrogated by decease of the end for which it was giuen.<note place="margin">Counterp. p. 8.</note> But such as do not sticke at this point, such as graunt that what hath bene instituted vpon any special cause needeth not to be obserued that cause ceasing, do notwithstanding herein faile; they iudge the lawes of God onely by the author and maine end for which they were made, so that for vs to change that which he hath established, they hold it execrable pride &amp; presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if so be the end and purpose for which God by that meane prouideth bee permanent. And vpon this they ground those ample disputes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning orders and offices, which being by him appointed for the gouernment of his Church, if it be necessary alwaies that the Church of Christ be gouerned, then doth the end for which God prouided remaine still; and therefore in those means which he by law did establish as being fittest vnto that end, for vs to alter any thing is to lift vp our selues against God, and as it were to countermaund him. Wherin they marke not that laws are instruments to rule by, and that instruments are not only to be framed according vnto the generall ende for which they are prouided, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according vnto that very particular which riseth out of the matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they haue to worke. The end wherefore lawes were made may be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and those lawes neuerthelesse require some alteration, if there be any vnfitnes in the meanes which they prescribe as tending vnto that end &amp; purpose.

Insufficiency of lawes doth somtimes come by want of iudgement in the makers. Which cause cannot fall into any law termed properly and immediatly diuine, as it may and doth into humaine lawes often. But that which hath bene once most sufficient, may wax otherwise by alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time &amp; place; that punishment which hath bene somtimes forcible to bridle sinne, may grow afterwards too weake and feeble. In a word we plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the difference of those three lawes which the Iewes receiued at the hands of God, the morall, ceremoniall, &amp; iudiciall, that if the end for which, and the matter according whereunto God maketh his lawes, continue alwaies one and the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his laws also do the like; for which cause the morall law cannot be altered: secondly that whether the matter wheron lawes are made continue or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue not, if their end haue once ceased, they cease also to be of force; as in the law ceremonial it fareth: finally that albeit the end co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, as in that law of theft specified, and in a great part of those ancient iudicials it doth; yet for as mush as there is not in all respects the same subiect or matter remaining for which they were first instituted, euen this is sufficient cause of change. And therefore lawes though both ordeined of God himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the end for which they were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned continuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may notwithstanding cease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if by alteration of persons or times they be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnsufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to attain vnto that end. In which respect why may we not presume, that God doth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call for such change or alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </note> as well of discipline as of doctrine, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be but that both of them haue a common cause. So that as we are to beleeue for euer the articles of euangelicall doctrine, so the precepts of discipline we are in like sort bound for euer to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue. Touching points of doctrine, as for example the vnity of God, the trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of persons, saluation by Christ, the resurrection of the body, life euerlasting, the iudgement to come, and such like, they haue bene since the first houre that there was a Church in the world, and till the last they must be beleeued. But as for matters of regiment, they are for the most part of another nature. To make new articles of faith and doctrine no man thinketh it lawfull; new lawes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment what common wealth or Church is there which maketh not either at one time or another? <hi>The rule of faith,</hi> saith Tertullian, <hi>is but one and that alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, and impossible to be framed or cast anew.</hi> The law of outward order &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not so.

But touching things which belong to discipline &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward politie,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> the Church hath authority to make canons, laws, &amp; decrees, euen as we reade that in the Apostles times it did. Which kind of lawes (for as much as they are not in themselues necessary to saluation) may after they are made be also changed as the difference of times or places shall require. Yea it is not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I am sure by themselues, that certaine things in discipline are of that nature, as they may be varied by times, places, persons and other the like circumstances. Whereupon I demaund, are those changeable points of discipline commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word of God, or no? If they be not commanded, and yet may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Church; how can their former position stand, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning all things in the Church which in the word are not commanded? If they be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and yet may suffer change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can this later stand, affirming all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable which are commanded of God? Their distinction touching matters of substance and of circumstance, though true, will not serue. For be they great things or be they small, if God haue commaunded them in the Gospell, and his commanding them in the Gospell do make them vnchangeable, there is no reason we should more change the one then we may the other. If the authority of the maker do proue vnchangeablenesse in the lawes which God hath made; then must al laws which he hath made be necessarily for euer permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, though they be but of circumstance only and not of substance. I therfore conclude, that neither Gods being author of lawes for gouernment of his Church, nor his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them vnto Scripture, is any reason sufficient, wherefore all Churches should for euer be bound to keepe them without chaunge. But of one thing we are here to giue them warning by the way. For whereas in this discourse we haue oftentimes profest, that many parts of discipline or Church politie are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in Scripture, they may perhaps imagine that we are driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19711:80"/>
discipline to be deliuered in scripture, and that hauing no other meanes to auoid it, we are faine to argue for the changeablenesse of lawes ordained euen by God himselfe, as if otherwise theirs of necessitie should take place, and that vnder which we liue be abandoned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is no remedie therefore but to abate this error in them, and directly to let them know, that if they fall into any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they do but a little flatter their owne cause. As for vs, we thinke in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect so highly of it. Our perswasion is, that no age euer had knowledged of it but onely ours; that they which defend it, deuised it; that neither Christ nor his Apostles at any time taught it but the contrary. If therefore we did seeke to maintaine that which most aduantageth our owne cause, the very best way for vs, and the strongest against them, were to hold euen as they do, that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there must needs be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d some particular forme of Church-polity, which God hath instituted, and which <note n="a" place="margin">Disciplin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, we may not measure the affection of our gratious God towards his by such differences. For euen herein shineth his wisdome, that though the wayes of his prouidence be many, yea the ende which he bringeth all at the length vnto, is one and the selfe same.

They were not bothe at one time deliuered, neither bothe after one sort, nor to one end. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vttered by the voyce of God himselfe in the hearing of sixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men; the former written with the finger of God; the former tearmed by the name of a Couenant; the former giuen to be kept without either mention of time how long, or of place where. On the other side the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giuen after, and neither written by God himselfe, nor giuen vnto the whole multitude immediatly from God, but vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> and from him to them both by word and writing; the later tearmed Ceremonies.

The Lawes positiue are not framed without regard had to the place and persons for the which they are made. If therefore Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God in framing their Lawes, had an eye vnto the nature of that people, and to the countrey where they were to dwell; if these peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per considerations were respected in the making of their Lawes, and must be also regarded in the Positiue Lawes of all other Nations besides; then seeing that Nations are not all alike, surely the giuing of one kinde of positiue Lawes vnto one onely people, without anie libertie to alter them, is but a slender proofe, that therefore one kind should in like sort bee giuen to serue euerlastingly for all. But that which most of all maketh for the cleering of this point is, that the Iewes who had Lawes so particularly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19711:82"/>
determining and so fully instructing them in all affaires what to do, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding continually inured with causes exorbitant, and such as their lawes had not prouided for.<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 35. <hi>Whereas you say that they (the Iewes) had nothing, but was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the law, and we haue manie things vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and left to the order of the Church: I will offer for one that you shall bring that we haue left to the order of the Church, to shew you that they had twentie which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided of by the expresse word of God.</hi>
               </note> And in this point much more is graunted vs then wee aske, namely that for one thing which we haue left to the order of the Church; they had twentie which were vndecided by the expresse word of God; and that as their ceremonies and Sacraments were multiplied aboue ours, euen so grew the number of those cases which were not determined by any expresse word. So that if we may deuise one lawe, they by this reason might deuise twentie: and if their deuising so many were not forbidden, shall their example proue vs forbidden to deuise as much as one lawe for the ordering of the Church? Wee might not deuise no not one, if their example did proue that our Sauiour hath vtterly forbidden all alteration of his lawes, in as much as there can be no lawe deuised, but needs it must either take away from his, or adde thereunto more or lesse, and so make some kind of alteration. But of this so large a graunt we are content not to take aduantage. Men are oftentimes in a sudden passion more liberall, then they would be if they had leysure to take aduise. And therefore so bountifull words of course and franke speeches we are contented to let passe, without turning them vnto aduantage with too much rigour. It may be they had rather be listned vnto, when they commend the Kings of Israell which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted nothing in the gouernement of the Church without the expresse word of God;<note place="margin">T.C. in the table to his second booke.</note> and when they vrge that God left nothing in his word vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 2. p. 446 <hi>If he will needs separate the worship of God from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall politie; yet as the Lord set forth the one, so he left nothing vndescribed in the other.</hi>
               </note> whether it concerned the worship of God or outward politie, nothing vnset downe, and therefore charged them strictly to keepe themselues vnto that, without any alteration. Howbeit seeing it cannot be denied, but that many thinges there did belong vnto the course of their publique affaires, wherein they had no expresse word at all to shew precisely what they should do; the difference betweene their condition and ours in these cases, will bring some light vnto the truth of this present controuersie. Before the fact of the son of <hi>Shelomith,</hi> there was no law which did appoint any certaine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for blasphemers.<note place="margin">Leuit, 24.12.</note> That wretched creature being therefore deprehended in that impiety, was held in ward, till the mind of the Lord were knowne concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his case. The like practise is also me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned vpon occasion of a breach of the Sabboth day. They find a poore silly creature gathering stickes in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Numb. 15.34.</note> they bring him vnto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the congregation, they lay him in hold, because it was not declared what should be done with him, till God hath sayd vnto <hi>Moses, This man shall dye the death.</hi> The Law required to keepe the Sabboth; but for the breach of the Sabboth what punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t should be inflicted it did not appoint. Such occasions as these are rare. And for such things as do fal scarce once in many ages of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it did suffice to take such order as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site when they fell. But if the case were such as being not already determined by law, were notwithstanding likely oftentimes to come in question, it gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of adding lawes that were not before. Thus it fell out in the case of those men polluted,<note place="margin">Numb. 9. Numb. 27.</note> and of the daughters of <hi>Zelophhad</hi>; whose causes <hi>Moses</hi> hauing brought before the Lord, receiued lawes to serue for the like in time to come. The <hi>Iewes</hi> to this end had the Oracle of God, they had the Prophets: And by such meanes God himselfe instructed them from heauen what to do, in all

things that did greatly concerne their state, and were not already set downe in the Lawe. Shall we then hereupon argue euen against our owne experience and knowledge? Shall we seeke to perswade men, that of necessity it is with vs as it was with them, that because God is ours in all respects as much as theirs, therefore either no such way of direction hath beene at any time, or if it haue bene, it doth still continue in the Church, or if the same do not continue, that yet it must be at the least supplied by some such meane as pleaseth vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of equall force? A more dutifull and religious way for vs were, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wisedome of God, which shineth in the beautifull variety of all things; but most in the manifold and yet harmonious dissimilitude of those wayes, whereby his Church vpon earth is guided from age to age throughout all generations of men.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.18.</note> The Iewes were necessarily to continue till the comming of Christ in the flesh, and the gathering of nations vnto him.<note place="margin">Gen. 48.10.</note> So much the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> did import.

               </gap>afety therefore of their very outward state and condition for so long, the after-good of the whole world, and the saluation of all did depend. Vnto their so long safety for two things it was necessary to prouide, namely the preseruation of their state against forraine resistance, and the continuance of their peace within themselues. Touching the one, as they receiued the promise of God to be the rocke of their defence, against which who so did violently rush, should but bruse and batter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; so likewise they had his commaundement in all their affaires that way, to seeke direction and counsell from him. Mens consultations are alwayes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous. And it falleth out many times that after long deliberation, those things are by their wit euen resolued on, which by tryall are found most opposite to publique safety. It is no impossible thing for states, be they neuer so well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, yet by ouersight in some one acte or treatie betweene them and their potent opposites, vtterly to cast away themselues for euer. Wherefore least it should so fall out to them, vpon whom so much did depend; they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter into warre, nor conclude any league of peace, nor to wade through any acte of moment betweene them and forraine states, vnlesse the Oracle of God or his Prophets were first consulted with. And least domesticall disturbance should wash them within themselues, because there was nothing vnto this purpose more effectuall, then if the authority of their lawes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors were such, as none might presume to take exception against it, or to shewe disobedience vnto it, without incurring the hatred &amp; detestation of al men that had any sparke of the feare of God; therefore he gaue them euen their positiue lawes from heauen, and as oft as occasion required, chose in like sort Rulers also to leade &amp; gouerne them. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding some desperatly impious there were, which adventured to try what harme it could bring vpon them, if they did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to be authors of confusion, and to resist both Gouernours and Lawes. Against such monsters God mainteined his owne by fearefull execution of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie iudgement vpon them. By which meanes it came to passe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were a people infested and mightily hated of all others through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, although by nature hard harted, querulous, wrathful &amp; impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of rest and quietnes, yet was there nothing of force either one way or other to

For euen as when the Lord would haue his fauour more appeare by temporall blessings of this life towards the people vnder the Lawe then towards vs, he gaue also politique lawes most exactly, whereby they might both most easily come into, and most stedfastly remaine in possession of those earthly benefites: euen so at this time, wherein he would not haue his fauour so much esteemed by those outward commodities, it is required, that as his care in prescribing lawes for that purpose hath somewhat fallen, in leauing them to mens consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may be deceiued; so his care for conduct and gouernement of the life to come, should (if it were possible) rise, in leauing lesse to the order of men then in times past.</hi> These are but weake and feeble disputes for the inference of that conclusion which is intended. For sauing only in such consideration as hath bene shewed, there is no cause wherefore we should thinke God more desirous to manifest his fauour by temporall blessings towards them, then towards vs. Godlinesse had vnto them, and it hath also vnto vs, the promises both of this life and the life to come. That the care of God hath fallen in earthly things, and therefore should rise as much in heauenly; that more is left vnto mens consultations in the one, and therefore lesse must be graunted in the other; that God hauing vsed a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter particularity with them then with vs for matters perteining vnto this life, is to make vs amends by the more exact deliuery of lawes for gouernment of the life to come; these are proportions, whereof if there be any rule, we must plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse that which truth is, we know it not. God which spake vnto them by his Prophets, hath vnto vs by his onely begotten Sonne; those mysteries of grace and saluation which were but darkely disclosed vnto them, haue vnto vs more cleerely shined.

But their reward is great in heauen; the crowne of righteousnes which shalbe giuen them in that day is honorable. The fruite of their industry then shall they reape with full contentment and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but not till then. Wherein the greatnes of their reward is abundantly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to counteruaile the tediousnesse of their expectation. Wherefore till then they that are in labour must rest in hope. O <hi>Timothie,</hi> keepe that which is committed vnto thy charge, that great commandement which thou hast recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued keepe, till the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ.

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be reiected, and theirs esteemed more probable which hold that the last wordes doe import perpetuall obseruation of the Apostles commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imposed necessarilly for euer vppon the militant Church of Christ; let them withall consider that then his commaundement cannot so largely bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as to comprehend whatsoeuer the Apostle did commaund <hi>Timothy.</hi> For

themselues do not all blind the Church vnto some things whereof <hi>Timothy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued charge,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.9.</note> as namely vnto that precept concerning the choise of Widowes. So as they cannot hereby maintaine, that all things positiuely commanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the affaires of the Church, were commanded for perpetuitie. And we do not deny, that certaine things were commanded to be, though positiue, yet perpetuall in the Church. They should not therefore vrge against vs places that seeme to forbid change, but rather such as set downe some measure of alteration; which measure if we haue exceeded, then might they therwith charge vs iustly: Whereas now they themselues both granting, and also vsing liberty to change, cannot in reason dispute absolutely against al change. Christ deliuered no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient or vnmeete lawes. Sundry of ours they hold inconuenient. Therefore such lawes they cannot possibly hold to be Christs. Being not his, they must of necessity graunt them added vnto his. Yet certaine of those very lawes so added, they themselues do not iudge vnlawfull; as they plainly confesse, both in matter of prescript attire, and of rites appertaining to buriall. Their owne protestations are that they plead against the inconuenience, not the vnlawfulnes of popish ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell; and against the inconuenience, not the vnlawfulnesse of Ceremonies in Buriall. Therefore they hold it a thing not vnlawfull to adde to the lawes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ;<note place="margin">T.C. l. 3. pa. 241. <hi>My reasons do neuer conclude the vnlawfulnes of these ceremonies of buriall, but the inconuenience and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diente of them.</hi> And in the Table: <hi>Of the inconuenience, not of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and so consequently they yeeld, that no lawe of Christ forbiddeth addition vnto Church laws.

               </note> to whom of all men they attribute most, whereas his words be plaine, that for Ceremonies and externall discipline the Church hath power to make lawes: the answer which herunto they make is, that indefinitly the speech is true, and that so it was meant by him, namely that some things belonging vnto externall discipline and Ceremonies, are in the power and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of the Church; but neither was it me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neither is it true generally, that al exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall discipline, &amp; all Ceremonies are left to the order of the Church, in as much as the sacraments of Baptisme &amp; the Supper of the Lord are Ceremonies, which yet the Church may not therefore abrogate. Againe, excommunication is a part of externall discipline; which might also be cast away, if all externall discipline were arbitrary, and in the choise of the Church. By which their answer it doth appeare, that touching the names of Ceremonie and externall discipline, they gladly would haue vs so vnderstood, as if we did herein conteine a great deale more then we do. The fault which we find with them is, that they ouermuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the Church of her power in these things. Whereupon they recharge vs, as if in these things we gaue the Church a liberty which hath no limits or bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; as if all things which the name of discipline co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth, were at the churches free choice, so that we might either haue Church-gouernours and gouernement or want them, either reteine or reiect Church censures as we list. They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at vs, as at men which thinke it so indifferent what the Church doth in

matter of ceremonies, that it may bee feared least we iudge the very sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselues to be held at the Churches pleasure. No, the name of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies we do not vse in so large a meaning as to bring Sacraments within the compasse and reach thereof; although things belonging vnto the outward forme and seemely administration of them, are conteined in that name, euen as we vse it. For the name of ceremonies we vse as they themselues do,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 3. p. 171.</note> when they speake after this sort: <hi>The Doctrine and Discipline of the Church, as the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest things, ought especially to be looked vnto; but the Ceremonies also, as mynt &amp; comyn, ought not to be neglected.</hi> Besides in the matter of externall discipline or regiment itselfe, wee doe not deny but there are some thinges whereto the Church is bound till the worlds ende. So as the question is onely howe farre the bounds of the Churches libertie do reach. We hold that the power which the Church hath lawfully to make lawes and orders for it selfe, doth extend vnto sundrie things of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction and such other matters, whereto their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that the Churches authoritie and power doth not reach. Whereas therefore in disputing against vs about this point, they take their compasse a great deale wider then the truth of things can afford, producing reasons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by way of generality, to proue that Christ hath set downe all things belonging any way vnto the forme of ordering his Church, and hath absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden change by addition or diminution great or small (for so their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of disputing is:) we are constrained to make our defence, by shewing that Christ hath not depriued his Church so farre of all libertie in making orders &amp; lawes for it selfe, and that they themselues do not thinke he hath so done. For are they able to shew that all particular customes, rites and orders of reformed Churches, haue bene appointed by Christ himselfe? No, they graunt that in matter of circumstance they alter that which they haue receiued;<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 27. <hi>We deny not but certaine things are left to the order of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of the nature of those which are varied by times, places, persons, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, &amp; so could not at one be set downe and established for ever.</hi>
               </note> but in things of substance they keepe the lawes of Christ without change. If we say the same in our owne behalfe, (which surely we may do with a great deale more truth) then must they cancell all that hath bene before alleaged, and beginne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a fresh, whether we reteine the lawes that Christ hath deliuered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of substance, yea or no. For our constant perswasion in this point is as theirs, that we haue no where altered the lawes of Christ, further then in such particularities onely as haue the nature of things chaungeable according to the difference of times, places, persons, and other the like circumstances. Christ hath commaunded prayers to be made, sacraments to be ministred, his Church to be carefully taught and guided. Concerning euery of these some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Christ hath commaunded which must bee kept till the worlds end. On the contrary side in euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somewhat there may be added, as the Church shall iudge it expedient. So that if they will speake to purpose, all which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath bene disputed of they must giue ouer, and stand vpon such particulars onely as they can shew we haue either added or abrogated otherwise then we ought, in the matter of Church politie. Whatsoeuer Christ hath commanded for euer to be kept in his Church, the same we take not vpon vs to abrogate; and whatsoeuer our lawes haue thereunto added besides, of such qualitie we hope it is, as no law of Christ doth any where condemne. Wherefore that all may be layd together, and gathered into a narrower roome. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. First so farre

forth as the Church is the mysticall body of Christ and his inuisible spouse, it needeth no externall politie. That very part of the law diuine which teacheth faith and workes of righteousnesse, is it selfe alone sufficient for the Church of God in that respect. But as the Church is a visible society and body politique, lawes of politie it cannot want. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Whereas therfore it commeth in the second place to be inquired, what lawes are fittest and best for the Church; they who first embraced that rigorous and strict opinion, which depriueth the Church of liberty to make any kind of law for her selfe, inclined as it should seeme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,<note place="margin">Esa. 29.14. Col. 2.22.</note> for that they imagined all things, which the Church doth without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of holy scripture, subiect to that reproofe which the scripture it self vseth in certaine cases, when diuine authority ought alone to be followed. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they thought it inough for the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celling of any kind of order whatsoeuer, to say, <hi>The word of God teacheth it not, it is a deuise of the braine of man, away with it therefore out of the Church.</hi>

Wherfore io reiect all orders of the Church which men haue established, is to thinke worse of the laws of men in this respect, then either the iudgement of wisemen alloweth, or the law of God it selfe will beare. Howbeit they which had once take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to condemn all things done in the Church, &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of God to be done, saw it was necessary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing in defence of this their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to hold that needs there must be in scripture set down a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete particular forme of Church polity, a forme prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing how al the affaires of the church must be ordered, a form in no respect law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be altered by mortal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Herupon the authors of the former opinion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19711:85"/>
were presently seconded by other wittier and better learned; who being loath that the forme of Church-politie which they sought to bring in should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then in the highest degree accounted of, tooke first an exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the difference betweene Church-politie and matters of necessitie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; secondly against the restraint of scripture, which they say receiueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie at our hands, when we teach that it teacheth not as well matters of politie as of faith and saluation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Constrained hereby we haue bene therefore, both to maintaine that distinction, as a thing not only true in it selfe, but by them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so acknowledged, though vnawares; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. and to make manifest that from scripture wee offer not to derogate the least thing that truth thereunto doth claime, in as much as by vs it is willingly confest, that the scripture of God is a storehouse abounding with inestimable treasures of wisedome and knowledge in many kindes, ouer and aboue thinges in this one kinde barely necessary; yea euen that matters of Ecclesiasticall politie are not therein omitted, but taught also, albeit not so taught as those other thinges before mentioned. For so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly are those thinges taught, that nothing can euer need to be added, nothing euer cease to be necessary: these on the contrarie side, as being of a farre other nature and qualitie, not so strictly nor euerlastingly commaunded in scripture, but that vnto the complete forme of Church-politie much may bee requisite which the scripture teacheth not, and much which it hath taught, become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite, sometime because we neede not vse it, sometime also because wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. In which respect for mine owne part, although I see that certaine reformed Churches, the Scottish especially and French, haue not that which best agreeth with the sacred scripture, I meane the gouernment that is by Bishops, in as much as both those churches are fallen vnder a different kinde of regiment, which to remedie it is for the one altogether too late, and too soone for the other during their present affliction and trouble; this their defect and imperfection I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lament in such case then exagitate, considering that men oftentimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of their owne, may be driuen to want that kinde of politie or regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is best, and to content themselues with that, which either the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable error of former times, or the necessitie of the present hath cast vpon them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Now because that position first mentioned, which holdeth it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that all thinges which the Church may lawfully doe in her owne regiment be commaunded in holy scripture, hath by the latter defendors thereof beene greatly qualified; who, though perceiuing it to be ouer extreame, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing loth to acknowledge any ouersight therein, and therefore labour what they may to salue it by construction; we haue for the more perspicuitie deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what was thereby meant at the first; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. how iniurious a thing it were vnto all the Churches of God for men to hold it in that meaning; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect their interpretations are who so much labour to helpe it, eyther by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding commaundements of scripture into two kindes, and so defending that all thinges must be commaunded, if not in speciall, yet in generall precepts; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. or by taking it as meant that in case the Church doe deuise any new order, shee ought therein to follow the direction of scripture onely, and not any starlight of mans reason. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 9. Bothe which euasions being cut off, wee haue in the next place declared after what sort the Church may lawfully frame to her selfe lawes of politie, and in what reckoning such positiue lawes both are with God, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19711:86"/>
should be with men. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 10. Furthermore because to abridge the libertie of the Church in this behalfe, it hath bene made a thing very odious, that when God himselfe hath deuised some certaine lawes and committed them to sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, man by abrogation, addition, or any way, should presume to alter and change them; it was of necessitie to be examined, whether the authoritie of God in making, or his care in committing those his lawes vnto scripture, be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments to proue that God doth in no case allow they should suffer any such kind of change. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 11. The last refuge for proofe that diuine lawes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church-politie may not be altered, by extinguishment of any olde or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new in that kinde, is partly a marueilous strange discourse, that Christ (vnlesse he would show himselfe not so faithfull as Moses, or not <note n="a" place="margin">Nisi reip. suae statum omne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> constituerit, magistratus ordinarit, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tém<expan>

I might haue added hereunto their more familiar and popular disputes; as, The Church is a Citie, yea the Citie of the great king, and the life of a Citie is politie: The Church is the house of the liuing God, and what house can there be, without some order for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of it? In the royall house of a Prince there must be officers for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, such as not any seruant in the house, but the Prince whose the house is shall iudge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient: So the house of God must haue orders for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, such as not any of the household, but God himselfe hath appointed. It cannot stand with the loue and wisedome of God, to leaue such order vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as is necessary for the due gouernment of his Church. The numbers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, orders, and attire of Salomons seruants did shewe his wisedome: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he which is greater then Salomon, hath not failed to leaue in his house such orders for gouernment thereof, as may serue to be as a looking glasse for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, care, and wisedome to be seene in. That little sparke of the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which remaineth in vs, may serue vs for the affaires of this life. <q>But as in all
other matters concerning the kingdome of heauen, so principally in this which concerneth the very gouernment of that kingdome, needfull it is wee should be taught of God. As long as men are perswaded of any order that it is only of men, they presume of their owne vnderstanding, and they thinke to deuise an other not only as good, but better then that which they haue receiued. By seueritie of punishment, this presumption and curiositie may be restrained. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke such chearefull obedience as is yeelded, where the conscience hath respect to God as the author of lawes and orders. This was it which countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the laws of Moses, made concerning outward politie for the administration of holy things. The like some law giuers of the Heathens did pretend, but falsely; yet wisely discerning the vse of this perswasion. For the better obedience sake therfore it was expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that God should be author of the politie of his church.</q>
But to what issue doth all this come? A man would thinke that they which hold out with such discourses, were of nothing more fully perswaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, that the scripture hath set downe a complete forme of Church-politie, vniuersall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, altogether vnchangeable. For so it would follow if the premises were sound and strong to such effect as is pretended. Notwithstanding they which haue thus formally maintained argument in defence of the first ouersight, are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19711:86"/>
by the very euidence of truth themselues constrained to make this in effect their conclusion, that the Scripture of God hath many thinges concerning Church-politie; that of those many some are of greater waight, some of lesse; that what hath beene vrged as touching immutabilitie of lawes, it extendeth in truth no further then onely to lawes wherein thinges of greater moment are prescribed. Now those things of greater moment, what are they? Forsooth, <hi>Doctors,</hi>

In which resolution if they will firmely and constantly persist, I see not but that concerning the points which hitherto haue beene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of, they must agree that they haue molested the Church with needelesse opposition; and henceforward as we said before betake themselues wholly vnto the triall of particulars, whether euery of those thinges which they esteeme as principall, be eyther so esteemed of, or at all established for perpetuitie in holy scripture; and whether any particular thing in our Church-politie bee receiued other then the scripture alloweth of, eyther in greater thinges or in smaller. The matters wherein Church-politie is conuersant, are the publique religious duties of the Church, as the administration of the word and sacraments, prayers, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall censures and the like. To these the Church standeth alwayes bound. Lawes of politie are laws which appoint in what maner these duties shal be performed. In performance whereof because all that are of the Church cannot ioyntly and equally worke, the first thing in politie required, is a difference of persons in the Church, without which difference those functions cannot in orderly sort bee executed. Hereupon we hold, that Gods clergie are a state which hath bene and will be, as long as there is a Church vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, necessarie by the plaine word of God himselfe; a state whereunto the rest of Gods people must be subiect as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching things that appertaine to their soules health. For where politie is, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but appoint some to be leaders of others, and some to be led by others.<note place="margin">Luc. 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Againe, for as much as where the clergie are any great multitude, order doth necessarily require that by degrees they be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; wee holde there haue euer bene and euer ought to be in such case, at least wise two sorts of Ecclesiasticall persons, the one subordinate vnto the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the Apostles in the beginning, and to the Bishops alwaies since, wee finde plainely both in scripture and in all Ecclesiasticall records, other ministers of the word and sacraments haue bene. Moreouer it cannot enter into any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt to thinke it lawfull, that euery man which listeth should take vpon him charge in the Church; and therefore a solemne admittance is of such necessitie, that without it there can be no church-politie. A number of particularities there
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19711:87"/>
are, which make for the more conuenient being of these principall &amp; perpetuall parts in Ecclesiasticall politie, but yet are not of such constant vse and necessitie in Gods Church. Of this kind are times and places appointed for the exercise of religion; specialties belonging to the publike solemnitie of the word, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and praier; the enlargement or abridgement of functions ministeriall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon those two principall before mentioned; to conclude, euen what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doth by way of formalitie &amp; circumstance concerne any publique action of the Church. Now although that which the scripture hath of thinges in the former kind be for euer permanent; yet in the later both much of that which the scripture teacheth is not alwaies needfull; and much the Church of God shall alwaies neede which the scripture teacheth not. So as the forme of politie by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> set downe for perpetuitie, is three waies faultie. Faultie in omitting some things which in scripture are of that nature, as namely the difference that ought to bee of Pastors when they grow to any great multitude; faultie in requiring Doctors, Deacons, Widowes, and such like; as thinges of perpetuall necessitie by the law of God, which in truth are nothing lesse; faultie also in vrging some thinges by scripture immutable, as their Layelders, which the scripture neither maketh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, nor at all teacheth, for any thing either we can as yet find, or they haue hitherto beene able to proue. But hereof more in the bookes that followe. As for those maruellous discourses, wherby they aduenture to argue that God must needs haue done the thing which they imagine was to be done; I must confesse I haue often wondred at their exceeding boldnesse herein. When the question is whether God haue deliuered in scripture (as they affirme he hath) a complet particular immutable forme of Church-politie; why take they that other both presumptuous and superfluous labour, to proue he should haue done it; there being no way in this case to proue the deede of God, sauing only by producing that euidence wherein he hath done it? But if there be no such thing apparent vpon record, they do as if one should demaund a legacie by force and vertue of some written testament, wherein there being no such thing specified, hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that there it must needes be, and bringeth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from the loue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will which alwaies the testatour bore him, imagining that these or the like proofes will conuict a testament to haue that in it, which other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can no where by reading find. In matters which concerne the actions of God, the most dutiful way on our part is to search what God hath done, and with meeknes to admire that, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dispute what he in congruitie of reason ought to do. The waies which he hath whereby to do all things for the greatest good of his Church, are mo in number the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we can search, other in nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we should presume to determine which of many should be the fittest for him to choose, till such time as we see he hath chosen of many some one; which one wee then may boldly conclude to be the fittest, because he hath taken it before the rest. When we doe otherwise, surely we exceede our bounds, who and where we are we forget; and therefore needfull it is that our pride in such cases be controld, and our disputes beaten backe with those demands of the blessed Apostle. <hi>How vnsearchable are his iudgements,</hi>

The sifting of that which is obiected against the orders of the church in particular, doth not belong vnto this place. Here we are to discusse onely those generall exceptions, which haue bene taken at any time against them. First therfore to the end that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vse whereunto they serue may plainely appeare, and so afterwardes their qualitie the better be discerned; we are to note that in euery grand or main publique dutie which God requireth at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of his Church, there is, besides that matter and forme wherein the essence therof consisteth, a certaine outward fashion whereby the same is in decent sort administred. The substance of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions is deliuered from God himself in few words. For example sake in the sacraments, <hi>Vnto the element let the word be added, and they both doe make a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> saith S. Augustine. Baptisme is giuen by the element of water, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script forme of words which the church of Christ doth vse; the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ is administred in the elements of bread and wine, if those mysticall words be added thereunto. But the due and decent forme of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring those holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, doth require a great deale more. The end which is aimed at in setting downe the outward forme of all religious actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church. Now men are edified, when either their vnderstanding is taught somewhat whereof in such actions it behoueth all men to consider; or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their harts are moued with any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suteable therunto, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their minds are in any sort stirred vp vnto that reuerence, deuotion, attention &amp; due regard, which in those cases seemeth requisit. Because therfore vnto this purpose not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speech, but sundry se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible means besides haue alwaies bin thought necessary, &amp; especially those means which being obiect to the eye, the liueliest &amp; the most apprehensiue sense of all other, haue in that respect seemed the fittest to make a deepe and strong impression; from hence haue risen not onely a number of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, readings, questionings, exhortings, but euen of visible signes also; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vsed in performance of holy actions, are vndoubtedly most effectual to open such matter, as men when they know &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber carefully, must needs be a great deale the better informed to what effect such duties serue. We must not thinke but that there is some ground of reason euen in nature, whereby it commeth to passe, that no nation vnder heauen either doth or euer did suffer publique actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are of waight, whether they be ciuil and temporall, or else spirituall and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, to passe without some visible solemnitie; the very strangenes whereof and difference from that which is common, doth cause popular eyes to obserue and to marke the same. Wordes both because they are common, and doe not so strongly moue the phancie of man, are for the most parte but sleightly

The things which so long experience of all ages hath confirmed and made profitable, let not vs presume to condemne as follies and toyes, because wee sometimes know not the cause and reason of them. A wit disposed to scorne whatsoeuer it doth not conceiue, might aske wherefore <hi>Abraham</hi> should say to his seruant, <hi>Put thy hand vnder my thigh and sweare:</hi> was it not sufficient for his seruant to shew the Religion of an othe,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.2.</note> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Lord God of heauen and earth, vnlesse that straunge ceremonie were added?

               </note> that those thinges which the whole Church of Christ doth hold, may well be thought to bee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall, although they be not found written; this his iudgement they vtterly condemne. I will not here stand in defence of S. Augustines opinion, which is that such thinges are indeede Apostolicall; but yet with this exception, vnlesse the decree of some generall councell haue happily caused them to be receiued: for of positiue lawes and orders receiued throughout the whole Christian world, S. Augustine could imagine no other fountaine saue these two. But to let passe S. Augustine, they who condemne him herein, must needs confesse it a very vncertaine thing what the orders of the Church were in the Apostles times, seeing the scriptures doe not mention them all,<note place="margin">Vid. Epist. 118</note> and other records thereof besides they vtterly reiect. So that in tying the Church to the orders of the Apostles times, they tie it to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous vncertain rule; vnlesse they require the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of no orders but only those which are knowne to be Apostolicall by the Apostles owne writings. But then is not this their rule of such sufficiencie, that we should vse it as a touchstone
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19711:89"/>
to trie the orders of the Church by for euer. Our ende ought alwaies to bee the same; our waies and meanes thereunto not so. The glory of God and the good of his Church was the thing which the Apostles aymed at, and therefore ought to bee the marke whereat we also leuell. But seeing those rites and orders may be at one time more, which at an other are lesse auaileable vnto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: what reason is there in these thinges to vrge the state of one onely age, as a patterne for all to followe? It is not I am right sure their meaning, that we should now assemble our people to serue God in close &amp; secret meetings; or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brookes or riuers should be vsed for places of baptisme; or that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist should be ministred after meate; or that the custome of Church feasting should bee renued; or that all kinde of standing prouision for the ministrie should be vtterly taken away, and their estate made againe dependent vpon the voluntary deuotion of men. In these thinges they easily perceiue how vnfit that were for the present, which was for the first age conuenient enough. The faith zeale &amp; godlines of former times is worthily had in honour: but doth this proue that the orders of the Church of Christ must bee still the selfesame with theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that nothing may be which was not then, or that nothing which then was may lawfully since haue ceased? They who recall the Church vnto that which was at the first, must necessarily set boundes and limits vnto their speeches. If any thing haue bene receiued repugnant vnto that which was first deliuered, the first things in this case must stand, the last giue place vnto them. But where difference is without repugnancie, that which hath bene can be no preiudice to that which is. Let the state of the people of God when they were in the house of bondage, and their maner of seruing God in a strange land, be compared with that which Canaan and Ierusalem did afford, and who seeth not what huge difference there was betweene them? In Aegypt it may be they were right glad to take some corner of a poore cottage, &amp; there to serue God vpon their knees, peraduenture couered in dust and strawe sometimes. Neither were they therefore the lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God; but he was with them in all their afflictions, and at the length by working their admirable deliuerance, did testifie that they serued him not in vaine. Notwithstanding in the very desert they are no sooner possest of some little thing of their owne, but a tabernacle is required at their handes. Beeing planted in the land of Canaan, and hauing Dauid to be their King, when the Lord had giuen him rest from all his enemies, it greeued his religious minde to consider the growth of his owne estate and dignitie, the affaires of religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing still in the former manner: <hi>Beholde now I dwell in an house of Cedar trees,</hi>

For on our part this must be the aunswere, which orderly proceeding doth require. The burthen of prouing doth rest on them. In them it is friuolous to say, we ought not to vse bad ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and presume all such bad as it pleaseth themselues to dislike; vnlesse we can perswade them the contrary.

And therefore the cause which they yeeld, why they hold it lawfull to reteine in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and in <hi>Discipline</hi> some things as good, which yet are common to the Church of Rome, is for that those good things are perpetual commandements, in whose place no other can come; but ceremonies are changeable.

For the affirmatiue whereof we are now to answer such proofes of theirs as haue bene before alleaged.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Let the Church of Rome be what it will,<note place="margin">That our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the customes of our fathers to be followed, is no proofe that we may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes which the Church of Rome hath, although we do not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of them as of our fathers.</note> let them that are of it be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and our fathers in the Christian faith, or let them be otherwise, hold them for Catholiques, or hold them for heretiques, it is not a thing either one way or other in this present question greatly material. Our conformity with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such things as haue bene proposed, is not proued as yet vnlawfull by all this S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath said, yea and we haue allowed his saying; <hi>That the custome of the people of God, and the decrees of our forefathers are to be kept, touching those things wherof the scripture hath neither one way nor other giuen vs any charge.</hi> What then? Doth it here therfore follow, that they being neither the people of God nor our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are for that cause in nothing to be followed? This consequent were good, if so be it were graunted, that onely the custome of the people of God &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of our forefathers are in such case to be obserued. But then should no other kind of later laws in the church be good, which were a grosse absurdity to think. <hi>S. Augustines</hi> speech therefore doth import, that where we haue no diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, if yet we haue the custome of the people of God, or a decree of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; this is a law and must be kept. Notwithstanding it is not denied, but that we lawfully may obserue the positiue constitutions of our owne Churches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the same were but yesterday made by our selues alone. Nor is there any thing in this to proue, that the Church of England might not by law receiue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, rites or customes from the Church of Rome, although they were neither the people of God nor yet our forefathers. How much lesse when we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from them nothing, but that which they did themselues receiue from such, as we cannot deny to haue bene the people of God, yea such as either we must acknowledge for our owne forefathers, or else disdaine the race of Christ?</p>
            <p n="6">6 The rites and orders wherein we follow the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">That the course which the wisedome of God doth teach, maketh not against our conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the Church of Rome in such things.</note> are of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such as the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> it selfe doth follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in. We follow the church of Rome in moe things; yet they in some things of the same nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which our present controuersie is: so that the difference is not in the kind, but in the number of rites only, wherein they and we do follow the Church of Rome. The vse of wafer-cakes, the custom of godfathers &amp; godmothers in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, are things not commanded nor forbidden in scripture; things which haue bene of old, &amp; are reteined in the Church of Rome euen at this very hower. Is conformity with Rome in such things a blemish vnto the Church of England, &amp; vnto Churches abroad an ornament? Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if not for the reuerence they ow vnto this Church, in the bowels wherof they haue receiued I trust that pretious and blessed vigor, which shall quicken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eternall life; yet at the leastwise for the singular affection which they do beare towards others, take heed how they strike, least they wound whom they would not.

Thus in shauing, cutting, apparell wearing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.27. Leuit. 19.19.</note> 
               <hi>yea in sundry kinds of meates also, swines flesh, conies, and such like, they were forbidden to do so and so, because the Gentiles did so. And the end why God forbad them such things was,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 22.11. Deut. 14.7. &amp; Leuit. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to seuer them for feare of infection by a great and an high wall from other nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>as S. Paul teacheth.</hi> The cause of more carefull separation from the neerest nations, was the greatnesse of danger to be especially by them infected. Now Papists are to vs as those nations were vnto Israell. Therefore if the wisdome of God be our guide, we cannot allow conformity with them, no not in any such indifferent ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Our direct answer hereunto is, that for any thing here alleaged we may still doubt, whether the Lord in all such indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ceremonies as those whereof we dispute, did frame his people of set purpose vnto any vtter dissimilitude, either with Aegyptians, or with any other nation else. And if God did not forbid them all such indifferent ceremonies; then our conformity with the Church of Rome in some such is not hitherto as yet disproued, although Papists were vnto vs as those heathens were vnto Israell. <hi>After the doings of the land of Aegypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 18.3.</note> 
               <hi>wherein you dwelt, ye shall not do, saith the Lord; and after the maner of the land of Canaan, whether I will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walke in their ordinances: Do after my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepe my ordinances to walke therein: I am the Lord your God.</hi> The speech is indefinite, <hi>ye shall not be like them</hi>: It is not generall, <hi>ye shall not be like them in any thing, or like vnto them in any thing indifferent, or like vnto them in any indifferent ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of theirs.</hi> Seeing therefore it is not set downe how farre the bounds of his speech concerning dissimilitude should reach; how can any man assure vs, that it exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth farder then to those things only, wherin the nations there mentioned were idolatrous, or did against that which the law of God commandeth? Nay doth it not seem a thing very probable, that God doth purposely adde, <hi>Do after my iudgements</hi>; as giuing therby to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that his meaning in the former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was but to bar similitude in such things, as were repugnant vnto the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, lawes and statutes which he had giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aegyptians and Cananites are for example sake named vnto them, because the customes of the one they had bin, and of the other they should be best acquainted with. But that wherein they might not be like vnto either of them, was such peraduenture as had beene no whit lesse vnlawfull, although those nations had neuer bene. So that there is no necessitie to thinke, that God for feare of infection by reason of neernes forbad them to be like to the Cananites or the Aegyptians, in those things which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had bene lawfull enough. For I would know what one thing was in those nations, and is here forbidden, being indifferent in it self, yet forbidden onely because they vsed it. In the laws of Israel we find it written,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.27.</note> 
               <hi>ye shal not cut round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou teare the tufts of thy beard.</hi> These things were vsuall amongst those nations, &amp; in themselues they are indifferent. But are they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19711:93"/>
indifferent being vsed as signes of immoderate and hopeles lamentation for the dead? In this sense it is that the law forbiddeth them. For which cause the very next words following are,<note place="margin">Leuit. 21.5.</note> 
               <hi>ye shal not cut your flesh for the dead, nor make any print of a marke vpon you; I am the Lord.</hi> The like in Leuiticus, where speech is of mourning for the dead,<note place="margin">Deut. 14.1.</note> 
               <hi>They shal not make bald parts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their head, nor shaue off the locks of their beard, nor make any cutting in their flesh.</hi> Againe in Deuteronomy, <hi>ye are the children of the Lord your God; ye shal not cut your selues, nor make you baldnes betweene your eyes for the dead.</hi> What is this but in effect the same which the Apostle doth more plainly expresse,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4.13.</note> saying, <hi>Sorrow not as they do which haue no hope?</hi> The very light of nature it selfe was able to see herein a fault; that which those nations did vse, hauing bin also in vse with others, the ancient Romane laws do forbid. That shauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and cutting which the law doth mention, was not a matter in it selfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and forbidden onely because it was in vse amongst such idolaters as were neighbours to the people of God; but to vse it had bin a crime, though no other people or nation vnder heauen should haue done it sauing only themselues. As for those laws concerning attire,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.19.</note> 
               <hi>There shall no garment of linnen &amp; wollen come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee</hi>;<note place="margin">Deut. 22.11.</note> as also those touching food and diet, wherein <hi>swines flesh</hi> together with sundry other meates are forbidden; the vse of these things had bene indeed of it selfe harmelesse and indifferent: so that hereby it doth appeare, how the law of God forbad in some speciall consideration, such things as were lawful inough in themselues.<note place="margin">Deut. 14.7.</note> But yet euen here they likewise faile of that they intend. For it doth not appeare,<note place="margin">Leuit. 11.</note> that the consideration in regard whereof the law forbiddeth these things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was because those nations did vse them. Likely enough it is that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites vsed to feed as well on sheepes as on swines flesh; &amp; therefore if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of the later had no other reason the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dissimilitude with that people, they which of their own heads alleage this for reason,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.19.</note> can shew I think some reason more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are able to find, why the former was not also forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Might there not be some other mystery in this prohibition then they think of? Yes, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mystery there was in it by all likelihood. For what reason is there which should but induce,<note place="margin">Deut. 14. Leuit. 11.</note> and therefore much lesse enforce vs to thinke, that care of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude betweene the people of God &amp; the heathen nations about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was any more the cause of forbidding them to put on garments of sundry stuffe, then of charging them withall not to sow their fields with mesline; or that this was any more the cause of forbidding them to eate swines flesh, then of charging them withall not to eate the flesh of Eagles, Haukes, and the like? Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church of Rome were to vs, as to Israell the Aegyptians and Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were of old;<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> yet doth it not follow, that the wisedome of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect doth teach vs to erect betweene vs and them a partition wall of difference, in such things indifferent as haue bene hitherto disputed of.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Neither is the example of the eldest Churches a whit more auaileable to this purpose.<note place="margin">That the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To haue bene in either directed by a weake and vnperfect rule, argueth imbecillity and imperfection. Men being either led by reason, or by imitation of other mens example; if their persons be odious whose example we choose to follow, as namely if we frame our opinions to that which condemned heretiques thinke, or direct our actions according to that which is practised and done by them; it lieth as an heauy preiudice against vs, vnlesse somewhat mightier then their bare example, did moue vs to thinke or do the same things with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

conforming rather our selues in that respect to <hi>Turkes,</hi> we should be spreaders of a worse infection into others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then any we are likely to draw from Papists by our conformity with them in ceremonies. If they did hate as <hi>Turkes</hi> do, the Christians; or as Cananites of old did the Iewish religion euen in grosse; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of locall neernes in them vnto vs, might happily enforce in vs a duty of greater separation from them, then from those other mentioned. But for as much as Papists are so much in Christ neerer vnto vs then <hi>Turkes,</hi> is there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man trow you, but will iudge it meeter that our ceremonies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion should be Popish then Turkish or Heathenish? Especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that we were not brought to dwell amongst them (as Israell in Canaan) hauing not bene of them. For euen a very part of them we were. And when God did by his good Spirit put it into our hearts, first to reforme our selues, (whence grew our separation) and then by all good meanes to seeke also their reformation; had we not onely cut off their corruptions, but also estranged our selues from them in things indifferent; who seeth not how greatly preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall this might haue bene to so good a cause, and what occasion it had giuen them to thinke (to their greater obduration in euill) that through a froward or wanton desire of innouation, wee did vnconstrainedly those thinges, for which conscience was pretended? Howsoeuer the case doth stand, as Iuda had beene rather to choose conformity in things indifferent with Israell when they were neerest opposites, then with the farthest remoued Pagans: So we in like case, much rather with Papists then with Turkes. I might adde further for more full and complete answere, so much concerning the large oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the case of the eldest Churches in regard of those Heathens, and ours in respect of the Church of Rome, that very cauillation it selfe should be satisfied, and haue no shift to flye vnto.</p>

The first thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in skilfull cures, is the knowledge of the part affected; the next is of the euill which do affect it; the last is not onely of the kind, but also of the measure of contrary things whereby to remoue it. They which measure religion by dislike of the Church of Rome, thinke euery man so much the more sound; by how much he can make the corruptions thereof to seeme more large. And therefore some there are, namely the Arrians in reformed Churches of Poland,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19711:95"/>
which imagine the cancre to haue eaten so far into the very bones and marrow of the Church of Rome, as if it had not so much as a sound beliefe, no not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God himselfe, but that the very beliefe of the Trinity were a part of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian corruption; and that the wonderfull prouidence of God did bring to passe, that the Bishop of the Sea of Rome should be famous for his triple crowne; a sensible marke whereby the world might know him to be that mysticall beast spoken of in the Reuelation, to be that great and notorious Antichrist in no one respect so much, as in this that he maintaineth the doctrine of the Trinity. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therefore and skill is requisite to knowe, what parts are sound in that Church, and what corrupted. Neither is it to all men apparant which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of vnsound parts, with what kind of vnsoundnesse euery such part is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed. They can say that in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in <hi>Discipline,</hi> in <hi>Prayers,</hi> in <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the Church of Rome hath (as it hath in deede) very foule and grosse corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the nature whereof notwithstanding because they haue not for the most part exact skill and knowledge to discerne, they thinke that amisse many times which is not, and the salue of reformation they mightily call for; but where and what the sores are which need it, as they wote full little, so they thinke it not greatly materiall to search. Such mens contentment must be wrought by strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme: the vsuall methode of art is not for them. But with those that professe more then ordinary &amp; common knowledge of good from euill, with them that are able to put a difference betweene things naught, &amp; things indifferent in the Church of Rome, we are yet at controuersie about the maner of remouing that which is naught: whether it may not be perfectly helpt, vnlesse that also which is indifferent be cut off with it, so farre till no rite or ceremony remaine which the Church of Rome hath, being not found in the word of God.

But how can these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parisons stand them in any steed? When they vrge vs to extreme opposition against the Church of Rome, do they meane we should be drawne vnto it onely for a time, and afterwards returne to a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity? or was it the purpose of those reformed churches, which vtterly abolished all popish ceremonies, to come in the end back againe to the middle point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uennesse and moderation? Then haue we conceiued amisse of their meaning. For we haue alwaies thought their opinion to be, that vtter inconformity with the Church of Rome was not an extremity wherunto we should be drawne for a time, but the very mediocrity it selfe wherein they meant we should euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Now by these comparisons it seemeth cleane contrarie, that howsoeuer they haue bent themselues at first to an extreme contrariety against the Romish Church, yet therin they wil continue no longer then only till such time as some more moderate course for establishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church may be concluded. Yea, albeit this were not at the first their intent, yet surely now there is great cause to

leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it. They haue seene that experience of the former policie, which may cause the authors of it to hang downe their heads.

But processe of time hath brought more light vnto the world; whereby men perceiuing that they of the religion in France haue also reteined some orders which were before in the Church of Rome, and are not commaunded in the word of God; there hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen a sect in England, which following still the very selfe same rule of policie, seeketh to reforme euen the French reformation, and purge out from thence also dregs of Popery.

If the Church of Rome do vse any such kind of silly exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is no such ougly thing to the eare, that we should thinke the honour and credite of our religion to receiue thereby any great wound. They which hereof make so perilous a matter, do seeme to imagine, that we haue erected of late a frame of some new religion; the furniture whereof we should not haue borrowed from our enemies, least they relieuing vs might afterwards laugh and gibe at our pouerty: whereas in truth the Ceremonies which we haue taken from such as were before vs, are not things that belong to this or to that sect, but they are the auncient rites and customes of the Church of Christ; whereof our selues being a part, we haue the selfe same interest in them which our fathers before vs had, from whom the same are descended vnto vs. Againe in case we had bene so much beholding priuately vnto them, doth the reputation of one Church stand by saying vnto another, <hi>I need thee not?</hi> If some should be so vrine and impotent, as to marre a benefite with reprochfull vpbraiding, where at the least they suppose themselues to haue bestowed some good turne; yet surely a wise bodies part it were not, to put out his fire, because his fond and foolish neighbour, from whom he borrowed peraduenture wherewith to kindle it, might happily cast him therewith in the teeth, saying, were it not for me thou wouldest freeze, and not be able to heate thy selfe. As for that other argument deriued from the secret affection of Papists, with whom our conformitie in certaine Ceremonies is sayd to put them in great hope,

No man which is not exceeding parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all can well deny, but that there is most iust cause wherefore we should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended greatly at the Church of Rome.

We haue most heartily to thanke God therefore, that they amongst vs to whom the first consultations of causes of this kind fell, were men which aiming at another marke, namely the glorie of God and the good of this his Church, tooke that which they iudged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto necessary, not reiecting any good or conuenient thing, onely because the Church of Rome might perhaps like it. If we haue that which is meere and right, although they be glad, we are not to enuie them this their solace; we do not thinke it a duty of ours, to be in euery such thing their tormentors. And whereas it is said,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 3. p. 179. <hi>Thus they conceiuing hope of hauing the rest of their poperie in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it causeth them to be more frozen in their wickednesse, &amp;c.

               </note> that Popery for want of this vtter extirpation hath in some places taken roote and florished againe, but hath not beene able to reestablish it selfe in any place, after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision made against it by vtter euacuation of all Romish ceremonies; and therefore as long as we hold any thing like vnto them, we put them in some more hope, then if all were taken away; as we deny not but this may be true, so being of two euils to chuse the lesse, we hold it better, that the friends and fauorers of the Church of Rome, should be in some kind of hope to haue a corrupt religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, then both we and they conceiue iust feare, least vnder colour of rooting out Popery, the most effectuall meanes to beare vp the state of religion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, and so a way made either for Paganisme, or for extreme barba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ritie to enter. If desire of weakening the hope of others should turne vs away from the course we haue taken; how much more the care of preuenting our owne feare withhold vs from that wee are vrged vnto? Especially seeing that our owne feare we knowe, but wee are not so certaine what hope the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19711:96"/>
rites and orders of our Church haue bred in the hearts of others. For it is no sufficient argument thereof to say, that in maintaining and vrging these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies none are so clamorous as Papists, and they whom Papists suborne; this speech being more hard to iustifie then the former, and so their proofe more doubtfull then the thing it selfe which they proue. He that were certaine that this is true, must haue marked who they be that speake for Ceremonies; he must haue noted who amongst them doth speake oftnest, or is most earnest; he must haue bene both acquainted throughly with the religion of such, and also priuy what conferences or compacts are passed in secret betweene them and others; which kinds of notice are not wont to be vulgar and common. Yet they which alleage this, would haue it taken as a thing that needeth no proofe, a thing which all men know and see. And if so be it were graunted them as true, what gaine they by it? Sundry of them that be Popish are eger in maintenance of Ceremonies. Is it so strange a matter to find a good thing furthered by ill men of a sinister intent and purpose, whose forwardnesse is not therefore a bridle to such as fauour the same cause with a better and sincerer meaning? They that seeke, as they say, the remouing of all Popish orders out of the Church, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the state of Bishop in the number of those orders, do (I doubt not) presume that the cause which they prosecute is holy. Notwithstanding it is their owne ingenuous acknowledgement, that euen this very cause which they terme so often by an excellency, <hi>The Lords cause, is gratissima, most acceptable vnto some which hope for pray and spoile by it, and that our age hath store of such,</hi>

For if the maintenance of Ceremonies be a corrosiue to such as oppugne them; vndoubtedly to such as mainteine them, it can be no great pleasure, when they behold how that which they reuerence is oppugned. And therefore they that iudge themselues Martyrs when they are grieued, should thinke withall what they are when they grieue.

               <hi>Behold we haue done our endeuour to cure</hi> the diseases of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but she through her wilfulnesse doth rest vncured: let them consider into what straights the Church might driue it selfe, in being guided by this their counsell. Their axiome is, that the sound beleeuing Church of Iesus Christ, may not be like Hereticall Churches in any of those indifferent things, which men make choyce of, and do not take by prescript appointment of the word of God. In the word of God the vse of bread is prescribed, as a thing without which the Eucharist may not be celebrated: but as for the kind of bread, it is not denied to be a thing indifferent. Being indifferent of it selfe, we are by this axiome of theirs to auoide the vse of vnleauened bread in their Sacrament, because such bread the Church of Rome beeing Hereticall vseth. But doth not the selfe same axiome barre vs euen from leauened bread also, which the Church of the Grecians vseth; the opinions whereof are in a number of things the same, for which we condemne the Church of Rome; and in some
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19711:97"/>
things erroneous, where the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is acknowledged to be sound; as namely in the Article proceeding of the holy Ghost? And least here they should say that because the Greeke Church is farther off, &amp; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> nearer, we are in that respect rather to vse that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vseth not; let them imagine a reformed Church in the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> where a Greeke Church and a Popish both are. And when both these are equally neare, let them consider what the third shall doe. Without eyther leauened or vnleauened bread, it can haue no sacrament: the word of God doth tye it to neither; and their axiome doth exclude it from both. If this constraine them, as it must, to grant that their axiome is not to take any place, saue in those things only where the Church hath larger scope; it resteth that they search out some stronger reason then they haue as yet alleaged; otherwise they constraine not vs to thinke that the Church is tyed vnto any such rule or axiome, no not then when she hath the widest field to walke in, and the greatest store of choice.</p>

And a little after he saith, that it is most absurd and against reason, that the Iewes should vaunt and glory that the Christians could not keepe those thinges without their doctrine.</hi>

               <hi>And in an other place it is said after this sort; It is conuenient so to order the matter, that we haue nothing common with that nation.

One cause is that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were the deadliest and spitefullest enemies of Christianitie that were in the world, and in this respect
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19711:98"/>
their orders so farre forth to be shunned, as we haue already set downe in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the matter of heathenish Ceremonies. For no enemies being so venemous against Christ as Iewes, they were of all other most odious, and by that meane least to be vsed as fit Church paternes for imitation. An other cause is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne abrogation of the Iewes ordinances; which ordinances for vs to resume, were to checke our Lord himselfe which hath disanulled them. But how farre this second cause doth extend, it is not on all sides fully agreed vpon. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching those thinges whereunto it reacheth not, although there be small cause wherefore the Church should frame it selfe to the Iewes example, in respect of their persons which are most hatefull; yet God himselfe hauing bene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their lawes, herein they are (notwithstanding the former consideration) still worthy to be honoured, and to be followed aboue others, as much as the state of things will beare. Iewish ordinances had some things naturall, and of the perpetuitie of those things no man doubteth. That which was positiue, wee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise knowe to haue bene by the comming of Christ partly necessary not to bee kept, and partly indifferent to be kept or not. Of the former kinde Circumcision and sacrifice were. For this point <hi>Stephen</hi> was accused; and the euidence which his accusers brought against him in iudgement was, <hi>This man ceaseth not to speake blasphemous words against this holy place and the lawe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 6.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>for we haue heard him say that this Iesus of Nazaret shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances that Moses gaue vs.</hi> True it is that this doctrine was then taught, which vnbeleeuers condemning for blasphemie, did therein commit that which they did condemne. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles notwithstanding from whom <hi>Stephen</hi> had receiued it, did not so teach the abrogation, no not of those things which were necessarily to cease, but that euen the Iewes being Christian might for a time continue in them.

The Christian Iewes did thinke at the first not onely themselues, but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gentiles also bound, and that necessarily, to obserue the whole lawe. There went forth certaine of the sect of Pharises which did beleeue, and they comming vnto <hi>Antioch,</hi> taught that it was necessary for the Gentiles to be circumcised, and to keepe the lawe of <hi>Moses.</hi> Whereupon there grew dissention, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> disputing against them. The determination of the Councell held at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> concerning this matter was finally this,<note place="margin">Act. 21.25.</note> 
               <hi>Touching the Gentils which beleeue, we haue written &amp; determined that they obserue no such thing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15.24.</note> Their protestation by letters is, <hi>For as much as we haue heard that certain which departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs haue troubled you with words, and combred your minds, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keepe the lawe; knowe that we gaue them no such commandement. Paule</hi> therefore continued still teaching the Gentiles, not onely that they were not bound to obserue the lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> but that the obseruation of those lawes which were necessarily to be abrogated, was in them altogether vnlawfull. In which point his doctrine was misreported, as though he had euery where preached this, not only concerning the Gentiles, but also touching the Iewes. Wherfore comming vnto <hi>Iames</hi> and the rest of the Cleargie at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 21.20.</note> they tolde him plainely of it, saying, <hi>Thou seest brother how many thousand Iewes there are which beleeue, &amp; they are all zealous of the law. Now they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19711:98"/>
are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes which are amongst the Gentiles to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to liue after the customes.</hi> And hereupon they gaue him counsell to make it apparent in the eyes of all men, that those flying reports were vntrue, and that himselfe being a Iew, kept the lawe euen as they did. In some thinges therefore wee see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did teach, that there ought not to be conformitie betweene the Christian Iewes and Gentiles. How many things this lawe of inconformitie did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, there is no need we should stand to examine. This generall is true, that the Gentiles were not made conformable vnto the Iewes, in that which was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to cease at the comming of Christ. Touching things positiue which might either cease or continue as occasion should require,<note place="margin">Act. 15.28.</note> the Apostles tendering the zeale of the Iewes, thought it necessary to binde euen the Gentiles for a time to abstaine as the Iewes did, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things offered vnto idols, from bloud, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strangled. These decrees were euery where deliuered vnto the Gentiles to bee straightly obserued and kept. In the other matters where the Gentiles were free,<note place="margin">Act. 16.4.</note> and the Iewes in their owne opinion still tied, the Apostles doctrine vnto the Iewe was, <hi>Condemne not the Gentile</hi>; vnto the Gentile, <hi>Despise not the Iewe</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.10.</note> the one sorte they warned to take heed that scrupulositie did not make them rigorous, in giuing vnaduised sentence against their brethren which were free; the other that they did not become scandalous, by abusing their libertie &amp; freedome to the offence of their weake brethren which were scrupulous. From hence therefore two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there are which may euidently be drawne; the first, that whatsouer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of positiue lawes the Apostles did bring in betweene the Churches of Iewes and Gentiles, it was in those things only, which might either cease or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a shorter or a longer time, as occasion did most require; the second, that they did not impose vpon the Churches of the Gentiles any part of the Iewes ordinances with bond of necessary and perpetuall obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as we al both by doctrine and practise acknowledge) but only in respect of the conueniencie and fitnes for the present state of the Church as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it stood. The words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels decree co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Gentiles are, <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost &amp; to vs, to lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you no more burden sauing only those things of necessitie, abstinence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idoll-offrings, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strangled &amp; bloud, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fornication.</hi> So that in other things positiue which the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ did not necessarily extinguish, the Gentils were left altogether free. Neither ought it to seeme vnreasonable, that the Gentils should necessarily be bound &amp; tied to Iewish ordinances, so far forth as that decree importeth.

therefore the Gentiles would be exempt from the lawe of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet it might seeme hard they should also cast off euen those things positiue which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued before <hi>Moses,</hi> and which were not of the same kinde with lawes that were necessarily to cease. And peraduenture hereupon the Councell sawe it expedient to determine, that the Gentiles should according vnto the third, the seuenth, and the fift of those precepts, abstaine from things sacrificed vnto idoles, from strangled and bloud, and from fornication. The rest the Gentiles did of their owne accord obserue, nature leading them thereunto. And did not nature also teach them to abstaine from fornication? No doubt it did. Neither can we with reason thinke,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4. 1. Cor. 5.13.

               <hi>is when the example not of a good but of an euill thing, doth set men forward vnto sinne. Good things can scandalize none saue only euill mindes</hi>: good things haue no scandalizing nature in them. Yet that which is of it owne nature either good or at least not euill, may by some accident become scandalous at certain times, and in certaine places, and to certaine men, the open vse thereof neuerthelesse being otherwise without daunger. The verie nature of some rites and Ceremonies therfore is scandalous, as it was in a number of those which the Manichees did vse, and is in all such as the law of God doth forbid. Some are offensiue only through the agreement of men to vse them vnto euill, and not else; as the most of those thinges indifferent which the Heathens did to the seruice of their false Gods; which an other in heart condemning their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, could not doe with them in shew and token of approbation, without being guiltie of scandall giuen. Ceremonies of this kinde are either deuised at the first vnto euill; as the Eunomian Heretiques in dishonour of the blessed Trinitie, brought in the laying on of water but once, to crosse the custom of the Church, which in Baptisme did it thrise: or else hauing had a profitable vse, they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards interpreted and wrested to the contrarie; as those Heretiques which held the Trinitie to be three distinct not persons but natures, abused the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of three times laying on water in Baptisme vnto the strengthning of their heresie. The element of water is in Baptisme necessarie: once to lay it on or twice is indifferent.<note place="margin">Epist. ad Lean drum Hisp.</note> For which cause <hi>Gregorie</hi> making mention thereof, sayth; <hi>To diue an infant either thrice or but once in Baptisme, can be no way a thing reproueable; seeing that both in three times washing, the Trinitie of persons; and in one, the Vnitie of Godhead may be signified.</hi> So that of these two Ceremonies, neither being hurtfull in it selfe, both may serue vnto good purpose; yet one was deuised, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conuerted vnto euill. Now whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> certaine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are said to haue bene shamefully abused vnto euill, as the Ceremonie of Crossing at Baptisme, of kneeling at the Eucharist, of vsing Wafer-cakes, and such like; the question is, whether for remedie of that euill wherein such Ceremonies haue bene scandalous, and perhaps may be still vnto some euen amongst our selues, whome the presence and sight of them may confirme in that former error whereto they serued in times past, they are of necessitie to be remoued. Are these or any other Ceremonies wee haue common with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> scandalous and wicked in their verie nature? This no man obiecteth. Are any such, as haue bene polluted from their verie birth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted euen at the first vnto that thing which is euill?

Wee that are strong, must beare the imbecillities of the impotent, and not please our selues. It was a weakenesse in the Christian Iewes, and a maime of iudgement in them, that they thought the Gentiles pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the eating of those meates, which themselues were afraid to touch for feare of transgressing the lawe of <hi>Moses</hi>; yea hereat their hearts did so much rise, that the Apostle had iust cause to feare, least they would rather forsake Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, then endure any fellowship with such, as made no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of that which was vnto them abhominable. And for this cause mention is made of destroying the weake by meates, and of dissoluing the work of God, which was his church, a part of the liuing stones whereof were beleeuing Iewes. Now those weake brethren before mentioned are said to be as the Iewes were, and our ceremonies which haue bene abused in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be as the scandalous meates from which the Gentiles are exhorted to abstaine in the presence of Iewes, for feare of auerting them from Christian faith. Therefore as charitie did bind them to refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that for their brethrens sake, which otherwise was lawfull enough for them; so it bindeth vs for our brethrens sake likewise to abolish such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, although we might lawfully else retaine them. But betweene these two cases there are great oddes. For neither are our weake brethren as the Iewes, nor the ceremonies which we vse as the meates which the Gentiles vsed. The Iewes were knowne to be generally weake in that respect; whereas contrariwise the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie of ours is not common vnto so many, that we can take any such certaine notice of them. It is a chance if here and there some one be found; and therefore seeing we may presume men commonly otherwise, there is no necessitie that our practise should frame it selfe by that which th' Apostle doth prescribe to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.

Wherein for as much as we are contented to take this vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their credite, and to thinke it may be; sith also they further pretend the same to be so dangerous a snare to their soules, that are at any time taken therein; they must giue our teachers leaue for the sauing of those soules (bee they neuer so fewe) to intermingle sometime with other more necessary thinges, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning these not vnnecessarie.

For as much therefore as all the Churches</hi> (so farre as they know which pleade after this manner) <hi>of our confession in doctrine, agree in the abrogation of diuers things which we reteine; our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ought either to shew that they haue done euill, or else she is found to be in fault that doth not conforme her selfe in that, which she cannot denie to be well abrogated.</hi> In this axiome that preseruation of peace and vnitie amongst Christian Churches should be by al good meanes procured, we ioyne most willingly and gladly with them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denie we but that to th' auoyding of dissention it auaileth much, that there be amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an vnitie as well in ceremonies as in doctrine. The only doubt is about the manner of their vnitie, how far churches are bound to be vniforme in their ceremonies, &amp; what way they ought to take for that purpose. Touching the one, the rule which they haue set down is; that in ceremonies in differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ought to be one of them vnto another as like as <hi>possibly</hi> they may be. Whcih <hi>possibly</hi> we cannot otherwise conster, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it doth require them to be euen as like as they may be, without breaking any positiue ordinance of God. For the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies wherof we speake being matter of positiue law; they are indifferent, if God haue neither himselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded nor forbidden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Churches discretion. So that if as great vniformitie bee required as is possible in these things, seeing that the law of God forbiddeth not any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that from the greatest vnto the least they must be in euery Christian Church the same, except meere impossibilitie of so hauing it be the hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. To vs this opinion seemeth ouer extreame &amp; violent: wee rather incline to thinke it a iust and reasonable cause for any Church, the state whereof is free and independent, if in these things it differ from other Churches, only for that it doth not iudge it so fit &amp; expedient to be framed therin by the patterne of their example, as to bee otherwise framed then they. That of <hi>Gregorie</hi> vnto <hi>Leander</hi> is a charitable speech and a peaceable; <hi>In vnâ fide nil officit Ecclesiae sanctae consuetudo diuersa, Where the faith of the holy Church is one, a difference in customes of the Church doth no harme.</hi> That of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> to <hi>Cassulanus</hi> is somewhat more particular, and toucheth what kinde of ceremonies they are, wherein one Church may vary from the example of an other without hurt; <hi>Let the faith of the whole church how wide so euer it haue spred it selfe be alwaies one, although the vnitie of beliefe be famous for varietie of certain ordinances,</hi>

For if Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be vrged by way of dutie to take such ceremonies as they like not of; how can dissention be auoyded? Will they say that there ought to be no dissention, because such as are vrged ought to like of that whereunto they are vrged? If they say this, they say iust nothing. For how should any Church like to be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of dutie, by such as haue no authoritie or power ouer it, vnto those things which being indifferent it is not of dutie bound vnto them? Is it their meaning, that there ought to be no dissention, because that which Churches are not bound vnto, no man ought by way of dutie to vrge vpon them; and if any man doe, he standeth in the sight both of God and men most iustly blameable, as a needelesse disturber of the peace of Gods Church, &amp; an author of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? In saying this they both condemne their owne practise, when they presse the Church of England with so strict a bond of dutie in these thinges, and they ouerthrowe the ground of their practise, which is that there ought to bee in all kinde of ceremonies vniformitie, vnlesse impossibilitie hinder it.

this case like diuerse families; then like diuers seruants of one family; because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Church, the state whereof is independent vpon any other, hath authoritie to appoint orders for it selfe in thinges indifferent; therefore of the two we may rather inferre, that as one familie is not abridged of libertie to be clothed in Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers gray, for that an other doth weare clay-colour; so neither are all Churches bound to the selfe same indifferent Ceremonies which it liketh sundry to vse. As for that Canon in the Councell of Nice, let them but read it and waigh it well. The auncient vse of the Church throughout all Christendome was, for fiftie dayes after Easter (which fifty dayes were called Pentecost, though most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the last day of them which is Whitsunday be so called) in like sort on all the Sundayes throughout the whole yeare their manner was to stand at praier, whereupon their meetinges vnto that purpose on those dayes had the name of <hi>Stations</hi> giuen them. Of which custome <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh in this wise; <hi>It is not with vs thought sit either to fast on the Lordes day, or to pray kneeling. The same immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from fasting and kneeling we keepe all the time which is betweene the Feasts of Easter and Pentecost.</hi> This being therefore and order generally receiued in the Church; when some began to be singular and different from all others, and that in a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie which was then iudged very conuenient for the whole Church euen by the whole, those fewe excepted which brake out of the common pale: the Councell of Nice thought good to inclose them againe with the rest, by a lawe made in this sort: <hi>Because there are certaine which will needs kneele at the time of praier on the Lordes day, and in the fiftie dayes after Easter, the holy Synode iudging it meet that a conuenient custome be obserued throughout all churches, hath decreed that standing wee make our praiers to the Lord.</hi> Whereby it plainely appeareth that in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, what the whole Church doth thinke conuenient for the whole, the same if any part doe wilfully violate, it may be reformed and inrayled againe by that generall authority whereunto ech particular is subiect, and that the spirit of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie in a few ought to giue place vnto publike iudgement; this doth cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough appeare: but not that all Christian Churches are bound in euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ceremonie to be vniforme; because where the whole hath not tyed the parts vnto one and the same thing, they being therein left each to their owne choyce, may either do as other do or else otherwise, without any breach of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at all. Concerning those indifferent thinges, wherein it hath beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought good that all Christian Churches, should bee vniforme, the way which they now conceiue to bring this to passe was then neuer thought on. For till now it hath bene iudged, that seeing the lawe of God doth not prescribe all particular ceremonies which the Church of Christ may vse, and in so great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of them as may be found out, it is not possible that the lawe of nature and reason should direct all Churches vnto the same thinges; each deliberating by it selfe what is most conuenient: the way to establish the same things indifferent throughout them all, must needs be the iudgement of some iudiciall authoritie drawne into one onely sentence, which may be a rule for euery particular to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And because such authoritie ouer all Churches, is too much to be granted vnto any one mortall man; there yet remaineth that which hath bene alwayes followed, as the best, the safest, the most sincere and reasonable way, namely the verdict of the whole Church orderly taken, and set downe in the assembly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19711:104"/>

But to maintaine that all Christian Churches ought for vnities sake to be vniforme in all ceremonies, &amp; then to teach that the way of bringing this to passe must be by mutuall imitation, so that where we haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ceremonies then others they shall bee bound to followe vs, and we them where theirs are better; how should we thinke it agreeable and consonant vnto reason? For sith in things of this nature there is such varietie of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, whereby one Church may be led to thinke that better, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church led by other inducements iudgeth to be worse: (For example, the East Church did thinke it better to keepe Easter day after the manner of the Iewes, the West Church better to do otherwise; the Greeke Church iudgeth it worse to vse vnleauened bread in the Eucharist, the Latine Church leauened; one Church esteemeth it not so good to receiue the Eucharist sitting as sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, another Church not so good standing as sitting; there being on the one side probable motiues as well as on the other:) vnlesse they adde somewhat else to define more certainely what ceremonies shall stand for best, in such sort that all Churches in the world shall know them to be the best, and so know them that there may not remaine any question about this point; we are not a whit the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for that they haue hitherto said.

Hereupon they conclude, that for as much as all the reformed Churches (so farre as they know) which are of our confession in doctrine, haue agreed already in the abrogation of diuerse things which we reteine: our Church ought either to shew that they haue done euill, or else she is found to be in fault for not conforming her selfe to those Churches, in that which she cannot deny to be in them well abrogated. For the authoritie of the first Churches, (and those they accompt to be the first in this cause which were first reformed) they bring the comparison of younger daughters conforming themselues in attire to the example of their elder sisters;<note place="margin">Rom. 16.5.</note> wherein there is iust as much strength of reason as in the liuery coates before mentioned.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19711:105"/>
vnto pietie and Religious seruice of God, was to enter into consideration first, that the change of lawes, especially concerning matter of Religion, must be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily proceeded in. Lawes, as all other things humaine, are many times full of imperfection, and that which is supposed behoofefull vnto men, proueth often-times most pernicious. The wisedome which is learned by tract of time, findeth the lawes that haue bene in former ages establisht, needfull in later to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. Besides that which sometime is expedient, doth not alwaies so continue: and the number of needlesse lawes vnabolisht, doth weaken the force of them that are necessarie. But true withall it is, that alteration though it be from worse to better hath in it inconueniences and those waighty; vnlesse it be in such laws as haue bene made vpon special occasions, which occasions ceasing, laws of that kind do abrogate themselues. But when we abrogate a law as being ill made, the whole cause for which it was made still remaining; do we not herein reuoke our very owne deed, and vpbraid our selues with folly, yea all that were makers of it with ouer sight and with error? Further if it be a law which the custome &amp; continuall practise of many ages or yeares hath confirmed in the minds of men, to alter it must needs be troublesome and scandalous. It amazeth them, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to stand in doubt, whether any thing be in it selfe by nature either good or euil, &amp; not al things rather such as men at this or that time agree to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they behold euen those things disproued, disanulled, reiected, which vse had made in a maner naturall. What haue we to induce me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the willing obedience &amp; obseruation of lawes, but the waight of so many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iudgement, as haue with deliberate aduise assented thereunto; the waight of that long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which the world hath had thereof with consent &amp; good liking? So that to change any such law, must needs with the common sort impaire and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the force of those grounds, whereby all lawes are made effectual. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we do not deny alteration of laws to be sometimes a thing necessary; as when they are vnnatural, or impious, or otherwise hurtfull vnto the publique community of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and against that good for which humaine societies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. When the Apostles of our Lord &amp; Sauiour were ordained to alter the lawes of Heathnish Religion receiued throughout the whole world; chosen I grant they were (<hi>Paule</hi> excepted) the rest ignorant, poore, simple, vnschooled altogether and vnlettered men; howbeit extraordinarilie indued with ghostly wisedome from aboue before they euer vndertooke this enterprise, yea their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie confirmed by miracle; to the end it might plainely appeare that they were the Lords Ambassadours, vnto whose Soueraigne power for all flesh to stoope, for all the kingdomes of the earth to yeeld themselues willingly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in whatsoeuer should be required, it was their duty. In this case therefore their oppositions in maintenance of publique superstition against Apostolique endeuours, as that they might not condemne the wayes of their ancient prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, that they must keepe <hi>Religiones traditas,</hi> the rites which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age had descended, that the ceremonies of Religion had beene euer accompted by so much holier as elder, these and the like allegations in this case were vaine &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous. Not to stay longer therefore in speech concerning this point, we will conclude, that as the change of such lawes as haue bene specified is necessary, so the euidence that they are such must be great. If we haue neither voice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that so pronounceth of them; neither sentence of men grounded vpon such
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19711:106"/>
manifest and cleare proofe, that they in whose hands it is to alter them may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise infallibly euen in hart &amp; conscience iudge them so; vpon necessitie to vrge alteration is to trouble and disturbe without necessitie. As for arbitrary alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when laws in themselues not simply bad or vnmeet are changed for better and more expedient; if the benefit of that which is newly better deuised be but small, sith the custome of easinesse to alter and change is so euill, no doubt but to beare a tolerable soare is better then to venter on a dangerous remedy. Which being generally thought vpon, as a matter that touched neerly their whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise; whereas change was notwithstanding concluded necessary, in regard of the great hurt which the Church did receiue by a number of things then in vse, whereupon a great deale of that which had bene was now to be taken away and remoued out of the Church; yeat sith there are diuerse waies of abrogating things established, they saw it best to cut off presently such things, as might in that sort be extinguished without danger, leauing the rest to be abolished by disusage through tract of time. And as this was done for the manner of abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so touching the stint or measure thereof, rites &amp; ceremonies and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things of like nature being hurtfull vnto the Church, either in respect of their quality, or in regard of their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber; in the former there could be no doubt or difficulty what should be done, their deliberation in the later was more hard. And therefore in as much as they did resolue to remoue only such things of that kind as the Church might best spare, reteining the residue; their whole counsell is in this point vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, as hauing either proceeded from the blindnes of those times, or from negligence, or from desire of honour and glory, or from an erroneous opinion that such things might be tollerated for a while, or if it did proceed (as they which would seeme most fauourable are content to thinke it possible) from a purpose <hi>partly the easilier to draw Papists vnto the Gospell,</hi> by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping so many orders stil the same with theirs,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 2. p. 29. <hi>It may well be their purpose was by that temper of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish ceremonies with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, partly the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But such is the lot of all that deale in publique affaires whether of Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, that which men list to surmise of their doings be it good or ill, they must before hand patiently arme their minds to indure. Wherefore to let go priuate surmises, whereby the thing in it selfe is not made either better or worse; if iust and allowable reasons might leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do as they did, then are these censures al frustrate. Touching ceremonies harmelesse therfore in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, &amp; hurtful onely in respect of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: was it amisse to decree, that those things which were least needfull &amp; new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest come should be the first that were taken away, as in the abrogating of a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of saints daies and of other the like customes it appeareth they did, till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the forme of common prayer being perfited, articles of sound Religion and discipline agreed vpon, Catechismes framed for the needfull instruction of youth, Churches purged of things that indeed were burthensome to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to the simple offensiue and scandalous, all was brought at the length vnto that wherein now we stand? Or was it amisse, that hauing this way eased the Church as they thought of superfluitie, they went not on till they had pluckt vp euen those things also, which had taken a great deale stronger and deeper roote; those things which to abrogate without constraint of manifest harme thereby arising, had bene to alter vnnecessarily (in their iudgements) the auncient recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

True it is that neither councels nor customes, be they neuer so ancient and so generall, can let the Church from taking away that thing which is hurtfull to be retained. Where things haue bene instituted, which being conuenient and good at the first, do afterwards in processe of time waxe otherwise; we make no doubt but they may be altered,<note place="margin">T.

And surely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious it must needs haue bene for one Christian Church, to abolish that which all had receiued and held for the space of many ages, &amp; that without any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto Religion so manifest and so great, as might in the eyes of vnpartiall men appeare sufficient to cleare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all blame of rash &amp; inconsiderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, if in feruour of zeale they had remoued such things.

And as they are obstinate to retaine that, which no man of any conscience is able wel to defend: so we might be reckoned fierce and violent, to teare away that, which if our owne mouthes did condemne, our consciences would storme and repine thereat. The Romanes hauing banished <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the proud, and taken a sollemne oath that they neuer would permit any man more to raigne, could not herewith content themselues, or thinke that tyrannie was throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, till they had driuen one of their Consuls to depart the Citie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they found not in the world what to obiect, sauing onely that his name was <hi>Tarquine,</hi> and that the common-wealth could not seeme to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered perfect freedome, as long as a man of so daungerous a name was left remaining.

Howbeit that which the wise man hath sayde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Enoch</hi> (whose dayes were though many in respect of ours, yet scarse as three to nine in comparison of theirs with whome hee liued) the same to that admirable child most worthily may be applyed, <hi>Though he departed this worlde soone, yet fulfilled he much time.</hi> But what ensued? That worke, which the one in such sort had begun, and the other so farre proceeded in, was in short space so ouerthrowne, as if almost it had neuer bene: till such time as that God, whose property is to shew his mercies then greatest when they are neerest to be vtterly despaired of, caused in the depth of discomfort and darknes a most glorious starre to arise, and on her head setled the Crowne, whome him selfe had kept as a lambe from the slaughter of those bloudie times, that the experience of his goodnes in her own deliuerance, might cause her mercifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> disposition to take so much the more delight in sauing others, whom the like necessity shold presse. What in this behalfe hath bene done towards nations abroad, the parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome most afflicted can best testifie. That which especially concerneth our selues in the present matter we treate of, is the state of reformed religion, a thing at her comming to the Crowne euen raised as it were by miracle from the dead, a thing which we so little hoped to see, that euen they which behelde it done, scarcely belieued their own senses at the first beholding. Yet being then brought to passe, thus many years it hath continued, standing by no other worldly meane but that one only hand which erected it, that hand which as no kinde of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent daunger could cause at the first to withholde it selfe, so neyther haue the practises so many so bloudie following since beene euer able to make wearie. Nor can we say in this case so iustly, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> the Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill states haue sustained the hand which did lift it selfe to heauen for them; as that heauen it selfe hath by this hand sustained them, no ayde or helpe hauing thereunto bene ministred for performance of the worke of reformation, other then such kind of helpe or ayde as the Angell in the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> speaketh of, saying, <hi>Neither by an armie nor strength, but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hostes.</hi> Which grace and fauour of diuine assistance, hauing not in one thing or two shewed it self, nor for some few daies or yeares appeared, but in such sort so long continued, our manifold sinnes &amp; transgressions striuing to the contrarie; what can we lesse thereupon conclude, then that God would at leastwise by tract of time teach the world, that the thing which he blesseth, defendeth, keepeth, so strangely, cannot choose but be of him? Wherefore if any refuse to beleeue vs disputing for the veritie of religion established, let them beleeue God himselfe thus miraculouslie working for it, and wish life euen for euer and euer vnto that glorious and sacred instrument whereby he worketh.</p>

            <p>I Haue for some causes, (gentle Reader) thought it at this time, more fit to let goe these first foure Bookes by themselues, then to stay both them and the rest, til the whole might together be published. Such generalities of the cause in question as here are handled, it will be perhaps not amisse to consider apart, as by way of introduction vnto the bookes that are to follow concerning par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
