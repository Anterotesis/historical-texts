            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Deuteronomy XXXII.xxix.</hi> Oh that they were Wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their Later End!</head>
            <p>THIS Chapter the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call the Summary, or an Abridgment of the whole Law; it is the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he compoſed for, and ſung to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before his Death: He was highly ſenſible what a rebellious and ſtiff-necked People he had had the Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of, and by Divine Inſtinct or Inſpiration foreſaw their greater Rebellion after his Departure from them, and the Dreadful Judgments that would fall down upon them; plainly foretold, that after his Death God would pour down upon them the fierceſt Inſtances of his Anger and heavy Diſpleaſure, for their Violation of his Commandments, for their Nonconformity to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws and Preſcriptions: We find him therefore, in the Cloſe of the foregoing Chapter, ſummoning the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their Tribes, and their Officers, to whom he communicated his Preſcience or Fore-knowledge of <hi>their utterly corrupting themſelves after his Death, and of the Evil which would befall them in the latter days for their doing Evil in the ſight of the Lord, for their provoking him to Anger through the work of their hands,</hi> verſ. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>And indeed, what <hi>Moſes</hi> thus foretold, exactly came to paſs; for when they were come into the Promiſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43422:3"/>
Land, and had received particular Command utterly to deſtroy all the Idolatrous Inhabitants thereof, for fear they ſhould be inveigled by them, and drawn away to their Idol-Worſhip, and thoſe Abominable Pollutions they were infamouſly guilty of; yet, contrary to the expreſs Command of God, they executed not this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, they <hi>deſtroyed not the Nations, but mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, and learned their Works; they went a whoring with their own inventions, they ſerved their Idols, and ſacrificed their Sons and Daughters unto Devils.</hi> Thus to their Idolatry they added Blood-guiltineſs, of the higheſt degree, the deepeſt Dye, even the moſt barbarous and unnatural, the Blood of their deareſt and innocent Children. Theſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> told them, would be ſuch Provocations, as would moſt juſtly inflame the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Anger and Diſpleaſure of God, as would enforce the Almighty to withdraw his Favour and Protection from them; ſo to abhor them, tho his own peculiar People, that he would give <hi>them over into the hands of the Heathen, and ſuffer ſuch as hated them, to Rule and Lord it over them.</hi> All this <hi>Moſes</hi> faithfully repreſented to the Elders of their Tribes, and to their Officers, but withal preſcribed them an effectual way to Peace and Reconciliation with their God, to render him propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and favourable to them, and that was, a turning unto him with true and faithful Repentance: This, he told them, would be the only way to oblige the Lord to Pity and Commiſeration: If they ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, their ſins then, tho of ſo high and provoking a Nature, <hi>would be blotted out, and the times of refreſhing would come;</hi> God then would hear their Complaint, God <hi>then would make his Arrows drunk with their Enemies Blood,</hi> verſ. 42. and Crown them, his People, with Victory and good Succeſs. But alaſs! <hi>Moſes</hi> had fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43422:3"/>
Apprehenſions of their Obdurateneſs and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, of their Blindneſs and Stupidity, that they would loſe all their true Judgment, that for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they would deſpiſe his wholſom Counſels and Inſtruction; therefore he very pathetically and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately prays for them in the Words of my Text, <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi>

               <hi>Oh that they were wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Firſt, In the firſt place, What it is to conſider.</p>
            <p>And here, to conſider, is to make a proper Uſe of the rational Faculty which God hath implanted in every one of us, to exerciſe the ſeveral Capacities of the Soul, to reflect upon our ſelves, to meaſure our Motions, our Actions, by the Standard of Reaſon. Whoever, through a manly and ſerious Application of his Mind, takes a juſt and an impartial View of himſelf, of all ſuch things as relate to and concern him, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly governs his Will and Affections, determins his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Deportment; ſuch an one is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Man. When a Man ſuffers not his Paſſions to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuate and ferment into a Storm, nor himſelf to be carried away with Exorbitant Luſts, but embraces in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43422:4"/>
Mind the whole Nature, Tendency, and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things; when he weighs them in the Scale of Reaſon, and diligently examins, carefully obſerves which way the Scale turns, and proportions his Courſe, his Actions to ſuch a diligent Obſervance and careful Examination; ſuch a Man is a wiſe and ſerious, a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſiderative Perſon: And this it is, in ſhort, to conſider; which brings me to the ſecond obſervable, namely,</p>
            <p>The Benefit of conſideration.</p>
            <p>It is a great Art and an Excellence in Man to know how to think, how to conſider; it is a thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome time for its Accompliſhment and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome Pains, ſome Induſtry for its Acquiſition; and whoever would but take the Pains, will but be at the expence of ſome Labour to ſeek it, will certainly find it; and when he hath found it, nothing will be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary, more beneficial and Advantagious to him; nothing will more avail to the good Conduct and well-government of his Life and Converſation: For then he will be able to look into the Nature of Humane Actions, to weigh well the Cauſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Conſequence of things, and to exerciſe that Senſe and Reaſon which God hath plentifully enrich'd and endow'd him with: And what can better contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his Peace and Happineſs, to his Security and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation? If he communeth but with his own Heart, and acts according to the Illumination of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to the Dictates of Reaſon and Convictions of Conſcience, if he ſeriouſly revolves in his Mind the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Vertue and the Danger of Vice; in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he will ſtand in Awe, and not ſin; he will have a care of affronting his God by wickedneſs and impiety; and this is the Benefit, this is the Advantage of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43422:4"/>
Alas! if we ſail without Chart, without Compaſs, without a Pilot, what can we expect but a fatal Shipwrack? If Men will not endeavour to diſpoſe themſelves to a ſerious Conſideration and Reflection upon what they are a going to do; but, as <hi>the Horſe into the Battle,</hi> ruſh upon things with Indiſcretion and Precipitancy; what can be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch their Folly, but Ruin and Deſtruction? It is the worthy Obſervation of <hi>Philo, That the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the dangers and miſcarriages of Men lies in their running on with the boiſtrous Tide of Paſſion; and that the firſt hopes of ſafety flow from a ſober reaſoning of the matter.</hi> But behold a greater than <hi>Philo</hi> is here: God himſelf lays the blame of all Men's Miſery upon Inconſideration. Thus God complains of his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Ah ſinful Nation, a people laden with Iniquity!</hi> And why were they ſo? Why forſook they the Lord, and provoked him to Anger? It was becauſe of their heedleſneſs and Inadvertency: <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my People doth not conſider,</hi> verſ 3. Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.27, 28. <hi>Who is he that turneth away from his Wickedneſs, and doth that which is lawful and right?</hi> The Conſiderative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>He repents becauſe he conſidereth:</hi> So that Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is the chief Impediment, the principal Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Repentance, which is the Reaſon why God, according to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Aſſertion, will ſeverely puniſh Men for it at the Day of Judgment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>God will bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing,</hi> i. e. ſay the generality of Latiniſts, <hi>Pro omni Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> with every Error or Miſcarriage; <hi>i. e.</hi> He will bring into Judgment the inconſiderateneſs of Men: And this Tranſlation the <hi>Seventy</hi> ſeem to approve of, <hi>Every ſecret thing,</hi> i. e. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43422:5"/>
attentis oculis &amp; praeterire,</hi> To behold or look upon a thing with a negligent or careleſs Eye. This Heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Neglect, this Remiſsneſs and Inconſideration in our Actions God will puniſh at the Day of Judgment; and there is all the Reaſon and Juſtice imaginable in ſo doing, becauſe from Inconſideration flow all Vicious and Immmoral Actions.</p>
            <p>But this by the By.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.4. What curbs and reſtrains a Man from the Commiſſion of any wicked Act? <hi>A withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Chamber, and there communing with his own Heart;</hi> ſuch a Solitude, ſuch a private Retirement and Communing, darts the moſt powerful and auſpicious Influence upon the Hearts of Men: <hi>Stand in awe and ſin not; commune with your own Hearts upon your Beds, and be ſtill.</hi> Thus in the Goſpel; Who were they that heard the Word of God, and were no better for it? Such as heard it ſlightly and ſuperficially, ſuch as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it not to enter into their Mind and Conſideration: Without Conſideration it was impoſſible for it to take root and grow, or to digeſt into Principles of Action; ſome Seed, indeed, there was, which arriv'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and perfection, which was proſperous and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but the reaſon was, becauſe it was ſown in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and a good Heart; ſuch heard the Word and kept it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Retain'd it in their Thoughts and Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and ſo brought forth Fruit with patience, Luke</hi> 8.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>But thus much of the Benefit of Conſideration: I come now to the third Obſervable, Namely, To ſhew you what is meant by the Latter End, which is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Conſideration here in the Text: <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end!</hi> That is, as if he ſhould have ſaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43422:5"/>
Oh that they would ſee the things which belong unto their Peace! Oh that the Evil I forewarn them of, may deter them from avowed Wickedneſs and Impiety, may oblige them to a conſtant Living up to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Obligations of the Divine Laws! If not, Oh that the Judgments of God may convince them of their Errors, and reclaim their Sins, that they would ſtimulate and excite them to Repentance, to a due ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſideration what it is to ſin againſt God, to an underſtanding what will be the Event of perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Wickedneſs, what will be the Reward of their Impenitence, both in this Life and the Life to come; ſo that by the Latter End is to be underſtood not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death, but, what follows after Death, <hi>the Judgment,</hi> an Appearance before the dreadful Tribunal of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, there to receive a Reward or a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proportionable to what we have tranſacted upon the Stage of this World. Oh that all you, who hear me this day, would underſtand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this great and certain Truth! <hi>That it is not only appointed unto all men once to die, but after this the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This is the import, this is the ſignification of the Latter End; Death is our Latter End, but the Reſurrection, the future Judgment is a Latter End beyond it. The Soul is of an immortal Nature, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Ceſſation, can never ceaſe to be; the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt naturally die, it's noble Frame and admirable Contexture muſt be diſſolved and taken in Pieces, it muſt return to its original Duſt and Corruption; tho this is but a tranſitory and temporal Death, this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable by a Reſurrection; it muſt certainly be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again, and be re-united to the Soul, and ſhare with it in whatever ſtate or Condition it ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced unto; if it hath not ſerved God, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43422:6"/>
it ſhall then ſuffer a ſecond Death, after its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unition to the Soul, they ſhall both be depreſs'd into a ſtate of Miſery, a State where are endleſs and eaſeleſs Torments; a Miſery, which is not Temporal or Tranſitory, but durable and permanent to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, <hi>and who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Whoſoever is wiſe will conſider this.</p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, let me uſe the Strain of the Holy Apoſtle to <hi>King Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26.27. Do you believe the Scriptures? Do you believe a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Judgment to come? I know you believe it: May I ſay, I know you remember it? This I dare ſay, that if you do not, I know you have no cauſe not to remember it: A thing of the higheſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a thing of the greateſt Concernment that ever will befall you, a thing that is moſt ſure and certain, a thing that you can as little avoid, as you can avoid Death, and a thing that muſt determin of your Eternal State, and do you not remember it? I am ſure we have all cauſe to remember it, we have all the reaſon imaginable to underſtand and conſider our Latter End.</p>
            <p>If there be any here of a <hi>Sadducean</hi> Temper, that deny the Reſurrection; or, with the <hi>Corinthian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist,</hi> queſtion <hi>How are the Dead raiſed up?</hi> And <hi>with what Body do they come?</hi> Such are fooliſh and inconſiderate; ſuch Queſtions flow from Incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and Indiſcretion, ſuch are horribly deceived; and they will find themſelves groſly miſtaken, for there will be a Reſurrection from the Dead: <hi>God hath certainly appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he he hath ordain'd, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43422:6"/>
all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead</hi> Acts 17.31. How ſtrangely then will ſuch <hi>Sadducees,</hi> or any, who are mindleſs of a future ſtate, be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the Reſurrection of the Dead? Oh! that we had been wiſe and conſider'd this. Oh! let us lie ſtill in the Duſt, will they then cry, let the Earth cover us, <hi>Let the Mountains and the Rocks fall upon us.</hi> Alas! <hi>the Trumpet will ſound,</hi> and they ſhall be rais'd from the Dead, they ſhall hear this terrible Voice, <hi>Ariſe you Wretches and come to Judgment;</hi> they will then find that, which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath aſſerted, to be infallibly true, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Know that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads me to the fourth Obſervable, namely,</p>
            <p>The great Advantage of conſidering the latter End. <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter End!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Saying of the <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> Eccluſ. 7.36. <hi>Whatſoever thou takeſt in hand, remember the end, and thou ſhalt never do amiſs.</hi> The <hi>Latiniſt</hi> reads it, <hi>In om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Operibus vel Sermonibus tuis memorare Noviſſima &amp; in aeternum non peccabis,</hi> In all thy Works or Words remember the laſt things, and thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commit <hi>a Sin unto Death;</hi> ſuch a Remembrance would make it morally impoſſible for thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a preſumptuous Sin, a wilful and deliberate Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Now the <hi>Four last things</hi> to be continually remembred, are, <hi>Death, a Judgment to come, Hell, and Celestial Glory.</hi> And what more horrible than Death? What more terrible than ſuch a Judgment? What more intolerable than Eternal Fire? And what worthier Object can there be for us to exert our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43422:7"/>
upon, than God and the Manſions of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Felicity? How many Sins might we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided in the courſe of our Lives, if we had had the ſerious remembrance and apprehenſion of theſe things? And how many Sins might we yet avoid, if we would but endeavour to have theſe things, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s <hi>Hand-writing upon the Wall,</hi> conſtantly in our Eye? Theſe things, <hi>as the Pilot the Ship,</hi> would direct and influence our whole Life and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would help us to ſteer our Courſe, and ſafely bring us to the Haven of Bliſs and Happineſs. Such would be the great Advantage of conſidering our latter End: If Men would but thus conſider, no Temptation would then take hold of them, nothing would ruffle and diſcompoſe their Conſcience, it <hi>would be void of Offence both towards God and towards Men.</hi> But alas! In this lapſed and degenerate Age, in this miſerable and naughty World, how many are there that have languid, luke-warm and feeble Opinions of Religion? If Judgment may be formed according to their Vicious and immoral Converſation, what a Deluge of Prophaneneſs and Impiety, Atheiſm and Infidelity overflows this <hi>Sinful Land, this poor Nation?</hi> How many live, as tho they believed that Vertue and Vice, that God and the Devil were Words ſignifying nothing, as if they were the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of ſome melancholy and pregnant Brain, as if they were invented meerly for Mens Terror and Affrightment? The <hi>Halter,</hi> the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> and the moſt terrible of Temporal Puniſhments too, have as little Influence upon Mens Lives, makes as ſmall an Impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, as thoſe which are Eternal: How many have ſuffer'd as <hi>Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> as <hi>Thieves,</hi> as <hi>Evil-doers?</hi> And yet Men will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43422:7"/>
not take Warning and Example; Men will not be deterr'd from committing the like abominable, Vile and Enormous Offences. Every <hi>Aſſize</hi> gives us too many freſh and ſad Inſtances of this Truth. Oh that Men would become wiſe, and conſider not only Temporal, but Eternal Puniſhments! Such a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would, if any thing, oblige them to follow the important buſineſs of Religion, <hi>To hurt no body by Word or Deed, to keep their hands from picking and ſtealing:</hi> Such a Conſideration would enforce them to <hi>labour truly to get their own living,</hi> and to do their Duty in that Station which Divine Providence hath allotted to them.</p>
            <p>There is not certainly a more effectual way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the <hi>drooping Spirit</hi> of Chriſtian Religion in the World, than ſeriouſly to contemplate upon, and conſider our Latter End, That we muſt ſhortly die, and come to Judgment, and there receive a Reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Deeds. If we were but poſſeſs'd with a warm and conſtant Senſe of theſe things, we ſhould, in all probability, endeavour to <hi>walk, circumſpectly, not as Foools, but as wiſe,</hi> to be holy in all manner of Converſation.</p>
            <p>Such is the advantage of a Religious Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Alas! were there but mature Thoughts, would but Men be wrought upon to act as reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; would they but judiciouſly and ſoberly weigh things in the Balance of their Underſtanding, they would ſeldom or never be found wanting in their Duty and Obligation: If Men would once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſerious Thoughts of Religion, they would ſoon ſet open their Ears to its ſweet and charming Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; if they would but fix their Eyes upon it, they would ſoon be captivated with its incomparable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43422:8"/>
Beauty, it would preſently attract their love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and enforce them to embrace it with all profound reſpect and affection: A conſideration of our latter end, a ſerious reflection upon Eternity, this would put the Soul into ſuch a frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as would make it reſtleſs and uneaſy, wrack'd and impatient, till it had made its Peace with an incens'd Judge, by Repentance not to be repented of; till it had prepar'd it ſelf for a comfortable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at his Bar, for a glorious advancement into an endleſs ſtate of Bliſs and Immortality: Such is the great advantage of conſidering our latter end. <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads me to the fifth and laſt Obſervable, Namely, That to conſider our latter end, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Wiſdom and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And here, if we conſider our latter end as we ought, it we ſeriouſly meditate upon Death and a Judgment to come, then we ſhall prepare our ſelves, and make ready for it by purity of Life, and holineſs of Converſation; ſuch a Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will create in our Minds an abhorrency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Sin, and plant in us Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a perfect and ſincere love of God and Religion; and this, I am ſure, is the greateſt Wiſdom, the nobleſt Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>is the beginning of Wiſdom: a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding have all they that do thereafter,</hi> Pſalm 110.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> There is no ſuch excellent and prudential courſe, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in our Breaſts a juſt and due reverence of God, an awe to his Laws, and a dread to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43422:8"/>
and all this is the happy effect of conſidering our latter end. <hi>So teach us to number our Days,</hi> is the fervent Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal. 90.12. So teach us to conſider our latter end, <hi>that we may apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom,</hi> i. e. to the important buſineſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>thus ſhall we lay up in ſtore for our ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come; thus ſhall we lay hold on Eternal Life:</hi> And this if we do, it will be a demonſtrative argument of our Wiſdom and Underſtanding. And that you may be perſwaded <hi>to incline your Ear unto Wiſdom, and apply your Hearts to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> I ſhall ſet before you the happineſs of a Religious, and the folly of a vicious and an Immoral Converſation; and this I cannot better do, than by referring you to the third Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs:</hi> You will ſee there, how the Wiſe Man ſets off Religion in the moſt beautiful and glorious Dreſs, enumerates there its peculiar excellencies, and particular advantages; <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He repreſents her as a great and generous <hi>Princeſs,</hi> diſtributing Gifts to her Subjects, <hi>length of Days is in her right hand, and in her left hand Riches and Honour:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace;</hi> i. e. They procure a bleſſed Tranquility in a Mans Mind and Conſcience, Proſperity in all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and Eternal Reſt with God in Glory. The <hi>Religious Man</hi> hath Peace and an Heaven in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; the greateſt tranſports of Joy poſſeſs and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round his Breaſt, and his laſt end is ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, <hi>he dies the Death of the Righteous;</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then, as a Glaſs, repreſents to his ſight the Beatific Viſion and the Joys of Eternity. And this it is to conſider our latter end, this is the bleſſed effect of a righteous Life; whoſoever then thus conſiders
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43422:9"/>
his latter end, it is certainly an Argument of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Conſider we the folly of a Vicious Life, and an Immoral Converſation; Alas! what is Vice and Immorality, but a ſort of practice that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeth and diſparageth a Man? Such a ſad courſe of Life generally plunges a Man into the moſt grievous and intolerable Evils, as a diſtemper both of Body and Soul, the greateſt diſtreſs of Fortune, Poverty and Diſgrace, a low and contemptible condition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and the loſs of Reputation, Affliction and Diſcompoſure of Mind, the torments of a troubled Conſcience, <hi>(for there is no Peace, ſaith my God, to the Wicked,)</hi> the danger of a Death-bed Repentance, and frequently brings him to a violent and an unnatural Death: Add to this Miſery, the loſs of Gods favour and loving kindneſs; <hi>ſuch treaſure up unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Oh the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and conſternation ſuch are in when they come to dye! when their Conſcience preſents to their ſight the dreadful <hi>Scenes</hi> of a Judgment to come; their evil Conſcience then flaſhes in their Face, caſts abroad its Thunder, and ſtrikes them with the greateſt Terrour and Affrightment. All theſe are the lamentable effects of a vicious Life, and an immoral Converſation; which ſufficiently demonſtrates the folly of ſuch as prefer Wickedneſs above Religion; <hi>ſuch do truly wander out of the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> But this is not all, <hi>the Man that wandereth out of the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, ſhall remain in the Congregation of the Dead,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to the verſion of the LXX, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.16. i. e. The Man that leaves the beautiful Paths of Vertue, which directly lead to Happineſs, and takes the By-Paths, the rough
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43422:9"/>
and unpleaſant Road of Iniquity, which conducts him to Eternal Death, ſuch a Man doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne his Reaſon, is not only void of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he ſhall remain in the Company of the <hi>Giants,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4. They were Men of a monſtrous Stature, and whoſe wickedneſs too was proportionable to their large Size; theſe Men, as they were ſingularly eminent for their height and bigneſs, ſo were they horribly infamous for <hi>Acts of Injuſtice,</hi> for <hi>Wrong and Robbery,</hi> for <hi>Tyranny and Oppreſſion;</hi> theſe were the Men, <hi>for whom it repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth;</hi> theſe were the Men, whoſe Sins opened the Cataracts, the Windows of Heaven, and brought down a deluge of Wrath and Indignation; and the Man, <hi>who works Wickedneſs, is not only without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> but ſhall be incorporated into the wretched Society and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of thoſe Giants and Rebels againſt God, ſhall be condemned to keep them company, ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to that accurſed place, which they had aſſign'd them, when the Flood came and deſtroyed them all; a Place where the <hi>Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I come now in the Sixth and laſt place to make an Application, and then I a'done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43422:10"/>And here, <hi>ſuffer a Word of Exhortation,</hi> you, who worthily deſerve to be puniſhed; you, who for your Evil Deeds are condemned to die; let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you and prevail with you to conſider your Latter End; it behoves you conſider it: Eternal Bliſs and Happineſs ſure, is a thing of the greateſt and moſt weighty Conſideration, a thing of ſuch vaſt moment, that for you to put off the Thoughts of it, and neglect the Proviſion for it, is certainly the moſt unaccountable Indiſcretion, the greateſt Folly and Madneſs.</p>
            <p>You have but this, and part of the Day following, to make your Peace with an Offended God, to make Proviſion for your Future Happineſs. To day then hear the Voice of God, who calleth upon you to conſider your latter End. I do not doubt your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it in one Senſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> That you have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Apprehenſions of your Temporal Puniſhment, of the violent and unnatural End you have brought your ſelves unto; but this ought to be the leaſt of your Conſideration; nothing ought to diſturb you now, but the apprehenſion of your having offended God: And if you now do truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear God, (as you have all imaginable reaſon <hi>to fear him, who is able to caſt both Body and Soul into Hell</hi>) that will raiſe you above all other Depreſſions, that will exalt you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all baſe and diſpiriting Fears. You are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that after your departure hence there will be a Judgment; and to make ready and prepare your ſelves for a comfortable appearance at that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Tribunal, you have received Sentence of Death from an Earthly Judge, which Death is only Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Tranſitory; and it was paſs'd upon you with all poſſible Regret and Reluctancy, with the greateſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43422:10"/>
unwillingneſs; but if you repent not of the Evils you have done, a more terrible Sentence will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon you by the Righteous Judge of the World, <hi>Go you Curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Will you not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your latter end, ſo as to prepare for it by true and faithful Repentance? Surely if you be wiſe, you will ſo conſider it, and let not your puniſhment here, but the conſideration, that you have offended a good and gracious God by your Wickedneſs, be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſuch a Repentance.</p>
            <p>And here, let me a little touch upon, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Wickedneſs, and ſet before you the evil things that you have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two of you are Condemned for Murder,</hi> and that of a moſt cruel and barbarous ſort; the one, for <hi>the Wife of his own Boſom,</hi> the other, of <hi>her harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Babe;</hi> Murders, monſtrous and unnatural: How Diametrically oppoſite are ſuch horrid Acts to the Laws of the Chriſtian Religion? They <hi>command the Husband to dwell with his Wife according to Knowledg,</hi> i. e. with all Conjugal Love and Affection, <hi>to give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Wife, as unto the weaker Veſſel;</hi> How then doth he violate this Command, <hi>who breaks the Bone of his Bone, who wounds the Fleſh of his Fleſh?</hi> Chriſtianity obliges <hi>Husbands to love their Wives as their own Bodies,</hi> charges every Man <hi>to love his Wife even as himſelf,</hi> Epheſ. 5.28.33. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, and be not bitter againſt them,</hi> Col. 3.19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have before us a Woman who hath Murder'd her own Child, an Infant <hi>born of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> Fornication of it ſelf is an hainous Sin, a Sin, that without Repentance excludes from the Kingdom of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Fornicators ſhall not inherit the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43422:11"/>
Kingdom of God:</hi> And it is a Sin much more hainous, when it is productive of a greater, when Murder is the ſad effect and lamentable conſequence of it; to deſtroy the Fruit of one's own Womb, to ſend it out of the World too unbaptized, before it was waſh'd <hi>in the Laver of Regeneration;</hi> to give it a <hi>Bloody Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm!</hi> I want Words to expreſs the unnaturalneſs and barbarity of ſuch an Action. Alas! How doth the Commiſſion of one Sin make way for another? How doth one Wickedneſs tread upon the heels of another? The Devil tempted to Fornication, and then to hide the Shame, tempted to murder the Infant; though that was the moſt effectual way to be expos'd to the greater Ignominy and Diſgrace. Thus the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did with <hi>David,</hi> as ſoon as ever he ſucceeded in his Temptation to commit Adultery <hi>with the Wife of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> he preſently took the advantage, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to add to his Adultery, the crying Sin of Murder.</p>
            <p>Blood-guiltineſs! A Sin which defiles the Land, a Sin which cries to Heaven for Vengeance, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes the Juſtice, and wearies the Ears of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, till it be avenged; a Sin for which God hath not only ordained a Temporal, but an Eternal Death to be the puniſhment of it, unleſs his Wrath be atton'd with an hearty and an unfeigned Repentance: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Sins of ſuch an horrid nature, <hi>muſt be ſought carefully with Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others of you are to be cut off with the <hi>Sword of Juſtice</hi> for <hi>Theft,</hi> for <hi>Wrong</hi> and <hi>Robbery,</hi> Acts altogether repugnant to the Laws of the Land, and contradictory to the Laws of God, who hath commanded us not to Steal, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal; had you ſought the Kingdom of God, and his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43422:11"/>
Righteouſneſs,</hi> had you not neglected his Divine Service and Worſhip, had you wrought honeſtly with your hands, and been induſtrious in your reſpective Vocations, God would never have ſuffer'd you to have wanted the Comforts and Neceſſaries of this Life, but Idleneſs is the grand Snare of the DEVIL; had you truſted upon your Heavenly Father, who <hi>Cloathes the Graſs and Lillies of the Field,</hi> He would have provided for you, He <hi>would have much more cloath'd you, O ye of little Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Excellent Advice which the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> gives, 62.10. <hi>O truſt not in Wrong and Robbery:</hi> He, that thinks to ſupport himſelf by ſuch Means, truſteth to a broken Reed, he will be ſure to be diſappointed, to find his Folly, when he expects the Fruit of his Contrivances; Riches innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten are not to be rely'd on, much leſs ſuch Gain as is got by Injury and Oppreſſion; Acts of Injuſtice make Men odious to God, render them unfit for humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: There are few that follow this wicked Employment, but at the laſt reap up the Wages which are appointed by the Law to be the Reward of it; and whoſoever of them eſcapes Vengeance in this World, ſhall not, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, eſcape Vengeance in the World to come: Nothing but the Execution of ſuch Men can give Check to their Wickedneſs, nothing can put a Stop to them, and prevent the Miſchief that ſuch Men do in the World, but a cutting them off, this is the Reaſon of Capital Puniſhments among Men; it is all imaginable Juſtice and Equity, to remove ſuch Men out of the World, as will be a Plague to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, while they live in it.</p>
            <p>Another of you ſuffers Death for <hi>Burning a Barn,</hi> for conſuming with Fire the Fruits of the Earth, which had been with Labour and Charge ſown and reap'd by one, who had formerly been to him a kind and an indulgent Maſter; An Act of Ingratitude as well as Impiety, and an Argument of a moſt Malicious and Diabolical Spirit, an Act that is

            <p>I am heartily ſorry that one who had taken Holy Orders upon him, (though it is a conſiderable time ſince he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Office or Adminiſtration</hi>) ſhould prove a Malefactor in this kind, and that ſome ſhould dare to improve this Crime to a general Reflection, ſuch as do ſo, are baſe and ill-natur'd, cenſorious and unthinking People: Alas! <hi>Offences will come,</hi> there will be ſome bad in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Communities of Men, there <hi>was a</hi> Judas <hi>among the very Apoſtles,</hi> the beſt Body hath ſome bad Blood in it, the fineſt Silver hath ſome Allay, the brighteſt Days have ſome Clouds.</p>

they <hi>that will be rich,</hi> that ſet their minds on the getting of riches, <hi>fall into a Temptation and a ſnare, into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which ingulph or drown them in Deſtruction and Perdition; the Love of</hi> Money <hi>is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome have</hi> coveted <hi>after, they have Erred from the Faith,</hi> and pierced <hi>themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> have brought themſelves to a ſad and moſt Wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>And the Man of God ſhould flee theſe things;</hi> this was the Charge, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to his Scholar, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> at his Embarquement into the <hi>Epiſcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>We have, I ſay, inſtances in Holy Scripture of ſuch as have not anſwer'd their Sacred Character, as have Preach'd to others, and themſelves been Reprobate, as have by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs fall'n into the ſnare of the Devil; thus <hi>Judas</hi> was poſſeſs'd with a baſe and unworthy Spirit of Covetouſneſs, he ſold the very Son of God for Money; when he ſaw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the matter was to End in the death of his Lord, <hi>he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,</hi> but Alas!

            <p>Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> for Money ſold to Deſtruction, 24000 <hi>Men of Iſrael,</hi> Numbers, <hi>Twenty Fifth, he</hi> loved <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Divination;</hi> and though he was Reſtrain'd by the Divine prohibition to go at the firſt, yet a ſecond Meſſage carried by more <hi>Honourable Perſons,</hi> and enforc'd with a Charming promiſe of promotion, and Advancement to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; This Lull'd <hi>the Prophet</hi> Aſleep, this was a bait, which he could not but ſwallow, the ſilver and gold, the Honors, that <hi>Balak</hi> promis'd, run ſo in his mind, that he could not but hanker after them; though at the laſt this prov'd his deſtruction, for he Aſſociated with <hi>the Midianites,</hi> was found with them; and was <hi>Slain in the Battel, Numb.</hi> 31.8.

by following the way of</hi> Balaam <hi>the Son of</hi> Boſor, <hi>who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>Thus have I ſet before you the evil things that you have done, and for which you are appointed to dye.</p>
            <p>What remains, but that, as <hi>an Ambaſſador of God,</hi> I pray <hi>you in Chriſt's ſtead to be Reconcil'd to God,</hi> to conſider your latter end, to ſeek the Lord your God with an hearty, and Sincere Repentance; <hi>Repentance</hi> is a Turning of the whole Heart from Sin and the Devil, to ſerve God in Newneſs of Life, a purging of the <hi>Conſcience from Dead Works to ſerve the living God, a dying unto ſin;</hi> ſuch a Compunction of the Heart for ſin, as is joyn'd with a full purpoſe, and a ſteady Reſolution to leave, and forſake it; God hath promiſed to pardon, and hath Actually pardoned the greateſt Sin upon ſuch a Repentance; Even Murder it ſelf, that Execrable and Crying Sin; though the innocent blood, you have ſhed, Crys to Heaven for Vengeance, <hi>yet the blood of the ever Bleſſed Jeſus crys as loud for your pardon and forgiveneſs,</hi> if you be but deeply touch'd, and affected with a ſenſe of your abominable wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Repentance,</hi> 'Tis True, is late, you have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful, you have put off your Duty towards God and your Neighbour; till the very laſt Minute of your Life; and the Holy Goſpel requires not only Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for Sin; but an Holy Life to demonſtrate the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Repentance; But Alas! You have little or no time to amend your Life in, your glaſs is well nigh run, you have not many hours for the Conſideration of your latter End; <hi>Well! but</hi> there is mercy with God, <hi>his Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ever to have mercy and to forgive,</hi> his mercy is as infinite as himſelf; and therefore none muſt pretend to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or Confine it; though you have hitherto liv'd in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, in the contempt of God and Religion; yet if you make a True and Ample Confeſſion of all your Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes; if you humbly beg pardon, and, <hi>with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can

            <p>
               <hi>I Leave you therefore</hi> to the goodneſs and pity, to the Gracious compaſſion of a merciful God; I pray you to conſider your Latter End, <hi>that after Death, there will be a Judgment;</hi> I beg of you to Employ the ſmall Moment, you have to live, to your Eternal intereſt and Advantage, <hi>to work out your Salvation with fear and Trembling,</hi> to be doubly diligent and induſtrious, <hi>to redeem the time,</hi> ſeeing you are but <hi>come into the Vineyard at the Eleventh hour.</hi>

Young Man, whoſe name was <hi>Greggson,</hi> with whom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other <hi>Roguiſh</hi> Pranks, he frequently impos'd upon, and cheated the ignorant, and unskilful with <hi>Pewter Shillings;</hi> and of whom it is probable, he learn'd <hi>his Art;</hi> for this <hi>Greggson</hi>'s <hi>Father</hi> had the Scandalous Character, &amp; Reputation of a <hi>Coyner;</hi> &amp; <hi>Greggson</hi> himſelf, who had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken <hi>Holy Orders</hi> upon him, was, about 10. or 12.

            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>School,</hi> I ſuppoſe, he went to the <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> again to take a degree, he wou'd not give me any ſatisfaction as to that particular.</p>

he frequently and narrowly eſcap'd; but all this wou'd not deter him from, wou'd not oblige and enforce him to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a dangerous employment, as ſo often brought him to the very brink of deſtruction, as ſo often gave him a diſmal proſpect of an infamous death.</p>

of Mr. <hi>Anthony Preſton</hi> Late Miniſter at <hi>Barns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and that the Hand in the <hi>Bond</hi> was nothing like it; and indeed for mine own Satisfaction, and that I might the better preſs him to a Confeſſion of the Forgery, I procured a Letter, which Mr. <hi>Anthony Preston</hi> had writ to <hi>one,</hi> who's concern'd in the management of the <hi>Prerogative Office</hi> in <hi>York,</hi> which I ſhewed to Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and deſir'd to compare the <hi>Hands,</hi> but the <hi>Bond,</hi> he pretended, was not in his poſſeſſion; though upon ſight of the <hi>Letter</hi> he acknowledged to me, That the <hi>Hands</hi> did not very well agree together; and yet at his Death declar'd, the <hi>Bond</hi> was <hi>legally</hi> obtained.</p>
            <p>Another thing that might oblige him to a Voluntary Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, was the Belief that <hi>Two poſitive Witneſſes</hi> were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requir'd by the <hi>Law,</hi> to the taking away his Life; and he was morally certain, that only <hi>One</hi> would Swear againſt him; but alas! he was groſly miſtaken; for the <hi>Judge</hi> (Mr. <hi>Baron Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) told him, That <hi>Counterfeiting Money was High-Treaſon at Common Law,</hi> but <hi>Clipping</hi> was not; and by <hi>Common Law</hi> one <hi>Witneſs in Treaſon,</hi> as well as other Offences, was deem'd Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. By the <hi>Statutes</hi> indeed (<hi>primo Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>Two Witneſſes</hi> are required in all ſorts of <hi>Treaſons:</hi> But afterwards the Statute, in 1. &amp; 2. of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary, cap.</hi> 11. reduces the Way of Tryal for Impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Counterfeiting the <hi>King's Coin,</hi> to the <hi>form accuſtomed</hi> before 1 of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. So that now the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Evidence for <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> and Evidence for <hi>Impairing,</hi> is this: The firſt being <hi>High Treaſon</hi> by <hi>Conmon Law,</hi> no more One Witneſs is required: The latter being made <hi>High-Treaſon by Act of Parliament,</hi> that <hi>Act</hi> requires <hi>Two Witneſſes.</hi> I ſhall not trouble you with any <hi>Tranſcript,</hi> it is but having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> and there you may receive further ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>That one Witneſs therefore will do for <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> by <hi>Common Law,</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> was pleaſed to declare it not only to be his own, but his <hi>Learned Brethren's</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43422:17"/>
conſiderative Opinion; and likewiſe produced Judge <hi>Hales</hi>'s Pleas of the Crown to the <hi>Jury,</hi> which ſhew'd, That that Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Judge</hi> gave the ſame Sence and Opinion in the Caſe, who was a moſt <hi>Eminent Lawyer,</hi> as well as a <hi>Great Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This voluntary Surrender of himſelf he often urg'd to me, as a plain Indication, as an undeniable Argument of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; but having confeſs'd to me (and which Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he, when interrupted by me, confirmed at the Gallows) his <hi>guiltineſs</hi> in <hi>Clipping</hi> and <hi>Coining,</hi> both before and after his frequent Deliverances, I told him, that the ill uſe he made of them had provoked <hi>the Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Sins</hi> of this and of another nature, being impenitently perſiſted in, had made them ripe for Puniſhment in this World, and that it was the <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> which would not permit him to live any longer upon Earth, and which had blinded and infatuated his Underſtanding; and that God would certainly overtake him with infinitely more fearful Storms of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in the World to come, if he laboured not earneſtly to reconcile himſelf unto Him before his departure, by a free and an entire confeſſion of his Sins, and a true and faithful Repentance for them. I deſir'd him, that (as he had been concern'd in an <hi>Honorary</hi> and <hi>Publick Office,</hi> but had in no wiſe anſwer'd the <hi>Character</hi> of it, his Life having all along been a <hi>contradiction</hi> to the Sacred Deſign and Holy End of its Inſtitution) he would leave ſomething in Writing behind him as a <hi>Monument</hi> of his hearty Sorrow and Repentance for the ſame; and that others might by him take an <hi>Example,</hi> and flee ſuch Vices as had brought him to ſuch a ſhameful End. This, I told him, was a very reaſonable requeſt, and nothing but what became a ſincere Penitent to do; but I could not perſwade him to any thing of this nature; he only deſir'd me, that, if I thought it expedient, I might diſcloſe to the World (and which is the reaſon of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) what he had confeſſed to me, and ſeem'd to wiſh heartily, that what he had done, and the Puniſhment he was like to undergo, might be of ſuch uſe to thoſe of the ſame
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43422:18"/>
               <hi>Function</hi> with himſelf, and to all others, as might influence them to the conſtant conſervation of <hi>Innocency,</hi> to be <hi>holy and righteous in all manner of Converſation.</hi> I duly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon him, from his Condemnation to his Death, and always, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after Divine Service,</hi> exhorted him (for alas! I could not extort one) to a thorow Confeſſion of all his Sins, and particularly of the Fact which he was to dye for, but he denied it then, and perſiſted in his Denial to the very laſt moment, That ever <hi>Roger Preſton</hi> coin'd for him 1300 <hi>l.</hi> in half a Years time (as he had ſworn) or that ever he was Privy either to his Clipping or Coining.</p>
            <p>Alas! he was horribly abus'd and impos'd upon by <hi>ſome,</hi> who for <hi>filthy Lucre's ſake,</hi> promis'd him, and gave him the greateſt Aſſurances of procuring him a <hi>Reprieve,</hi> ſo ſtrangely and unreaſonably, to the very moment of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Execution;</hi> did he buoy up himſelf with hopes of Life, upon the conſideration of ſuch Vain Promiſes, and the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> he himſelf had made, that the <hi>Powers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> did, I'm afraid, very little operate upon him. When he came indeed to the place of <hi>Execution,</hi> and ſaw a <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death</hi> ſtare him in the Face, he was, I believe, under the greateſt Trouble and Confuſion, and ſpoke to me more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately than ever he had done before, to pray for and with him. I told him nothing would make the <hi>Sacrifice of Prayer</hi> acceptable to God, but a confeſſion of all his Sins, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Fact he dy'd for; an abhorrency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of them; an hearty acknowledgment of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice;</hi> a cheerful reſignation of himſelf to God, and a being in Love and Charity with all the World. But, alas! after he had taken a ſolemn Leave of his Son, (the <hi>Sheriff</hi> having immediately before his Execution acquainted him with his <hi>Reprieve</hi>) and given him a <hi>Charge</hi> to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to his <hi>Mother,</hi> and the like, when he aſcended <hi>the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> inſtead of performing the Religious Duty I preſs'd him to, inſtead of imploring the Mercy and Forgiveneſs of God for his great and manifold Tranſgreſſions of the Laws, both
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43422:18"/>
Humane and Divine, and particularly for the Scandalous Life he had led, when being under the higheſt Obligations to the contrary, as having taken Holy Orders upon him; inſtead of expreſſing an Univerſal Love and a Catholick Charity, he did nothing but bitterly inveigh againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> the <hi>Jury,</hi> the <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and againſt <hi>the Clerk of Aſſize,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Records of his former Trials</hi> againſt him. Thus he died in the <hi>Pett;</hi> thus he expir'd rather in a Tramport of Rage and Fury, than with a Chriſtian Temper and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>But as he liv'd, ſo he was reſolv'd to dye;</hi> which ſhew'd a ſear'd and an inſenſate Conſcience, that through the long and cuſtomary practice of Wickedneſs and Vice, he was grown <hi>numb'd,</hi> or paſt feeling, that Darkneſs had vail'd his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that God had juſtly <hi>given him the Spirit of Slumber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'm heartily ſorry I can give no better an account, nor a more comfortable relation of him, though <hi>Charity</hi> commands to think the beſt, obliges to the moſt candid and favourable conſtruction.</p>
            <p>I pray GOD, that every one by his exemplary Puniſhment may be influenc'd and perſwaded to <hi>follow always that which is Good,</hi> ſo to exerciſe themſelves, as <hi>to have always a Conſcience void of Offence both towards God and men;</hi> and particularly <hi>all ſuch</hi> as are called to any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Office or Adminiſtration,</hi> that they may take heed to do the thing which is Right, that they may do all to the Glory of God, to the Honour of the Chriſtian Religion, and to the Reputation of their Holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by conſtantly living a Life of Holineſs and Purity: <hi>In doing this, they will ſave themſelves and them that hear them.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>There were Ten Perſons more executed with him, Two for the ſame <hi>Treaſon,</hi> who were both convicted by one and the ſame Witneſs <hi>R. P.</hi> They were Mr. <hi>Nicholas Battersby</hi> of the City of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Robert Cokeſon</hi> of <hi>Wakefield Woodſide</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Wakefield</hi> in the County of <hi>York,</hi> who both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the Fact they were condemn'd for. <hi>Cokeſon</hi> indeed ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43422:19"/>
to have ſome ſence of God and Religion, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if he were to have liv'd, would have become a new man: And though he abſolutely, to the laſt moment of his Life, denied the Fact which <hi>Preſton</hi> laid to his Charge, yet he did not deny, that he had been a great Clipper; but <hi>who</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated or furniſhed him with <hi>Money,</hi> that he would never in the leaſt declare.</p>
