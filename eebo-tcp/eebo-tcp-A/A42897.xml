            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Firſt is concerning the <hi>Author,</hi> who he is, and it is his deſire that his <hi>name</hi> should be concealed, not to put the Dr. into the <hi>Temptation</hi> of giving <hi>him</hi> a <hi>like</hi> occaſion of <hi>complaint,</hi> as he had done formerly to T G when having gotten the knowledge of his being the <hi>Author</hi> of a certain <hi>private</hi>

made by him, <hi>he published the ſaid Paper in Print with ſuch Characteriſtical notes of the Author, as might eaſily diſcover who he was, and in terms ſo invidious, as were apt to create the greatest Prejudice againſt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is, what <hi>determin'd</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> to make choice of this way of <hi>Dialogue</hi> between a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and a <hi>Non-Conformiſt,</hi> and I have heard him ſay, it was Dr St's conſtant acting of both <hi>parts</hi> in his Writings without any manner of <hi>Retractation;</hi> and no <hi>Method</hi> ſeemed more apt to make the Reader ſenſible of this <hi>Artifice,</hi> than to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the <hi>Parts</hi> to the <hi>Proper Perſons,</hi> and make <hi>each rehearſe</hi> for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Third is the <hi>Style,</hi> in which if the Dr chance to meet with <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe which he calls <hi>hard words,</hi> and which he ſaith <hi>he is ſo uſed to, that he</hi>

                     <hi>can eaſily paſſ them over,</hi> yet in caſe this good <hi>Reſolution</hi> should fail him, he can haue no <hi>juſt reaſon</hi> to complain, <hi>they</hi> being either <hi>All</hi> or the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of them as appears by the <hi>Citations</hi> in the Margent, <hi>tranſcribed</hi> from his own <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> and but the <hi>Echos</hi> of his own <hi>Reproaches.</hi> And I doubt not, but the

Reader after he hath conſidered all things, will find them to be much beneath the merits of his <hi>Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vapouring</hi> without cauſe, and the bitter <hi>Sarcaſms,</hi> with which he treats T. G. who for the <hi>moderation</hi> uſed by him in his <hi>Reply</hi> had gained the repute of a <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>modeſt Adverſary</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many <hi>Learned men</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, why ſome <hi>Paſſages</hi> are more <hi>largely</hi> inſiſted on in this Treatiſe, which the Reader perhaps will think did not deſerve the <hi>Pains</hi> that is beſtowed on them, and particularly that <hi>Religious</hi> Queſtion concerning the <hi>Heathen's Jupiter, whether according to the Fathers he were the true God or a Devil?</hi> But the <hi>great advantage</hi> the Dr thinks it to be to his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> to maintain him to be the <hi>true God,</hi> and the diſcuſſing this Point <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def. p.</hi> 24</note> to be ſo <hi>very material towards the true Vnderſtanding the nature of Idolatry,</hi> as to deem it worth the while to ſpend a <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>twelve Pages</hi> in giving a <hi>full account</hi> of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning it, is to be conſidered, as alſo his unreaſonable <hi>triumphing</hi> over his Adverſary for having aſſerted <hi>Jupiter</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94906:4"/>
according to the <hi>Fathers</hi> to be a <hi>devil,</hi> and the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> all this muſt make upon an unwary Reader, together with the <hi>great abuſe</hi> he puts upon the <hi>Fathers</hi> by <hi>mis-repreſenting</hi> their Senſe, and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting</hi> their words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is shown in the <hi>Third Part</hi> of this Treatiſe <hi>Dial.</hi> 3.</p>

                        <p>Marry, that <hi>there are three kinds of Idolatry The one is, when the true God is worshipped by other means and wayes, than he hath preſcribed, or would be worshipped. The other is when

                        <p>I know Dr. St. ſaith <hi>his meaning</hi> is, <hi>when God is worshipped against his expreſſ Command:</hi> but the words to me ſeem not ſo much to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> the giuing that <hi>wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> which he hath <hi>expreſsly forbidden;</hi> as the giving him <hi>any</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which he hath not <hi>expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To this it is anſwered by Dr. St. firſt <hi>that no true Proteſtant can ſwear blind Obedience to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in all things. That euery one hath a</hi> Judicium priuatae diſcretionis, <hi>which is the Rule of practice as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and though we freely allow a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall Power vnder Chriſt in the Governours of the Church, yet that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to an obligation vpon men to go againſt the dictates of their own reaſon and conſcience. Their power is only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue, and declaratiue, and in matters of duty can bind no more than reaſon and euidence brought from Scripture by them doth.</hi> Again <hi>if the Governours muſt be Judges, what things are lawful what not, their power will be abſolute; for to be ſure what euer they command, they will ſay is lawful either in it's ſelf, or as they command it: If euery priuate perſon must iudge what is lawfull, what not, which is commanded; (as when all is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94906:48"/>
ſaid, euery man will be his own Judge in this caſe, in things concerning his own welfare) then he is no further bound to obey, than he iudgeth the thing to be lawful which is commanded. And for the plea of an erroneous conſcience, that takes not off the obligation to follow the dictates of it: for as he is bound to lay it down, ſuppoſing it erroneous; ſo he is bound not to go againſt it while it is not laid down.</hi> But then again — <hi>Did not the Pope plead to be a lawfull Governour? And if men are bound to ſubmit to the determination of Church-Governours, as to the lawfulneſſe of things, they were bound to beleeue him in that as well as other things, and ſo ſeparation from that Church</hi> (that is, the Church of Rome) <hi>was vnlawfull then.</hi> Where vpon he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that <hi>let men turn and wind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which way they will, by the very ſame Arguments, that any will proue Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church of Rome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe she required vnlawful things, as conditions of her Communion, it will be proued lawful, not to conform to any ſuſpected or vnlawfull practice, required by any Church-Governours, vpon the ſame terms? if the thing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,

be after ſerious and ſober inquiry, iudged vnwarrantable by a Man's own Conſcience.</hi> Laſtly, he addes, <hi>that withall, it would be further conſidered, whether when our beſt Writers againſt the Papiſts do lay the imputation of Schiſm, not on thoſe who withdraw Communion, but on them for requiring ſuch conditions of Communion (whereby they did rather eiect men out of their Communion, than the others ſeparate f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is what vpon Second thoughts (for the term expreſsly was not in his firſt Answer) he undertakes to prove: And I cannot but wonder, ſaith he, to ſee it drop now from his Pen, who on the other ſide aſſerts Scripture (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Expreſs Scripture) to be his moſt certain Rule of Faith, and on the other ſide denies, (as hath been shewed aboue) any thing to be an Article of Faith which is not acknowledged to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf. What may the meaning of this be? If it be expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed in Scripture that God is not to be worshipped by an Image, it is an Article of Faith, If it be not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94906:65"/>
to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf, it is no Article of Faith but (as he calls it) an Inferiour Truth or Pious Opinion, yet ſuch as neither himſelf, nor any man elſe according to his Principles ought to belieue there is a Iot of Truth in it. Here vpon he calls vpon the Dr. to ſpeak out. <hi>Is it, or is it not an Article of Faith? If it be an Article of Faith, t'is falſe what he aſſerts ſo ſtiffly in his Rational Account p.</hi> 54. <hi>that the Church of England makes no Articles of Faith, but what are acknowledged to be ſuch by Rome it ſelf. If it be not an Article of Faith, t'is falſe what he affirms ſo poſitiuely here, that God hath expreſsly prohibited it in the</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                              <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And which ſide ſoeuer he takes, tis manifeſt he contradicts himſelf.</hi> Here was Prouocation enough for Dr. St. to cleer himſelf. But T. G. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>Perhaps his meaning is, ſaith he, that what at one time is but an Inferiour Truth, muſt at another time be an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, according as it may ſerue to the different ends and purpoſes he hath deſigned to himſelf. And here, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, ſaith T. G. lies the Knack, or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94906:66"/>
(if you will giue it ſo venerable a name) the Myſtery of the buſineſs. When the Hedge of the Church of England (viz, Suſcription to her 39. Articles) muſt be broken down for the Good Brethren the Non-Conformiſts (pray pardon me, if I repeat his words) to enter in and ravage without ſcruple her Rights and Reuenues, ſo many of the ſaid Articles, as are not owned by Rome it ſelf, muſt paſs for a company of Inferiour Truths, or Pious Opinions, not, to be aſſented to, but not to be oppoſed for Unitie's ſake. But when the Church of Rome is to be charged with Idolatry (the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſaith Mr. Thorndike, with which Ignorant Preachers driue their factions) then they are no more Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Truths, but Articles of Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly reuealed in Holy Scripture. Now would an Impartial Reader (to uſe Dr. Taylor's expreſſion vpon another occaſion) ſay vpon his Conſcience, that this was not kindly done, to make vſe of the Authority of the Church of Rome, to vnhallow ſo many of the 39. Articles, as are not owned by her, and caſt them down into the claſs of Inferiour Truths, to ſtich vp the Rent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94906:66"/>
made by the Non-Conformiſts from the Church of England: And then to conſecrate them again ſo eaſily by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that one Definitiue word [expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] into diuine Reuelations, againſt the Church of Rome, to make the Breach of the Church of England from her, yet wider. But what cannot an Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal complyance with one Party; and a Polemical Animoſity, or (as Mr. Thorndike calls it Faction) againſt another doe? when the ſame Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it reſpects the former shall be ranked only amongſt Inferiour Truths, which none are obliged to aſſent to; and as it may ſerue to oppugn the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shal be raiſed to an Article of Faith, which all are bound to belieue. Here then ſaith he, lyes the Myſtery, that the ſame Propoſition, viz <hi>that God is not to be worshiped by an Image,</hi> taken Irenically and in its Pacifick temper, is but an Inferiour Truth, becauſe not owned to be an Article of Faith by the Church of Rome: but taken Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, and in its warlike Humour, it muſt be an Article of Faith, becauſe expreſsly (as Dr. St. ſaith) revealed in ſcripture.

The firſt part touches not the worship of Images, or of God himſelf by them, but only the making them, and giues matter to Divines to diſpute, whether it be forbidden by this Commandment to make any Image or any likeneſs at all; a thing in which Proteſtants are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as well as Catholicks. The ſecond forbids indeed in expreſs terms to bow our ſelues down to the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (as the Heathens did) but ſpeaks not one word of the lawfulneſs or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that if to treat a matter expreſsly, be not the ſame in other words, as not to ſpeak of it at all, it is manifeſt, that to worship God himſelf before or by an Image, is not expreſsly prohibited by this Commandment This T. G. deſires his Proteſtant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (he should haue ſaid Puritan) to conſider well, and not ſuffer Puritan) to be deluded wish the ſound of words. Is it all, one, ſaith he to bow our ſelues down to the Images themſelues without any Relation to God, and to worship God himſelf by bowing before an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge? The difference is too palpable not

to be ſeen by any one who hath not the natural Conceptions of his mind cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by an ouer eager deſire to purſue at any rate ſo vniuſt and vncharitable a charge, as that of Idolatry. The Iews we know gaue worship to God by bowing down before the Ark and the Cherubins, and yet they did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them inſtead of God: And if Dr. St. will needs contend, that this was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpenſation to the Iews, that they might lawfully bow down to or before the Ark and Cherubins to give worship to God, he muſt acknowledg the Precept (if it were ſo) as to that part, viz, of not worshipping God by bowing before an Image, not to haue been Natural, for then God had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with them to commit Real Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; but Ceremonial only, and ſo not to oblige Chriſtians, vnleſs he wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them alſo in the obſervance of all the Ceremonial part of the Law of Moſes.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94906:74"/>
becauſe <hi>Excommunicated</hi> Perſons, ſuch as <hi>Idolaters</hi> are, being depriued of <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority</hi> themſelues, can giue none to others; and if thoſe others take <hi>any</hi> vpon them, it muſt be <hi>vſurped</hi> and <hi>vnlawful;</hi> no man can <hi>giue</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he hath <hi>not</hi> in himſelf: and vpon this Principle it is, that the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clarendon</hi> in his late <hi>Excellent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of Leviathan</hi> p. 40. 41. affirms, that <hi>this ſole Propoſition, that men cannot dispoſe of their own liues, hath been alwaies held as a manifeſt and vndenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument, that Soveraigns neuer had, nor can haue their power from the People; becauſe it is without doubt, that no man is</hi> Dominus vitae ſuae <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot giue that to another, which he hath not in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94906:74"/>
Argument preſs much <hi>more home,</hi> For, maintaining as he does in that Book, <hi>that no particular Form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is</hi> de Jure Divino <hi>but mutable as the ſecular Magiſtrate, with the aduice of learned and Experienced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, shall ſee convenient for State and Church; and particularly that the main ground for ſetling Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Nation, was not any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Divine Right, but Conveniency to the State and Condition of the Church at tbe time of it's Reformation, citing for it the Teſtimony of Arch Bp. Cranmer and others; This</hi> ſaith T. G. <hi>ſeems but too apparently to be a clinching of the Nail which he had driuen before to the head. For, if the Form of Church Government be mutable, as the Secular Power wel-adviſed shall ſee Reaſon, what greater Reaſon can there be, ſaith he, for the actual changing of Epiſcopacy, than the Nullity of it's Juriſdiction?</hi> And therefore <hi>wonders, how the Governours of tbe Church of England could ſee their Authority ſo cloſely attacqued (at leaſt ſo manifeſtly betrayed) by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Champion, and not vindicate themſelues and their Juriſdiction from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94906:75"/>
the foul ſtain of Antichristian, which neceſſarily follows, if the Church of Rome, as he pretends, be guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and they derive together with their Conſecration, their Epiſcopal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from it.</hi>

For we worship,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Prototype absolutely, that is, for it's own proper Excellency; but the Image only with a Relative worship,</hi> cultu ſolum reſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo, that is <hi>for the Excellency, not of the Image it ſelf, but of the Prototype,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94906:120"/>
which kind of worship</hi> (cultus) he affirms to be <hi>farr Inferiour to that other, which is Abſolute.</hi> Again <hi>we worship the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as that to which we owe that worship, and to which we pay it as a debt, and in order to which it is an act of Juſtice. But we do not worship the Image ſo, but as the term of that worship which we owe to another, that is, the Prototype.</hi>

For this would be a foolish lye &amp;c.
