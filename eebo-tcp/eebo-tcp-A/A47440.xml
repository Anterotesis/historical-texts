         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A

<hi>St. Patrick's Church,</hi>
DUBLIN,
On the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1690. Before the Right Honourable the LORDS

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE great Respect and Reverence which
is universally paid by the whole Church
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Author of this Sermon
(who His Majesty has been graciously pleas'd to
advance to the Bishoprick of <hi>Londonderry)</hi> and of
whom we here in <hi>England</hi> have large Accounts from
those who have come from that Kingdom; made
me think it would be no unacceptable thing, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
this Sermon which was receiv'd with so great
applause at <hi>Dublin:</hi> But this is all personal to the
Author. The Book it self needs not any Foreign
recommendations drawn from Favour or Concern,
for the Person who writ it: For here are many
particular Matters of Fact hinted at, relating to the
<hi>Irish</hi> Affairs, which are little known amongst us;
and the Causes of their and our late Miseries and
Distractions are so distinctly and methodically set
down, that tho very many of them are generally
known, and commonly talked of, and many more
<pb facs="tcp:94727:3"/>
have been of a long time fufficiently guessed at by
thoughtful and inquisitive Men; yet such Books
can never be useless or unpleasant, which set those
things all together in one continued Light, that
before for the most part lay dispersed in the Minds
of those who read them.</p>
            <p>They that read the Sermon, will find other
Beauties in it which will sufficiently please them:
Every thing is described in such moving and lively
Colours, that it was but a common piece of justice
to so great and so good a Man, to Reprint a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which will assuredly convince the Nation,
That the great esteem which is paid to him in his
own Countrey, proceeds neither from want of
Judgment, nor from an over-great Partiality.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
HENRY Lord SIDNEY,
Viscount SHEPPY;
AND
THO. CONNINGS BY, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
Lords Justices of IRELAND.</head>
            <opener>May it please Your Lordships,</opener>
            <p>THIS Sermon was at first Composed, and is now Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with peculiar Respect to Their Majesties Subjects in
this Kingdom. Those in <hi>England</hi> who had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Enquiry and Correspondence, need not the Informations
here offered. But the Protestants of this Kingdom have been so
long and industriously kept in the Dark, and not suffered to look
into the Designs of those that had them in Subjection, farther than
they felt the effects of them, that many may be Strangers to the
full extent of those Designs, and the Miraculous Steps of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by which they have been delivered from them.</p>
            <p>I know much more might be said, and has been said on this
Subject. But I have chosen those Points that seemed to me most
proper for the Occasion. And, I hope, enough to satisfy us all
of the great reason we have to praise God for our wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
which was the design of the Discourse.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships can witness what sense the Protestants of this
City have of it; and for ought appears, the whole body of them
through the Kingdom, are in their Present Majesties Interest to
a Man. Which could never have happened, if the late Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been in any measure Tolerable to them. And had others,
<pb facs="tcp:94727:4"/>
instead of being at ease where they were at that time, lived here
under the Government they fancied so Indulgent, I doubt not but
they would have had the same sentiments with us, and been cured
of their Folly.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships have come to the Government of this Kingdom
in an Ill and Vnsetled Posture of Affairs: but you need look back
only to Presidents in each of your own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to guide your Management with
the happiest Success.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> five times Chief Governor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Years 1557, and 1578. <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> three times Lord Justice between the Years 1582, and 1600.</note> Your Ancestors go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
it in Times as difficult as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and had the chiefest part in reforming
the Superstition and Barbarity of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and in setling Religion on that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
foot, on which it has since stood; but they, and all since, have
been forced to leave the Work imperfect: It remains now, I hope,
to be perfected by you.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships may reasonably conclude, that it is not an easie
undertaking to Civilize and Reform this Nation, since so great
Persons were not able to perfect it. And yet that it is to be done,
because they went so far in it. For want of a vigorous prosecution
it has been to do a-new every forty years hitherto. Your Lordships
have the Experience of many such Periods to direct you how to do
it effectually. We hope, and heartily pray, that it may now at
last have its accomplishment in Your hands under Their Majesties
Government; and that this may be one of the blessings of Their
Reign, Providence has given you an opportunity of making your
Selves, and your Memory, grateful to present and future Ages,
by becoming happy Instruments in it. That you may be such, I
hope your Lordships will believe is by none more zealously desired
than by,</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. 107. 2d verse. Old Translation.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed, and

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THanksgiving is all the Tribute we can pay to Heaven;
and 'tis so easie a return for our Beings, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Comforts we receive from thence, that he is very
inexcusable and unworthy the Mercies he receives, who is
backward in so easie an acknowledgment: hence the whole
World has ever look'd on it as the securest way for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their present, and procuring new Blessings, to own God
to be the Author of them, and to express their gratitude in
<hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and in other Acts of Devotion and
Thanksgiving, as appears not only from the People of God
in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> but likewise from the yet remaining
Devotions of the Ancient Heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94727:5"/>
This <hi>Psalm</hi> is a solemn form used by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church on
such occasions: 'Tis not material to explain to you the first
occasion of its being made; it sufficiently appears from my
Text (which is the Introduction to it) that it was designed
as a solemn return of Praise to God for redeeming the <hi>Israelites</hi>
from Captivity, for delivering them from their Enemies, and
bringing them back to their own Country, whence they had
been driven by Violence and Oppression, <hi>vers.</hi> 39, 40.</p>
            <p>Now this is so exactly our Case, and the design of our
present appearing in this place, that I think there is no more
incumbent on me, than to endeavour to beget in you a due
sense of it, and to stir you up to an hearty acknowledgment
of God's present Mercies to us; and I promise my self some
success in this undertaking, and that the consideration of the
following Particulars will make the same impression on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body concerned, as it hath done on me.</p>
            <p>First therefore, Let us consider our <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Secondly, The <hi>Returns</hi> we are obliged to make for it.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Deverance</hi> we ought to reflect,</p>
            <p>I. On the depth of the Contrivance and Design against
us, from which God has graciously been pleased at this time
to deliver us.</p>
            <p>II. On the great extent of it. All Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> especially
such as profess the Reformed Religion, being struck at by it.</p>
            <p>III. On the miraculous Concurrence of Providences for
our deliverance, in breaking this Design so deeply laid, and
vigorously prosecuted.</p>
            <p>You all have suffered so much by this Design, and the
memory of your Dangers and Deliverance from it is so fresh
before you, that I need not trouble you with the particulars
of it: 'Twas, in short, to destroy you and your Religion, and
enslave all <hi>Europe</hi> under the Tyranny of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>I. The depth of this Design appears, 1st, From the length of
time, wherein it has been formed and carrying on. Some, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94727:5"/>
not without reason, date it from the very beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
some from the Restauration of the Royal Family,
and some from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace; but as it immediately
concerns these Kingdoms, we can trace it by many Foot-steps
from the Year 1670. since which time, not only we, but all
<hi>Europe,</hi> have groaned under the fatal effects of it: As to this
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we find a Scheme of it laid down at large
in a Paper formerly found in the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnell</hi>'s House;
then Collonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> dated <hi>July</hi> 1671. supposed to be drawn
up by his Brother <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> then Titular Archbishop of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and accidently dropt about that time; several Copies
of which have for many years been in Protestants hands. In
this Paper are proposed, The modelling the Army. The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Papists</hi> into Corporations. The bringing them to serve
in Civil and Military Imployments, and the raising a vast Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of them to be transported into <hi>England</hi> on occasion.</p>
            <p>One Particular in this Paper is remarkable. 'Tis in these
words; <hi>The Toleration of the Roman Catholick Religion in</hi>
England <hi>being granted, and the Insolency of the</hi> Hollanders <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down, a Confederacy with</hi> France, <hi>which can influence</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>as</hi> Scotland <hi>can also, will together by God's blessing make
his Majesty's Monarchy Absolute and Real:</hi> Where we see that
the Design was to make the King Absolute; and the means
proposed, Toleration of <hi>Popery,</hi> a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> and a
League with <hi>France,</hi> all which were at that time put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and have been prosecuted vigorously to this Day.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> We shall better understand the depth of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against us, if we reflect on the Power, Policy, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Persons engaged. The Power and Money of <hi>France,</hi>
the Cunning and Craft of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> the numerous and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted
Roman Clergy, the Wealth and Arms of <hi>England,</hi>
were all to be employed to our Ruine; the Indigent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
<hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were to be armed, and let loose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us: The Common Enemy of Christians, the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94727:6"/>
Ravaging <hi>Tartars</hi> were called into Christendom to promote
this Design, and their destructive methods of managing
Wars by universal Slaughters, havock and burnings, brought
into practice by the more Unchristian <hi>French:</hi> and to Crown
their Design for the general Slavery and Desolation of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
Protestants were cajoled, bribed or compelled to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
persecute and devour one another. All which might
be proved by undeniable Instances, if this Sermon were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for a History.</p>
            <p>But <hi>3dly,</hi> We may have a further Idea of the depth of this
Contrivance from which God has hitherto delivered us, if we
consider the Methods used for effecting it: Had it been hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Hell, it could not have been more a mystery of Iniquity
than it was; more Black and Villanous means could not have
been applied to bring it to perfection.</p>
            <p>For <hi>1st,</hi> We find Wicked and Treacherous Leagues and
Conspiracies entred into in order to carry it on: One of which
is more especially notorious and remarkable for its folly and
falshood; A League so contrary to all sense as well as faith, that
the great Princes concerned in it are yet ashamed to own it; a
League so mischievous to <hi>Europe</hi> in general, and so destructive
to <hi>England</hi> in particular, that it has brought them to the very
brink of destruction: and it is only God's miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that could, or yet can preserve them: A League that
broke the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> so carefully preserved by our
wise Forefathers, and by that means has advanced one, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
and sinking all the rest. This is that fatal <hi>Confederacy
with France,</hi> proposed in the forementioned Paper: These are
the <hi>Engagements of Friendship and Alliance</hi> which Monsieur
<hi>D' Avaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, tells the States of <hi>Holland,</hi>
in his Memorial of <hi>September 9. 1688<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King his Master had
with the King of Great Britain:</hi> This is the Secret Treaty Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<hi>Primi</hi> tells us <hi>his Britannick Majesty signed in the Year 1670.
whereby he should have secured to him an absolute Authority over
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94727:6"/>
his Parliament, and the re-establishment of the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholik
Religion in his three Kingdoms:</hi> This is the <hi>Alliance with
France</hi> which <hi>Maloony</hi> the Popish Bishop of <hi>Killaloo</hi> in a Letter
of his to Bishop <hi>Tyrest</hi> of <hi>March 8th.</hi> 1689. (the Original
whereof was found amongst the Bishop's Papers, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be produced) is so very angry that some <hi>Trimmers</hi> (as
he calleth them) <hi>obliged</hi> King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>disown;</hi> and this is
the very source and fountain of all the present Calamities of
<hi>Europe,</hi> but more particularly of ours.</p>
            <p>A second method of carrying on of this Conspiracy to
Ruin us, was by corrupting Ministers, by granting large Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and multiplying Bribes. I wish this means of promoting
this wicked design had stopped at Ministers, and that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Princes had set them above the suspicion of taking
Bribes; for we are willing to think that it should be below the
Majesty of a Crowned head to turn Pensioner, or to sell his
Crown or People for <hi>Louis d' Ors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third means for carrying on this Contrivance against us,
was Murthering and Poysoning; an Art too much practised of
late in some Courts: and 'tis observable, that wherever the
Life of a <hi>Protestant</hi> stands between a <hi>Papist</hi> and an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it is of no long continuance; nor doth any Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to appear vigorous or terrible to <hi>France,</hi> but he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be taken off in the prime of his age, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
suspicion of foul play; witness Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> There is much Gold in <hi>France,</hi>
and there are every where wicked men ready to be bribed to
do any thing; and 'tis not supposed of some, that they scruple
much to make the experiment what it is able to do.</p>
            <p>But <hi>4thly,</hi> Where they could not Murther <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes,
(it is hard to say where they have not attempted it) they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to defeat them of their Succession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We all are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that this was the only womb that conceived a Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> for us, and gave him a Birth. There was an attempt of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94727:7"/>
the same kind in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which did not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to their mind; but time and experience make men wiser;
hence it is that the contrivance that proved abortive then, did
with us come to perfection; but in such a manner, that at the
same rate (if allowed) we might be sure never to fail of an
Heir to defeat a <hi>Protestant</hi> Successor.</p>
            <p>A fifth means of promoting this design, was by calling the
<hi>Turk</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and by supporting that common Enemy of
Christianity to the ruin of those that profess the holy name of
Christ. And the <hi>French</hi> King, that he might embroil Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Sea as well as by Land, has made his Pride stoop to
his Interest, and condescended to buy a Peace with the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines,</hi>
Covenanting with them, to assist them in their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and their enslaving Christians. A Man and his designs
are known by his Friends and Confederates: Now the <hi>French</hi>
King's Allies are the <hi>Bandity</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Pirates</hi> of <hi>Algiers,</hi>
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the <hi>Tories</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> What
a mercy of God is it, to give us a Deliverance from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
and Designs of such Monsters!</p>
            <p>The depth of this Design appears from a sixth method used
to effect it, and that was to stir up and animate one party of
<hi>Protestants</hi> to bite and devour another. 'Tis not bare diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Opinion that makes men of different Sects so strange
and unsociable to one another, as we commonly observe them
to be; but their strangeness and enmity proceeds either from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or from some peculiar Principle that obliges them to
persecute and destroy all that differ from them, tho in a trifle.
Where neither of these happen, or where men of different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are not encouraged or suffered to hurt one another, we
see they live very easily and lovingly together, of which <hi>Holland</hi>
is an undeniable instance, and likewise this City under our late
common sufferings, in which the generality of <hi>Protestants</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their difference in Judgment, lived with much
mutual confidence and friendship: but it is a Principle of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94727:7"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that every Prince is obliged to root out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all <hi>Hereticks</hi> out of his Dominions, and that under no less
a penalty than Deposition. This is required of Princes by the
Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> and all <hi>Popish</hi> States and
Princes have been so true to it in their practice, that I do not
remember that there has been, nor believe that there is at this
present, any Prince or State of that Persuasion, who doth Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
any Religion besides their own in their Country, where
they are able to suppress it with safety to themselves: and they
have generally been so eager upon it, that many have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to their own destruction. No wonder therefore if their
Persons and Religion be very odious to men of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
since every body naturally hates one that is always
ready to do him a mischief. But I wish that they had kept this
Principle to themselves, and not industriously sowed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<hi>Protestants,</hi> among whom they first by their Emissaries
sow false Doctrines and raise Schisms, and then set up others
to persecute and destroy those whom they themselves have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
And when they have prevailed with one Party to bait,
worry and exasperate another to the height, they then take
them off for a time, and put the Rods and Axes into the hands
of the oppressed; and whilst they yet smart under their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they stir them up and encourage them to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on their persecutors. By which Arts they make the breach
irreconcilable and the difference, tho inconsiderable in it self,
to become the ground of an eternal Schism and Feud between
the parties whom they have thus dashed against one another.</p>
            <p>We all know that these were the methods used to set us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ears ever since the Reformation; and in the two
last Reigns 'twas particularly observable, that Toleration and
Persecution succeeded one another by turns, and were timed
just as they served most effectually to set People a madding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
one another. One day the Laws must all be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and none must be a favourite that would not be forward
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94727:8"/>
to execute them; the next day the Persecution must not only be
stopped, but the instruments of it exposed to the revenge of
those they had exasperated, and forced to take their turn in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
by the Actions and Law-suits of such as they had
wronged. Thus the common Conspirators against our Peace,
Liberty, and Religion, blow the coals and kindled a flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us that was like to devour us all: and 'tis God's great
mercy that we have escaped it. These are a few of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
which might be offered to shew the depth of this
design, from which our good God has graciously redeemed us.</p>
            <p>II. But I haste to the Second Head of my Discourse,
whence we may have occasion to magnify God's goodness in
our Deliverance; and that is from the extent of the design
against us, which was equal to its depth; it being of a vast
and comprehensive Nature.</p>
            <p>The true and great design was to satisfy the ambition of the
King of <hi>France</hi> by advancing him to the universal Monarchy of
the <hi>West: England</hi> might be cullied and wheedled with the
imaginary pleasure of <hi>Mastering</hi> his <hi>Parliament,</hi> of getting his
<hi>will of his People,</hi> and setling <hi>Popery: Holland</hi> with the hopes
of gain and a free Trade; The <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Emperor</hi> with the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretence of re-establishing the Catholick Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the
true and bottom-design was to enslave <hi>Europe,</hi> and to make
the <hi>French</hi> King as great and as pernicious to the <hi>Western</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and States, as the <hi>Turk</hi> has been to the <hi>Eastern.</hi> And they
did not miss the matter, who in the Emblem represented these
two as sawing the Globe asunder, whilst the King of <hi>England</hi>'s
part was to pour in Oil to make the work more easie for them:
a thing so destructive to the true interest of his Crown, that it
is a miracle how he could be prevailed on to accept of the
employment, much more how he should be able to prevail
with his Subjects to assist him in it. Whatever be pretended of
the stubborness or ungovernableness of the People of these
Nations; it certainly argued a very passive and submissive tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94727:8"/>
in them to give Money so liberally, and to Fight so fiercely
as they did, to destroy themselves and their fellow <hi>Protestants,</hi>
to make sport for their common adversaries, and serve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of their most inveterate and most dangerous enemy,
the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Design was universal, and aimed at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and enslaving all the Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe:</hi>
No distinction of <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Papist,</hi> Enemy or Ally. All were
equally devoted to destruction in it.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was actually turned out of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (his present Majesty) was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of his Principality of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Empire was partly to
be given up to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the remaining Princes were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to <hi>France</hi> for Protection, and to chuse his Son
King of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Dukedom of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to be brought
in under the notion of <hi>Pupillage.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were
frightned, bought, or wheedled out of their strong Holds; and
the Keys of their Country (such were <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al</hi> and <hi>Guastalla)</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>French</hi> hands <hi>Sicily</hi> was perswaded to Rebel, and sollicited to
serve the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as they had done the <hi>French</hi> before in the
famous Vespers, <hi>Genoa</hi> was to be Bombed, <hi>England</hi> bought, and
<hi>Holland</hi> drowned. <hi>Spain</hi> had a Barren Queen designedly made
so (as many believe) put upon him, that his Crown might
fall to <hi>France</hi> by Succession. The <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdoms, whose
cold and distance secured them from immediate attempts, were
yet taken off from assisting their Neighbours, and bought into
something worse than a neutrality. The great Contrivers and
Managers of these, were the <hi>French</hi> King, the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and I
need not name the third in the Triumvirate. 'Tis too much
that we groan yet under the mischievous effects of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy;
which has been no less pernicious to all <hi>Europe,</hi> than
that of <hi>Antony, Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> was to the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.
There is no doubt but all these have been designed,
attempted, and almost brought to perfection within these 20
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94727:9"/>
years by strength of this Confederacy: and there is not one
Prince or State in all <hi>Europe</hi> that has not been concerned in
the fatal effects thereof.</p>
            <p>But <hi>3dly.</hi> This design was levelled more immediately at the
destruction of the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Extirpation of the
Pestilent Northern Heresie</hi> has been long known to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Article in it, and was probably the pretence and bait that
induced his late Majesty to espouse it. He was not fonder of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>obeyed without reserve</hi> than of propagating his Religion; and
perhaps, he chiefly desired an absolute Authority over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that he might compel them to come into the Bosom of
his Church. What business had he with a standing Army, or
numerous Troops of Dragoons, but to employ them as Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
to convert his Heretical Subjects? The example of
<hi>France</hi> had taught him their use; and that Dragooning was a
much more effectual way to <hi>Reconcile</hi> men than Sermons, or
Arguments. In short, by this Conspiracy, the <hi>Protestants</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> are already destroyed: those of <hi>Savoy</hi> turned out of their
Country: those of <hi>Holland</hi> have been invaded, and forced to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themselves with their Waters. And as for us in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
need not tell you, how we have been used: The least hint is
sufficient to refresh your memories; and the danger we have
escaped, is yet so near, that it supersedes all necessity of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
It has been said of some, that when they have been
shewed the next morning the danger they escaped in the night,
they have died with apprehension. I am sure no Precipice can
have a more dreadful prospect to those that have escaped it,
than our danger ought to have, and will have to all that duly
consider, and look back on it. But God has Redeemed, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us out of our Enemies hands: He has brought us back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our own Land, and we are now before him this Day to
Magnifie him for our Deliverance. Let us therefore joyn in that
which is the burthen of this Psalm, <hi>O that men would Praise the
Lord for his goodness, and Declare the wonders he doth for the
Children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94727:9"/>
But <hi>4thly.</hi> This Conspiracy had a peculiar respect to the Free
States of <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Twas about the time of the entring into this
League, that famous saying was applied to <hi>Holland, Delenda est
Carthago.</hi> It was pretended to be of ill consequence to Princes
and Crowned Heads, to let a Common-Wealth be their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
lest the fight and example of Liberty might influence their
People: they combined therefore to destroy them, that the slaves
of <hi>France</hi> might not understand, that there was a milder Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World, than the Tyranny of their Master. If his
present Majesty cou'd have been prevailed on to come into the
Confederacy, he needed not have ventured his Life to rescue
<hi>England,</hi> and merited a Crown by such hazardous undertakings.
He might have been a King out of hand in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and secured of his Succession to the <hi>English</hi> Throne, but he
scorned Crowns of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s giving: much more one, that he
cou'd not take without injuring his Country; the Liberty of
which is due to his Ancestors, and the Preservation of it to
Himself. But when they cou'd not corrupt, they resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him; and that more particularly because they look'd on
him, as the Patron and Defender of the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> to
which they on all occasions declared their enmity. 'Tis not
imaginable, with what Passion and Zeal their whole Party
here used to enlarge on the Praises of an Absolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how impatient they were to hear any one name to
them the Laws, the Liberty of the Subjects, or a Common-Wealth.
No, the King's Will was the only Law they cou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to hear of, and they mightily admired, and praised the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
temper of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that counted themselves
happy to be under a Power, which when it pleased might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them with a Bow-string. They did not mince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but openly professed, that they designed to free the King
from the chains of the Laws, and the Pupilage of Parliaments: or
as the <hi>Irish</hi> Proposals, I mentioned before, word it, <hi>make his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
absolute and real.</hi> The very terms of the League, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94727:10"/>
to Abbot <hi>Primi,</hi> were to <hi>secure</hi> to the King <hi>an Absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over his Parliament, and the Re-establishment of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Religion in the three Kingdoms of</hi> England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>But <hi>5thly.</hi> This Confederacy, or rather Conspiracy, had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
relation to <hi>Ireland.</hi> The great Body and Magazine of Men,
whose hands were to perform this Work in these Kingdoms,
were to be raised out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> The <hi>Irish Proposals,</hi> I have so
often mentioned, promise 150000, part of them were to be
the King's immediate Guards; part of them the standing Army
of <hi>England;</hi> and all of them the Instruments of our slavery. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make them considerable, and to hire them to do their
work cheerfully, <hi>Ireland</hi> was to be seperated from the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> and made independant on it. The <hi>English</hi> interest
in it was to be destroyed, and the <hi>Protestants,</hi> under the notion
of <hi>Whigs, Fanaticks, Cromwelians,</hi> rooted out of it. How near
these things were to taking effect, you all can witness, they
were not only designed and attempted, but actually, for the
most part, executed upon us; our Estates were taken away,
and this Kingdom cut off from <hi>England</hi> by Acts past in their
late <hi>pretended Parliament,</hi> our Houses were filled with Soldiers
and Dragoons, our Churches possessed by <hi>Romish</hi> Priests, our
Persons shut up in Prisons, and our Religious Assemblies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.
Our Friends and Relations, our Nobility, Gentry, and
Clergy, driven, for the most part, out of the Kingdom, attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Life and Estates, and an Army ready to be transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>England,</hi> if God had not put a stop to their Designs,
and confounded their Devices. 'Tis by his Mercy <hi>we are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from the Lands from the North, and from the South,</hi>
and therefore let us give Thanks unto him, and Praise him.</p>
            <p>You see then the Extent of this Design, that it took in all the
Princes and States of <hi>Europe;</hi> that it struck at our Estates, our
Liberty, our Lives, and above all at our Religion; that it was
carried on by many and powerful hands, and by the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94727:10"/>
and efficacious methods. And who else cou'd defeat such a
contrivance or put a stop to it, but the same God that bounds
the Sea with a heap of dust, and says to the Waves thereof, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall you come and no further?</p>
            <p>III. Which is a proper Introduction to my third Head, the
miraculous Concurrence of Providences for our Deliverance, in
breaking this Design so deeply laid, and vigorously prosecuted.
These were so many and so remarkable, that I doubt whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Revolution was accompanied with a chain of such strange
and unaccountable Accidents. I shall mention only a few,
that every body must have observed, and leave you to judge,
whether the Finger of God must not be acknowledged in
them.</p>
            <p>First therefore, It was strangely unaccountable, that the <hi>Pope,</hi>
who seemed to have a great stake and interest in this Design,
and, as one wou'd imagine, was most deeply concerned in the
success of it, should upon a trifle break with the <hi>French</hi> King;
and not only desert his Party, but most cordially espouse the
opposite side: and that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who never before
stuck at any thing when interest was in the case, upon the
World's counting it base or wicked, shou'd refuse his Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common Justice in Matters of so little moment as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi>
and <hi>Franchises.</hi> It is plain, that the <hi>Pope</hi> has right on his
side in both these, and that the <hi>French</hi> King was not much
concerned either in profit or honour to defend them: The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi>
being a new Usurpation, and the <hi>Franchises</hi> an ancient
Nusance: yet so obstinate have both sides proved in the contest,
that we hope 'tis become irreconcilable. Now if this had not
happened, the Counter-League of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to the
<hi>French</hi> Conspiracy cou'd hardly have been entred into or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
'tis this takes off the odium from the Emperour and
King of <hi>Spain</hi> of assisting his present Majesty to redeem <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and deprives the <hi>French</hi> King of the advantages he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to himself by declaring this a War of Religion: It being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94727:11"/>
rediculous to pretend a Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> War against the Father and Head
of his Church. This aversion of the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> designs is
an obstacle in the way that neither <hi>Lewis</hi> nor <hi>James,</hi> can yet get
over, tho the one begs hard, and the other offers fair to remove it:
Having profered the <hi>Pope</hi> all that he desired at first, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the <hi>French</hi> Clergy to own his Infallibility into the bargain.</p>
            <p>Thus God shews, that the hearts of Kings are in his hands:
that he can make them stoop and do mean things, when it
will do them no good; and obstinate when yielding would be
serviceable to them. It cannot but be esteemed a further Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that two <hi>Popes</hi> should succeed one another of the same
humour, which is not common, and should persevere in the same
enmity to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly.</hi> It must be owned as a signal piece of Providence
in God to have raised up a Man endued with the Courage,
Closeness, and Activity of his present Majesty: Who durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
so strange, and inhumane probability, such an impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
thing as our Deliverance. 'Tis a rare thing in the World
that one Man should have the dexterity to engage, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to manage so many different Interests into a Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and argues a particular Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> It was another piece of Divine ordering, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should be so particularly interessed and engaged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this Work before it was too late, and our destruction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.
If we had gone on a few years in the course in which
we were, in all probability our condition would have become
altogether desperate. But the eagerness of the Conspirators to
cut off their present Majesties from all hopes of Succession to
the Crown, made them introduce a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> two or three
years sooner than they were ready for him: they knew very
well when he appeared, the persons concerned would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to the height; and that then, if ever, their present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
must appear for their Right, and the Kingdoms for their
Deliverance; against which they were not as yet prepared: for

they had not yet sufficiently trained the <hi>Irish,</hi> nor filled the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Papists:</hi> for want of which they were not
able to make any resistance against the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
awakened him before they were prepared for him, and
necessiated him to make his descent into <hi>England,</hi> whil'st the
Arms were still for the most part in the <hi>Protestants</hi> hands, and
the <hi>Papists</hi> in no capacity to awe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The very pretended Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was
so ill managed, that it was not so much as a well contrived
Cheat. The very <hi>Papists</hi> complained of it, and that publickly
in Print. There was published here, amongst many others
under the late Government, a Virulent Paper against his
present Majesty, Entituled, <hi>England's Crisis, or the World well
amended.</hi> To give it the greater credit, the Author pretends to
be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and the evidence of truth forced from him this
following passage. <hi>One reason of his</hi> (the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s)
<hi>Expedition had at least a shew of Justice in the Quarrel; I mean
the business of the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>which I cannot but confess,
some People managed, as if they designed either that we should not
believe at all, or if we did, our belief should be as implicit as to
Successions and Inheritances here, as that of the Romanist is in his
expectation of Inheriting the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter.</hi> This,
it is true, they imputed to the Treachery of Councellors and
Managers: But when their Zealots writ, and King <hi>James</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
such Accounts of that Matter to be published, 'tis a sign
the business needed an Apology; and that by God's just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on them, their usual dexterity failed them in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> It was a peculiar Providence in this Affair, that King
<hi>James</hi> did not adhere determinately to any Councels or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors;
but did things irresolutely and by halves. I find <hi>Papists</hi>
in their Letters to him complaining of this, and cautioning
him against it; one intreats him for <hi>God's sake, not to listen to
trimming Councellors, whose aversion to his Religion, and cunning
design of spinning out his Life with their</hi> Pian Piano <hi>put them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94727:12"/>
upon urging to him, that great alterations are dangerous, when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
otherwise, than by slow and inperceptible degrees.</hi> The same
tells him, that <hi>nothing causes irresolution more than a medley of
Councellors of a different Religion from their Prince,</hi> yet King
<hi>James</hi> could never free himself from this <hi>Medley:</hi> And that is
the reason that his Actions were never of a piece; and that
he commonly spoiled his business by doing too much, and yet
too little; thus he ought either not to have brought any <hi>Irish</hi>
or <hi>French</hi> into his Army, or made the whole intirely <hi>Papists.</hi>
He ought either to have accepted the <hi>French</hi> King's Assistance
and Fleet without reserve, or else broken with him altogether,
and declared against him: But by hanging between both he
lost the affections of his own Subjects, which might have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him, and the benefit of Foreign Assistance, his doing and
undoing things had the same effect, in which, and many other
particulars, his not sticking intirely to one sort of Councellors
was to us a great Providence.</p>
            <p>I must reckon it as a sixth, That the States of <hi>Holland</hi> should
without scruple trust their All into His Majesty's Hand, and be
content to run his fortune; which they plainly did in his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
We all know that the <hi>Vnited Netherlands</hi> are a free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
most Jealous of their Liberty, and who have done and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
more to maintain it, than perhaps any Nation in the
World. And as they are jealous of their Liberty, so they are close
and wary, and not apt to venture too much at one slake. Now
that such a People should commit the absolute disposal of their
<hi>Navy, their Armies, and their Money, the very Sinews of their
State,</hi> to one Man, and venture all in the same Bottom with
him, was an <hi>unbounded Trust and Kindness,</hi> as his Majesty himself
is said to have expressed it to them. They trusted not only him,
but the Winds and Seas for his sake: And tho' they had such
intire confidence in his Conduct and Faith, as not to ask him
what he designed, yet the hazard of a Winter-Voyage, where
the whole of their State was at once exposed to the Mercy of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94727:12"/>
a Tempest, was sufficient to have stumbled them, had not the
same God, that inclined the hearts of <hi>Israel</hi> as of one man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>David,</hi> knit their hearts to him and made them tender
of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> where they without hesitation ventured
their State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly.</hi> It must be owned as an effect of the same Providence,
that King <hi>James</hi>'s Court and Ministers were so blinded, that they
could not see into his present Majesty's designs: And so secure
that they would not give credit to the many Advices given
them of these Preparations, of which we can give no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than that of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 5. 13. <hi>He taketh the wise in their
own craftiness, and the councel of the froward is carried headlong;
they meet with darkness in the day, and grope in the noonday, as
in the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>8thly.</hi> I shall only mention King <hi>James</hi>'s deserting his Army
in <hi>England,</hi> on which if he had absolutely cast himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on their Fidelity, it is certain by what has happened
since, that a great part of them would have stood by him. There
were enough to make a vigorous Opposition, who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to run his Fortune, if God had not enfeebled their
Courage, and put fear in their Hearts. It was this opened the
way to one of the greatest Revolutions that ever happened in
that Kingdom, almost without a drop of blood; which must be
owned as a singular Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9thly.</hi> It was an over-reaching act of Providence, to make
that the Key to open a way for our settlement, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by our Enemies, as the certain means to embroil us for
ever. I suppose no body doubts, but those who advised King
<hi>James</hi> to desert the Kingdom, believed, that we could never
come to a settlement without him: and yet the event proved
directly contrary to their expectation; for his presence in all
probability had been such a rub to our settlement, that it had
not been easie to get over it. It was indeed strange we should
come to a Resolution so soon, especially where the weight of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94727:13"/>
matter was so great, and the opinions of men so divided, that
in the near equality of voices, the wisest could not foresee how
it would end, till Heaven it self determined it. For what else
could have brought such different Interests and Judgments to
acquiesce in the conclusion?</p>
            <p>Neither, in the <hi>10th</hi> place, must we imagine that the strange
and absurd division of <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Jacobites</hi>
and <hi>Williamites,</hi> happened without a Providence. Whatever
sence some may have of it in other respects, we of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
must own it as a great and signal Mercy. King <hi>James</hi> and his
adherents here reckoned upon a strong and numerous Party in
<hi>England,</hi> and were affraid if they had utterly destroyed us, that
they should have lost them, and therefore in many cases were
obliged to bear an easier hand towards us, than otherwise
they would have done. And whatever Favour or Forbearance
we received from them, was intirely due to this consideration.
This was the use God made of this Faction, and now it has
served his purpose, I hope he will extinguish it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11thly.</hi> God in his Providence so ordered it, that King
<hi>James</hi> found an unexpected diversion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his Forces till things were setled in <hi>England,</hi> and till his
present Majesty had leisure to break the Enemies power in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and prepare for the Conquest of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Had King <hi>James</hi>
on his Landing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> found no opposition in it, but been
intirely at Liberty to joyn his Forces with that Party that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for him in our neighbouring Kingdom, every one is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
how fatal the event might have proved, not only to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but also to the Liberty of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But it pleased God
to find him work here by an unexpected Opposition, which
not only imployed, but ruined his best men; and lost him such
an Opportunity as never could again be expected. If we consider
the Places and Persons that made this Opposition, it is a Miracle
that they should undertake, much more that they should succeed
in it, and it looks as if God Almighty in his Providence had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94727:13"/>
raised them up for that juncture, and inspired them with Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in an extraordinary manner, to shew his power in their
weakness, and his care of us, in the seasonableness of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
Our Enemies were very sensible of the unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this accident, as they called it, and curst <hi>Derry</hi> and
<hi>Eniskillin,</hi> as the occasion of the ruin of their affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12thly.</hi> It was certainly a great Providence to us, that his
Majesty in person should undertake the Reduction of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
At a time, and in such circumstances, that King <hi>James</hi> and his
Party judged it impossible, and promised themselves, that they
had made him such work at home, that he should rather fear
an Invasion from <hi>Ireland,</hi> than think of an Expedition into it.
But the Providence of God by his single Courage and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
broke all their measures, and put them out of those methods,
which they imagined so well concerted, that it must be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to defeat them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>13thly.</hi> Can it be ascribed to any thing else than a singular
Providence, that they should mistake themselves, and disregard
the advices, or rather (as they themselves used to call them) <hi>their
Orders from France,</hi> so as to put themselves to the hazard of a
Battel, when delay was so much their interest whatever it cost
them, and so easie to them had they not been infatuated?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>14thly.</hi> It was no less an over-ruling Providence, that an
Army so well Trained, Disciplined, and Armed, and so advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
posted, should make so little opposition. The advantage
of their Post by all intelligent men was reckoned above three to
one; and it had been impossible to beat them from it, had not
the God of Battels enfeebled their hearts, and animated his
Majesty to an Attempt, that seems next in strangeness to that
of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s on the <hi>Philistines:</hi> and which perhaps only his
Majesty of all men living would have attempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>15thly.</hi> Add to this, the strange panick fear that seized the
vanquished. Tho' their Troops were for the most part untouched,
and a very few fallen, yet such a dread and terror possessed them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94727:14"/>
as did formerly the <hi>Syrians</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and they fled where
no man pursued them. King <hi>James</hi> did not stop till he get out
of the Kingdom, and his Army fled as far as the Sea would
let them, had they had Ships they would have gone all togo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>16thly.</hi> I must remark it further as a peculiar Providence,
that his Majesty's victory happened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at such a critical time, that
the Peace of <hi>England,</hi> nay perhaps the fate of <hi>Europe</hi> depended
on it. Had it but been delayed one week, no body knows
what would have been the consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>17thly.</hi> The saving of this City of <hi>Dublin</hi> from so often
threatned, and as both we and the generality of our Enemies
believed, resolved destruction, is another piece of Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and withal so strange, that we can give yet no account of
it, or so much as guess at what altered their resolution. I need
only mention this to most of my Hearers, to fill their Hearts
with Admiration, and open their Mouths with Thanksgiving to
God for the Miracles of his Mercies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>18thly.</hi> And yet there is still behind a greater Miracle and
Mercy than this, and which we can hardly think on without
Terror, and that was the miraculous preservation of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Person in the Battel. To whom we may apply what
<hi>David</hi> affirms of himself, <hi>there is but a step between me and death,</hi>
our danger came nearer even within a hair's breadth. If there
were no dangers and difficulties in life, we should not be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of particular Providences: But one such escape as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens
the sence of Religion, and of God's Power more in our
hearts than many years of even and uninterrupted happiness.
We must acknowledge, that all our Lives in him were at the
Mercy of that one Bullet: and 'twas surely the God of Battels
in his unspeakable Mercy and Providence preserved us. If
Thousands of us had died, the Enemy would not have cared for
us. And notwithstanding they lost the Battel, yet they would have
counted it a Victory, and their loss sufficiently ballenced by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94727:14"/>
the single life of his present Majesty. 'Tis certain they would
willingly have given their Army for it. And this alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to teach us how to value it, and what thanks we owe
to God for preserving it.</p>
            <p>In short, we had not, neither have we yet in our utmost
view another Chance to save us, our Liberties, Estates, or
Religion, but this one, of His Majesty's coming to the rescue
of these Kingdoms: and his undertaking it has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by such a miraculous chain of Providences, that we
must acknowledge, that it is by the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi> are now our King and Queen. Perhaps they
have more visible Reasons to put that in their Titles than any
Princes in Christendom.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore own the whole of our Deliverance to be
a Work of God, and ascribe it intirely to him, without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
any part of it to ourselves. God in his Providence
has so ordered the matter, that we in this place have had no
hand in it, or pretence to it. And as for others, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not to be so much a work of man, or carried on by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
means, as by the over-ruling Providence of God.
'Twas manifestly God, rather than the People, set our King and
Queen on the Throne. The People obstructed it as much
as they could, by their Divisions; the Nobles opposed it;
the Mighty stood up to hinder it; the Nations combined
against it; but God had them in derision, and not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
Their Majesties from the striving of the People,
but also made them their Head: 'Tis He, <hi>the most High,
that ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he will:</hi> 'Tis He raised up King <hi>William</hi> to be a
Deliverer to us. And, to summ up all, 'Tis he that <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we
trust that he will yet deliver us.</hi> And therefore to him be the
sole glory of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94727:15"/>
And now, that God has so signally appeared for us, let
us (which was the <hi>Second</hi> general Head I proposed) consider
what returns we are obliged to make him.</p>
            <p>First, Let us remember, that it was not for nothing that
he delivered us. He had certainly a peculiar design in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us from the hands of our Enemies, by so many and so
remarkable Providences, <hi>even that we might serve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear.</hi> Let us therefore employ those Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Estates and Churches to his Service, that he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for us, and restored to us. Let us avoid those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
that induced him to bring such heavy Judgments
upon us: and let us remember, how easie it is for him to
bring us to a condition much worse than that from whence
he delivered us; and assure our selves, that if instead of
serving him, we serve his Enemies, the Devil, and our Lusts,
he will make his Providence as signal in our future punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it has been in our present deliverance. It were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to point out the Sins that provoked God, and occasioned
our late Sufferings, and the same Causes will always have the
same Effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us own God's goodness to us in our late Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
how in the midst of his Anger he remembred Mercy;
how he made our Sufferings easier to us than we expected,
and Relieved us sooner than we cou'd have reasonably ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
He continued us among the Living, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Death. He gave us Hearts to bear up under our
Pressures; and made us Unanimous and Kind to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He preserved us from <hi>Famine and Pestilence,</hi> which
we feared; and granted us, for the most part, opportunity
of meeting together, to Worship him; and in many things
rather afforded our Enemies an occasion of shewing their
Malice, and wicked Intentions against us, than of executing
them. So that we must acknowledge with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that the
<hi>Lord has chastned and corrected us, but hath not given us over unto
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94727:15"/>
               <hi>3dly</hi> Let us be thankful to God for our Deliverers, and
thankful to them for the great Pains they have taken, and
the great Dangers they have run to effect it. This is in a
manner all we can return them at present, for all the Pains
and Costs they have been at for us; and for all the Generosity
they have shewed towards us; our Enemies having disabled
us in a great measure either to help our selves, or make any
retribution to them. However, what we can do, let us do
chearfully. And let us return at least our hearty Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Prayers to God for them: Especially for Their
Majesties, whose parts have been so signal in it, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
in our minds the Memories of the ancient Hero's
the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Edwards, Henries,</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that made us safe at Home, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our Neighbours. If we consider what we have
seen the King do in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and what part her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
in the mean time acted in <hi>England,</hi> it must be our own
faults if we are not a happy People under such Princes, and
we must be very ungrateful both to God and them, if we are
not sensible of his goodness, in blessing us with such Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
either of which seems capable of Governing much
larger Territories, than they yet possess; And I hope, as
they are entitled to them, so in time they will acquire
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Let us spare no Pains nor Cost to perfect this Happy
Work of our Deliverance; and let us remember, that if this
had not happened, we must have lost our Estates and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and perhaps together with them our Lives. Who would
not within these last three years have given one half of his
Estate to save the other? And then what great matter if
we give half of our Incomes for some years, to enable Their
Majesties to secure the whole to us, since whatever it cost
us, 'tis but restoring part of what we have saved, or had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
by Their means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94727:16"/>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Let us not Grudge or Murmur at the Hardships or
Difficulties, with which we may be obliged to struggle for a
few years. No great Cure was ever perfected without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Patient to some pain, and then why should we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it? those that saw not what we suffered under the late
Government, may think some things hard at present. But I
observe, that the People of this Kingdom, that seem to have the
greatest cause to complain, are best satisfied; which gives us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect, that if any complain, 'tis rather from their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
with the present Government, than their particular
uneasiness. And I am afraid some amongst us are become like
the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth in the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> which, as
the Historian observes, could neither indure its Wounds nor
its Remedy: 'Tis want of experience in the World for any
one to expect, that such a great Revolution should be brought
about, without exposing many to Hardships and Difficulties.
But he that has Patience shall see the end of his Hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us lay aside all Animosities amongst Ourselves,
and all Virulency against our Enemies. Let us be Charitable
to the Distressed, and mindful of those that have not yet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their share in this Deliverance. Let us perform our Vows
and Engagements to God, which we made in our distress. Let
us say aside Self-interest, and set ourselves to lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Solid Peace, in Piety and Justice. That the God of
Peace may delight to bless us and our Governors; and grant
us an Intire Victory over our Enemies; a Happy Union and
Agreement amongst Ourselves: and minister unto us many
more Occasions of Thanksgiving.</p>
