            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>'TIs some Years since the Publication of this
small Treatise: I am still convinced the
Interest of Religion is not a little concern'd in the
Enquiry. The <hi>Office</hi> lies among Persons who have
a great force upon Custom and Practise: And where
the <hi>Motion</hi> is strong, the Direction should be well
secured. 'Tis true <hi>Milton</hi> treats the Argument as
he does the King, with great Contempt: But to
be ill used by such a Hand, and in such Company,
is rather an Honour than otherwise. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(says this Man) <hi>owns no such</hi> Order, <hi>and
therefore they must be left to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Sons of</hi> Sceva <hi>met with. Bishops or
Presbyters we know, and Deacons we know,
but what are Chaplains?</hi> (Eiconocl. <hi>p. 163.)</hi> He
might have answered in his own Words, <hi>(p. 164.)</hi>
That they were <hi>Houshold Priests;</hi> and given an
Instance from the Old Testament. For there we
find that <hi>Micah</hi> entertain'd a Levite with Salary
and Diet; and after all told him, <hi>he should be
a Father, and a Priest to him.</hi> (Iudg. 17. 10.)
It seems he did not think he had hired a
<hi>Servant</hi> with his <hi>ten Shekels.</hi> As for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
They had a Modester Sense of Religion than
to rob their Gods of their <hi>Ministers,</hi> and make
them their own. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours were
Priests themselves, but had none <hi>Belong</hi> to them
till they were Dead, and Deifyed. Towards the
Declension of Philosophy, now and then a grave
<hi>Pretender</hi> was drawn off by the <hi>Steams</hi> of the
<hi>Kitchin. Lucian</hi> ridicules these Men for their
<pb facs="tcp:61346:3"/>
Little Compliances. One of them it seems made
his Court to the <hi>Lap-dog,</hi> to improve his Interest
with the <hi>Lady.</hi> But an envious <hi>Foot-man</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to smoke the Matter, broke a Iest upon
the Favorite, and the Philosopher, and spoiled
All. But these <hi>Sages</hi> don't come strictly within
the Question. They were only <hi>Seculars;</hi> and
entertain'd upon the Score of Learning, not
Religion.</p>
            <p>In the Church, the Business of a Chaplain seems
not of the highest Antiquity. In the first Ages
the Clergy were supported by their Bishop, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
lived under his Observation. <hi>(Can. Apost.)</hi>
And afterwards, when They removed from the
<hi>Mother Church,</hi> They had <hi>Titles,</hi> i. e. <hi>Cures</hi>
assigned them, much larger than single Families.
The first Chaplain I meet with was one <hi>Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
a very unfortunate Person. He lived in the
Reign of <hi>Dioclesian:</hi> And was <hi>Ordained</hi> by the
<hi>Donatists</hi> for the See of <hi>Carthage,</hi> against the
Catholick Bishop <hi>Caecilian.</hi> He was Set up and
Countenanced by his Patroness <hi>Lucilla,</hi> a high
Spirited Lady; who refused Communion with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian,</hi>
for being Reproved by Him when he was
Arch-deacon. <hi>(Optat. Lib. 1. cont. Parmen.)</hi>
However, by the Story <hi>Majorinus</hi> might be no
more than a <hi>Reader</hi> in the Family; who in the
Custom of those Times was less than a Sub-deacon.</p>
            <p>The wrong Vse the Rich <hi>Laity</hi> might make of
the Indigence or Ambition of these Houshold
Clergy, was I suppose the Reason why the Second
Council of Orange (<hi>Can.</hi> 9. held <hi>Ann.</hi> 533.) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb facs="tcp:61346:3"/>
no Priest to Reside with Secular Persons,
without the Bishop's Leave.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> Reports <hi>(Cypr. Ang.)</hi> 
               <q>That
Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> observed the Interest of the Church
prejudiced by the great Increase of Chaplains in
the Houses of private Gentlemen.</q> To prevent
this Inconvenience, and some others, King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First published his <hi>Instructions</hi> to Archbishop
<hi>Abbot, An.</hi> 1629. containing <hi>Orders</hi> to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by the Bishops in the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
The <hi>Instructions</hi> were comprehended in
ten Articles. The seventh enjoyns, That <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
suffer none under Noble-men, and Men
Qualified by Law, to have any private Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
in his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have mentioned these Instances, to shew the
Difficulty of the Office. 'Tis a nice Vndertaking,
and requires a more than ordinary Sufficiency.
And therefore an Vnexperienced, Vnballasted
Divine, must be an improper Missionary. 'Twere
well if he understood Something of Men and
Things; if he was furnish'd both with <hi>Matter</hi> and
<hi>Form,</hi> and rather Brought his Education than
Received it. For a Disadvantage in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Business, is not easily overcome. There
should be Vigilance in Conversation, a Sweetnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of Temper, an Vnaffected Piety, and a noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Interest. And since the Clergy thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
are more Numerous than formerly, they
should manage with the greater Care. For when
the Priesthood is misunderstood, Religion must
decline of Course. And when Religion is gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we have lost the best support of this Life, as well
<pb facs="tcp:61346:4"/>
as the other. This Reasoning must be allowed
by those who are not sunk below the Doctrines of
Providence. Indeed if a Man sets up for a <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
I don't expect the Argument should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
But the Opinion of such Iudges is neither
Credit, nor Misfortune. With these People a
Iest passes for a Demonstration; and to Laugh,
and Confute, is the same Thing. It seems Truth
and Falshood depends upon their good Liking:
And they have the peculiar Privilege of Wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Things <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> at Pleasure.
Who would expect such Flights of Conceit from
so humble Pretences? For an Atheist, if you
will take his Word for it, is a very despicable
Mortal. Let us describe him by his <hi>Tenents,</hi>
and Copy him a little from his own <hi>Original.</hi>
He is then no better than a heap of Organized
Dust, a stalking Machine, a <hi>Speaking Head</hi>
without a Soul in it. His Thoughts are bound
up by the Laws of <hi>Motion,</hi> his Actions are all
prescribed. He has no more Liberty than the
Current of a Stream, or the Blast of a Tempest.
And where there is no Choice, there can be no
Merit. The <hi>Creed</hi> of an Atheist is a degrading
Systeme, a most mortifying Perswasion. No Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
can make him <hi>Shine:</hi> He strikes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
out of all Claim to Regard: And has no
Alliance to any honourable Distinction. He is
the Offspring of <hi>Chance,</hi> the Slave of <hi>Necessity,</hi>
danced by foreign Impulses no less than a <hi>Puppet.</hi>
Ignoble in his Descent; Little in Life, and
Nothing at the End on't. Atheism, the result
of Ignorance and Pride; of strong Senses, and
<pb facs="tcp:61346:4"/>
feeble Reason; of Good <hi>Eating,</hi> and Ill <hi>Living!</hi>
Atheism, the Plague of <hi>Society,</hi> the Corrupter
of <hi>Manners,</hi> and the Vnderminer of <hi>Property!</hi>
What can the Raillery, the Reproaches, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious
Censures of this <hi>Sect</hi> signifie? Why
should They be raised above their Principle, and
rated higher than their own Valuation? They
are below all Consideration, except that of <hi>Pity,</hi>
and <hi>Prayers;</hi> and these I heartily give them.</p>
            <p>If the Plainness of <hi>what Follows</hi> disgusts the
sober Reader I am sorry for it. 'Tis a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
which could not be declined without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the <hi>Subject.</hi> The oversmoothness of
an Argument, is apt to abate the Force. You
must give it a Point to make way for Passage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Pleasure cannot always be made the Vehicle of
Health. And when the Case requires it, no
Man blames the Doctor for preferring the Cure
to the Palate. Besides, the bare mention of
some Practices is enough to expose them. And
when Things are a Satyr upon themselves, who
can help it? The Deformity lies in the Monster,
not in him who shows it.</p>
            <p>I am far from desiring a Depression of the
<hi>Laity,</hi> or abetting any <hi>Spiritual Usurpation.</hi>
Honour and Civil Pretences are not Held at
the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and therefore She
should not Seize without Warrant. To make
<hi>Orders</hi> a <hi>Patent</hi> for Pride, and a Privilege
for Misbehaviour, is much more than runs in
the <hi>Commission.</hi> I am pleading for no Cynical
Neglect, no ill supported Forwardness, no Brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:61346:5"/>
above Mens Business, or their Talent. But
then I hope 'tis no harm for Church-men to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Liberty; and keep the Property of
their Persons to themselves. Especially since
They live amongst a <hi>Free People,</hi> and have so
good Evidence for their Title. Farther, There
is no fear of <hi>Levelling</hi> from this <hi>Enquiry.</hi> For
Independency does not suppose Equality: Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Degrees are well enough consistent.</p>
            <p>To prevent all Misconstruction. I willingly
grant it no Disadvantage to a Gentleman to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi>
to a Person of Quality, provided his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
be <hi>Secular.</hi> But the Function of an
Ecclesiastick, requires another <hi>Relation.</hi>

that had the Vulgar had any Power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
Right, a good Cause might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
have been lost for want of fine
Cloaths to plead it in. Whether any part
of this Vanity prevails with us, I shall not
dispute; however this Inference may be
fairly allowed, That the Success of Truth
depends very much upon the Reputation of
its Advocate. For the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in regard they are not judicious and
impartial enough to penetrate the bottom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61346:7"/>
of things, are more influenced by show and
appearance, than by substance and reality.
And therefore if a Man's Person or Office
happens to wear an uncreditable Name, and
and falls under a general di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esteem, though
never so undeservedly, he must not expect
to be perswasive with others, though the
nature and proof of what he recommends,
may appear sufficiently evident and weighty
to an unprejudiced mind. For besides that
Men are not willing to learn Rules of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Condu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> from those they contemn,
because this looks like a disparagement of
themselves, and sets the despised Person in
some measure above them, besides, I say,
they are not over-willing to be informed
by such Instructors; 'tis not often that
they think they can: For 'tis generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for granted that Discourses cannot rise
much above the Character of those that
make them; and that 'tis scarce possible for
an inconsiderable Man to say any think that
is worth the taking notice of. So that when
Men have entertained a little Opinion of
any Person, he is under a mighty disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of fixing any good Advice upon them.
The contemptible Notion they have of him
gives their Judgments an ill tincture, and
makes them unindifferent, so that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see things in their true colours, nor
allow them their proper weight; but are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61346:7"/>
apt to conclude the reasonings of those they
disesteem resemble the insignificancy of their
Authors, and so many a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od well-meaning
Argument is turned back and discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
only for keeping suspected unreputable
Company.</p>
                  <p>Of the truth of this Observation ill Men
are very apprehensive, who being desirous
of enjoying the ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sures of Vice, without
coming under the discipline of Ignominy
and Restraint, make it their business to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent
the Ministers of Religion, depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Authority, and decrying the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of their Prosession; being well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that when they have disarm'd their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
(as they reckon them) of their
Reputation, they need not fear any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
disturbance from them.</p>
                  <p>In pursuance of this Design they would
fain perswade the World, that the Clergy
are so far from deserving any additional
Esteem upon the account of their Office,
that for this reason they ought to forfeit
part of what they had before; as if Orders
suppos'd some antecedent Crime, and were
rather inflicted than given, and that those
who receive them ought to pass for Persons
degraded from the privileges of Birth and
Education, or at least not to enjoy them
without stain and abatement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61346:8"/>Now that there are some Persons, and
those not all of the lowest Rank, who seem
to be of this unreasonable Opinion, is too
apparent; and therefore I shall desire them
to consider, that those who account the
Priesthood a lessening of a Man's Quality,
must either believe all Religion to be an
Imposture, or if they do own the Being of
a God, their apprehension of him is so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and unworthy, that I think it would
be a kindness to them to suppose them
Atheists: For 'tis not so monstrous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
to deny the Existenee of a Deity,
as to suppose him void of Excellency and
Perfection: To imagine him to be so far
from being the Fountain of Honour, that
He is rather to be accounted a discredit to
those who belong to him, and that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Condition ought to be asham'd of
his Service; such a Notion of God Almighty
as this, besides the Absurdity of it, looks
like a malicious acknowledgment of his
Being, only to make him capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>But besides, at the Function of the Clergy
in general is too often misunderstood,
(which in such a sceptical and licentious
Age we need not wonder at) those who
officiate in private Houses lie under parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Disadvantages: Here the Master of
the Family usually expects an extraordinary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61346:8"/>
observance from the Priest, and returns him
less notice in exchange, than to others of
the same Order and Condition. Now one
would think in point of reason, that an
Ecclesiastical (as well as a Civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary)
Officer should be more consider'd
within the limits and extent of his Employ
than elsewhere, both upon the account of
the Jurisdiction he hath there, and because
of the Advantage those he is concern'd with,
do or may receive from the Execution of his
Office.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason of this unaccountable
Practice must be resolved into one or both
of these Pretences; either</p>
                  <p>1. That a Clergyman officiating in a
Family, ought to be entertain'd no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than under the Notion of a Servant:
or</p>
                  <p>2. Because 'tis in the Patron's Power
to oblige the Priest with Church-Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>It will be therefore the Design of these
Papers to shew,</p>
                  <p>1. That a Priest, or Chaplain in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
is no Servant.</p>
                  <p>2. That whatever fair Expectations the
Patron may have given the Priest of future
Advantage, those are no sufficient Grounds
to justify an imperious Deportment on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61346:9"/>
one hand, or a servile Submission on the
other.</p>
                  <p>1. I shall prove that a Priest, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
in a Family, is no Servant; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of which I believe he is often thought
to be, though 'tis not always spoken out.
Now in order to the removing this Mistake,
I shall in the</p>
                  <p>First place answer those Objections, which
seem to have given the most probable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of its rise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I shall give a short Description
of the Office of a Chaplain; and shew how
much it differs from that of a Servant.</p>
                  <p>I. I shall answer those Objections, which
have given the most probable occasion to
this Mistake; among which we may reckon
the Priests being entertained with Diet.</p>
                  <p>But that eating at another's Table does
not make a Man a Servant is plain; for if
it did, then every one that visits his Friend,
if he happens to eat or drink without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it, must immediately forfeit his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
If it be said, That 'tis not eating
now and then upon a Visit which brings a
Man into the Condition of a Servant, but
doing it constantly, and with the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
To this I answer, That if eating by
the year makes a Man a Servant for a year,
than eating by the day must make him a
Servant for that day; the only difference in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61346:9"/>
this case is, that the one who eats but a
Meal or two comes into his Liberty sooner
than the other.</p>
                  <p>But possibly 'tis the Priests contracting for
Diet which makes him mistaken for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to him that affords it; and here 'tis
supposed to come under the notion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
because the Priest is to do something for
it. Now because a consideration of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whether it be received in Money or
Diet, or both, is the same thing; I shall
prove that a Man's Receiving Money in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of bestowing his Time and Pains
upon another, does not make him a Servant
to him that returns him a Recompence for
his Trouble. For example, Lawyers and
Physicians have their Fees, or their Wages
if you please, and yet I suppose none will
say that they are Servants to all the Clients
and Patients that imploy them, and if not
to all, then for the same reason not to any:
The Judges have a Fee for every Cause
which is tried at the <hi>Nisi prius</hi> Bar, and a
Justice of Peace hath Money allow'd him for
making a Warrant, which both of them
may receive without forfeiting their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The House of Commons likewise have
Pensions from their Electors, during the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Parliament; I confess 'tis not usually
paid now, but if they did receive it as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they have done, I hope no one would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61346:10"/>
say a Knight of a Shire was Servant to a Man
of Forty Shillings <hi>per annum,</hi> because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
something towards his maintenance.
In all these cases a Man is engaged in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of others, and receives a consideration
for his employment, and yet hath no reason
to be accounted a Servant for his pains.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that in most of these Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Salaries are assign'd by Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that there is no contract between
him that receives and him that gives the
consideration; I answer, that there is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though not an express contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the People have agreed to consent to
whatever their Representatives shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> As to the case of the Lawyers, though
their Fees are stated by Law, yet every one
chuses whom he will make use of; so that
the voluntary Retaining any one, is no less
than a plain Contract, and the giving him so
much Money upon condition that he will
plead for him.</p>
                  <p>3<hi>ly,</hi> 'Tis not the contracting for Money
in lieu of some other exchange which makes
a Man a Servant, for then every one that
sells for Money would be a Servant to the
Buyer, and consequently a Pedlar might
make himself a Master of the best Merchant
in <hi>London,</hi> if he should happen to be so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
as to be his Customer: and which is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61346:10"/>
most to be lamented, if a Man could not by
way of Contract receive Money with one
hand, without parting with his Liberty
with the other, then the Landlord must be a
Servant to the Tenant; for the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
for Rent, though he never receiv'd
a Penny, is enough to bring him Under; so
that according to this Opinion, a Man cannot
let his Farm without Demising and Granting
away himself.</p>
                  <p>But further, That the entertaining the
Clergy with Diet and Salary is no Argument
of their subjection, will appear, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that we are bound to contribute towards
the support of our Parents, if they stand in
need of it; and yet I suppose it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that this makes us there Superiors: 'Tis so
far from it, that our assisting them is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
part of that honour which the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
enjoyns us to pay them, and is
so interpreted by our Saviour himself, St.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 4, 5, 6. The communication
therefore of part of our Wealth to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
officiating in our Houses, is in reason
nothing but a due respect to their Function,
and a grateful acknowledgement of their
Care: What the Priest receives from us is
in effect offered to God Almighty, because
'tis given upon the account of the Relation
he hath to him, and the Advantages we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
from thence. This is honouring God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61346:11"/>
with our Substance, who in regard he stands
in need of nothing himself, hath order'd
those Persons (whom he hath set apart to
keep up his Service and Worship) to receive
what Men present to him in token of his
Sovereignty and Providence. Thus what
was offer'd to God under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(except what was spent in Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing)
was the Priests Portion, assign'd by
the Divine Appointment, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 8, 9.
and in the 20<hi>th. verse</hi> of that Chapter the
reason why the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was to have
no Inheritance in the Land which was to
be divided, is given, because God promised
to be their Inheritance, that is to give
them those Offerings which were made to
him; and that this was a very liberal Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and much exceeded the provision
which was made for the rest of the Tribes,
might easily be made good, were it not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to the present Argument.</p>
                  <p>There are many other places in the Old
Testament which may be alledg'd for the
confirmation of this Truth, as <hi>Deut. 18. 2.
Iosh. 13. 14. Ezek. 44. 28, &amp;c.</hi> And that
this practice did not depend upon any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonial
Constitution, but was founded in
the unalterable reason of things, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if we look into the New Testament;
where St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<hi>that those that Preach the Gospel</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61346:11"/>
(which every Priest does who reads the
New Testament) <hi>should live of the Gospel,
1 Cor.</hi> 9. 14. Our Spiritual Governors are
<hi>Ministers of God</hi> to us as well as our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Inference, <hi>v.</hi> 6. may in a qualified
sense at least, be applied to them, <hi>For this
cause pay you Tribute also.</hi> And that the
same Apostle did not believe that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this nature, ought to subject
the Clergy to Distance and Submissive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
is beyond question; for he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 11. <hi>If
we have sown unto you Spiritual things, is
it a great thing, if we shall reap your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
things?</hi> It seems he did not believe this
Favour so extraordinary, or to have any
such commanding quality in it, as to make
him their Servant, or Dependant, if he had
received it. Nay he tells them that he
had <hi>power to eat and to drink;</hi> that is,
God had given him a right to a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Maintenance out of the Estates of
those he instructed; which without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where the circumstances of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will permit, ought to be proportioned
with respect to the Person Represented,
and to the Nature and Quality of the
Employ. 'Tis plain therefore that the
Apostle thought that if God's Ministers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the Fortunes of their Charge,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61346:12"/>
yet they were not so mightily indebted
beyond a possibility of Requital; but that
the Obligation was full as great on the other
side: and the reason why some Men now
a days are not of the same mind is, because
the Concerns of another World have none,
or a very slender Consideration allowed
them; for otherwise without question Men
would look upon those as none of their
least beneficial Friends, who are appointed
by God to guide them securely in their
Passage to Eternity: but now 'tis the Mode
with too many to live as if their Souls were
the most inconsiderable thing they carried
about them.</p>
                  <p>5. It may be objected, That every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
ought to be under the Government of
one single Person, and because the Priest is
confessed not to be the Master, therefore he
must be under command, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Servant. Now this is so slender an
Objection, that I should have waved the
mention of it, but that some People seem
desirous of being imposed upon in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and we know when Men are in love
with a Mistake, the least appearance of a
reason is apt to entangle their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and make them overlook the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an Assertion they are prejudiced
against.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61346:12"/>To what is objected therefore I answer,
That this Argument proves all Boarders Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
though their Office or Quality be
never so much above those they sojourn
with. I grant the Priest is not to disturb
the Master of the House in the Government
of his Family, nor to intermeddle in his
Affairs, (to do this were an unreasonable
Incroachment) but the living under his
Roof makes him no more his Servant, than
his Father or Mother are, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
with him.</p>
                  <p>There may be several other things urged
against the truth of the Proposition I am
to defend, but the solving the remaining
Objections will fall in more conveniently,
after I have given a short description of the
Office of a Chaplain, and shown how much
it differs from that of a Servant, and how
inconsistent it is with it; which I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore, The Office of a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in a Family, is to Pray for, Bless, and
give Absolution to those he is concerned
with; which are all Acts of Authority and
Jurisdiction. He is to Counsel, Exhort, and
Reprove the Master of the Family himself,
upon occasion (though with respect to his
station) which Offices are inconsistent with
the condition of a Servant, and must be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61346:13"/>
very unsuccessfully perform'd by him, as
will further appear afterwards.</p>
                  <p>2. He does not receive this Commission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from the Master of the Family, or from
any humane Authority, but from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whose Deputy he is in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Religion: He is not entertain'd upon
any secular Account, or to manage any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Business but what relates to another
World; and is Consecrated to this Function
by the Divine Warrant and Appointment,
and consequently he is God's Minister not
Man's. The Place in which he is engaged
is his Parish, and the difference between a
Parochial Priest and him lies in this, that
the extent of his Charge is not so large
as that of a Parish-Priest; the one having
but only one single Family to take care of,
and the other a great many: but the Office
is the same, and therefore the one hath no
more reason to be accounted a Servant than
the other.</p>
                  <p>3. However Pride, Ignorance, or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
may sometimes byass Mens minds,
yet if they would but attend to their own
practice, they would see that the concern
of a Priest in a Family is no servile Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
because in the absence of a Priest the
Master of the Family supplies his Place, as
far as lawfully he may, that is, in Praying
and giving Thanks at Meat; which is a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61346:13"/>
plain confession that Men are satisfied that
'tis very improper to employ any of their
Servants in the performance of Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
the doing of which would be disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to God, and weaken the force and
Majesty of Religion; and therefore when
one Consecrated to Holy Ministrations is
not present, God ought to be addressed to
by a Person of the greatest Consideration in
the Family; which implicit confession of
theirs, is both agreeable to the reason of
Mankind in general, and the practice of the
first Ages of the World, when the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Authority were united, the
same Person being both Priest and Prince in
his Family; as appears from <hi>Abraham, Isaac,
Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi>'s erecting Altars, and offering
Sacrifices: And before the Institution of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Law (in which God chose a distinct
Tribe to serve him in Holy Offices) the
First-born, among other considerable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
had the Priesthood annext to his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
                  <p>4. This Notion of a Servant destroys the
End and Design of the Priestly Office, it
renders his Person cheap, and his Discourse
insignificant, it causes his Reproofs to be
look'd upon as presumptuous, and makes a
generous Freedom and impartial Plainness,
to be interpreted a forgetfulness of Distance:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61346:14"/>
And yet this sort of Plain-dealing is not
more necessary toward any sort of People
than those who are Wealthy and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
the Nature of their Circumstances
being such as make them much more apt
to flatter themselves, and to be flatter'd by
others; which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> command
St. <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>charge those that</hi> were <hi>Rich
that they should not be High-minded:</hi> The
Apostle well knew in what great danger
such Persons were of taking the height of
their Condition amiss, and confiding too
much in it; for to this unhappy Mistake
they have not only the common Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Self-love to betray them, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
confederate Circumstances from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
strike in to carry on the Imposture,
and to cheat them into a wrong Opinion
of themselves. They see how they are
reverenced and admired by almost all sort
of People, and that Men frequently resign
their Ease, their Liberty and Conscience
too, to purchase fewer Conveniencies than
they are already possessed of: They find
that Wealth and Reputation puts them into
a capacity of gratifying their Senses, and
their Humour; gives them many Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of obliging their Friends, and
crushing their Enemies; and makes their
Will a kind of Law to their Inferiours and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61346:14"/>
Dependants. Now these Advantages when
they are not throughly examined, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the value which vulgar
Estimation sets upon them, are apt to
swell them into an unreasonable Conceit
of themselves; which Vanity is still fed
and inflamed because they are often so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
as not to attend that these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Accommodations are things really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from their Owners; that these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental
Privileges are but a decent Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
which enriches no deeper than the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
and Impression, which though Royal,
cannot alter the Mettal: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
they are apt to fancy their Fortunes
and themselves to be all of a piece, that
this glorious Outside grows out of some
intrinsick Prerogative, and is the genuine
Lustre and Complexion of their Nature.
And since a flourishing Condition is thus
apt to impose upon Men, and hath such
a natural tendency to give them a false
<hi>Idea</hi> of their own Excellency, have they
not need of a prudent and conscientious
Friend, to insinuate that they have no Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Advantages above the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to awaken them into right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of things, and rescue them from
that Delusion which their own Vanity, and
the Ignorance or Design of others of of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61346:15"/>
puts upon them? Therefore if Men would
have their Lives correct and happy, they
ought to encourage their Friends, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those who are particularly concern'd
in the Regulation of their Conscience) to
tell them of their Faults; they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
them to this freedom, if not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Declaration, yet by affable Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
always receiving the Performance of
the nice Office with demonstrations of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Satisfaction. Did Men consider
how slippery and difficultly manageable an
elevated Station is, they would easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that it was not the safest way to trust
altogether to their own Conduct, but to
take in the constant assistance of a Religious
Person, that so their Miscarriages might
be represented, their Consciences directed
in doubtful Cases, and their Minds forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with Defensatives proper to the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of their Condition and Temper. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the very converse of such a Guide,
if his Character were rightly understood,
and prudently supported, would help to
keep them upon their guard; and by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a kind of Religious Awe upon their
Spirits, make their Conversation more
staunch and regular, and often prevent their
falling into any remarkable Excesses: But
these Advantages are all lost upon those
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61346:15"/>
who misapprehend the Priest's Office, and
entertain him upon the same account they
do their Footmen, only to garnish the
Table, and stuff out the Figure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
When a Man hath received such a
disparaging Notion of the Priest, and rang'd
him amongst his Servants, there is small
likelihood of his being the better for his
Company; for this Conceit will make his
Carriage lofty and reserv'd; his Words,
Gestures, and Silence, will all carry marks
of Neglect and Imperiousness in them:
which are plain and designed Intimations
that the Priest must not insist upon the
Privileges of his Function; that he must
not pretend to any Liberty, but what his
Patron is pleas'd to allow; with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of whose Actions he is not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle,
nor remonstrate against the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of any Practice, nor show him
the Danger of continuing in it: for though
all this be done with Caution and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Respect, yet he must look for
nothing but Disdain and Disappointment in
requital, for presuming to admonish his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours;
which is such an Usurpation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Dominion and Quality as is not to be
endur'd; being neither agreeable to the
servile Employment of the one, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Honour of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61346:16"/>5. This degrading the Priesthood into
a servile Office, takes off from that Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is due to the solemn Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Religion, and makes them look
common and contemptible; by being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
by Persons not <hi>sui juris,</hi> but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the pleasure of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them: God therefore to prevent his
Ordinances from falling into contempt,
and to make them effectual to procure the
happiness of Mankind, hath given his Priests
Authority over all they are concern'd with;
they are to <hi>bless</hi> the People in his Name,
and the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us
<hi>That without contradiction the less is blessed of
the better,</hi> Hebr. 7. 7. They are called <hi>the
Lord's Priests,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 17. <hi>The Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Mal. 2. 7. And
in the New Testament, they are stiled the
<hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors of God;</hi> and made
<hi>Overseers of his Church by the Holy Ghost,</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 20. Acts 20. 28. The Sense of
which Texts, and partly the Words are by
the Appointment of our Church applied to
those who are ordain'd Priests, to put them
in mind of the Dignity of their Office, and
the great Care they ought to take about the
conscientious Discharge of it.</p>
                  <p>I confess 'tis possible for a Priest to make
himself a Servant; he may 'tis likely be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61346:16"/>
Steward or Clark of the Kitchin if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(as Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> complains some
of the Clergy were forced to be in his
Time, <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Histo Refor. p. 61.) but as
long as he does not engage in any Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is intended for State, or the
Convenience of Life, as long as he keeps
to his Priestly Function, so long he may
be assured he hath no Master in the House;
and for any to suppose he hath, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and absurd Mistake; (to say
no worse of it) 'tis an inverting that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which God made between the Priest
and People, and denies that Authority
which God hath granted for the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Church. It endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that Honourable Relation which the
Priest hath to the Divine Majesty (to whose
Service he is appropriated) which God is
pleas'd to dignifie him with, that he might
have the greater Influence upon those he
is concern'd with, and be Successful in the
Execution of his Office: And therefore for
a Patron to account such a Consecrated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
his Priest, as if he Belonged to him as
a Servant, is in effect to challenge Divine
Honours, and to set up himself for a God:
For if he is any thing less, he must own
that the Service of the Priest does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him; for that in the very Terms
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61346:17"/>
and Notion of it, is intended for no <hi>Being</hi>
inferiour to that which is suppos'd to be
Divine.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That the Priest hath
obliged himself to remove with the Patron,
when and whither he thinks fit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seems to be in the same Condition
with the rest of the Attendants: To this
I answer, That this makes him no more
a Servant than the travelling and ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
way of Living among the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
would make the Priests Servants to the
People, provided they were Christians: To
make it plainer, Suppose a Bishop Ordain'd
over the Company of a Ship, and that his
Diocese lay only in one Bottom; can we
imagine that he would lose his Episcopal
Power, and fall into the Condition of other
Sea-men, as soon as the Ship was order'd
to weigh Anchor, and began to make its
Voyage from one Port to another: At
this rate a Man may call a Guardian Angel
one of his Domesticks, because for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and Protection of their Charge, these
benevolent Spirits are pleas'd to accompany
us from one Place to another. I grant the
Scripture tells us they are sent forth <hi>to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
for those who are Heirs of Salvation,</hi>
Hebr. 1. 14. but then we must allow them
to be God's Ministers not ours; and so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61346:17"/>
likewise are those of whom I am now
Speaking, as among other Places may be
seen from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4. God hath pleas'd to
put the Clergy in joynt Commission with
the Angels themselves, for the Guidance
of, and superintending his Church. When
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> would have worshipped the Angel
which appear'd to him, he is forbid to do
it, and the reason alledged is, <hi>because I am
thy Fellow-servant,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. that is, as
<hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it, we are both Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
of the same King. And although
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, had
Privileges peculiar to themselves, both in
respect of the extent of their Jurisdiction,
the infallibility of their Doctrine, and other
miraculous Gifts with which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
to which Bishops themselves, much
less inferiour Priests, have no reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;
yet though God was pleas'd for the
more speedy and effectual planting of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
to qualifie the Apostles in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Manner, and to give them a
larger Commission than to the Clergy of
succeeding Ages, yet they all act by the
same Authority, and for the same End;
therefore the unfixt and moving Nature of
a Cure, does not alter and degrade the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Priest: He is not less a Shepherd,
because the Flock happens sometimes to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61346:18"/>
wander unaccountably, from one Pasture
to another: He is bound to attend the
Charge he hath undertaken, and must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Neglect of it to God; and when
it does not continue in the same Place, to
accompany its Motion, is no more a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
to his Office, than it is to that
of a Judge to go the Circuit, whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is as considerable, though it tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
with him from one County to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if he had been always fixt in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be farther objected, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
appoints the Hours of Prayer, which
seems to imply something of command:
To this I answer, That in his chusing the
Time of Prayer, he does not appoint any
Service for himself, but only declares when
he and his Houshold are ready for God's
Worship, and desirous of the Priestly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and Blessing; which is proper for
him to do, because the Family is employed
in his Business, and under his Command;
and therefore without his Permission, they
have not many times an Opportunity of
meeting together for Divine Service: Which
is still more reasonable, because the Priest
is supposed only to intend the Affairs of
Religion, and to be always ready for the
performance of his Office, and consequently
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61346:18"/>
that Time which is most convenient for
those under his Care, and in which the
Assembly is like to be most numerous, he
is by virtue of his Office bound to observe,
whether his Cure lies in a private Family,
or a whole Parish.</p>
                  <p>But lastly, it may be urged, That the
13 of <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 28. calls the Patrons of
Chaplains their Masters; and will any Man
be so hardy as to question the Judgment
and Determination of the Parliament? But
here we may observe, That this Act calls
only those Patrons Masters, who can give
Qualifications for Pluralities. Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
this Observation, I answer, with all
due Submission and Respect to this Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Council; That if the Question was
concerning any Civil Right, then 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
'tis in the Power of the Parliament
either to limit, or take it away, because
the whole Power and Authority of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is there, either Personally, or by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation;
and therefore they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
any Person of his Honour or Estate
(the Right of the Succession to the Crown
excepted) as far as they please: Not that
'tis impossible for them to act Unjustly, but
only that what they Determine hath the
force of a Law, because every Man is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have given his Consent to it. But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61346:19"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61346:19"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61346:20"/>
here we must observe, that the Church is
a distinct Society from the State, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
upon it: The Constitution of
the Church is founded in the Appointment
of Christ, in that Commission which he
gave the Apostles and their Successors, and
consequently does not derive its Authority
from any Earthly Power. The Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
never yet made Bishop, Priest, or
Deacon, nor ever can; and therefore we may
safely affirm, without any injury or disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to him, That he cannot make these
Spiritual Offices greater or less than they are:
Therefore if God hath made the Priests Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(as nothing is plainer in Scripture than
that he hath) an Office of Government,
Direction, and Superintendence over those
he is concern'd with, then 'tis not in the
Power of the Parliament to make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
servile; because no Person, or Society
of Persons, can take away that Power which
they never gave: The Parliament may with
equal Right Enact that Parents shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their Children, and that the Wife
shall be her Husband's Mistress, without a
Compliment, as make the People the Priests
Masters, and give the Flock a Jurisdiction
over the Shepherd: They may with the same
Justice repeal the most Established Laws of
Nature, and invert the Right of the two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61346:20"/>
former Relations, as of this latter; for
this hath its Establishment from the same
God that the other have, and for Ends,
at least equally weighty, and momentous.
This Power of their Spiritual Governours
they have no more Authority to destroy,
than they have to vote down the Cannon
of Scripture, or to decree Sacrilege to be
no Sin: 'Tis granted, That all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Persons, as they are Members of the
State, are subject to its Authority; and
that a Priest, or Bishop, may properly be
a Servant to the Magistrate, if he holds
any Secular Employment under him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in this case he acts by a Commission
from the Civil Government; but this only
concerns him as he is a Member of the
State, and does not in the least affect his
Spiritual Capacity: The Power which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
from that, flows from another Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and is given by our Saviour himself,
and therefore cannot be weakned, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd,
by any State-Constitution whatever.
Men should do well therefore to consider,
That as a Prince hath no reason to take it
well, if the People should look upon his
Officers as their Servants; so 'tis not over-respectful
to God Almighty to suppose his
Ministers stand in that inferiour Relation
to those they are concern'd with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61346:21"/>I shall now proceed to the Second thing
at first propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> to show, That
whatever fair Expectations the Patron may
have given the Priest, yet these are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Grounds for an imperious Carriage
on the one hand, or a servil Submission on
the other.</p>
                  <p>1. This sort of Deportment were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
supposing the Patron had as full
and absolute a Right in Church-Preferment,
as he hath in any other part of his Estate.
For what can be a more ungenerous and
ungentlemanly Practice, than to require
that a Man should resign up his Liberty,
and forfeit the Privileges of his Station,
only upon the probability of receiving some
sort of Consideration for it afterwards?
How unlike a Benefactor does he look
who sets an Excise upon his bare Word,
and clogs the expectation of future Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
with present Inconvenience? Thus
to anticipate the Revenues of a Favour, is
like taking Usury for Money before 'tis
lent, which certainly is one of the worst
sorts of Extortion, because here a Man
not only pays for that he hath not, but
for that which possibly he may never
have. But</p>
                  <p>2. Let us suppose the Priest in actual
Possession of some considerable Preferment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61346:21"/>
yet being 'tis pretended to be given, it
ought certainly to come disencumber'd from
all Conditions which may abate the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. He that pretends to give, should
chiefly respect the Advantage of him to
whom the Favour is granted. He should
demean himself towards the obliged Party,
as if the Obligation had never been; that
it may plainly appear, that his Intention
in conferring it, was disinterested; that he
had no little Designs of Profit or State, to
serve in it; but that it proceeded purely
from a generous Inclination to promote the
Happiness of another. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to part with any thing out of a selfish
Design, is an Exchange, not a Gift, which
when 'tis done by a Person of Estate, is an
Argument of a mean and mercenary Spirit.
But then to pursue a Benefit with Superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liousness
and Contempt, to expect a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the most unreasonable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
to give upbraiding and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Signs of the dependance and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of the Receiver; to require a Man
to relinquish the necessary Freedom of one
of the most solemn and honourable Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
this turns an Obligation into Injury
and Affront, and looks like a malicious
Trap set to catch a Man's Reputation. Who
that hath either Sense or Honesty would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61346:22"/>
turn his Canonical Habit into a Livery,
and makes himself useless and ridiculous
for the greatest Consideration whatever?
A worthy Person would scorn a Kingdom
proffer'd upon such dishonourable terms.</p>
                  <p>3. If we put the case as 'tis determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Law, this practice will appear still
more unreasonable. 'Tis sufficiently known,
and were it not for the overgrown Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of some Persons, it were superfluous
to mention that the Patron is so far
from having a full Propriety in Church-Preferments,
that his Right only consists
in a power to Nominate who shall enjoy
them. Which very Nomination must be
made within six Months, and fix't upon
a Person Canonically qualified, otherwise 'tis
wholly invalid. His Interest in Church
Livings only enables him to give them
away, not to keep them. He hath no
Power to enter upon any part of the
Glebes, or Tithes, or so much as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester
the Profits for the next Incumbent.
He is only a Trustee authorized under
certain Conditions, to dispose of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of the Church, which is settled
upon it by as good Laws as any he holds
his Estate by. That Right which he hath
was originally granted in consideration of
Works of extraordinary Piety, in building
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61346:22"/>
or endowing of Churches: which is a
Title very few (except the King) can
pretend to, either upon their own, or their
Ancestors Accounts. From all which it
appears, that the Patrons giving an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
out of his Estate, is a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thing from his Presenting to a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and therefore his Expectations of
Gratitude and Observance, should not be
set so high in this latter case. For here
neither Law, nor Religion, allow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to be a Penny the better for what
he disposes of; he cannot detain the least
part of it without Injustice and Sacrilege,
nor confer it upon exceptionable Persons
without breach of Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>The Trust indeed is honourable and
weighty, it being in the Power of those
to whom 'tis committed to encourage Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and to provide the People with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and conscientious Guides: but then I
must add, that it ought to be discharged
accordingly, and that those who do not
chiefly aim at these Ends in the exercise of
it, have little either of Conscience or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in them.</p>
                  <p>We have reason to believe that when
the Church gave this Right of Presentation
to Lay-Patrons, (for that the Bishops had
originally the Right of judging the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61346:23"/>
of Priests, and fixing them in their
respective Cures, without being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> for their refusal
of the Peoples choice, might be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
were it pertinent to the business in
hand.) When the Church I say parted with
this Right, she had no Suspicion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of after Ages; but imagined that
the Integrity, and Conscience, if not the
Munificence of the first Patrons, might
have been transmitted to the Heirs or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers
of their Right. The Piety of those
Times would have made it look unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to have been apprehensive of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
Bonds, of forced Compositions, and
Contracts for Farms, or Women. But some
People have now learn'd to make bold
with God Almighty, beyond the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as well as the Example, of their
Predecessors; and to be guilty of those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
Frauds, which by the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of our Laws against some of them,
seem not to have been so much as thought
on, in those more Primitive and Religious
days.</p>
                  <p>And here in point of Charity I think
my self obliged to desire those who are
concern'd in the Rights of Patronage, to
consider before 'tis too late, how great a
Sin it is to abuse their Power; and through
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61346:23"/>
Covetousness, or some other unwarrantable
Principle, to betray the Church, which
hath in some measure made them her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:
It imports them very much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
how unworthy and unchristian it is
to play upon the Indigence or Irresolution
of another; and take an Advantage from
the Unfortunateness of his Condition or
Temper, to oblige him to mean and sinful
Compliances! And what an open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguised
Affront it is to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
to endeavour to make his Ministers
cheap and insignificant; both before, and
after the conferring our pretended Favours
upon them. To create servile Dependances,
and raise our private Grandeur upon the
Endowments of Religion, is a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the End and Design of them.
This makes the Church contemptible by
the Strength of her own Revenues, and
causes the Monuments of our Fore-fathers
Piety to be instrumental in undermining,
and exposing that Faith they thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to secure and advance: which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is guilty of, he may be assured he
hath a Right to the Imprecations, as well
as the Patronage of the first Endowers of
Churches, which dreadful Legacy they
were generally very careful to <hi>settle</hi> upon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61346:24"/>
such irreligious Posterity, <hi>Spelman de non
temerand. Eccl.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short, To prostitute so sacred a Trust
as this is, to Pride and Ambition, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to sacrifice to the Devil with that which
is consecrated to God Almighty; and looks
like a more provoking Impiety than <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzer</hi>'s
debauching to the Honour of his
Idols, in the Vessels of the Temple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.
3, 4. For here is not only an Abuse of
Holy things but Persons too, and God
is dishonoured in those that Represent
him upon a most solemn and important Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>I shall now at last crave leave to desire
those of the Clergy, who are engaged in
the Families of Secular Persons (for I mean
no other) to reflect of what ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it is to Religion for them not to
assert their Office in a prudent defensible
way: and how cheap in their Persons, and
unsuccessful in their Employment, they
must necessarily be, if they betray the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of their Function, by servile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
and Flattery. People will be apt
to imagine (and not without reason) that
those who will cringe below the Gravity
of their Character, to gain a little of this
World, can scarce have any Great and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Apprehensions of the other. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61346:24"/>
Ceremony in a Clergyman is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
misinterpreted, and supposed to
proceed not from his Breeding or Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but from a consciousness of his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and others are willing to allow him
so much Sense, as to be a competent Judg
of his own Inconsiderateness; and since he
confesses himself contemptible by his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
they think it but just to treat him
accordingly. For Men of Figure, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
those who are very Understanding
and Religious, are apt to have Misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
conveyed into them by over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Respect; and to imagine the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between him that gives it, and
themselves, to be much greater than really
it is. Since therefore as things stand, there
is some danger lest Churchmen should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
away the Usefulness and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Calling; they would do well
to decline superlative Observance, for fear
they give others a wrong Notion of their
Employ, or be thought to have <hi>Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in admiration because of Advantage.</hi> It
would be no more than requisite, if they
would reserve their <hi>Duty</hi> for their King,
their Bishop and their Parents, and express
their Gratitude to their Patrons in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
less liable to Misconstruction, and
more proper to the Relation between them.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61346:25"/>
For as they should not be unwilling to
own the Distinctions which the King's Laws
have made, as they ought to make some
particular Acknowledgments for the Favors
and Civilities of those they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concern'd with, and by inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and agreeable Conversation, prevent
all reasonable Suspicion of their being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with the superiour Quality or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of others; so likewise are they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
not to be so officiously, or rather pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasitically
mindful of the Condition of any
Person, as wholly to be forgetful of their
own. For notwithstanding the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
they may sometimes happen to come
into the World with; the Constitution of
the Government hath set them upon the
same Level with the inferiour Gentry, as a
reward of their Education, and out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their Function: Now that the
Laws were not Priest-ridden and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
lavish of their Honour in this case
might, were it necessary, be abundantly
proved from the reason of the thing, and
the general practice of other Countries,
both with respect to ancient and modern
Times. These Privileges therefore being
confer'd upon just and publick Accounts, a
Man is sometimes bound to maintain; and
to surrender them up to the supercilious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61346:25"/>
of every assuming or ignorant Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is a Reflection upon the Wisdom, and
Ingratitude to the Religious Bounty of those
Kings who granted them: and which is
worse, a Churchman by making himself
Contemptible hath parted with his Power
of doing good; and consequently disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the great End of his Calling.
Whereas without doubt 'tis part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of these Privileges to create a sutable
Resolution and Presence of mind in those
that have them, that so their Spirit being
raised up to their civil Station, their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Department may be the better
proportioned, and their Actions keep a
truer Decorum with the Nature of their
Office; that they might not be Over-awed,
and almost struck Dumb with the Glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Title, or Fortune; but retain a
graceful Freedom in Conversation, neither
Idolizing Greatness, nor Neglecting it. The
Intention of the Laws in distinguishing the
Clergy from the Vulgar, besides the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of their Merit, was to put them
into a better Capacity to maintain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Interest of Religion among all
sorts of Persons; that the Rich as well as
the Poor might be advantaged by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
and when Persons of Condition
were to be told of their Faults, the Priest
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61346:26"/>
might be fortified with a convenient Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to give the Reproof, and the others
dispos'd to receive it without disgust and
impatience. Now to be ready upon all
Occasions to resent any dishonour done to
Religion with a prudent Gravity and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
carries such a noble Air of Greatness
and undesigning Honesty in it, that it Forces
a secret Veneration from Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and though a Man may happen
to be unjustly hated for speaking unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Truths, yet he is sure never to be
despised. Whereas a diffident and unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
Behaviour in a Clergyman, is often
suppos'd to proceed from ignoble Qualities,
and consequently will be sure to weaken
the force of his publick Instructions; it
being natural for ill Men especially, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard,
if not to deride the Admonitions of
those they believe are afraid of them; and
he that cannot talk without concern before
a Sinner of Quality any where but in the
Pulpit, might almost as good say nothing
to him there. For if a Churchman's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
be servile and designing all the
Week, his appearing with a new Set of
Notions upon the Sunday, will be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
only a formal Compliance with his
Profession: His pressing those Doctrines
which his Practice contradicts, will signify
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61346:26"/>
little either to his own Advantage, or theirs
that hear him: For though Men ought
to mind what is said, and not who says
it; yet the Prejudices of the Generality are
such, that a good Cause usually suffers very
much when 'tis pleaded by an improper
and exceptionable Advocate: How fulsom
an Entertainment it is to hear a Coward
harangue upon Valour, or a Covetous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
preach up Contempt of the World?
The Man might better have spared his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick;
for his commending those good
Qualities he neither hath the Honesty or
Courage to be Master of, is in effect but a
Satyr upon himself, and serves only to
make him more despicable and ridiculous;
and which is worse, the secret disdain the
Audience hath for such a Panegyrist, often
slides from his Person to his Subject;
which makes his Exhortation nauseous,
and helps to bring Virtue it self into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That the Poverty of
some of the Clergy forces them to suppress
their Sentiments in some things, and to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
whatever an encroaching Spirit shall
think fit to put upon them: To this I
answer, That the Temptation to this Sin
ought to have been prevented before their
going into Holy Orders: For those who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61346:27"/>
cannot be supplied with a competent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by themselves, their Relations, or at
least by some creditable independent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
had much better chuse some other
inferiour Employment, than expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such apparent Danger in this: But
if their own or their Friends imprudence,
hath sent them unprovided into the Church,
'tis more Reputable, Conscientious, and to
a generous mind more Easie too, to submit
to the Inconveniencies of their own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
than to the Pride of others; and to
prefer a homely, unornamented Liberty, to
a splendid Servitude. And as for those (if
there be any such) who do not discharge
their Office with that Plainness, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
managed Resolution which God and
the Church expects from them; it will
not be improper to remind them of what
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> hath written upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Country Parson,</hi> pag. 5. where he tells
us, <q>That such Persons wrong the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
neglect their Duty, and shall be so
far from that which they seek by their
Over-submissiveness and Cringing, that
they shall ever be despised.</q> Indeed they
have no reason to expect any better Usage;
for as Flatterly is deservedly accounted one
of the most contemptible Vices, so a Clergy-man
when he is guilty of it is the worst

                     </gap>ers. To which we may add, That
'tis hard to conceive how the Oath against
<hi>Simo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> can be fairly taken by such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for certainly he that purchases his
Preferment with the Prevarication of his
Office, does no less contradict the Design
of this Oath, than if he had paid down the
full value in Money for it: He that hath

of his Order) cannot in any reasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

                  </p>
                  <p>Those therefore who are this way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
should do well to consider, How
Mean it is to be over-awed, and how Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
to be bribed into an Omission of
their Duty! What a sordid and criminal
Perfidiousness is it, to betray the Honour
of their Function, and the Happiness of
their Charge, <hi>For handfuls of Barley and
pieces of Bread?</hi> Ezek. 13. How ill do they
Represent the God of Faithfulness and Truth;
who either by verbal or silent Flattery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Men into a false Perswasion of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and dissemble their Apprehensions of
Danger, when the Mistake is likely to
prove Fatal to those that lie under it? Can

the Souls of Men, as to let them miscarry

venture their being Damn'd than Disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged?
How such a Treacherous Observance
will be look'd upon in the Great Day of
Accounts is not difficult to foretell, were
it not too sad an Argument to dilate upon:
However something of the Guilt of it may
be conceived by a remarkable Sentence of

                     <hi>I</hi> Easily foresee some People will be disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the Freedom of these Papers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and think themselves treated with too
little Ceremony; But unless they can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
their pretended Adversary, and confute
his Arguments, I would desire them by all means
to smother their Resentments: For as bad as
the World is, to appear in defence of Pride, and
turn Advocate for the Devil, looks like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
sort of an Employment. However to
sweeten their Humour as much as may be, they
may please to consider that there was no good
to be done in this Case without plain dealing;
This Malady of all others must be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
otherwise it's in vain to expect a Cure.
'Tis to no purpose to declaim in general
against a Proud man, and to give him a great
many hard Names; for unless you point di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upon his Vice, distinguish it's Nature,
and discover the weakness of that which he
builds upon. Every one will be sure to avoid
the Charge and parry against the Application.
Farther, to abate their Censure I think it not
<pb facs="tcp:61346:31"/>
improper to acquaint them that here are no
particular Characters attempted, nor is there
the least intention to provoke or expose any
Person Living. Besides when a Piece like this
is drawn from so many different Faces; the
mixing of Features and Complexions, will keep
the <hi>Originals</hi> from being discover'd. In short
the Design of this small Discourse is only to
make Men more useful and acceptable to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and more easie to themselves than they
generally are: And that those who over-top
their Neighbours upon any considerable account;
may manage their Advantage with that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and good Humour, that none may have

                     <p>With all my heart, for I suppose
you will not make a practice of it: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61346:32"/>
Emergency you may be under, I would
advise you to appear in your old shape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;

                     <p>I am sorry to hear Thinking agrees

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why last night I happened to light
upon an overgrown Fop, who plagued the
Company with such an impertinent History
of his Quality and Performances, and was so
vain and insolent in all his behaviour, that
as soon as I was delivered from him, I had
a plentiful occasion to consider the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Pride; which is the present Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of my Thoughts, and upon a full
view, I find so much folly, and ill humour,
and Monster, in the Composition of this
Vice, that I am ashamed, and almost afraid,
of the <hi>Idea</hi> I have raised.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>'Tis somewhat hard you can't

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Because I have observed it's but
a bad Sign of Humility to declaim against
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61346:32"/>
Pride; for he that is really humble will be
unconcerned about Respect and Applause;
such a Person values himself upon nothing
but his Conscience and Integrity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the haughtiness of another can't make
him uneasie; so that if he finds himself wince
upon the account of neglect, he may be
pretty well assured he has a sore place.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I think you are somewhat out in
your notion of Humility; for that virtue
does not make us either servile or insensible,
it does not oblige us to be ridden at the
pleasure of every Coxcomb. We may shew
our dislike of an imperious humour, as well
as of any other foolish Action, both for the
Benefit of others, and in vindication of our
own right.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I am glad to hear this concession
from you, because from hence it follows that
a man may have a just esteem of himself
without being proud: Now if this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was remembred and rightly applyed,
men would not be so censorious in this point,
nor mistake their own Pride for their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
so often as they do. For instance, a
man whom the Law has made my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
may take notice of his Quality if he
pleases; but this can't well be done, except
he makes me an abatement of the regard he
receives from me, therefore I ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the <hi>Reserve</hi> or <hi>Familiarity</hi> of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61346:33"/>
as a Neglect, for provided he keeps
within his proportion, he challenges nothing
but his own; so that if I am displeased, the
Pride lies on my side, for affecting to have
an equal Regard paid to persons who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I have nothing to object against
the main of your discourse, and conceive
that the best way to know whether we are
guilty or not, and to prevent charging this
odious Imputation unjustly upon others, is
to state the Nature of Pride, and to enquire
into the Grounds of it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess that is the way to pinch
the Question, therefore let what will come of
it, I will stand the Test of your Method,
though I am afraid you will say some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
things.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Suppose I do; if the subject leads me
to it, the fault is not mine: But to come
to the point: Pride has a very strong Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the mind; it's bottom'd upon Self-love.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray give me leave, I say Pride is
originally founded in Self-love, which is the
most intimate and inseparable Passion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature. The kindness men have for
themselves, is apt to put them upon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
their own things: which humour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61346:33"/>
check'd in time, will make them take
most delight in those Circumstances and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which distinguish them from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and place their supposed Advantages
in the best light. Now this design is best
pursued by being Master of uncommon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
which though desired by all, are
possessed but by a few; for the Rareness
of things raises their Esteem, and draws a
general Admiration. And their desire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
distinguish'd, is one reason why they love
to keep the odds in their own hand, and to
make the distance between themselves and
their Neighbours as wide as may be, which
often runs them upon a vain, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Ostentation of their Power, Capacity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
For this magnificent discovery makes the
difference between them and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the more apparent, and consequently
occasions their own Greatness to be the more
remarkable.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I think you have said something

                     <p>If by loving you mean wishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
happy, I agree with you; for we may, or
rather we must desire to be as happy as is
possible, provided it be without prejudice to
another. But then if Esteem is understood
by Love, it's easie (without care) to exceed
in our own behalf; and in this sense we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do love our selves too well, as often
as we set an overproportioned and unusual
value upon any thing because it's our own;
as if our fondness and partiality was the true
Standard of worth, and we had the faculty
of turning every thing we touched into gold.</p>

                     <p>I will not contest this point any
farther with you; but as I remember you
started another Paradox, by intimating that
it was a sign of Ambition to esteem any
Excellency the higher for being uncommon:
Now since the value of an Advantage is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hansed
by its scarceness, and made more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
to the owner; I think it somewhat
hard not to give a man leave to love that
most which is most serviceable to him,</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61346:34"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>So it would if he had no body to
love but himself; but since he is both obliged
and naturally inclinable to universal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
this alters the Case: for he who va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lues
any thing the more for being uncommon,
will desire it should continue so, which is no
kind Wish to his Neighbours, and is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that a man does not delight in an
Advantage so much for it self, as for the
Comparison; not so much for its own irres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective
goodness, as because others want it.
Now it affords a more generous, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
a more transporting pleasure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with universal Happiness, though we
make no greater figure in it, than the rest of
our Neighbours; than to be gazed at, and
admired by a Crowd of indigent and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
People.</p>

                     <p>The World does not seem to be
of your opinion; however I will let your
Argument pass for the good nature of it.
But after all let me tell you, though I have
no mind to be counted proud, yet I have
a strong fancy for myself, and therefore if
you will not allow me to be civil to my
Person, we might e'en as good dispute no
farther, for—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Don't trouble your self, if your
Terms are moderate, we'll never break off
upon the score, therefore I will offer at a
short negative description of Pride, in which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61346:35"/>
if it's possible, I will give you Satisfaction.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray let us see how liberal you
will be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>First it's no part of Pride to be
conscious of any perfections we have, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intellectual or moral; for this is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cases necessary, and impossible to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.
He that is wise or learned must know
it, otherwise he can't understand when he
judges true or false, nor distinguish difficult
and noble Speculations, from trifling and
vulgar Remarks, nor tell when he acts ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
or not. Now a Man that is ignorant
of these things can neither be wise nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Therefore as he that has a just and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
sense of the Magnitude, Distance and
Colours of Objects, must conclude that he
has eyes whether he will or not; so these
perfections of the mind discover themselves
by their own Light. The Possessour can no
more be ignorant of them, than he can doubt
of his Existence when he is awake. To give
one instance more; How can any Person have
true Fortitude, who does not know how far
he ought to hazard himself, and wherein the
baseness of Cowardise consists? So that to
affirm a Man may be ignorant of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderableness,
is to make him wise and great,
and good by Chance, which is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Excellencies supposed in him.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Right. And since I like the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and tendency of your Argument, I'll
try if I can reinforce it: I say then, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it was possible for a man to be ignorant
of his good Qualities; it was by no means
convenient: For if he carried such a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
about him, without knowing how well
furnished he was; its somewhat hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how he could either improve or use
it. If it lay thus close, it would be little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than a Mine undiscovered, for which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the owner of the Ground, or any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else are ever the richer,</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>You say well, and therefore I shall
venture in the second place to affirm, That
as we may be acquainted with our own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments,
without being guilty of Pride,
so neither is it any branch of this sin to
discover that they are greater than some of
our Neighbours enjoy. If we have a real
Advantage over another, it's no sin to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of it; to apprehend otherwise, is to judge
contrary to the Reason of things, when the
Case is plain, we may believe we have more
Honesty, Sense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than some others. This
is as allowable as it is for us to think, that
we have better Complexions than Moors, and
are taller than Pygmies.</p>

                     <p>Can you go on?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I'm not afraid to add, Third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
that we don't fall into the sin of Pride
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61346:36"/>
by being delighted with those Advantages
of Mind, Body or Fortune, which Providence
has given us; these things in the very notion
of them are supposed to be beneficial. Now
it's natural and necessary for us to be pleased
with the Enjoyment of that which is good; of
that which is agreeable to our Faculties, and an
Advancement of our Nature: To speak strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when the Faculty and the Object are
rightly proportioned, Satisfaction follows of
course, and its as impossible for us not to be
pleased, as it is for fire not to ascend: Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if we are not allowed to take any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in our condition, we are not bound
to give God thanks for it,; for we are not
obliged to be thankful for that which does
us no good: But nothing can do us any good,
except it be by giving us a pleasure either
in hand or in prospect. Fourthly, it is no
part of Pride, to be more pleased with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Advantage our selves, than by seeing
one of the same value possessed by another.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Make this out and you will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Very well: I prove my Proposition
thus. First, Because that which is in our
Possession, or incorporated into our Essence, is
always in our Power, and ready to be made use
of when we think fit. But that which belongs
to another is often at a distance, and out of our
reach, and can't be communicated to us, though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61346:36"/>
the owner was never so willing. Secondly, it
must be more agréeable to be Master of any
perfection our selves, than to contemplate
one of the same nature in another; because
every one is more certain of the kind Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
he has to himself, than he can be of
the Affection of any other Person whatever:
That I will be always kind to my self, I am
as well assured of, as that I have a being;
but that another will be so, is impossible for
me to know: And therefore let a man be
never so good natured, it must be somewhat
more satisfactory to him, to see himself well
furnished in any kind, than his Neighbour.
Thirdly, that which is our own and in
our Nature, we have the most intimate
and vigorous sense of; for the presence
of any desirable Object, we know is more
acceptable and entertaining than either the
notion or Prospect of it: Possession gives us
the Life of the thing, But hopes and Fancy
can furnish out no more at the best than a
Picture finely drawn. So that, for Example,
let a man be of never so generous and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
a Spirit, yet it's natural for him to
be better pleased, withbeing rich himself (if he
has any value for riches) than in having
the bare Idea of an Estate: Besides as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that which is our own, is always
at our disposal, and does not depend upon
the uncertain Inclination and humour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Very comfortably argued. I find
then by your discourse that a Man may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity be pleased with his Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and have good Thoughts of himself too,
if he deserves it. Now some People are so
unreasonable, that they will neither give
Men leave to love, nor understand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
if they are conscious of any commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Quality, they must be sure to lay it out
of the way that they may not see it; nay
if a Man has taken never so much care to
make himself insignificant, in order to the
promoting of Humility, they will scarce let
him know he is good for nothing, for fear
he should grow conceited of his Virtue. But
I perceive you are not so strait laced, and
pedantick in your Notions. Therefore if
you can recover us no more Ground, let
us know directly what Pride is, and be as
fair as you can.</p>

                     <p>Why Pride in the plainest words
which I can think of, is too high an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our own Excellency.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>How shall we know when we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rate
our selves?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>That is a very seasonable question,
and absolutely necessary to the state of the
Case: Therefore I shall lay down some indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Marks of this Vice, that whenever
we see the Tokens we may conclude the
Plague is in the House.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Let us hear your Diagnosticks.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>First, Then we may be assured
we have this Disease, when we value any
Person chiefly because his advantages are of
the same nature with those we enjoy, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
others who have an equal right to
Regard, only because their Privileges are of a
different kind from our own. For instance,
when Men who derive their considerableness
from the Sword, the Gown, or their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
think none worthy their Esteem
but such as claim under their own Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
In this case it's evident it can be nothing
but Partiality and Conceitedness which makes
them give the Preheminence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We may certainly conclude our
selves infected with this Vice, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Rights of our Neighbour, not upon
the account of Covetousness, but of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
only that we may have it in our power
to create Dependencies, and to give another
that which is already his own.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When Men don't measure their
civil Advantages by the Laws of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but by their own fancies, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of Flatterers; this is another infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
sign they are Proud.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to mention no more, When Men
love to make themselves the subject of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
To conn over their Pedigrees, and
obtrude the Blazon of their exploits upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61346:38"/>
the company; this is an argument they are
overgrown with conceit, and very much
smitten with themselves.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Though I think you have hit the
symptoms pretty well, yet except they are
marked somewhat more distinctly, 'tis possible
for a Man to have most of them without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
e'er the wiser. For unless we are able
to draw up a just State of the Degrees of
merit, we can never take the true height of
our Pretensions, and being in this uncertainty
it's odds if self Love does not make us deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to the prejudice of our Neighbours.
Now I would gladly know how we must go
to work to be sufficiently informed in this
Point.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>We must endeavour to get right
apprehensions of the several Excellencies of
humane Nature, and what proportion they
hold to each other: In order to the assisting
our Judgment in this case I shall lay down
these general rules.</p>
                     <p>First, Those advantages which spring from
our selves, which are the effects of our power
and courage, of our Industry or Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
are more valuable than those which
are derived, and borrowed, because they are
a sign of a Richer and more active nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Those Qualities which are most
useful ought to have the Preference: for
since acknowledgments ought to be suitable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61346:38"/>
to the nature of benefits received, those who
have the largest Capacity of obliging, may
fairly challenge the Perheminence in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
and therefore in the third place the
duration of an advantage ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd;
And that which has the firmest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and is most likely to continue, ought
to be prefer'd to others which are brittle and
short lived. These rules carefully apply'd
will shew us how far our pretensions to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
are short of, or exceed other Mens, and
so prevent an over-weening opinion of our
selves. However, we are to observe that
outward Respect ought to be given according
to the Distinctions of; Law, and though a
Man may happen to be very defective in
point of merit, yet we ought to take notice
of the value Authority has set upon him.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Give me leave to put in a word,
which is to tell you, that though I am not
satisfied with your Instances, yet I am glad
to find you will allow us different degrees
of worth. I was almost afraid you would
have set all Mankind upon a Level.</p>

I freely grant you that the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Quality ought to be kept up for

the reason of my Concession; you will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No, not till you give me a farther
occasion; especially since the inference of your
discourse is not unacceptable: from whence
it followeth, that when a Man sees plainly
that he has the Advantage of his Neighbour,
he may let him understand so much without
any offence to humility.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>No doubt of it, especially when
his station is publick; but then the discovery
of his superiority ought to be managed with
a great deal of Art and good nature, to which
we are obliged not only in point of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance
but Justice. For though there is often
a real disterence between one Man and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
yet the party who has the advantgae
usually magnifies the inequality beyond all
Sense, and Proportion. Men don't consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the great priviledges of humane
Nature are common to the whole Kind; such
as being equally related to God and <hi>Adam,</hi>
Reason and Immortality, the same number of
Senses, and much of the same perfection and
continuance. And as for those things which
are the peculiar Advantages of a few; they
are either acquired and enjoyed by the strength
of those general ones I have mentioned, or
else they are forein and in a great measure
Chimerical, and therefore can be no real
enrichments of our nature. They are often
no more than the Blessings of Chance, of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and Imagination. And though they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61346:39"/>
may set us upon higher Ground, yet they
can add nothing to the true Stature of our
Being. But to combate this Vice more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully,
we'll examine its most plausible
Pretences, and see if we can discover the
weakness of them.</p>

                     <p>You talk as if you were retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>I tell you once again you are
much mistaken. I have no design to lessen
the value of any mans Honour, or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:

                     <p>I somwhat suspect you have a
mind to engross this Vice of Pride to your
self. This sort of discourse looks like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
against Arbitrary Power, where the
sharpest Invectives are commonly made by
the most Enterprizing, and unmortifyed Men,
who are only angry that they are not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61346:40"/>
of that absoluteness themselves, which
they endeavour to render odious in others.</p>

                     <p>Hah! you are somewhat smart.
However let me tell you, if I have any such
project as you imagine, you have me upon
a fair Dilemma. For, if my reasons against
Pride hold good, they will stand upon record
against my self, which I suppose will be no
unacceptable revenge for you: if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant,
you will have the diversion of
laughing at the folly of the attempt: and
which is more considerable, you may keep
your good opinion of yourself into the bargain.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray begin your attack as you think
fit, and for disputes sake I'll try how far I
can maintain the ground against you.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>First then, Learning (to begin there)
and High Conceit agree very well together:
for a Man of Letters may have a clearer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the stupidness and deformity of this
Vice, and being better acquainted with the
frame and passions of humane Nature, he
can't choose but discover how unacceptable
it must make him to all Mankind. Besides
he is supposed to know that nothing in strict
reason deserves a true Commendation, but a
right use of the Liberty of our Will, which is
in every ones power to manage to advantage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Learning gives us a fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the impersection of our nature, which
one would think might dispose us to Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61346:40"/>
The more a Man knows the more he
discovers his ignorance. He can scarce look
upon any part of the Creation, but he finds
himself encompassed with doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
There is scarce any thing so trifling
or seemingly common, but perplexes his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
if he has but sense enough to
look into all the objections which may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
about it. He knows he has a being 'tis
true, and so does a Peasant, but what this
thing is which he calls himself, is hard to
say. He has reason to believe, that he is
compounded of two very different Ingredients,
Spirit, and Matter; but how such unallyed
and disproportioned substances should hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Correspondence and act upon each other, no
mans Learning yet could ever tell him. Nay
how the parts of Matter cohere, is a Question
which it's likely will never be well answer'd
in this life. For though we make use of the
fairest <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> yet if we pursue the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
home, we shall go nigh to dispute
away our Bodies, and reason our selves all
in pieces. Insomuch that if we had nothing
but Principles to encourage us, we might
justly be afraid of going abroad, lest we
should be blown away like a heap of dust:
For it's no solution to say the greater parts
of Matter are connected with hooked parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
for still the difficulty returns how these
Hooks were made? <hi>Quis custodiet ipsos
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61346:41"/>
Custodes?</hi> What is it that fastens this Soder,
and links these first Principles of Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Chain? And as the more refined Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
know little or nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of the material World; so upon
Enquiry we shall find them as defective in
their Skill about Moral Truths: (excepting
those who are taught by Revelation, which
supernatural Discoveries the unlearned are
capable of understanding, as far as their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is concerned.) Those who made Laws in
their respective Countries, we have reason to
believe had their minds polished above the
vulgar rate: And yet we see how unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
the publick Constitutions of Nations va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> allowed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Stealing, and some
<hi>Indians Herodotus</hi> mentions, used to bury
their best Friends in their Stomachs. In
short, the Rules of Decency, of Government,
of Justice it self, are so different in one place
from what they are in another, so party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
and contradictious, that one would
almost think the Species of men altered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Climates; and that they
had not the same Nature in common. One
would almost think that Right and Wrong
lay rather in the Fancies of men, than in
the reason of things, and was bounded more
by Seas and Rivers, than by any unalterable
limits of Nature; that Virtue and Vice were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61346:41"/>
minted by the Civil Magistrate, and like
Coins would pass for Currant only in his
own Dominions. The Heathen Philosophers
may fairly be granted to have as good pretences
to Learning, as any other sort of men among
them: And yet we may observe from <hi>Tully</hi>
and <hi>Laertius</hi> what a small Proportion of solid
Knowledge they were Masters of; how
strangely did they differ in Matters of the
highest Import? How eagerly did they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
and not without probability on both
sides: Whether there was any thing certain?
Whether the Criterions of Truth and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
were clear and indubitable or not? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Government of the World was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,
fatal, or providential? How many <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
Bonums</hi> have they presented us with,
some of them only fit to entertain a Brute,
others noble enough for a Spirit of the highest
Order? It were tedious to recount the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
one Sect had with another, their Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences
with themselves, and the ridiculous
and ill supported Tenets some of the most
famous of them have held. Insomuch that
<hi>Tully</hi> takes notice that there was no opinion
so absurd, but was held by some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
or other. 'Tis true they could wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and Harangue better than the common
People; they could talk more plausibly about
that they did not understand; but their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lay chiefly in Flourish, and Terms, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61346:42"/>
Cant; for as for any real Improvements in
Science they were not much wiser than the
less pretending Multitude. Indeed the more
modest of them would confess that the chief
use of Learning was to give us a fuller discovery
of our Ignorance, and to keep us from being
peremptory and dogmatical in our determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Now one would imagine the more
intimate Acquaintance we had with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of our Nature, the greater reason
we should have to be humble. Is Weakness
a proper Foundation to erect our lofty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
upon? Indeed he that has not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or capacity to examine how it's with
him, may be fondly persuaded to fancy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
somebody, and grow vain upon the kind
presumption; but for a man to be proud who
can demonstrate his own poverty, is little
less than Madness.</p>

                     <p>If the case stands thus, to make

                     <p>Pray don't interrupt me, and I will
try if I can give you a little Ease. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore, as we may, that Learning does
give some advantage, and that our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
are really enriched by it; yet in
regard we have but a few Principles to build
upon, the greatest part of our Knowledge
must consist in Inferences, which can't be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61346:42"/>
wrought out without great Labour and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of mind: And when we are at any
distance from self-evident Truths, the mind
is not only perplexed with the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a great many Circumstances, but which
is worse, Forgetfulness or Mistake in the least
of them, frustrates our whole Design, and
rewards us with nothing but Error for our
trouble.</p>
                     <p>Now he that is so liable to be imposed
upon, who rises but by Inches, and enriches
himself, by such slow and insensible Degrees;
'tis a Sign that his Stock was either very
small, or that he is unskilfull in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of his Business, and therefore he has
no reason to be proud of what he has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
Besides it's an humbling consideration
to reflect what pains we are obliged to take
to muster up our Forces, and to make that
little reason we have serviceable. How fast
does Obscurity, Flatness and Impertinency
slow in upon our Meditations? 'Tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Task to talk to the purpose, and to put
life and perspicuity into our Discourses; those
who are most ready and inventive have not
their best Thoughts uppermost: No, they
must think upon the Stretch, ransack, and
turn over their mind, and put their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
into a kind of Ferment, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to produce any thing extraordinary:
So that considering the Trouble and almost
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61346:43"/>
Violence we are put upon, one would think
that Sense and Reason was not made for
Mankind, and that we strive against our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we pretend to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well; What though our Minds
were poor, and unfurnished at first, is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disparagement to us to have more Wit
than we were born with? What though we
can't strike out a Science at a Heat, but are
forced to polish our selves by degrees, and
to work hard for what we have? The less
we were assisted by Nature, the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
it is to our Industry, and our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
are so much the more our own.
And since we have thus fairly distinguished
our selves by Merit, why should we seem
unapprehensive of our Performances? since
we have paid so dear for the Improvements
of our understanding, and our advantages
are gained with so much Difficulty, what harm
is it to make our best of them? Why should
we not oblige the negligent to Distance and
Regard, and make those who are younger
or less knowing than our selves sensible of
their Inferiority?</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I agree with you as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hinted, that a Man may lawfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Character and just pretences against
Rudeness and Ignorance, especially when the
publick Good is concerned in his Reputation.
But when he acts a private part, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61346:43"/>
with People of Sense and Modesty, he
should give them but very gentle remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of his Prerogative: his Opinion of
his own worth should but just dawn upon
them, and at the most give them but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and remote notice, that he expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
singular Acknowledgment: He should
take the respect that is paid him rather as
a Present than a Debt, and seem thankful
for that which is his own: But to be stiff
and formally reserved as if the Company did
not deserve our Familiarity; to be haughty
and contemptuous, and to make scanty and
underproportioned returns of Civility: this
is a downright Challenge of Homage, and
plainly tells people, they must be very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly:
'Tis in effect to say, Gentlemen, I have
more Learning, and have done the publick
greater Service than you, and therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be considered for it: you may possibly
say that I have more preferment too, and
am paid for my merit in mony, but that
shall not serve your turn; for except you
shew your selves very dutiful, I shall give
you broad Signs of my dissatisfaction, and
never let you have the Honour of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
again. Now such a Man if he went
much abroad, would plague mankind more
with his Company, than he could oblige
them with his Writings, though they were
never so considerable. Such People seem to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61346:44"/>
owe their parts to their ill Temper: Their
Industry is malicious, and they have taken
pains not so much to oblige the World, as
to get an Opportunity of trampling upon
their Inferious. Had they been good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they would have been as dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
as their Neighbours. But their
imperious Carriage is just as reasonable as it
would have been for the old <hi>Athletae</hi> to
have drudged hard in Eating and Exercise,
that they might employ their Bulk and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in beating every one who was weaker,
and less skilful than themselves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>By your discourse you seem to
mistake the matter, and not to weigh things
rightly. 'Tis not Superiority that these
Gentlemen of Learning are so solicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
'tis not personal Advantage which they
chiefly intend by their Reservedness: They
have no doubt a more publick and generous
Design; for you may observe they usually
bear hardest upon those of their own Order
and Profession, which is nothing but a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and politick stateliness for the promoting
of Knowledg in others. The young Fry,
whether you know it or not, must be held
at a Distance, and kept under the Discipline
of Contempt. If you give them any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Quarter, you indulge them in their Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and ruin them to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
For who would be at the trouble of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61346:44"/>
Learning, when he finds his Ignorance is
caressed, and that he is easie and acceptable
enough in the Company of the best Authors
of the Town? But when you brow-beat
them and maul them, you make them Men
for ever; for <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum;</hi> though
they have no natural Metal, yet if they are
spurred and kicked they will mend their pace,
if they have any feeling. Such rigorous usage
will make them study night and day to get
out of this ignominious Condition, in hopes
that it may come to their own turn to be
proud one day. Take my word for it, there
is no such way to make a Scholar, as to
keep him under while he is young, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preferred.</p>

                     <p>Notwithstanding your Flourish I
can't perswade my self that this Dispensation
of Pride is so mighty useful as you pretend
I should think such an untoward manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any Accomplishment should rather
discourage others from attempting such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
circumstances. If Sense and Learning
are such unsociable imperious things, a good natured
Man ought to take especial care not
to improve too fast. He ought to keep down
the growth of his Reason, and curb his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals
when he finds them ready to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip
his Neighbours. I assure you, if I was
of your opinion, and thought my self near the
temptation to so much ill humour, I would
never look on a Book again.</p>

                     <p>Come when you have said all, there
is no keeping up the Credit of Learning
without that which you call a reserved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
For if those who are eminent this
way should condescend to those Familiarities
which you seem to desire, the honour of
their Profession would suffer much by it; if
they should converse upon the Level, the
veneration which their Inferiours have for
them would quickly wear off: And if the
vulgar observed there was no distinction kept
up amongst the Men of Letters; they would
suspect there was nothing extraordinary in
any of them. Pray who are supposed to be
the best Judges of Learning, those who have
it or others?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Then if they seem to undervalue it
themselves, is not this the way to bring it
into a general disrepute? I tell you once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if the privileges of Merit are not insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
upon all, must go to wrack. If a Man
who has digested all the Fathers, and is ready
to add himself to the Number, shews any
tolerable countenance to one who has scarce
rubbed through <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and lets a pure
English Divine to go cheek by jole with him,
the Commonwealth of Learning will grow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as contemptible as that of the Pigmies,
and be only sit to write Romances upon.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I shall not enquire how far this
lofty method may advance the Reputation
of Learning, but I am pretty sure it's no great
addition to theirs who use it; for it only
makes others more inquisitive into their defects,
and more inclinable to expose them. If they
take them tardy they endeavour to humble
them by way of Reprizal. Those slips and
mismanagements are usually ridiculed and
aggravated, when such Persons are guilty of
them, which would be overlooked or excused
in others of a more modest and affable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
If they happen to be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with themselves: If their vanity
of appearing singular puts them upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
Paradoxes, and proving them as Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxically.
If a presumption upon their own
strength, and a desire of greater triumph
makes them venture too far into the enemies
Quarters, and take up a Post which they
can't maintain; they are usually laught at
for their folly and left to shift for themselves;
for Pride never has any friends, and all Men
are glad of a just occasion to lessen his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
who makes such an ill-natured use
of it.</p>

                     <p>No, I grant there is another sort
of People who use them with neglect enough:
But then they are somewhat more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.
They have not such fair opportunities
to understand the just pretences of a liberal
Education, and a Religious employment.
They are apt to fall under unfortunate hands
in their minority: The vanity of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and the Knavery of Flatterers often
gives them a wrong notion of themselves, and
makes them admire nothing but Wealt hand
Greatness, and think no condition deserves
regard but that which resembles their own. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their neglect looks less unaccountably
by reason of their Quality, and their Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
makes their Pride sit more decently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. They usually contemn with a better
Grace than others: for there is a great deal
of Art and Mystery in Pride to manage it
handsomely: A man might almost as soon
learn a Trade: and if we observe we shall
find that those who were not brought up to
it, seldom prove their Crafts-master or practise
with any sort of address. To which I may
add, that such Persons are usually willing to
pay for their imperiousness, so that a Man
is not made a Fool for nothing. But when
this lofty humour is clumsily and inartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
managed, when it's affected by those of
a self-denying and mortified Profession, and
who get their Living by declaiming against
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61346:46"/>
it. When it's taken up by Men of Sense,
who may well be expected to see through
the folly of this Vice, and who generally
have not those pretences of a byassed Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to misguide them: especially when
they play it upon Persons of their own Order
who were born and bred to as fair Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Regard as themselves, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their Inferiours in nothing so much as
in Success; this is such a singular Practice
that I had rather leave it undescribed than
be forced to give it its proper Character.</p>

you consider that these Gentlemen of the

are many of them Curates; and is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reasonable there should be a distance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

confound these two Relations by lavish and

and by degrees the very notion of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority.
If there is not a due Homage paid
in Conversation, those who are in a state of
subjection will neither know their Condition
nor their Duty: They will be apt to forget
they hold by a servile Tenure, and think
themselves enfranchised from all manner of
Suit and Service. Besides, if the Parson should
use his Curate with that freedom which you
insinuate, as if there was neither dependence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61346:47"/>
nor obligation between them; this might be
of very ill example to the Parish, and make
all other servants challenge the same liberty,
and grow pert upon their Masters: And when
this Sawciness became universal, as it's likely
it might do in a short time, what less Mischief
could be expected from it, than an old <hi>Scythian</hi>
Rebellion?</p>

                     <p>I confess, I was not aware the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Government depended so much upon
the distinction between Rector and Curate,
and that if the modern way of Distance and
Subordination was not kept up, we must
presently return to <hi>Hobs</hi>'s state of Nature.
If a Curate be such a dangerous thing, that
a little civil Usage to him is ready to make
the World fall about our Ears, I wonder
why so many of them are suffered. Now
without raising the <hi>posse Comitatus,</hi> if the
Pluralists would but do their best to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them, their Number might quickly be
so retrenched, that they would not be in
the least formidable. But you seem to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
all this while upon a wrong Principle,
you take it for granted, that Curates are
Servants; now if this proves a mistake, you
will own they may be treated with a little
more freedom, without any danger to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

                     <p>But the Rector has no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Curate after he is Licensed and

therefore; if the Curate was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
to wait upon the Rector, nor has
his Authority from him, nor can be removed

of the benefits of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Because I am willing to rescue them
from that contempt, which they will certainly
fall into, as long as they pass under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which considering the number of persons
Officiating, this way, must be very prejudicial
to Religion. Besides it makes some persons,
who are fit to do the Church service, suspend
themselves, and shew their Priesthood only
by their Habit, rather than serve God under
such uncreditable circumstances: and for the
same reason others are tempted to grow too
fond of a Presentation, and choose rather to
court it by Flattery, or other indirect pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
than be condemned to the servile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a Curate. For let me tell you, it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61346:49"/>
no ordinary piece of Self-Denial, for a Man
of a generous Education, who has been train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up all along to Freedom and good Usage,
to be degraded in his Manhood, when the
mind is most in love with Liberty, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon Business with marks of disadvantage,
when he stands most in need of Reputation.
To my thinking this is a very discouraging
and preposterous way of Educating the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
If a Man must go to service, he had better
begin with it as they do in Trades, and not
be Master at first, and then be forced to turn
Apprentice, or Journyman afterwards. Of
such ill consequence it is to miscal things, and
as <hi>Plato</hi> observes, that an alteration of the
Notes in Musick is apt to produce an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Laws and Customs of a Country:
so by changing the names of Offices for
others of less Repute, we change the Uses and
Designs of them, and make them less satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to those engaged, and less serviceable to
the Publick than they would have been, if the
Character of their Institution had been kept up.</p>

                     <p>Granting at present what you say

with Abatement.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, People are apt to fancy that it
is the want either of Parts or Conduct, which
keeps him without a Patron.</p>

                     <p>If People think so, I am sorry their
Sense and Charity is no greater; for if they
examined things fairly, they would find that
the being a Curate is no Argument of a Mans
insignificancy, nor any just blemish to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
For it is often the integrity and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
temper of his mind which hinders him
from a better Provision; it is because he will
not flatter the Pride of some, nor keep pace
with the Bigottry of others: because he will
neither court Greatness nor Faction, nor make
himself popular to the disadvantage of his
Audience. Because he cannot digest a Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Contract, nor charge through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perjury
with the courage of an Evidence. In short, it
is his plain and impartial dealing with the
People, his resolution to preserve the Decency
of his Character, and the Innocence of his
Conscience which bars his promotion: so
that if he was mean enough to complain, he
might have the satisfaction to apply this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Tully</hi> to himself, <hi>Non nos vitia sed

                     <p>Why, to mention no more, the 18<hi>th</hi>
of the Apostles Canons, and the 80<hi>th</hi> of the
Council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> are, I think, considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Evidence; the first of which forbids the
ordaining of those who had married a Servant,
and the other excludes manumized Persons,
while their Patrons were living, from the
Priesthood.</p>

                     <p>Because by those Injunctions a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man

the modern opinion, this provision signifies
nothing; for if a man must go to Service af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is in Orders, had he not as good do it
before? In you sence he often only changes
his Lay for an Ecclesiastical Master, which
sometimes might be so far from an advantage
that it would make the Servitude the more
uneasie, by being subjected to one no more
than equal to himself.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant you in the Primitive Times
the advantage of Priesthood was equally sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61346:51"/>
among all the Order, and none of that
Character had any Superiority over another.
For then the Revenues of the Church consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only in the voluntary Offerings of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which were all deposited with the Bishop,
who assigned every one his respective portion;
so that no Priest had any dependence upon
another for his maintenance; but now the
case is otherwise, and a manought to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to him that supports him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>It's somewhat hard, that the bare
alteration of the Church Revenues should
make so wide a difference between those
who were equal before; that a man must
lose his freedom only for want of a Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and be made a Servant because he does
not take Tithes, though he has as much spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Authority as if he did. But I perceive
you think there is no consideration equivalent
to a little money, and that he who receives
it must be no longer at his own disposal,
though he makes never so valuable a return.
Since therefore you insist so much upon main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnance,
what if it appears that the Curate
maintains the Parson?</p>

                     <p>No, I'm afraid they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Then if the Curate does all the
work, ought he not to have the reward for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61346:52"/>
his pains? In short, either he is qualified to
undertake the Parish or not; if not, with
what sincerity can he be employed? If he is
qualified, why is he barred the profit when
he only performs the Conditions upon which
they were settled, when none but himself
answers the design they were intended for?
To speak properly, the Rector seems to live
out of the labours of another, he is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the perquisites of the Curates Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and therefore is in effect but a kind of
Pensioner to him.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I see you are an everlasting Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
you won't allow any encouragement to
extraordinary Industry and Merit.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>You mistake me. I would have the
best men have the best Livings, but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we go to doubling of Preferments, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it were not amiss to examine whether the
number of Benefices exceeds the Persons who
are capable of them. Let us first examine
whether they will hold out one apiece, and
when every man has one, then the supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary
Livings may be divided amongst those
who are most deserving.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>In good time, when it's likely there
there will be none left! Now do you imagine
the Church can be defended against her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
by the strength of a single Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage?
But it may be you will say all our
Plurality-men are not Writers.</p>

                     <p>No, nor Readers neither. Besides,
we may observe that Heresie and Schism were
very successfully combated before Unions,
Dispensations, and Consolidations were heard
of. If you consult Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s History of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> (p. 216.) he will inform
you that Non-residence and Pluralities are
things of no very primitive establishment. I
confess some of the Lay-managers of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
have not been over-kind to the
Church, so that Affairs are not in so good a
posture as they might have been: But God
be thanked there is still some provision left
for the Ornament and Defence of Religion.</p>

                     <p>Why, to speak to your Case, there
are Dignities, to which those Gentlemen who

have a good right: And with submission to

which they should be obliged to draw their

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Those peaceable men you speak of,
are none of the most useful in a time of War,
and therefore a smaller Gratification should
content them.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Then they should be continued for

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly this is a good probable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to keep the Church Militia in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and might for ought I know, very
much improve the <hi>noble Science of Controversie.</hi>
But to return to the old Argument, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to bring me over to your opinion of the
Curate, you must clear the business of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
a little better, for I am afraid where he
has his money he ought to own he has his
Master too.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess there would be a great
deal in what you say, if the Rector had the
right of Coinage. If the Money had his
Image, and Superscription upon it, the
Curate's taking it for currant, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him under his Jurisdiction: but that
the bare receiving a sum should sink a Man
into a servile state, is past my comprehension.
For considering that Mony is a thing of such
quality, and sovereign sway in the World,
one would imagine it should bring Power
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61346:53"/>
and Reputation along with it, and rather
enlarge than abridge a Man's Liberty by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it. And to mention nothing farther,
the nature of the Contract between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Curate, is sufficient to give you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
for there, as has been observed, the
Curate undertakes no other Employment but
the Instruction and Government of the
Parish. There is no attendance upon the
Parson, no running upon his Errands, nor
subjection to his Humour indented for.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Methinks it is a little hard a Curate
must not be called a Servant, as well as a
Cook, or a Footman, since he has Wages as
much as the other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Possibly not always so much nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but waving that, if you had remembred
what I urged to you before, this Objection
would have been no difficulty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>What was that?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, that the Curate is to wait
upon none but God Almighty, that the
manage of his Employment is not prescribed
by the Rector, but by the Rubrick and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church, and that he is not
removeable at pleasure. I suppose by this
time you apprehend there is a difference
between him and a Footman, or a Steward
either.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well! Notwithstanding your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety,
this notion of Wages sticks in my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
still.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61346:54"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I wonder the glitter of a little Mony
should dazle your Eyes at that rate, that
you cannot see so plain a distinction. You
don't seem to understand Commerce, if you
think that something of Authority and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is always given in exchange for Mony.
Now I am of <hi>Diogenes</hi> his mind, and believe
it possible for one to buy a Master, as well as
a Servant.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>As how?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, for the purpose, if a person of
twenty one puts himself Apprentice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you know this is seldom done without
charge: now what does a Man do in this case
but purchase his subjection, and hire himself
a drubbing upon occasion? To give one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
more. When a Woman of Fortune mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a Man with nothing, does she not give
him Meat, Drink, and Wages to govern her?
And to end this dispute, you know Physicians,
and Lawyers, and Judges, have Fees or
Wages, either given, or assigned them by
Law, without being thought Servants to
those they are concerned with, Now, what
reason is there a Curate should have worse
luck with his Mony than other People?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>To deal plainly, I suppose it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he does not get enough of it. If his
Fees were as considerable as any of those
Gentlemen you speak of, I question not but
his Office would be much more reputable.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Well guessed, and therefore what
Character do they deserve who confine him
to this scandalous Pittance. I believe you
can scarcely name any sort of Injustice which
has a more malignant influence upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than this oppresion of Curates.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Because their Poverty exposes them
to Contempt, which renders their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
insignificant, and which is worse, makes
them less considerable in themselves, as well

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>No, but it's a scurvy temptation,
especially to those who have lived freely, and
been bred to better Expectations. For when
a man finds his hopes disappointed, himself
unsupported, and topp'd upon by Persons of
meaner Pretences and Employments; this
is apt to pall his Spirits, and check the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of his thoughts, so that his Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                     <p>I grant there is some truth in your
observation, and that it is Want which often
reconciles men to Labour and Letters; but
this is at their first setting out, when though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61346:55"/>
they have not gained their point, yet they
are full of hopes, which pricks them on,
and puts them upon their utmost. but after
they are once qualified for success, and find
their industry discouraged, this makes them
sink in the socket, and fret away their
strength and Spirits; so that either out of
impotence, or disgust, or dispair, they give
over the fruitless pursuit, and seldom make
any generous attempt ever after. 'Tis true,
there are some hardy souls that won't be
beaten off by ill usage, but these are very
rarely to be met with.</p>

                     <p>Yes; I think they would have
more Books, and more Learning, and more
Credit. They would not be so easily obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to improper Compliances, nor so liable
to serveral other miscarriages in their Conduct.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I say then, for a Clergy man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
himself by the labour and necessities of
one of his own Order, and make his Figure
out of the Church without performing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61346:55"/>
required, is a direct translating the holy
Revenues to a Foreign and secular use, and
consequently besides other aggravations is
no better than sacrilege, which is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical
Sin, and unless we are very much
in the dark will be accounted for afterwards.
In short this Practice has been the main ground
of the Contempt of the Clergy, making one
part of them grow cheap by their Poverty,
and the other by their Covetousness.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>To speak within Compass, in my
Opinion the Curate ought to have half the
profits, let the value of them be never so
considerable; for if the Parson has the other
moiety for doing nothing, I think he has no
reason to complain. But if the Living be
small, then he that supplies it should have
two thirds assigned him, because he cannot
be decently supported under that proportion.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, I am not disposed to examin
that matter any farther. But I beseech you
what is all this to the business of Pride? I
think your Zeal for the Curates has tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
you a little out of your Subject.</p>

                     <p>No such matter; for it is generally
nothing but Ambition which makes Men
Covetous and Mean: besides, if it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
it is a very seasonable one. However

                     <p>With all my Heart, and since (as
has been shewed) Learning and Conceit,
make so odd a Figure; let us proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the pretences of Nobility, for I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
the Vulgar Notion of it is screwed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too high, and that it has not Ballast

                     <p>I must tell you, you are upon a

treat so nice a subject as this is with proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I am sensible of what you say, and
shall manage my enquiry with all the fairness,
and decency, the free discussion of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
will allow. To begin, you know all
Men were equally Noble, or if you will,
equally Plebeian at first: now I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand how they came to be so much
distinguished afterwards, for there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
reasons assigned.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I suppose the distinctions you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were founded upon extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
and won at the expence of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Merit. For how can you imagine
any persons should emerge out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Mass of Mankind, unless by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Capacity, Labour, and Resolution?
Their mounting, argues that Fire was the
ruling Element in their Composition; and
that they were of a more vigorous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing
Spirit than their Neighbours.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I am willing to suppose with you,
that they made a generous use of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and employed them for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of Mankind: being as remarkable for their
Justice, Fidelity, and good Humour, as for
their Conduct and Courage; and therefore I
am not willing to believe the account which
some pretend to give concerning the Original
of Nobility.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>What is that?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61346:57"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>They will tell you that it has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
founded upon Rapine and Injustice. It seems
they have observed out of <hi>Thucidides,</hi> that in
antient times it was counted an Heroick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivement
to Plunder lustily, and he was a
Man of the best Quality, who was able to
steal most Cattle. These <hi>Nimrods</hi> (say they)
grew great by the strength of their Limbs
and their Vices, engraved their Murthers
upon their Shields, and Hectored all the little
and peaceable People into Peasantry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>This looks so like a Chimerical and
ill natur'd Opinion, that I shall not do it the
honor of a Confutation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no exceptions to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,
but to go on, for the more distinct
consideration of the Argument, we will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Nobility into two kinds, Hereditary, or
Acquired. The first is transmitted to us from
our Ancestors, the other is immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by the favour of the Prince.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Proceed upon the several parts of
your Division.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>1. Then, Hereditary Nobility seems
no just ground for a high Opinion, because it
is borrowed. Those great Actions which we
had no share in, cannot properly be any part
of our Commendation, especially if we want
abilities to imitate them. 'Tis true, they
ought to be taken notice of by others for the
encouragement of Vertue, and the ornament
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61346:58"/>
of Society. But then he that depends wholly
upon the worth of others, ought to consider
that he has but the honor of an Image, and
is worshiped not for his own sake, but upon
the account of what he represents. To be
plain, it is a sign a Man is very poor when he
has nothing of his own to appear in; but is
forced to patch up his Figure with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of the Dead, and rifle Tomb-Stones and
Monuments for Reputation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Notwithstanding your rallying, I
cannot conceive what crime it is to possess the
Inheritance of our Forefathers. Now Honor
is part of their Estate, which was raised on
purpose that we might be the better for it.
And since their Children were the occasion of
their merit, and pushed them on to generous
undertakings, ought they not to share in the
glory of the Success?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. But it should be managed with
great modesty, because though an honourable
Title may be conveyed to Posterity, yet the
ennobling Qualities which are the Soul of
Greatness, are a sort of incommunicable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and cannot be transferred. Indeed
if a Man could bequeath his Virtues by Will,
and settle his Sense, and Learning, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
upon his Children, as certainly as he
can his Lands, a brave Ancestor would be a
mighty privilege.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61346:58"/>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope those fine Qualities are not
so incommunicable as you suppose, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
there is a <hi>Ie ne scay quoi,</hi> in persons
well born: there is a peculiar Nobleness of
Temper in them, their Conversation is inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
graceful, and a Man may distinguish
their Quality by the Air of their Faces.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I wish that Spirit of Honor and
Bravery you mention, was inseparable to their
Quality; but it is too plain that great Minds,
and great Fortunes don't always go together;
however I grant there is some Truth in your
observation, but am afraid the distinction
does not always spring from the cause you
assign. For by the gracefulness of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I suppose you mean a decent Assurance,
and an Address in the Modes, and Gestures
of Salutation. Now these are pretty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
I confess, and recommend a Man
to Company with some advantage; but then
they are easily gained by Custom and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore we need not fetch them
<hi>ex Traduce.</hi> And moreover, these little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
are often magnified beyond all Sense
and Reason, and some People are so Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
fond of them, as if they were the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
perfections of Human Nature; and that it
were in reality a more valuable and gentile
quality to Dress well, and come handsomely
into a Room, than to take a Town, or to be
fit to discharge the Office of a Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61346:59"/>
Now with submission to these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Gentlemen, I am not of their mind
in this matter, but think it much better for a
Mans Parts to lie in his Head, than in his
Heels.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I think so too, but you have not
answered the whole.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>True! Your Air was omitted: now
if this was a constant privilege of Birth,
which you know it is not, yet in this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Age of ours, there is no Arguing from
an Outside. Besides, I doubt this Advantage
is sometimes the effect of a slothful and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
Life. When Men will attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either in the Field, or in their Closets:
when they will neither trouble themselves
with Thinking, nor endure to be exposed to
the Weather: This Niceness, though it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them insignificant to the great purposes of
Life, yet it Polishes their Complexion, and
makes their Spirits seem more moving and
transparent. Sometime this Sprightliness and
Grandeur of Face, is Painted by Flattery:
for when Men are once made to believe they
are very Considerable, they are presently for
trying to write the Inscriptions of their Quality
upon their Forehead. Now Conceit when
it is Corrected with a mixture of Gravity,
is an admirable <hi>Wash,</hi> and will make one
look as Wise, and as Great as you would
wish.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61346:59"/>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>This Grandeur of Face, as you call
it, may possibly be explained upon kinder
Principles; for I am apt to believe that a
quick Sense of Honour, a Consciousness
of Worth, an Elevation of Thought, will
sometimes break out into a Lustre, and
make the great Soul sparkle in a Man's Eyes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot deny what you say,
and therefore the best Construction ought to
be made, where the known Character of the
person does not disallow it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I see you can be fair when you list,
therefore I shall venture to go on with you to
another Advantage of Nobility, <hi>viz.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Now to begin in your own way,
Don't you think it is a great addition to ones
Birth to stand at the bottom of long Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Pedigree, and be some yards removed
from the first Escocheon? Is not that Family
substantially Built which can stand the shock
of Time, and hold out against all varieties of
Accidents? How generous must that Blood be,
which has been so long Refining, and run
through the Channels of Honor for so many
Ages, where it is sometimes as hard to come
to the Plebeian Fountain: as to find out the
Head of <hi>Nilus?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so hard neither, For if you go
but one Inch farther than the Gentleman at
the Topyou spoke of, it is ten to one but you
take old Goodman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Leathern
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61346:60"/>
Breeches. And as for the Antiquity of a
Family, though it looks prettily at first sight,
yet I fear it will abate upon examination.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray try your skill upon it, for I
am not of your mind.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Then to deal plainly with you, I
conceive the Antiquity you talk of, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
nothing but antient Wealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the chief commendation of this Privilege
consists in the long continued Frugality of the
Family, who after they were once possessed
of an Estate, had the Discretion to keep it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it nothing then for a Man's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
to have lived in Reputation, and to
have had Interest and Command in their
Country for so many Generations?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I suppose the <hi>English</hi> of all this is
no more than that they have lived in good
Houses, Eat and Drank better, and born
higher Offices than those who have wanted a
Fortune. Now Mony, and a moderate share
of Sense, will furnish any Man with all these
Advantages. And as to the holding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so many Accidents, and Alterations of
State, I am afraid it sometimes proceeds from
shifting and indifferent Principles, and from a
servile compliance with whatever is Upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.
So that what my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in reference to Notions and Inventions,
may be sometimes applicable to Families;
where he tells us, that Time is like a River,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61346:60"/>
in which Metals and solid Substances are
sunk, while Chaff and Straws swim upon
the Surface.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You are to consider that an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Gentility does not necessarily convey to
us any advantage either of Body or Mind:
and to speak like Philosophers, these are the
only two things in which we are capable of
any real improvement. I confess, if every
Generation grew Wiser, Stronger, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer,
or longer Lived than the other: if the
Breed of a Man's Family was thus improved,
the farther it was continued; then indeed the
quality of an Escocheon would be exactly
contrary to that of Cloaths, and the one
would always grow better, as the other does
worse, by wearing. From whence it would
follow, that if the seven Sleepers had been
made Gentlemen immediately before they
entred their Cave, and had held on their Nap
from seventy, to seven hundred years, they
had most undeniably slept themselves into
a considerable degree of Quality.</p>

                     <p>Pray don't grow warm, and I will
endeavour to satisfie you, and in order to it,
I observe in the third place, That an antient
Gentility, makes a Man Superior only to those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61346:61"/>
of the same Quality, <hi>(viz.</hi> an Esquire, to an
Esquire, and so in the rest) and that in nothing
but in point of Precedency. The reason, I
suppose, why those which are placed in any
degree of Honor, precede others who are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
raised to the same Height, is for the
encouragement of Industry. To make Men
forward to exert their earliest Endeavours to
deserve well of the State; for this reason there
is a distinction made between Merit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
equal, only upon the account of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of Time.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Look you! We that pretend to be
subject to a Constitution, must not Carve out
our own Quality, for at this rate a Cobler
may make himself a Lord.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, then I say, it is Vanity for
any Man to have a better Opinion of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
than the Law allows: my Reason is,
because the Law is the measure of Honor, as
well as of all other Civil Rights. Besides, I
must tell you that it is both reasonable, and
the Interest of the State that Merit should be
considered, of what date soever it is. A
worthy Action ought to be as much reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now, as one of the same kind was a
thousand years since. The prospect of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
to a generous Mind, is the chief incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all great Undertakings. This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61346:61"/>
Polishes Arts and Sciences, makes
Men Industrious in improving their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
and Resolute in exposing their
Persons, for the Publick Service. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we dote upon Antiquity so far, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
the Merit of the present Age, the
Government must necessarily suffer by it: for
such a Partiality will slacken the Nerves of
Industry, and occasion a negligence both in
those who have an antient Title to Honor,
and in those who have not. The first will
grow sluggish, because they have a sufficient
share of Reputation already; and therefore
need not run any hazards about getting
more. The latter will abate in their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to oblige their Country, because they
know their Service, though never so great,
will be contemned, and for that very Reason
which ought to make them the more valued,
that is, because their Considerableness came
from themselves. Moreover, If the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of antient Honor, have not by Personal
Additions improved that Stock which was
granted to their Ancestors; there is no reason
it should be rated above the same Degree
(Precedency excepted) which is given now.
For to affirm that a Family raised to Nobility
by this King, is not as good as one raised by
the Conqueror, is a reflection upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Majesty: it supposes his Judgment, or
his Authority, less considerable than that of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61346:62"/>
his Predecessours; and that the Fountain of
Honour is almost dry'd up, and runs more
muddy than in former Ages.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>How plausibly soever you may
make your opinion look, I'm sure it has the
disadvantage of being Singular. For you
know a plain Gentleman of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is accounted a Person of better Quality
than a new made Knight, though the reason
of his dubbing was never so Meritorious.
Honour like <hi>China</hi> Dishes must lie some
Ages under Ground before it comes to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
And to carry on your own Figure,
the greater distance from the spring always
makes the Stream the more considerable.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>This is to be wiser than the Laws!
And since you are for Illustrations I reply,
that to suppose an ancient Title (though
lesser in degree) is preferable to a greater
of late Creation, is as if one should affirm
that an old shilling is better than a new
half-Crown, though the Alloy and Impression
are the same in both. Nay from your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
a man may conclude that a coarser
metal only by being digg'd and refin'd in
the Dayes of our Great Grandfathers, (though
perhaps it has contracted some rust by lying)
is more valuable than the same weight in
Gold but lately separated from the Oare.
And that an ancient Estate is really better
than one newly purchased, though the Lands
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61346:62"/>
of the latter are richer, and the Survey lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the other. Now if a man should
prove so fanciful as to demand a greater
Rent for his Farm because it has been in the
Possession of his Family for some hundred
of years, I believe the want of Tenants would
soon convince him of his Errour. From
whence it's evident that in taking an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of Nobility we are not so much to
consider its Antiquity, as the Merit of the
first Grantee, and the distinction the Prince
has put upon it; which like Figures or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marks upon Money, stamp the value,
and tell the Subject for how much it is to pass.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray by your favour are not Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
and Coyns valued more for their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
than their Metal?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>That Question is to the point;
and therefore I answer,</p>
                     <p>First, That Coyns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they are
valuable as rarities, yet they signifie little
in Exchange and common use; And if a man
has any debt to pay, or Commodities to
buy, <hi>K. Charles</hi> his Image, and superscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will do him much more service than
Ce'sar's.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Reason why these things
are sometimes so much valued, is not because
they are old but useful: They often rectifie
Chronology, and explain History, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
us several material parts of Learning,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61346:63"/>
which might otherwise have been irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
lost.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a disparity in the case
of ancient Coyns and Families; For in the
first you have the same numerical peice, in
the latter nothing but the Name or Relation,
so that the change and succession of Persons
seems to destroy the notion of Antiquity.
To make the Instance parallel we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Gentleman as old as <hi>Methusalem,</hi> and
then I confess he would be a great Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and ought to be valued accordingly.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>As I remember you were saying,
the merit of the first Gentleman of the House
ought to be consider'd.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I conceive that circumstance
very material, and that if upon enquiry it
proves unintelligible, or unlucky, it's no small
abatement to the Family. For if he Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
himself by a voluntary engaging in unjust
Quarrels, he has no better pretence to Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
than what a resolute and successful Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may Challenge. If he owes his Heraldry
to a servile Flattery, and a dextrous Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the vices of Princes, the marks of
their Favour are rather infamous than Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable
to his Posterity, because he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
for those qualities, for which he ought
to have been punished.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>What if the Gentility was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
I hope we may make the best of what
we have paid for?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61346:63"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>By all means! But then this is a
sign that Worth and distinguishing Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were wanting, otherwise the Honour
had been conferred Gratis. The same may
be said when <hi>Arms</hi> or Titles are given at
the Instance or recommendation of a Favorite,
for this is down-right begging for Quality,
and looks more like an Alms than an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Father it's a lessening to a mans No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
when the Reason and Grounds of it
are unknown, for if his Rise had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from worthy and creditable Causes, he
would in all likelyhood have been as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with them, as with his Arms;
It being both easie and for the Reputation
of the Family; that Records of this nature
should have been preserv'd, and therefore the
loss of them seems rather to proceed from
Design than Neglect. In short, if the first
Principles of Honour happen to be thus coarse,
or counterfeit, it's not in the power of time
to mend them: A Pebble or <hi>Bristol</hi> stone
will not change their natures, and improve
into Diamonds, though they are laid up a
thousand years together.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Hark you Mr. I doubt your Effects
(if you have any) have lain but a little
while in the Heralds Office.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Probably as long as your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships:
But I take it to be much more a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly
quality to discover such unsociable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61346:64"/>
mistakes than to abett them. If we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of understanding any thing, it must
undoubtedly be more creditable to promote
good humour and modesty in Conversation,
and give men right Apprehensions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
than to flatter them into groundless
Conceits, and make them believe they may
be truly Great, and yet good for nothing.
To maintain such indefensible and dangerous
Principles of Honour, which not only impose
upon our Understandings, but emasculate our
Spirits, and spoyl our Temper, and tend
only to the nourishing of Idleness and Pride;
is in my opinion no very Heroical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I find we must come to the
Merits of the Cause as you call them, and
examine upon what foundation the Family
stands.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I think that is the only way to
know what we have to trust to, and how
far we may insist upon the advantages of
Birth.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>What are the usual steps to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I suppose one of these three, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Commerce or Arms. The pretences of
Learning have been examined already; To
which I shall only add, that if a Person whose
mind is enlarged, and beautified with all
sorts of useful Knowledge, is notwithstanding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61346:64"/>
obliged to Modesty, and Sobriety of thought,
then certainly those who claim under him,
and are wise only by Proxy, ought not to
grow too big upon their Relation to the
Muses. To Proceed, Commerce is another
Expedient which often distinguishes a man
from the vulgar. For Trading raises an Estate,
and that procures Honour, so that in this Case
Wealth is the main of the merit, and that
which is chiefly insisted on by those who
inherit it. But here we ought to be very
cautious and meek-spirited, till we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the honestly of our Ancestours, for
<hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Circumvention</hi> make no good
Motto for a Coat. And yet your men of
Trade are too often assisted in their Fortunes
by these Qualities.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I think you are too hard upon them,
and believe they may come into their Estates
by more accountable methods, <hi>viz.</hi> by their
Industry, by Understanding how to make use
of all fair advantages, and by the luck of
a good Acquaintance.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant there is a great deal of
Good Faith, Frankness and Generosity to
be found among Tradesmen, and that such
Professions are necessary to the convenience
and splendor of Life, and being thus useful
ought to be esteemed Honourable. But their
being used to value small gains is apt (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
care) to make them contract a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61346:65"/>
of Spirit, and to stand too much to
the point of Interest.</p>

                     <p>A great part of it consists in the

                     <p>I am willing to think so, however
these <hi>Arcana Officinae,</hi> are counted such Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
that except an Apprentice is fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
how to Adulterate, and Varnish, and
give you the Go-by upon occasion, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
may be charged with Neglect, and sued
for not teaching him his Art, and his Trade.</p>

                     <p>Granting your Inference, yet you
know a Man may understand his Weapon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his Neighbour, and notwithstanding
be of a very peaceable inoffensive Temper.
However, when the Rise of the Family is
owing to such an Original, a Man has a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Reason not to flourish too much upon
the glitter of his Fortune, for fear there should
be too much Alloy in it. For some People
are forced to climb in a very mean and servile
posture. They must Flatter, Deceive, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61346:65"/>
Pinch; use their Neighbours, and themselves
too, very unkindly, before they can gain
their Point. So that if the Ancestour had not
been remarkably Little, his Posterity had
never been reputed Great.</p>

Why should I enquire so anxiously how my
Ancestors came by their Estate? Let their
Merit be as small as you please, the Revenue
will not sink upon this Score. Now, if you
considered the Sovereignty of Mony, how it
commands Honor, and Beauty, and Power,
how much of Ornament, and Defence, and
Pleasure there is in it; you would allow us to
be a little Uppish upon the Matter: for when
a Man has such a Universal Instrument of
Delight, and is Master of that, which is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of every thing else, he ought visibly to
Congratulate his Happiness, and pay himself
a particular Respect.</p>

to make him believe he has Sense, which
will be in a manner as well, for Pleasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
mostly in Fancy.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't envy such a one the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of his Imagination, though I believe
it is much short of the transports of Lunacy:
but withal I think that folly and madness are
no proper Judges to pronounce upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements
of human Nature. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Argument, no person can be Great
by being Owner of those things which wise
Men have always counted it a piece of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to despise. To which I must add, that
it is not the possessing, but the right manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any valuable Advantage which
makes us Considerable. He that does not
employ his Fortune generously, is not to be
respected merely because he has it. Indeed if
a Man gives me part of his Estate, I am
bound to make him an acknowledgment;
but I am not obliged to honor him because he
is pleased to keep it to himself.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well! Since Merchandize is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
liable to exceptions, and antient Wealth
has no right to challenge Worship, and
Homage. Pray what do you think of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
raised by Arms? I hope here you will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61346:66"/>
grant the Materials are all shining, and solid.
And when an Ancestour works out his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by great and hazardous Undertakings,
by contempt of Danger and Death, and all
the instances of an Heroick Gallantry;
is it not highly reasonable his Descendants
should share his Honor, as well as his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance?
Nay, they seem obliged, in justice
to his Memory, to have some stroaks of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Reserve in their Carriage. They
might better be Profuse in their Expences,
than their Familiarities. The wasting his
Estate, and razing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him out of the Heralds
Books, is scarce more injurious to his Name,
than the heedless Condescensions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
For by such ill managed Humility,
they do as it were Prostitute his Quality,
mingle his Ashes with ignoble Dust, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the Monuments and Distinctions of his
Merit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess a Man ought to be civil
to his Generation, but not to that degree as to
plague the Living, only in Ceremony to the
Dead. And I may say farther, that a Noble
Ancestor, does not desire his Posterity should
pretend to honor him this way, except his
Qualities, as well as his Name descend upon
them. A person truly Great, is never fond
and unreasonable; he hates to see Folly Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,
though it be in his own Children;
and had rather have his Memory buried in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61346:67"/>
Oblivion, than his Honor should be Usurped
by a Degenerate insignificant Off-spring. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the reasons you assign why Martial
Men ought to be valued by after-Ages, seem
to be common to other pretences to Nobility.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I am sorry if they appear so, since
I designed them chiefly for the advantage of
Arms. For in my judgment, the Profession
of a Soldier has a particular, and paramount
Title to Honor. For can there be a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
instance of Greatness, than for a
Man to be undismayed amidst so many horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Instruments and Images of Death? To
expose his person as freely as if he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
immortal, and to fear nothing but Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Disgrace? And therefore though
there are many other creditable Employments
and Accomplishments, yet there is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent,
and almost an astonishing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Gracefulness in Valour. It has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more illustrious and sparkling, more
Noble and Majestick than the rest.</p>

                     <p>Hold! You are going to describe
<hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Cesar;</hi> do you think that every

fine things? This must be examined farther by

that though I have a great esteem for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Sword, and don't in the least intend
to lessen the just Character of Military Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet I conceive there is another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61346:67"/>
which possibly does not glitter alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
so much upon the Sense, but for all
that, if you touch it 'twill prove right Sterling.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>That of Learning; therefore if you
please, I will just glance upon the Advantages
of Learning without interposing my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by way of comparison.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

make amends for the freedom you took

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Don't mistake me, I am conscious

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>1. Then not to mention that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is an improvement of our Minds, which
is the noblest part of us. I say not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, you may please to take notice, that
without some share in this accomplishment,
War it self cannot be successfully managed.
Without the assistance of Letters, a Man
can never be qualified for any considerable
Post in the Camp. For Courage and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Force, unless joyned with Conduct,
and reach of Thought (which are the usual
effects of Contemplation) is no more fit to
command than a Tempest; doing for the most
part more harm than good, and destroying
it self by its blind and ill directed motion.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61346:68"/>
It is Learning which teaches a General the
successes and events of Action in former Ages,
which makes him better able to judge of
his present preparation. It instructs him how
to take advantage of his Enemies, and avoid
those miscarriages which have been fatal to
others before him. It teaches him how to
Fortifie and Assault, how to manage the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Ground and Weather. It lets him
into the knowledge of Human Nature, and
shews him how to understand the Tempers of
other men, and to govern his own. It dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
by what secret Springs the Passions are
moved, what are the most probable Causes
of Hope and Fear, of Resolution and Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
and how strangely they are mixed, and
varied according to the difference of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
Governments, Conditions, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations,
especially according to the different
Age, Temper, Interest, and Experience of
those who are in Power.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, no doubt it teaches a Man to
take a Soul in pieces, as easily as a Watch!
If ever I heard such Conjuring!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray be not so sharp, the Discourse
is not so Romantick as you suppose.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Go on.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Secondly, I observe that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Learning are more lasting and
extensive than those of Arms. The Courage
of a Soldier, does his Country not much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61346:68"/>
service after his death, the benefit of it being
usually confined to one Age: whereas by the
knowledge of Men and Things, Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
for Society are framed, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
adjusted to the Temper, and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of the People; of the happy effects of
which, remote Posterity is often sensible.
And as the Consequences of Valour, seldom
reach beyond the death of him who shewed
it, so there are few the better for it, except
those a Man engages for; which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
none but his Countrymen. But
Learning, by inventing and improving Arts
and Sciences, scatters its Favours in a much
larger compass; becomes a universal Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and obliges mankind in its most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Latitude of Place and Time.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope you will grant that Learning
must fly to the Protection of the Sword to
secure its quiet, and all the profits accrewing
from thence. For in earnest, Notions, and
Syllogisms, are very defenceless things against
Violence. If we had nothing but Philosophy,
Statutes and Reports, to secure the Peace;
our <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> were but in an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I agree with you, and shall just add
in the third place, That the successes of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are naturally of a very innocent Tendency,
and under good management prejudicial to
none. The Conquests of Arts are not like
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61346:69"/>
those of Arms, gained by slaughter, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ruin and desolation. No, Here
is nothing routed but Ignorance and Error,
nothing destroyed but obstinate Humour, and
savage Disposition:
<q>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.</q>
But a Martial Man, except he has been
sweetned, and polished by a Lettered Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is apt to have a tincture of sowerness,
and incomplyance in his Behaviour. And
therefore if you observe your old Heroes in
<hi>Homer,</hi> (for want of being Book-Learned)
were none of the Gentilest Men. What a
rugged tempestuous, unconversable Mortal
was <hi>Achilles;</hi> I could never fancy that same
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well! I perceive it is requisite for
a Man to get some Sense to his Courage if
he can: but have we not lost all our Pride,
and gone somewhat off from the Point?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>No, We have only fetched a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and thrown our reasoning more into a
Circle to invest the Place; and now we will
come on directly, and make a little Assault,
only to try the strength of the Garrison.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Very Soldier-like! In plain <hi>English</hi>
I doubt you are attempting to shew that it is
not so much the Profession of Arms, as the
unexceptionable management of that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which makes a Family honourable.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61346:69"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. Therefore before we fall too
much in love with the Buff in the Wardrobe;
we should examin whether the War was just,
whether our Ancestor fought in defence of
his Prince and Country, or let himself out to
any person who would hire him to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We should consider whether the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
was Great and Dangerous; whether
the Advantages were gained by open Bravery
and Resolution, or were no more than the
effects of Chance, of Treachery, or Surprize.
And though a Man can give a creditable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to all these Questions, he should then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
there are a great many persons who
have ventured as far as himself, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their first Obscurity: so that had it
not been his good Fortune to have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notice of his General, his Merit had
been unrewarded. There are many persons
who perform signal service in a Breach, or
Scalado, and yet their Courage is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded,
and lost in the Crowd, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
of the Action, so that they get nothing
but Blows for their Pains. To wind up this
part of the Discourse: let the Rise of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
be never so considerable (I mean none
but Subjects) it ought not to supersede the
Industry, or stop the Progress of those who
are thence Descended. For if we rely wholly
upon the Merit of others, and are Great only
by imputation, we shall be esteemed by none
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61346:70"/>
but the injudicious part of the World. To
speak out, if neither the advantages of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and Education. (which often concur in
these Cases) the expectation of others, nor
the Memory of worthy Ancestors, if none
of these Motives can prevail with a Man to
furnish himself with Supravulgar and Noble
Qualities, this is an argument that he is
either under a natural incapacity, or else
has abandoned himself to Sloth, and Luxury.
And without dispute he is most emphatically
mean, who is so under the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and arguments to the contrary. So
that the Lustre of his Family serves only
to set off his own Degeneracy, it does <hi>Facem
praeferre pudendis</hi> and makes him the more
remarkably Contemptible.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>You are smart upon the empty
Sparks! And I perceive by your discourse
that if we intend to set up strong, we must
do something for our selves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: And therefore I presume that
Women have more reason to insist upon
their Birth than Men: because they have not
so fair a trial to discover their worth. They
are by custom made incapable of those em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
by which Honour is usually gain'd.
They are shut out from the Pulpit and Barr,
from Embassies, and State Negotiations, so
that notwithstanding (as I believe it often
happens) their Inclinations are generous, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61346:70"/>
their Abilities great, to serve the publick;
yet they have not an opportunity of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly I think you need not have
been so liberal to the <hi>Beau-Sex;</hi> you know
they have enough to be proud of besides
Heraldry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>What do you mean?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Their Beauty Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Right, I believe that may disturb
them sometimes; but they have no great
reason for it. For Beauty though it's a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
varnish, yet it's of a frail Constitution,
liable to abundance of Accidents, and but
ashort lived Blessing at the best. And waving
this Consideration, it seems to be made chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the entertainment of the lookers on.
Those who are so much admired by others,
can't share the pleasure of the Company
without the help of a Glass; for the Eyes
which shew us other Objects cannot see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Nature seems to have laid the most
graceful parts of our Fabrick out of our
way; to prevent our vanity. For could
some People always command a sight of
their Faces, they would <hi>Narcissus</hi> like be
perpetually poring upon their Handsomeness,
and so be neither fit for Business, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>To my thinking you have not
cleared the Point; For why may we not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61346:71"/>
insist upon the privileges of Nature? Why
should a fine Woman be so prodigal of her
Beauty, make strip and waste of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and squander away her Face for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
There is no reason persons of a less
agreeable aspect (except they have some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage) should converse with beauty
upon a Level. For those who cannot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out an equal proportion towards the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Conversation, ought to pay for their
insufficiency in Acknowledgments. Beauty
without doubt was design'd for some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and if so, certainly the Owners
have the best right to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant it; and therefore it's allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to set a value upon their Persons,
for the better disposal of them. And farther
if they have a mind to it, they may please
themselves, because they are acceptable to
others, which is a generous satisfaction:
But when they grow humoursom they spoil
all; For Pride not only raises a prejudice
against their Beauty, but really lessens it.
For if you observe, it paints an ill-natured
Air upon their Face; and fills them with
spleen and peevishness and passion, which
exhausts their Spirits, and makes their blood
less florid, so that their Beauty is neither so
agreeable nor lasting as otherwise it would
be. And if the present inconvenience will
not cure them, they will do well to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61346:71"/>
that they must of necessity grow humble
when they are old; unless they are so fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
as to doat upon Rubbish and Ruins.</p>

                     <p>Pray let us take leave of the Ladies,
and proceed to the other branch of your
Division, <hi>viz.</hi> to acquired Nobility. And
here methinks every thing looks unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
and fine upon your own Principles.
For here we are beholden to none but our
selves; we are not thrown up the Hill by
anothers Arms, and made considerable by
Diversion, or Chancemedly; but climb the
ascent by plain Strength, and indefatigable
Activity. Is it not a singular commendation
to have our circumstances not only large
and Honourable, but Independent; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to create the privileges we enjoy? Here
is no gilding of a coarse substance, no bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Glory, no faint Reflection from an
Ancestour, but the Man is all bright and
luminous to the Center, and shines and
sparkles in his own worth. He is not Great
by Genealogy and ancient Title, by the
Favour of Fortune and the Labours of those
he never help'd, but by Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
by having Greatness incorporated
in himself. Now may not a Person who
has thus distinguished himself by his Merit,
make use of the Honour which has been so
justly confer'd upon him, and put the Lazy

                     <p>If you recollect your self you will
find that this point concerning Acquired
Nobility has been occasionally discoursed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Therefore I shall only add that upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
a Man has obliged the Publick, and
is remarkable for great Abilities and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Use of them; he would do well to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that there are others who have ventured
as far, and performed as considerably as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whose Services all miscarried as to any
private Advantage, because they were not so
lucky as to act under the Notice of those who
were able to reward: And that many Persons
well furnish'd for Employment and Honour,
go out of the World as obscurely as they came
in; only for want of a proper opportunity to
bring them into Light, and publick View.</p>

                     <p>What tho some People are unlucky,
ought their misfortunes to be pleaded to the
prejudice of Desert in others?</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>No. But when a man has received
so valuable a consideration for his Service
as Honour and Estate, he ought to acquiesce,
and not press too arbitrarily for Submission.
He should not set a tax upon his Conversation,
and put the Company under Contribution for
Respect. Besides a Gentleman of the first <hi>Head</hi>
has a particular reason to manage his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
obligingly: For by treating the little
People roughly, he does in effect but expose
his Ancestours and reproach his own former
Condition.</p>

                     <p>You have so many fetches with
you! But what do you think of Magistrates?
In my opinion those who represent their
Prince, and are the Ministers of Justice, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
practise that Humility and Condescension
you seem to admire, with any manner of
Decency, or Security to the publick. For if
they don't oblige their Inferiours to Distance,
their Reputation will sink, and the Majesty
of the Government will be lessen'd, and then
it's easie to guess what the consequence must
be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I agree with you: Magistrates
ought to assert their Office, and not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cheap by improper Familiarities. But
their Character may be over-strained. To
prevent which inconvenience they may please
to remember that their power was given
them upon a publick account, more for the
benefit of others than themselves. They are
deputed by their Prince, for the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Virtue, for the ease and Protection of
the People, and therefore they should discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
none who are regular and fair, they
should shew their Authority upon nothing
but Insolence and Injustice, Thieves and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors;
upon those who affront the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or break the Peace. There is no
necessity they should bring the Air of the
Bench into common Conversation, and wear
their Commissions always upon their Faces.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61346:73"/>
To manage their Power thus singularly looks
like a little private Design of setting up for
themselves; as if they procured their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to fright the Kings Liege Subjects,
and to over-awe the Neighbourhood into a
greater Reverence.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>But if they should happen to take
too much upon them, are the People to slight
them upon this account?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>By no means: the Authority ought
to be consider'd let the Men be what they
will. However in general I observe that the
best way to secure Observance, is not to
insist too violently upon it. For Pride is a
most unfortunate Vice, other Immoralities
usually gain their Point, though they lose
more another way; but a Proud man is so
far from making himself Great by his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and contemptuous Port, that he is usually
punished with Neglect for it: and that
Disdain with which he treats others, is
returned more justly upon himself: which
may be done without much difficulty, in
regard Honor is not become a property so
far as to have all it's Appurtenances bounded
and fix'd by Law. The Circumstantials and
oftentimes the most pompous part of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
are arbitrary and undetermined.
For we are not told either by Statute, or
Common Law how many Bows a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
of such a degree may expect from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61346:73"/>
us, not how low we are to make them, nor
how often the terms of Respect are to be used
in our Application.</p>

                     <p>I mean that it is not settled by Act
of Parliament, how many Sirs and Madams,
a Discourse of such a length is to be sprinkled
with; and therefore a cross-grained Fellow,
will tell you he has his Betters upon their Good
Behaviour: if he likes their humour, he will
be as liberal to them in acknowledgments as
they please; if not, he shall take the freedom
to hold his hand, and let them help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
how they can.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Well! I cannot reconcile this self-denying
Humour you are contending for
the Character of a Gentleman. Such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
management of Fortune and Honour
as this is, argues either that a Man wants
Sense to understand his Condition, or Spirit to
maintain it. To throw away the Prerogatives
of our Birth, or the rewards of our Industry,
at such a careless Cynical rate, is a sign of a
Rustick inapprehensive meanness, and that we
have not the least inclination to Greatness in
us. For those who desire to be Great, will
endeavour to excel, and those who excel will
be sure to shew it; for the Essence of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
lies in Comparison. A tall Man loses the
advantage of his Stature, unless he stands
streight, and overlooks his Neighbour.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Methinks you are somewhat out
in your notion of Greatness.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Let us hear if you can hit it better.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>To speak freely, I conceive it a
much more substantial and better natured
thing than you have made it. Greatness cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
does not consist in Pageantry and Show,
in Pomp and Retinue; and though a person of
Quality will make use of these things to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Singularity, and to put the Vulgar in mind
of their obedience to Authority, yet he does
not think himself really the bigger for them:
for he knows that those who have neither
Honesty nor Understanding, have oftentimes
all this fine Furniture about them. Farther,
To be Great, is not to be starched, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
and supercilious, to swagger at our Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and browbeat our Inferiours. Such a
Behaviour looks as if a Man was conscious of
his own insignificancy, and that he had nothing
but Outside, and Noise, and ill Humour, to
make himself Considerable with. But he
that is truly Noble, has far different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and turns his Figure quite another
way. He hates to abridge the Liberties,
to depress the Spirits, or any ways to
impair the satisfaction of his Neighbour. His
Greatness is easie, obliging, and agreeable,
so that none have any just cause to wish it
less. And though he has a general kindness
for all Men, though he despises not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61346:74"/>
Mortal, but desires to stand fair in the
Opinion of the World, yet he never courts
any Man's Favour at the Expence of Justice,
nor strikes in with a Popular Mistake. No,
He is sensible it is the part of true Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to adhere unalterably to a wise Choice:
not to be over-run by Noise and Numbers,
but to appear in defence of injured Right, of
neglected Truth, notwithstanding all the
Censure and Disadvantage they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lie under. To conclude his Character,
A Great Man is affable in his Converse, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in his Temper, and immoveable in what
he has maturely resolved upon. And as
Prosperity does not make him haughty and
imperious, so neither does Adversity sink
him into meanness and dejection: for if ever
he shews more spirit than ordinary, it is when
he is ill used, and the World frowns upon
him. In short, he is equally removed from
the extremes of Servility and Pride; and
scorns either to trample upon a Worm, or
sneak to an Emperor.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>In earnest, you have described a
Person of Honor: And I am so far pleased
with the Character, that I would give all I
am Master of to make it my own. But can
we receive no other Advantages from Nobility,
but what have been hinted already?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>All that I can think of at present,
are these following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61346:75"/>First, It gives a fair occasion to excite the
generosity of our Minds, and disposes us to
the imitation of great Examples, that so we
may not seem unworthy our Predecessours.
Indeed, a Man is bound in justice not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Reputation, nor spoil the Breed of
the Family: but to hand down the Line to his
Posterity, at least with the same good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he received it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, These Privileges of Birth may
serve to check an insolent Humour in others,
who behave themselves contemptuously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us upon lesser, or but equal pretences.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A Man may make some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
this way, when he falls undeservedly
under Publick Disgrace, or is unrighteously
Oppressed. For in such a Case, the mention
of his Ancestours seems free from all suspicion
of Vanity, and may fairly be interpreted to
proceed either from self-Defence, or greatness
of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The same may be done when
any Office or Promotion, may Legally be
claimed by vertue of an honourable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For example, If a Man should put in
to be one of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> he might
modestly enough publish his Pedigree, and
prove his six Descents, against a less qualified
Competitor.</p>

                     <p>If you are at a sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> For,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61346:75"/>
as I remember, it has been granted already,
that the common People may pay a Respect
to Quality, though you mortifie the Pleasure
a little severely in those who receive it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>May pay a Respect, call you it? I
say they must. For not to mention that
Gentlemen have generally a greater share of
Fortune and Sense too, than those of vulgar
Condition; not to mention this I say, if they
had nothing to plead but their Quality, they
ought to be regarded upon that Score, because
the State sets a value upon it, and that for
publick and considerable Reasons.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive if a Man will but stay
and hear you out, you are civil enough at the
last. Pray what are we to do next?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, now I could run a Discourse
with you upon the inconveniences of Pride:
and snew you in particular, what an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
Aversion it gives all Mankind against
us, when we are overgrown with it. How it
multiplies, and conceals our Defects from us,
and makes us do a thousand silly things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking notice of them. How it makes
us a Prey to Flatterers, and puts us to great
Expences only to be laughed at. I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with you, how it spoils Conversation,
and takes away the pleasure of Society. How
often Families, Kingdoms, and Churches are
embroiled, and the World turned topsiturvy
by this Vice. These and many other ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61346:76"/>
of Pride might be enlarged upon;
but this part of the Argument is, I conceive,
more proper for Divines, and therefore I shall
pursue it no farther.</p>

afraid your time had been preingaged to
those Gentlemen and Ladies you parted

not to stay long. By their Habit and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
they seem to be Persons of Condition,

must be well remembred?</p>

                     <p>I'm sorry you should be in love
with a Delusion, especially when you know

                     <p>Happiness is Happiness; whether
'tis founded in Reason or Imagination, 'tis
all a Case to me, provided I have a vigorous
Sence of it. Nay, in my Judgment, those
which you call the Satisfactions of <hi>Fancy,</hi>
are the better of the two. They are more
at Command than the other; and stand in
no need of a Foreign Supply. The want
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61346:79"/>
of <hi>Tools</hi> and <hi>Materials,</hi> if the Model is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
is a Commendation to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
To make so fine a <hi>Something</hi> out of
<hi>Nothing,</hi> has some resemblance to Creation:
So that if this way has as much Pleasure in
the Effect, it seems to have more of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
in the Cause.</p>

will quickly disappear. The agreeable part
of the <hi>Fit</hi> won't last; therefore let us get
rid of it as soon as may be. The longer it
continues, the worse and the weaker 'twill

And endeavour to prove in the</p>
                     <p>First place, That Richness of Habit is not
only Lawful but Convenient, for those
who are possessed of publick Charges; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they execute their Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For the People generally take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
more from the Appearance than the
Reason of Things. Their Apprehensions are
so disposed, that they think nothing Great
but what is Pompous, and Glitters upon
the Senses. If their Governours had not
some Advantage of them in Figure; they
would be apt to overlook their Character,
and forget their Distance.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61346:80"/>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no Intention to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Gold Chains, Velvet Caps,</hi> or <hi>Sables,</hi>
or any Thing of this Nature; but granting
this Furniture may be somewhat of a Guard
to Authority, yet no publick Person has any
Reason to value himself upon it. For the
Design of this Sort of State is only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Weakness of the Multitude.
'Tis an innocent Stratagem to deceive them
into their Duty, and to awe them into a
just Sense of Obedience. A great Man will
rather contemn this kind of Finery, than
think himself considerable by it. He will
rather be sorry that his Authority needs the
Support of so little an Artifice, and depends
in any measure upon the use of such Trifles.
To stoop to the vulgar Notion of Things,
and establish ones Reputation by counterfeit
Signs of Worth, must be an uneasy Task to
a noble Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides, we are not to think
the Magistrate cannot support his Office
without Fine Cloaths. For if he is furnish'd
with general Prudence, with Abilities par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to his Business, and has a competent
share of Power, he needs not doubt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
over the People.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray what do you think of private
Quality? I hope you don't intend to strike
us out of all Distinction, to run all Metals
together, and make a Sort of <hi>Corinthian Brass</hi>
of us.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>By no means. However, your
Argument must abate farther upon this
Head. For Quality, separated from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is sufficiently maintained by <hi>Title,
Arms,</hi> and <hi>Precedency:</hi> This is enough to
keep up <hi>Distinction,</hi> and to encourage Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Merit. There is no necessity for
Persons, without Jurisdiction, to march al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with <hi>Colours displayed.</hi> It seems more
agreeable that they should conceal, than
make a needless Ostentation of their Wealth.
Would it not look odly in a Souldier to give
in a <hi>History</hi> of his Valour and Conduct in
Conversation? Or for a Man of Learning
to make Harangues upon his own Parts and
Performances, and tell the Company how
ignorant they are in respect of him?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>That would be a little Fulsom I
confess; But is the Case the same?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Much at one, in private Persons.
For them to appear Pompous in Equipage,
or Habit, is but a vain-glorious Publishing
their own Grandeur, a silent Triumphing
over the Inferiority of others, and is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to proclaim themselves extraordinary
People. Whereas a modest Man, if he was
somewhat taller than his Neighbours, would
chuse to shrink himself into the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Company, and be contented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to loose something of his own Stature,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61346:81"/>
than to upbraid them with the Littleness of
theirs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>What, because a Lord of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
has not always a <hi>Commission,</hi> must he
be allowed no better Cloaths than a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. There may be some Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and yet it needs not be very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive.
A Gentleman's Mien and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is sufficient to discover him, without
any great dependance upon <hi>Shops</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</hi>
After all, the best way of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is by the Qualities of the Mind. Let
Persons of Condition strive rather to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
in their Disposition than the Vulgar:
Let them put on a better Humour, wear
a finer Understanding, and shew a more shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Fortitude: Let them appear remarkably
Just, Inoffensive, and Obliging. This is the
way to be nobly Popular, and gives them
the Hearts, as well as the Ceremony, of
their Inferiors.</p>

                     <p>However, they seem willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to try their Skill; and I believe the
Experiment succeeds sometimes. But to
your Question: Was the Surplusage of
Wealth employed in charitable Uses, and
Entertainments soberly Hospitable, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61346:82"/>
it would run in a more proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
Did Men lay out their Abilities in the
Service of Religion, and for the promoting
of Arts and Knowledge, how might they
advance the Prosperity and Glory of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this way? How much Wiser, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,
and Richer, might they make their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours?
And as they would be more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to their Country, so they would serve
the Designs of Greatness much more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.
Such a generous Use of Fortune,
would give Lustre to their Reputation; and
make the World look with Wonder and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
upon them. How would it raise a
declining Interest to its former Height, and
with what Advantage convey their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to Posterity? But to return; Richness
of Habit is not only unnecessary to keep up
the Distinction of Degrees, but insufficient.
For where there are no <hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> to
confine the Condition of Persons, and ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Heraldry</hi> of the <hi>Wardrobe,</hi> every
one has the Liberty of being as Expensive,
and Modish as he pleases. And accordingly
you may observe that ordinary People, when
they happen to abound in Money and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
have their Houses and Persons as rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Furnished, as those who are much their
Superiours. There are other Instances in
which methinks these things are a little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</p>

                     <p>When you have said all, A good
Suit does a Man Credit, and puts People in
mind of paying him a proper Respect. And
since others esteem me upon this Account, I
ought to follow their Opinion. For why
should I think my self wiser than the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority</hi>

                     <p>You are wonderfully resigned in
your Understanding; I guess the Occasion,
and shall endeavour to disappoint your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
For notwithstanding your <hi>Majority,</hi>
I conceive the Reasons of things are rather
to be taken by <hi>Weight</hi> than <hi>Tale:</hi> And if
so, fine Cloaths will signify nothing in the
Value of a Man, because they are but Signs
of <hi>Wealth</hi> at the best, which generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is no more an Argument of Worth, than
of the contrary. And as Cloaths don't sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Man considerable, so neither can they
make him so. This will appear if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61346:83"/>
either the Materials of which they
consist, or the Art and Curiosity which is
shewn in the Fashioning of them. The
<hi>Matter</hi> of which a rich Habit consists, is
either the Skins of Beasts, the Entrails of
Worms, the Spoils of Fishes, some shining
Sand or Pebles, which owe their humble
Original to the Dirt. And is it not a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Vanity to value our selves upon what
we borrow from Creatures below <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Life?</hi> In short, either they are a real
Advantage, or not: If they are, they prove
our Dependance upon inferiour Things;
which ought to be a mortifying Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
unless we can be proud of Beggary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If they are not, then to dote on them is a
Sign we are sunk beneath our proper Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
that we admire Trifles, and disgrace
the Dignity of our Nature. To see these
insignificant Ornaments valued at so great
a Rate, and preferred to the Necessaries of
Life, is no small Disparagement to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of Men, and is an Argument
of the Littleness and Degeneracy of our Kind.
One would think he that has the Liberty
of looking upon the Sun and Moon for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
would never purchase the Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a Peble at so high a Price.</p>

to make them <hi>Cheap.</hi>

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes farther, That
Diamonds and Rubies were little esteemed
by the Eastern Nations, where they were
the Growth of the Country. So that I
suppose when the <hi>Parthian</hi> Children, and
<hi>Milk-maids,</hi> had worn them till they were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61346:84"/>
weary, they were bought up for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Ladies.</p>
                     <p>Now to be fond of any thing purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is uncommon, because the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Mankind wants it, is an ill-natured
Pleasure, and arises from an unbenevolent
and ungenerous Temper.</p>

                     <p>Pray what do you think of the
Artificial Improvement, is not a rich Dress
an Addition to the <hi>Wearer</hi> upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Not at all. 'Tis true, the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon what was more imperfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by Nature, the graceful Disposition of
the Parts, and the judicious Mixture of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
are Arguments of Industry and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity;
but then this Commendation does
not belong to those that buy them. If the
meer <hi>Wearing</hi> them is any ways Creditable,
it is because the Taylors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
of <hi>Honour.</hi>

                     <p>I grant you those People make
them, but the <hi>Suiting</hi> them is above their
Talent. None but Persons of Condition can
hit this Point. Indeed they have a great
Delicacy and Exactness in their Fancy: They
pitch upon nothing that is Tawdry and
Mechanick, Staring, or ill Matched. One
may know a Gentlewoman almost, as well
by seeing her chuse a Mantua, or a Ribon,
as by going to <hi>Garter,</hi> or <hi>Clarencieux.</hi>

                     <p>The mixing of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Shade,</hi>
handsomely, looks like a Genius for <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi>
And that is the most you can make
of your Observation. To go on with you:
I shall venture to add, That for private
Persons to expect an unusual Observance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of <hi>fine Cloaths,</hi> argues them
conscious of their own little Worth, and
that the greatest part of their Quality comes
out of the <hi>Dressing Room.</hi> Having nothing
to prefer them to the Esteem of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
they are contented to take up with
the Ceremony of the Ignorant: And with
a little Glitter, and Pageantry, draw the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
unthinking <hi>Mobile</hi> to admire them.
Now to desire Respect where we have no
Jurisdiction, purely upon our own Account,
is an Argument either of a weak Judgment,
or weak Pretences. If we understood the
true Grounds of Esteem; If we were well
stock'd with Abilities, or good Actions, to
entertain us at home; we should not make
our selves so mean, as to let our Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
depend upon the Reverences of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
or Designing. Besides, to delight
in the Submissions of others, is a certain
Sign of Pride. This supposes that we are
not so much pleas'd with our own Station,
as with looking down, and seeing our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as we fancy in a worse Condition than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61346:85"/>
our selves. Whereas a generous Mind has
its Happiness encreased by being Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I was going to tell you, that Rich
Cloaths are accounted unsuitable to old Age,
which is a farther Proof of their Insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy.
That Age which is most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Wisdom and Temper; which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
honoured with the Weight of Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Dignity of Office; and has deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
the greatest Regard paid it: That Age,
I say, chuses to appear in a plain, unorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Guarb. Whereas were fine Cloaths
marks of true Honour; were they Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
great enough for a Man's Reason to
delight in, the wisest part of the World
would not go without them: Especially
since the Decays of Nature give so fair a
Plea for the Assistances of Art. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a greater Disparagement to this sort
of Finery, than its being refused by that
Age which seems to need it most; and if it
was Considerable best deserves it. Since
Men at the Height of Discretion are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of these Additions; this is a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Proof that they are Childish and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling,
and fittest for those who carry more
<hi>Body</hi> than <hi>Soul</hi> about them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61346:85"/>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Your Inference is, That there
should be a Resemblance between Age and
Habit; and that a Finical old Spark, can
never be in the Fashion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Right. For old People to set up
for Mode and Dressing is a nauseous Piece of
Vanity. Indeed, when we come into the
World first, 'tis not so remarkable an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
if we misplace our Esteem, and
make an indiscreet Choise. 'Tis no wonder
if we stick upon a gaudy Outside, when we
are not sharp enough to look through it.
When our Minds are unfurnished with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for Thinking, and scarce strong enough
to wield a rational Pleasure, they are apt to
divert themselves with the Amusements of
Sense. But when we have run through the
Experience of many years, and had so many
Opportunities of Improvement: When our
Reason is grown up to Maturity, and we
are supposed to have made our last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Things: When every thing we
say or do, should have an Air of Gravity and
Greatness in it; then to dote upon Trifles,
is a shrewd Sign that our Minds are no less
decay'd than our Bodies. It looks as if we
were ashamed of making any Pretences to
Wisdom, and betrays an impotent desire of
returning to the Extravagance of Youth.</p>

They have the Excuses of Custom, the Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Figure, and the Inclinations of Sex,
to plead in their behalf. Besides, I am told
St. <hi>Augustine (Ep. 245. Tom. 2.)</hi> abates very
much of the Rigour of your <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and
speaks with great Moderation upon the
Point. <q>He thinks Fine Cloaths ought not
to be forbidden married Women, who are
obliged to please their Husbands.</q> And
if they may use this Expedient to <hi>please</hi>
them when they have them; why may they
not do it that they may <hi>please</hi> to have them?
Why may not the same little Charm be
practised to Begin, as well as to Entertain
the <hi>Relation?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>With all my Heart; let St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>'s
Indulgence pass. But 'tis my humble
Opinion they should keep their Inclinations
unengaged. They would do well not to
dress their Fancy, nor wear their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery
in their Head, nor think their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
Quality better than their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For when a Woman is once smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with her <hi>Drapery,</hi> Religion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
laid aside; or used moreout of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
than Devotion. When her gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Passions lye this way, Charity is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
and Good-nature fails, and Justice
is overlook'd, and she is lost to all the
noble Purposes of Life. How often are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61346:86"/>
neglected, Tradesmen unpaid, and
Servants stinted to mortifying Allowances
for the Support of this Vanity? How pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and ununiform does it make the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of some Families? And what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable
Mixture of Poverty and Riches do
we see sometimes within the same Walls?
These Excesses make them forget the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of their Sex, and the Duties of their
Station. They Rob the Necessities, and
Fourish in the Penance, and Wear that which
should have been the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of
their own <hi>Retinue.</hi>

                     <p>Truly I think the Taylor should
<hi>take Measure</hi> of their <hi>Quality,</hi> as well as of
their Limbs. For those who make their
<hi>Cloaths</hi> much better than their Condition,
do but expose their Discretion. Persons of
Quality have some little Colour for their
Vanity: But as for others, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say for themselves. In them it
looks like a Levelling Principle; like an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Aspiring into a forbidden Station. It
looks as if they had a mind to destroy the
Order of Government, and to confound the
Distinctions of Merit and Degree. In a

                     <p>I perceive you think Ignorance
and Idleness necessary Qualifications of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61346:89"/>
Gentleman; and doubt not but that you
practise accordingly. But if Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
are too great to be govern'd by the
Laws, they should be so modest as not to
plead it for their Advantage. They should
throw up their Fortune, and disband from
Society. Yes, and their Quality too; for
this, as well as the other, is settled by the
<hi>Constitution.</hi>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought <hi>Quality</hi> had been the
sole Privilege of Birth, or at least of the
Prince's Favour.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>All Honour, as well as Land, is
originally a Gift from the Crown. Now
<hi>Prerogative</hi> is a part of the Law: And
though Quality and Estate are settled upon
a Man and his Heirs, yet the Grant runs
always with a Condition of Forfeiture in
Case of Treason. And therefore the Son
of an unrestored Traytor has no Pretences
to the Quality of his Ancestors.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I know we say that Treason taints
a Man's Bloud, and makes it baser than that
of a Peasant; but I look upon this as a kind
of Whimsey. For though the Government
may take away my Estate, yet it cannot
make me nothing of Kin to my Father. So
that the Son of a Gentleman must be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
in spight of Fate.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>But not in spight of Treason. For
in that Case, he is banished the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61346:90"/>
transplanted from the Family of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
His Lease of Heraldry is expired, his
Title is extinct, and he can no more claim
his former Honour, than an Estate which
was sold by his great Grand-father. I grant
you the Relation between him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
continues, and that's it which destroys
his Pretentions. The Stream of Honour is
dryed up, before it reaches the Chanel of
Posterity. The Father has lost all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can convey nothing <hi>over.</hi> The Son if
he pleases may be of kin to the Treason,
for the Infamy of that remains; but as for
the Quality 'tis all wiped out, as if it had
never been. And therefore though your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is true, your Inference fails; for
the Son of a Traytor, is not the Son of a
Gentleman. In short, you must either allow
that Quality, like other Branches of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
stands upon the Basis of Law; or
else you unavoidably run into the Principle
of Levelling. For where the Distinctions
of Condition are not ascertained by publick
Provision, every one is at Liberty to rate
his own, and his Neighbour's Station, as he
pleases. Where there are no Inclosures all
People may intercommon, without Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or Ceremony. New Grounds of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
may be set up, and the old ones dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed;
and a Taylor may make himself a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61346:90"/>
Lord, and clap a Coronet upon his <hi>Goose,</hi> if
he has a mind to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I suppose your Conclusion is, That
the Notion of Honour is to be taken from
the Laws and Government, and not from
any private Set of People, how valuable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in other Respects.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Right. And from thence I infer
that Duelling is a very dishonourable Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
For when you have given the best
proof of your sufficiency, and <hi>killed your Man,</hi>
you are seized into the Hands of <hi>Iustice,</hi>
treated like Assassinators, and condemned to
die with Circumstances of Ignominy. You
are not <hi>Indicted</hi> for acquitting your selves
like Gentlemen, but for disturbing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, and murthering the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Now the Law never loads a Man
with Reproaches, nor punishes him thus
coarsely, for doing a handsom Action.</p>

Cant; <hi>Murdravit, stragem excercuit, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticavit:</hi>
Very pretty Stuff to dispatch a Man
of Honour with! You see how the Men
betray their Ignorance by their Forms of
Speaking. And as for the Bench, they have
a thousand Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> for making of
Malefactors; and they must say something
in Defence of their Trade.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Bench,</hi> the <hi>Bar,</hi> and
the rest, they are not the <hi>Makers</hi> but the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61346:91"/>
                        <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Law;</hi> they are the Servants of
the Government, and their Methods of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
are chalked out by their Superiours.
And when the Reason of Things is good,
'tis not material though the <hi>Latin</hi> proves
otherwise. Indeed I think the Laws can't
use you too rigorously, for I'm sure you
treat them with great Contempt. When
Highway-men kill 'tis commonly for a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
to prevent Discovery, or in the heat
and surprize of Passion; and when 'tis over,
they seldom justify the Fact, but condemn
what they have done. But your Tribe are
Murtherers by <hi>Principle,</hi> which is something
worse than <hi>Malice prepence,</hi> because 'tis
ready upon all Occasions, and often acts
without any Provocation; except the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of complying with a barbarous Custom.
As if it was as indifferent a thing to cut a
Man's Throat, or let it alone, as to wear a
Broad or Narrow brim'd Hat: And that
these little Concerns of <hi>Bloud,</hi> ought to be
perfectly governed by the <hi>Fashion.</hi> And
when the Barbarity is committed, you have
the Assurance to maintain it, and to argue
for the Murther against Law and Gospel.
In short, I think you stand in the greatest
defiance to Authority of all Men Living.</p>

                     <p>If the Government will not make

                     <p>You would do well to prefer a

the Crown, and the two Houses at

Do you not perceive, That by thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Business out of the Hands of the
Government, you both reproach, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
renounce it at your Pleasure. The Laws
very well suppose, that People are apt to be
too partial and passionate in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and therefore remit them to a publick
Decision. Now 'tis a kind of Maxim with
us, That <hi>no Man should be wiser than the

so mortal an Affront till <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
happen'd to say, He was no Gentleman that

looks like Spleen, and Monkery, and

scarce meet a Man of Quality without a pair
of <hi>Compasses</hi> about him; and Visits were

as soon as the King grew weary, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
was quite laid aside. And then as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>

                     <p>However it prevailed so far, that

                     <p>Your saying that these Indignities won't

And will you venture your <hi>All</hi> upon a

There are many other grave Persons of

                     <p>I hope not. 'Tis true, I know
some People are all Quality: You would

Title and Genealogy. If you happen to
encounter a Prejudice, or cross upon their
Fancy, they are too Considerable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you. These, I confess, I almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of, but hope their Number is not great.
By the way, let me tell you your Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61346:94"/>
take a very great Liberty in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;

And count that a noble Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the Laws punish as a Capital
Offence. Now to set up a Notion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Consequence. 'Tis such an Affront to

                     <p>You may set up a Science against
the Government, and range Murthering
under Discipline and Rule, and call it by
what fine Names you please: But your
Methods of Killing, and that of Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
are alike <hi>Fair</hi> in the Eye of Justice;
and the same Rewards are assigned to both.
As for your Friends at Court, 'Tis to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that Princes in time will resent the
Breach of their Laws, and the Loss of their
Subjects, a little more heartily: That they
will not encourage a Practice which insults
their Authority, and ridicules their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and keeps up a Spirit of Barbarity
throughout the Nation. Besides, there are
Things they call <hi>Appeals,</hi> and in that Case
you know your <hi>Pardon</hi> is out of Doors.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>We must take our Chance for

                     <p>
                        <hi>You are hardy Men some of you.
If all the Subjects should take the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
we should have wild Work. You
say the Government is defective in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Respects of Honour, and therefore
are resolved to be your own Carvers. What
if the under Sort of People should take the
Hint, and practice upon it, in the Instance
of Property?</hi> Look ye Neighbours <hi>(says a
sharp Country Fellow)</hi> the Fine Folks have
gotten away all the Land from us; for my part
I want so many score Acres to live easily, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61346:95"/>
I suppose you do so too, and I think our Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
deserves it. 'Tis true, Estates are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>settled,</hi> and I should believe my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to observe my Countries Customs, if others
would do the same: But I perceive the Gentry
can set the <hi>Constitution</hi> aside, without any
Scruple. They can Tilt through one anothers
Lungs in a Bravado, though the Law makes
Hanging matter on't. Why should we be more
Slaves to the Goverment than others, I'm sure
we do not get so much by it? We are enough
of us, let us mind our Business. <hi>'Tis true,
this would be a lewd Project; but 'tis the
Consequence of your own Principle, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have a care of setting the Example.</hi>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>If we take a greater Freedom
with the Government than the Vulgar, our
Quality is our Excuse; that will bear us
out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Quite contrary. For first, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is supposed to be better acquainted
with the Laws than a Peasant; therefore
his Breaking them must be a greater Fault,
because it implies more of Contempt in the
Action.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Where the Example is of worse
Consequence, the care to check it should be
the greater. The Influence of Men of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
is Considerable. When They are at the
Head of an ill Custom, they have presently
a Train to attend them. The Infection
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61346:95"/>
spreads like Lightning; and 'tis a Credit
to live counter to Reason and Regularity.
The slender Principles, the loose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
of these Men, is that which has so effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Debauched the Age. This is it which
has exposed Virtue, and banished Religion,
and almost buried the Distinctions of Good
and Evil.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Since Quality is a Distinction
settled by Law; those who have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Share of this Privilege are most obliged
to observe the publick Regulations. The
Government is a great Benefactor to such
Persons, and they are very ungenerous and
ungrateful, if they fly in the Face of it. A
Man that enjoys Honour and Estate by a
Society, has greater Engagements to Regard
it, than he who receives only a common
Protection. One has perhaps a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> per
<hi>Annum</hi> for keeping the Laws and the other
nothing but his Labour for his Pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
pray which is most to blame then if they
break them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>You seem to forget that their
Fortune and Condition follows their Birth,
so that they are only obliged to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
for the Advantage.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>You argue too fast. Pray are
not <hi>Descents</hi> and Inheritances governed by
Law? What Claim can we make to Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
or Property without it? A Man when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61346:96"/>
he is about it, may as easily be born to
10000 <hi>l.</hi> a year as to 10 Pence. The Trouble
to himself, or his Mother, is much the same
as to that matter. People come into the
World in <hi>Turky</hi> the same way they do Here;
and yet, excepting the Royal Family, they
get but little by it. Nature has set us all
upon a Level as to these Things: 'Tis only
the <hi>Constitution</hi> which makes the Difference;
and therefore those who have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
should pay it a proportionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive you are coming on
again: And to stop you a little, let me tell
you, 'tis my Observation, That the Custom
of Duels puts Gentlemen upon their good
Behaviour, 'tis a check upon Conversation,
and makes it more inoffensive than it would
be otherwise.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>An admirable Remedy! Just such
a one as Death is against all Diseases. If
there must be Disputes, is not Squabling less
inconvenient than Murther? Had not a Man
better have a black Eye, than a Napkin
drawn through him; and Bleed rather at
the Nose than at the Heart? These Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,
though much better let alone, make
neither Orphans, nor Widows, nor perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
Feuds among Families. Besides, the
Disorders of Conversation may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without such a dangerous Expedient.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61346:96"/>
For not to mention Religion, a moderate
share of Prudence and Behaviour will do the
Business. 'Tis not yet the Fashion for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Quality to Tilt. Now though they
can hate one another pretty heartily; though
their Humours are full as nice, and their
Passions as strong, as those of the other Sex;
yet the Sense of Decency is sufficient to keep
them from coarse Language, and rude Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>However, Misunderstandings will
happen sometimes. And when they do, it
does not become Gentlemen to manage them
like lesser People. Their Revenges must be
particular, as well as the rest of their Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It looks as odly for them to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
as to Salute like a Clown.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>So that I perceive if Butchers had
but the Manners to go to <hi>Sharps,</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would be contented with a Rubber at
Cuffs. If they must be singular in their
Disputes, let it be for the better I beseech
you. Let us not be so vain as to think it
a Commendation to be more unreasonable
in our Demands, and more savage in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
than the Meanest, and most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplined.
If they must run counter to the
Vulgar in every thing, I wonder they don't
leave off Swearing, Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These, by
their Assistance, are grown <hi>Plebeian</hi> Vices:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61346:97"/>
Insomuch that Porters and Foot-men are as
perfect in them as themselves.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant you Clowns may Box it
off, and be quiet; this way of Satisfaction
is agreable enough to their little Pretensions.
But the Honour of a Gentleman must have
other sort of Damages.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>If the Dispute was between Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and Gentleman, you would say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though not enough. But you know
a Gentleman is not obliged to Fight ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who is not so. Now where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Disobliged is equal, at least to
the Degree of Gentlemen; why should the
Affront be counted so mortal an Injury?
I know no reason for this, unless you will
say, That Men of Quality are obliged to be
more Bloudy and Implacable; and to carry
their Passions to greater heights of Fury, than
other People. But this Plea proves them
really less, not greater than the common
Size of Mankind; and is far wide of the
true Character of Honour. If Quality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in such Sallies as these are; Tigers
and Fiends may put in for a considerable
Share.</p>

                     <p>If this way of deciding Quarrels
among Gentlemen were peculiar to our Age

more Force; but we have almost a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prescription of Time and Place against

for the Heathen Religion, or the <hi>Alcoran;</hi>
and yet I hope you will not plead in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of either of these. To give you an
Instance near home. The <hi>French</hi> you know
are far from being an inconsiderable Nation.
Their Nobility are as numerous, and their
Pretensions as well supported; they have
as much Fire in their Tempers, and as much
Regard for their Honour, as any of their
Neighbours: Notwithstanding this, you see
the Practice of Duelling is absolutely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and they are all contented to refer
their Grievances to the Government.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> King takes more care

                     <p>Particular satisfaction for every
Affront in Conversation cannot be awarded
by <hi>Stated Laws;</hi> the Circumstances are too
many to be brought within a Rule. A
Prince must be little less than absolute to
do this effectually. Now such a stretch of
Prerogative would be agreeable neither to
the <hi>English</hi> Genius, nor <hi>Constitution.</hi> And is
it not a hard Case that we must either deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up all our Property to the Crown; or
our Lives to every ungovernable Passion and

                     <p>You may remember that the

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61346:98"/>
other Tenure then the Laws. What a
monstrous Injustice; what an Ingratitude;
what an insufferable Pride must it then be,
for private Men to erect a Magistracy of
their own; to <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>Execute</hi> in Matters
of Life and Death; and to <hi>Hang</hi> and <hi>Draw</hi>
within themselves? If the Subjects may
set the Laws aside with so little Ceremony,
and make Supplemental Provisions at Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the significancy of Government will
be unintelligible. If Authority may be sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

not in a hundred? And when the <hi>Fences</hi> are

                     <p>Your mentioning the <hi>French,</hi> puts
me in mind of the old <hi>Romans;</hi> they were
a very brave People: Pray what was their
Practise in the Case, for I have almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Not at all for your purpose. 'Tis
true, There was a sort of Duelling among
them, as that of the <hi>Horatii,</hi> and <hi>Curiatii;</hi>
of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> and the <hi>Gaul</hi> that
Challenged the Army. But then there was
a difference in the Persons and Occasion.
These Duellists were Enemies, Subjects of
different Princes, a sort of Fighting <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,</hi>
chosen like <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> to
decide the Controversy of the Field. At
least the Contest was allowed by Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61346:98"/>
and undertaken upon the score of
their Country. But as for one Subjects cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
anothers Throat about private Disputes,
they were perfect Strangers to these Methods
of Justice. When <hi>Milo</hi> killed <hi>Clodius</hi> upon
the Road, though there was no such thing
as a Challenge; though <hi>Tully</hi> proves it no
more then a <hi>Rencounter;</hi> yet because there
was a former misunderstanding between
them; neither the Rhetorick of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
nor the bravery of the <hi>Prisoner,</hi> could
prevent the <hi>Execution.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>After all; you cannot deny but
that the present Custom has prevailed for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>So have a great many other ill
things besides. There is scarcely any Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
so singular as to want a Precedent.
But Custom without Reason, is no better
then antient Error. And since you press
your Prescription, I shall trace it to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
Now the Practise of Subjects Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves by the Sword, was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the <hi>Lombards, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi>
A People, who possibly at that time of day,
had not Brains to decide the matter any
other way. For how much soever they may
be of kin to us, we must own they were a
very unpolished sort of Mortals. And why
should we be tied up to the Dictates of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
and Ignorance? If a Man's House, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61346:99"/>
Habit, and Eating, was not better than theirs;
he would not be thought to have much of
the Spirit of a Gentleman. If we are bound
to implicit Submission; if we are to follow
Antiquity, without any Exceptions of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Why don't we feed upon <hi>Mast,</hi> and
lodge in Caves, and go almost Naked? And
to come nearer our Northern Ancestors;
Why don't we vindicate our selves by Tryal
<hi>Ordeal?</hi> Bath our Innocence in <hi>Scalding
Water,</hi> and hop over <hi>heated Plough-shares</hi>
Blindfold?</p>
                     <p>Farther, We may observe that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
of this Custom was somewhat restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and bound up, to certain Forms of Law.
The Occasion was generally Considerable:
Either for wiping off Imputations of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or prosecuting Appeals of Murther, or
trying Titles of Land. As for the Disputes
of <hi>Sharpers,</hi> of Bottles, Dice, and Wenches,
we don't read of any Provisions made for
the Honour of such Sparks, and Diversions
as these. We may observe,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Men were just come
off from Heathenism, and very undisciplined
in Life. Their Reason was in the <hi>Oar,</hi> and
their Understandings as low as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
This Condition of things made their
Princes either mislead or indulge them.
They had Authority to misguide their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to encourage their Revenge, and in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61346:99"/>
some measure to excuse it. The <hi>Writ of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat</hi>
was made out in the King's Courts, and
the whole manage of the Quarrel under the
Direction of the Government. 'Twas none
of their way to be kill'd in Hugger-mugger,
and steal a Stabbing as they do now. <hi>(Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
posthum.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If they fought without publick
Allowance, and any Person fell in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
the Survivers were apprehended and
tryed for <hi>Murther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, These <hi>Combats,</hi> though gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by these Restrictions, and under the
Countenance of Law, were always condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you think then, they are not
capable of Regulation?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>No more than Adultery. This
Practise is <hi>Malum in se;</hi> and an ill thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done within a Rule. 'Tis like a strong
Poyson, it must be Expelled; for all the
Cooking in Nature will ne're make Diet on't.
'Tis true, there are degrees in Deformity,
as well as Beauty; and therefore some Cases
may be more remarkable then others. For
the purpose; when a Gentleman of Estate
Fights an indigent Bully, who possibly
knows no more how to live in this World,
then he does in the next. This Man is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
to see his Neighbour in easy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
And when it comes once to this;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61346:100"/>
the strength of his Malice and the Opinion
of his Skill, will pick a Quarrel from a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Occasion. Now should I desire him to
get an answerable Fortune before the <hi>Glove</hi>
comes: To make the hazards of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
equal, their Pockets as well their as Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
should be in some measure adjusted.
To throw down a few Farthings, and make
a Noise to have them covered with Gold;
would be absurd in a <hi>Wager;</hi> And a Man
must be very weak to accept it. And if Life
be either valuable to keep, or dangerous to
loose, one would think the Paralel should
hold. This venturing All against Nothing,
puts me in mind of <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had lost the Battle at <hi>Actium,</hi> and
was Penned up in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> would needs
send <hi>Augustus</hi> a Challenge. <hi>Caesars</hi> Answer
was, <hi>That if he was weary of Living, there was
other ways of Dispatch besides Fighting him;
And for his part he should not trouble himself
to be his Executioner. Antony,</hi> I suppose,
thought the return reasonable; and in a short
time did his own Business.</p>

                     <p>I will give you one that's more odd,
if you call it so. I mean the Mystery of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds,</hi>
and <hi>Thirds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is such a Masterpiece; that I think
no Description can reach it. These Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pullers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61346:100"/>
in Distraction, are such implicit
Mortals as are not to be matched upon any
other occasion: A perfect Stranger shall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them at the first word. To ask Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
would be ungentile. On they go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Acquaintance either with the Man,
or the Matter. A most honourable Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
to Fight about they know not what;
for, and against, they know not whom! So
that for ought they can tell, they may be
under the Pious necessity of Murthering
their Father.</p>

                     <p>Right! There is nothing <hi>Prepence;</hi>
neither Malice nor Reason. But for all that,
I don't like a Man that can hate at first Sight,

                     <p>So much the worse; because it
argues the greater Contempt of human Kind.
For my Heart, I can't understand a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant
that can kill in cool Blood; and
shew the utmost effects of Rage without
Passion! 'Tis a Sign his common Temper
is as bad as the Malice, and Provocations
of other People. This Stoical Improvement,
is the Philosophy of a Butcher. It makes a
<hi>Beast</hi> of an Enemy, and knocks him down
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61346:101"/>
with as little concern as if he were an
Oxe.</p>

                     <p>To requite you for your extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Instances, I will give you a pretty
tough one on the other side. If a Souldier
refuses a Challenge from another, he will
not only be counted a Coward, but in all
likelihood Cashiered into the Bargain.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>The Case is hard I confess, but
not yours; for you are none of the <hi>Military
List.</hi> To those who may be concerned, I
answer.</p>
                     <p>1. You know the Challenger is punished as
well as the Challenged; which Discipline will
prevent the Case from being common. But
when it does happen, it may be replied in
the</p>
                     <p>Second Place, That he who professes
Arms, may prove his Courage by more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible
Instances. His former Behaviour in
the Field is oftentimes sufficient to wipe off
an Aspersion of Cowardize.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If he is not furnished with Proof
this way: Let him desire his Superior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that the next time he is drawn out, the
Challenger may be Posted near him. And
then would I heartily convince him, and
the Enemy to boot, that I wanted no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
If a Man miscarries in such a
Tryal, he may justify himself to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
He dyes in his <hi>Calling;</hi> and if nothing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61346:101"/>
else hinders, he may look the other World
in the Face.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>But a Souldier may sometimes
wait a long while for such an Opportunity
of purging himself: And would you have
him starved, and laughed at, in the mean
time?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Let him remember he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
as well as a Souldier; and that he
was first <hi>Listed</hi> under God Almighty. Now
a Man of Honour will rather starve, than
be false to a solemn Engagement. And
where the Cause is just, he is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for his Constancy. And if Interest
strikes in too, 'tis not only Criminal but
Weakness to desert it. As for the point of
Contempt, let him return it with pity: 'Tis
no Dishonour to be undervalued by those
who want either Understanding, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or both. If bare Contempt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason is so terribly Significant, a Fool
would be better than a Philosopher; a Slave
than an Emperour; provided the first had
but the Insolence to scorn the latter.</p>

put the Question! In earnest, I believe this

                     <p>Yes. But the Worship is stark
naught, and less to be chosen than the <hi>Fiery
Furnace.</hi> 'Tis great pity so much good <hi>Blood</hi>
should be offered at it. That Men who
have such Opportunities for Sense, should
be entangled in so monstrous an Absurdity!
That those who might be the Ornament of
their Age, and Defence of their Country,
should make themselves a Misfortune to
both!</p>

                     <p>Look you! To risque the <hi>Main</hi>

the Conduct of Prudence and Justice:
Without this Assistance the best Event will

                     <p>No more than all the <hi>Heresies</hi>
since <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> 'Tis a Principle so full

In a Word, 'Tis as contrary to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

                     <p>Yes. I say a Christian and no

                     <p>I have nothing to say as to that.
But then you should wish the Occasion may
never happen; and keep your Resolution
to your self. For to give out this sort of
Language, looks too like a Provocation:
And if you should be so unfortunately set
upon, be sure you keep within the Compass

Sure these are none of the

I think one might as good disband, and
turn Hermit, as be troubled with them any
longer. I begin now to understand the
Conduct of the first <hi>Monks,</hi> but believe their
<hi>History</hi> misreported. They fled the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Mankind, more than that of a
single Tyrant. They prefer'd the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Town, and found their Safety
and their Satisfaction better secured in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
than <hi>Society.</hi> For a wild Beast does

                     <p>Do you think it so impracticable
an Absurdity to wish all People well, and
endeavour to make them so?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. We comprehend all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in the <hi>League.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>You have a notable Grasp: I dare
not strain my Inclinations at that rate. I
love to keep fair with the World as well as
you, but it may be upon different Reasons.
In a word, I take Civility to be only a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61346:105"/>
with the Mode, Friendship but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Name for Trade, all mercenary and
designing. Indeed considering the state of
humane Affairs, 'tis next to impossible to be
otherwise. Where there is so much of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence,
Competition, and Uncertainty, you
must expect Self-interest will govern. You
may observe, That which you call <hi>Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
is most remarkable in the Young and
Unexperienced. Such Persons I confess are
often very Lavish of their Favours, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressing
in their Conversation: But these
Blandishments seem only designed for a State
of Impotence; that what they can't carry
by Force and Foresight, they may obtain
by Flattery. Like unfledged Birds, they are
fond of every one, that they may be <hi>Fed</hi>
the better. And where this Reason fails, that
which I am going to add will supply it.</p>

                     <p>What is that?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Why young People generally don't
Think so far as others, nor consider a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
at a Distance: This often makes
them more Liberal than Wise. They are
apt to be over-credulous at first Setting out;
and cannot so well see through Artifice and
Pretence: So that 'tis no wonder if they
bestow their Inclinations too freely upon
their Neighbours.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>This early Disposition to <hi>Oblige,</hi>
appears to me an Impression of Nature,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61346:105"/>
which was intended for Continuance: For
as the Use and Posture of the <hi>Limbs</hi> hold the
same in Manhood as they were in Infancy;
so one would think the <hi>Motions</hi> of the Mind
should be set Right at first. And therefore
when good Humour happens to wear off
with <hi>Age,</hi> it seems to proceed from Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanagement;
and looks more like a Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of Nature, than an Improvement of
Reason. If you please to hear me, I shall
endeavour to prove <hi>Vniversal Benevolence</hi>
both an acknowledged, and a practicable
Disposition.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray begin.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>My first Argument then shall be
drawn from Community of Nature. We
are all cast in the same <hi>Mould,</hi> allied in our
Passions, and in our Faculties: We have
the same Desires to satisfy, and generally
the same Pleasure in satisfying of them. All
Mankind is as it were one great <hi>Being,</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into several Parts; every part having
the same Properties and Affections with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now as we can't chuse but desire
Accommodations for our own Support and
Pleasure; so if we leave Nature to her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Biass, if we hearken to the undepra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Suggestions of our Minds, we shall wish
the same Conveniencies to others. For the
apprehending a Being so like our own, in
prosperous Circumstances, must be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61346:106"/>
of our selves: By this we see as
it were our own Nature pleased, and
Flourishing in another. And thus much
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> himself confesses to the Ruin of
his <hi>Cause, That the Sense of haviug commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
Satisfaction is naturally Delightful.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>But will this Notion spread wide
enough to do any Execution?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. For if a Man can but disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself from the Excesses of Self-love,
in a single Instance, he does the Business. If
he can but wish well to another, without
making Interest the only Motive, he may
be generous enough to take all Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Affections. For he that can do it
to one, without any mercenary View, may
for the same reason do it to a Million. 'Tis
but repeating the Action, where for his
Encouragement the Pleasure will be likewise
repeated.—</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>You are going too fast. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Capacities and Behaviour of Men
will leave your Repetition neither Sense, nor
Possibility: For to love Insignificancy is Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and seldom passes any farther than
Children or <hi>Relations.</hi>—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>For all that; one may wish a
poor Man an Estate, or a Fool Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
there is no unconquerable Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor so much as any Difficulty in these
things.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61346:106"/>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I say farther; to love malitious
and disobliging Qualities is impossible.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>If those Qualities were inseparable
from the <hi>Object,</hi> I grant your Meaning: But
where Malice is only <hi>Accidental,</hi> and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
possible, the Case is otherwise. A
Physician may have a Kindness for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi>
without being fond of the <hi>Disease.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>To illustrate your Distinction. If
a Man gives me a sower Box on the Ear; I
may love the <hi>Hand,</hi> though I don't like the
<hi>Blow.</hi> I assure you he that can thus abstract
the Affront from the Person that gives it,
and take off a Cuff so metaphysically, is
very much a Philosopher.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>If you are not satisfied, I'll consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Objection farther afterwards. At
present I shall go on to a second Proof, That
Universal Benevolence is agreable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, unless you have a mind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Not just now. Take your Method.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove my Point, from that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi>
which generally follows any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Misfortune. This Civility is so very
common, and so much expected, that those
who are unconcerned at the Troubles of
another, are called <hi>Inhumane. i. e.</hi> They are
degenerated from their Kind, and don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Name of Men. And does it not
plainly follow, That those who are thus
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61346:107"/>
sensibly Touched, must have a real Kindness
for the Unfortunate?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I think not. For Compassion is
but the Consequence of Infirmity, and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
upon Self-love. We are affected with
what another suffers, because this puts us
in mind we are not secure our selves. And
when our Neighbour's Calamity discovers
more than the possibility of our own, 'tis
no wonder if we are somewhat uneasy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant you Compassion may be
sometimes accounted for, as you say: But
then 'tis a Mistake to suppose it can come
from no other Cause. For 'tis easy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That the most generous Dispositions
are the most Compassionate. Such Persons,
though their Fortune is never so well Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
though the greatness of their Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts
them from Fear, and makes them
least concerned for any Accident of their
own, yet none condole and sympathize
more heartily than they. 'Tis plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this Pity and Tenderness, being so
void of Self-interest, must proceed from
Good-will.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Go on. I shall come in with you
by and by.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>I affirm then in the</p>
                     <p>Third place, That 'tis not agreable to the
Attributes of God to suppose, that he has
made the Nature of Man such, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61346:107"/>
to his Original Inclinations, he should
be unconcerned about the Happiness of his
Neighbour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Why so?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Because this would be a Reflection
both upon the Goodness, and Wisdom, of
God Almighty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Prove the Parts of your Assertion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>1. This Supposition is repugnant
to the Goodness of God. For can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
that God, who is infinite Goodness
himself, who made all rational Creatures
that they might be Happy; can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that he should contradict the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own Blessed Nature, and form
a <hi>Being</hi> wholly unlike himself? A <hi>Being</hi>
which he would not only hate as soon
as it was made; but, which is more, he
could impute his Dislike to nothing but
his own Workmanship? But if either
out of Indifferency, or Disaffection, 'twas
contrary to the Nature of Man to wish the
Happiness of another, he must be such a
Thing as I have described. And is it possible
to conceive, That Goodness and Perfection
can be the Parent of so unlovely an Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring?
That the over-flowing Generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Divine Nature, would create im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Beings with mean or envious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?
To be thus furnish'd, would make
them both Miserable and Troublesom; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61346:108"/>
acceptable to this World, nor fit for
the other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>These Inclinations you so much
dislike are very common; therefore if they
don't come from <hi>Above,</hi> you must find
them out some other Original.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>That will be done without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
To begin; The Reason which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Men from wishing the Happiness of
others, proceeds sometimes from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of Education, from the ill Examples
and Flatteries of those they first conversed
with, and sometimes 'tis afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by their own Fault. The general
Cause of this Depravation, is Covetousness,
and Pride.</p>
                     <p>1. An immoderate Love of Money spoils
those generous Dispositions they were sent
into the World with. It confines their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to their <hi>Pockets,</hi> and shrinks up
their Desires into the narrow and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Compass of their own Concerns. Their
Nature is so impoverish'd by their ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
that they are not able to spare
one kind Wish from themselves, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
one generous Thought in favour of
another.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>The Case is somewhat worse than
you have represented it. People don't always
keep within the terms of Neutrality. They
are not contented to forbear Wishing well,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61346:108"/>
but are oftentimes averse to the Happiness
of others.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Right. When Pride strikes in, that
is the Consequence. This Vice makes Men
think their Neighbours Advantage prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to their own; and that the greatest
Pleasure is to see others beneath them. Such
an ill-natured Notion as this, made Lucifer
uneasy, and envious in Heaven; and we
know what was the Issue. Far be it from
us to suppose, that God would stamp such
Ignoble, such Apostatizing Qualities upon
any rational Being. These would not be the
<hi>Image</hi> of the Deity, but the Devil.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>In my Opinion <hi>Self-love</hi> seems the
best Expedient to secure <hi>Individuals.</hi> By such
a Bent of Nature, a Man will be sure to take
care of one, and not leave his Business to
the Generosity of his Neighbours.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>If every one could stand upon his
own Legs, what you say would have a better
Colour. However, your Objection leads me
to shew you, That it reflects upon the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
of God, to suppose Men made with such
narrow inconversable Inclinations: For by
this Temper they would be unfit for <hi>Society.</hi>
But God has design'd Man a <hi>sociable</hi> Creature.
To this end he has sent him into the World
weak, and defenceless; so that without the
Care of others 'tis impossible for him to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
And when he is best able to Shift, if he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61346:109"/>
had no Assistance, or Converse but his own,
the Indigence of his Nature would make him
very uneasy, and ill supplied.</p>
                     <p>Now there is nothing so strongly cements
Society; nothing makes it flower, and flourish
so much, as a hearty Regard to the publick
Good. 'Tis <hi>general Kindness</hi> and Good-will,
which establishes the Peace, and promotes the
Prosperity of a People: To say, this <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
keeps Men just and inoffensive, is too
mean a Commendation. It improves their
Practice much higher, and makes them Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
and Obliging. Without this Virtue
the publick Union must unloose, the Strength
decay, and the Pleasure grow faint and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid.
And can we suppose that God would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfurnish
Man for the State he designed him,
and not afford him a Soul large enough to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his Happiness? That he should give him
<hi>Solitary</hi> Principles, and yet intend him for
publick Converse? Create him so, that he
shall naturally care for nothing but himself;
and at the same time make his Interest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon mutual Affection, and good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with others? Is it imaginable
that such a comprehensive Wisdom, which
has made all things in <hi>Number, Weight,</hi> and
<hi>Measure;</hi> secured the Preservation of <hi>Brutes,</hi>
by Instinct and Sympathy, and made so fair
a Provision for the inferiour World; Is it to
be conceived, I say, that so glorious <hi>a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61346:109"/>
should not proportion the Faculties of
his noblest Creatures, but send them into <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
with Inclinations unsuitable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they must necessarily be placed in?</p>
                  </sp>

for a Commonwealth besides <hi>stark
Love</hi> and <hi>Kindness,</hi> and I believe the Building
might last, without tempering the Mortar
with <hi>Hony.</hi> What do you say to the fear of
receiving <hi>Harm,</hi> and the hopes of Assistance?
These are the Motives of Self-love, and I
think sufficient to make Men just, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to do a good Turn.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly I think not. I grant you these
Motives are not insignificant: They have an
Interest in Life, but not enough to push it to
Perfection, and secure it's Happiness. For first
they will not restrain a secret Mischief which
considering the unfortified State of Mankind,
is a great Defect. Besides, the Agreableness of
Society must be lost this way. 'Tis Inclination
and Endearment that gives Life and Pleasure.
But when People have nothing but Fears, and
Jealousies and Plots in their Heads, there is no
<hi>Musick</hi> in their Company. And farther, I
would gladly know, how these scanty Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
can explain why Men should dye for their
Friends, and sacrifice their Interest for their
Country, without Necessity? By the Maxims
of Self-love, such Actions as these must be
foolish and unnatural: And yet those who are

thus forgetful of themselves, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was

                     <p>You forget that there is such a
thing as Honour and vain Glory in the
World. This is the Bait that catches the Men
you speak of: 'Tis the Reputation of the

them so Prodigal, and Resigning.</p>

                     <p>In earnest you are catched your
self! Your Objection supposes the Truth of
what I am contending for. It supposes that
Benevolence and Generosity are possessed of
the publick Esteem; That they have Custom
and <hi>Prescription</hi> on their side; That they are
the highest Improvements of the Will, the
most admired and heroick Qualities. Now 'tis
very strange, so universal a Consent should be
founded in a Mistake; and none but Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi>
and some few of his Discipling, should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Operations of their own Minds,
and the right Constitution of them.</p>

                     <p>Well! If this World won't satisfy
you, the other shall. I say then, That the
fear of <hi>invisible Powers,</hi> and the Expectations
of future Punishments, are sufficient to keep
Men upon their <hi>good Behaviour;</hi> to be a check
upon their Privacies, and make them honest
at Midnight. And yet after all, they may have
no great Stomach to the Matter. 'Tis the <hi>Rod,</hi>
not the Inclination, which learns the <hi>Lesson.</hi>

                     <p>I grant you the Disciplining part of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61346:110"/>
Religion is very significant. However, it would
not give a sufficient Relief in this Case.</p>

                     <p>Because upon your Supposition the
Force of it would be lost. For if the Nature of
Man was averse to <hi>general Kindness;</hi> if he could
not chuse but think it unreasonable to love
any Body but himself, then God in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to love his Neighbour would oblige
him to an impossibility. We might as well be
commanded to taste Gall as sweet as Hony:
For 'tis as much in our Power to alter the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
of our Senses, as to love any thing
contrary to our Reason and Inclination. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Supposition therefore no Man could
have an inward Affection for his Neighbour,
which yet 'tis certain we are obliged to have.</p>

                     <p>If I am used well I'll ne'er trouble
my self about what People think. If they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
act like Friends, they may <hi>wish</hi> like
Enemies, if they please.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Have a Care! If they are not so
<hi>within,</hi> they will not be long so <hi>without.</hi> For
if we had a kind of Antipathy against minding
any thing but our selves: If we thought our
own Interest prejudiced, or our Quiet embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed
by being concerned for others, in this
Case, all Offices of Humanity and Obligation,
would be so many Acts of Penance. And since
the opportunities of Obliging return so fast;
to be commanded the Use of them, would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61346:111"/>
make our Lives almost a perpetual Torment. It
would be like feeding upon that we naturally
abhor; which instead of nourishing, would
throw us into <hi>Sweats</hi> and <hi>Convulsions.</hi> And at
this rate a Kindness would often be a greater
Mischief to the Doer, than a Benefit to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.
The Upshot is, that if the Mind of Man
was naturally averse from Wishing well to any
thing but himself, the command of <hi>general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence</hi>
would be impossible to be entertain'd
in Principle, and Affection. And as for the
Counterfeit in outward Practise, that would
be such a Grievance to ill Nature, that very
few would submit to it. For if Men are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
as not to be governed by Religion
Now, when 'tis both profitable and pleasant, of
how little force would it be, should it lye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wholly in Violence and Aversion? If
Envy, and ill Nature, were the natural Frame
and Complexion of the Mind, Religion would
signify not much towards Reformation; so
that <hi>Society</hi> could receive but small Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from thence.—</p>

Under favour, that's no Consequence. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that you'll grant that Men don't act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
up to the stretch of their Capacities:

                     <p>Look you, all ill Usage proceeds
from ignorance and disorder of Mind. Those
that give it, are the greatest Sufferers. They
destroy their own Happiness more than ours.
And under this Notion they will deserve our
Compassion much better than our Hatred:
Our Charity will take them in as naturally
as <hi>Bedlam.</hi> 'Tis true, there may be some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of difference in the Distraction, but that
is all. And as we may Wish, we may likewise
Attempt their Welfare: Not only out of Pity,
and common Alliance; but also from the
Prospect of a Return.</p>

we have made him more commodious for our

the satisfaction of doing Good against Evil,
which as 'tis the most divine Quality, so to
maintain it, the Pleasure is proportionably
raised. There is a secret Triumph and Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Spirit upon such an occasion. There
is no one that acts in this manner who does
not inwardly applaud himself for it; which is
as much as to say. God bids him go on.</p>

thus far with an Enemy; but if you enlarge
your Sense to Complacency and Affection, I
grant it impossible. Besides, there is no need
of winding up the String thus high: We are
not obliged to be pleased with those that do
us Mischief; the Goodness of God himself
does not proceed thus far. For tho he is kind
to the <hi>Unthankful</hi> and the <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> the

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Very much. In good earnest this
Quality is well worth the Courting; 'tis valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in <hi>Fortune,</hi> as well as in Beauty and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
'Twill make a Man an interest in the
World. It removes Difficulties, &amp; smooths the
Passage for Business; and like the Marriage of
Princes, there is Policy as well as Pleasure in
the <hi>Alliance.</hi> You know the Trade of Life can't
be driven without <hi>Partners;</hi> there is a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Dependance between the <hi>Greatest</hi> and the
<hi>Least.</hi> And the best Figure is but a <hi>Cypher,</hi>
where it stands alone. For this reason a wise
Man will strengthen the Confederacy, and
take in all the Help he can get. Now there is
nothing so engaging as a benevolent Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Temper makes a Man's Behaviour
inoffensive, affable, and obliging; it multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Friends, and disarms the Malice of an
Enemy. He that is kind out of Principle, will
be so to all the Advantages of Decency and
Compass. That which is Natural, is Uniform,
Constant, and Graceful. Whereas he who
Counterfeits good Nature, he who is civil on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Breeding or Design, will be apt to
have <hi>Breaks,</hi> and Inequalities in his Humour.
A Man cannot always stand bent; so that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Negligence, or Passion, or Interest, will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61346:113"/>
some time or other return the Posture, and
unmask the Pretence, and then the Labour
is all lost. But the natural Complexion of
Goodness will hold.</p>

                     <p>No fear of that. This Quality will
do more than pay for its keeping. Remember
that Power goes in with the Inclinations of
Course: Get but Mens Hearts, and their
Hands will follow. But to do this, there is
nothing more likely than a plausible and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Honesty. The Charms of Kindness are
irresistable; they conquer, and captivate, and
return with Spoil and Triumph. Besides, the
Assistance that comes from Inclination, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
safer, and more serviceable, than that
which is haled in by Force or Money. He
that reigns in the Affections is the happy
Prince; for in Love there's neither Treachery
nor Desertion. A Man remarkably Obliging,
is almost proof against the most Malitious.
They'll be afraid of attaquing one so forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in publick Esteem, and under so sacred
a Character. Though his Virtue may be
over-looked, the Infamy of the Action will
prevent an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; our Affection to others gives
us a share in their Happiness, and so becomes
an Addition to our own. Wishing well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61346:113"/>
a Man's Capacity of being Happy:
This hinders his Satisfaction from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to his private Interest. He is really the
better for whatever good his Neighbour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys;
because every thing of this Nature sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
his desires, and gives him that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

                     <p>Yes. And in a great measure make
him Master of all the Happiness he sees, or
hears of. All prosperous Events, all Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Industry, and Blessings of Providence
which he is acquainted with, his excellent
Temper gives him an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nterest in; for tho he
has not the Possession of these things, he has
what is most desirable, the Satisfaction of
them. Nay, I believe the generous Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
may be improved to exceed the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
and make a Man more happy than
those he rejoyces for. In this Case, the Laws
of Nature give way for the Encouragement
of Goodness, the Stream rises higher than
the Fountain, and the Rebound is stronger
than the first Motion.</p>

                     <p>This is a new way of extracting the

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61346:114"/>
impoverishing the <hi>Flower.</hi> Were I Master of
this <hi>Secret,</hi> I would not concern my self about
laying in the usual Provision for Satisfaction.
No, I would rather chuse to be happy at the
second hand, that is much the easier way;
there the Gains come in a main, without any
Venture. For Instance. I would not trouble
my self about getting an Estate; 'twere only
Loving a Man dearly that has one, and that
will do as well. But the Mischief is, at present
I am not a Man of that fortunate Imagination.</p>

                     <p>Be it so. I shall allow your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in some measure, and make my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon it.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, if kind Wishing and Obliging
are such entertaining Actions; if they may be
carried up to transport, and almost sensuality;
then your general Benevolence is nothing but
a resined sort of Self-love, because it acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a foreseen Reward. I told you <hi>Self</hi> would
be at the Bottom after All.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>So let it, since it has Company. For
let me tell you, to be delighted in the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of another, is so far from being mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that 'tis an infallible proof of a natural and
undissembled Goodness. How can we better
demonstrate the reality of our Affections to a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61346:114"/>
Friend, than by rejoycing at his Prosperity?
As for the Pleasure which attends so noble a
Disposition, the Expectation of that is no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
self design. For we are allowed to love
our selves, as well as our Neigbour: So that
the prospect of being pleased does not lessen
the generosity of the Action, if His Advantage
was as sincerely sought, and delighted in, as
our own. Therefore by Charitys not <hi>seeking
her own,</hi> (which you know is made a part of
its Character) is only meant, that it does not
seek its own, without a joynt Respect to the
Welfare of another. In short, I think the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Congratulation is so far from a Fault,
that the first Satisfaction ought rather to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a second; we should be pleased with our
Pleasure, because it brings us the good News
that our Minds are rightly disposed.</p>

                     <p>A kind reconciling Thought is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Remedy. This Balsamick Humour closes
the Wound, and scatters the Anguish. Like
the Motion of <hi>Restitution,</hi> it returns Nature
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61346:115"/>
to her Ease, and sets her in the Posture she
was made for.</p>

                     <p>I grant you Benevolence has a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Quality, and sits very smooth at first.
But as the World goes the Consequences of it
are more likely to make us unhappy, than
otherwise.</p>

                     <p>If you look Abroad you'll find Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and Disappointment, and Vexation,
much more common than Prosperity. Now
this predominancy of Misfortune lyes very
hard upon <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and makes the kindest
People the greatest Sufferers. Their Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
rises in proportion to their Generosity;
their Tenderness is more passive, which makes
a foreign Calamity strike deeper, and grow
more pungent. Having strong desires to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but small Abilities to effect it; their good
Nature must needs grow troublesome, because
'twill often make 'em Wish those things which
they see are impossible to compass. But others
who keep their Inclinations at Home, are not
so much exposed to disquiet; because their
Passions and Expectations being confined to
their private Interest, they are concerned for
no Misfortune but their own.</p>

                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Supposing what you say would hold, it
would be no just discouragement to Goodness,
considering how much it will be rewarded
hereafter. But because your Objection relates
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61346:115"/>
chiefly to the <hi>present,</hi> I shall direct my Answer
against that Sense, and give it you by Parts.</p>
                     <p>I affirm therefore, That if a Man does but
joyn Consideration with his Benevolence; if
his Understanding be good, as well as his
Will, his Affection for the common Welfare
will never hurt him. For</p>
                     <p>1. He will perceive that the unhappy part
of the World is not so numerous as at first it
appeared. Those who are of low Condition,
tho they may seem most Deserted, are not the
worst Provided for. Their Fortune is little 'tis
true, and so generally are their Desires, which
makes them want as few things as those whose
Possessions are larger. They have the Pleasure
of their Senses as well as others; and what is
denied in Variety, is supplied by Labour,
which sharpens the Appetite, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
the Constitution.</p>
                     <p>2. As for those who are real Objects of
Compassion, the old Maxim will in great
measure relieve them; <hi>Dolor, si gravis brevis,
si longus levis.</hi> At the worst, Life and Misery
will be dispatched e're long; and then, if they
deserve it, they are Happy; as Happy as
Goodness can wish.</p>
                     <p>3. Commiseration has a mixture of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as well as Trouble in it. By this a
Man is conscious he does the Office of a
Friend; that he is of a generous and humane
Disposition. These Thoughts make the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61346:116"/>
of the Sympathy equalize the Trouble, if
the Person be not very near, or the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
very great, which we are concern'd for.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>There is something in what you
say; for I have observed that Women will
Weep and Condole with abundance of
Tenderness and Affection: I believe they are
pleased with the Pomp and Passion of their
Sorrow; and think themselves the best Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
People in the World for't.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>We should interpret all Signs of
good Nature in the fairest Sense. But I shall
proceed, and observe</p>
                     <p>4. A wise Well wisher will consider there
is a necessity of Discipline, both to secure the
Orderly and reclaim the Evil. Goals and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets
are as useful in a State, as great Places, and
<hi>Patents</hi> of <hi>Honour.</hi> Where Goodness is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Reason unabsolute, there must be Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
to fence in Duty, and check the Abuse
of Liberty. As things stand, 'tis not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
how Providence can Govern without
Punishing. Upon this Contemplation a good
Man will no more be disturbed at the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Correction, than by seeing his Friend
take unpalatable Physick, which he knows to
be proper for his Health. And as for those
who are lost beyond Recovery, tho he wishes
twere otherwise, yet their obstinacy does
'not so deeply affect him as to make him
uneasy.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>Is not such a Sedateness a Sign of
Neglect, and Stoical Indifference?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Not at all. The Saints above are
not afflicted at the Punishment of the damned,
and yet they have Charity in perfection: But
your Objection runs into an absurd Inference.
It dilutes the Happiness of the other World,
and gives Hell an Influence upon Heaven.</p>

                     <speaker>Philot.</speaker>
                     <p>I have nothing farther to object, and
therefore must be your Proselyte: But if you
have any more to say, let's hear it, for a Man
can never be too well fortified against Custom.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Philal.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. <hi>General Kindness</hi> may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
from the Nobleness of such a Temper.
It springs from a generous Root, and spreads
and flourishes upon the best Nourishment
imaginable. There's nothing in it that is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
or Fantastical. 'Tis not supported by
Chance or Humour, by Flattery or Design: It
stands upon its own independent Strength,
and holds on through all Opposition. 'Tis
above Discouragement and ill Usage, and not
so much as checked into Indifferency, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Injury and Provocation. I need say no
more for this Virtue, than that 'tis the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of God. This Truth I shall take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Indeed the Universe proves it; all the
Powers and Delights of Nature are standing
Evidence. If Omnipotence were in other
Hands than Goodness, we should feel terrible
Effects on't. Now to resemble God is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61346:117"/>
of Virtue; 'tis doing the wisest and the
greatest Action in its Kind. To mention but
one Advantage, We can't recommend our
selves more effectually to God Almighty than
by delighting in the same Actions which he
does. Love naturally arises from Likeness of
Disposition. Our Imitation of another is an
unquestioned proof that we value his Person,
and admire his Choice; which lays a kind of
an Obligation for a return. Such a Consent of
Wills, such an Uniformity of Desires, does as
it were incorporate distinct Essences, and
makes us almost the same thing with another;
so that as long as he has a Regard for himself,
he must have one for us too. By being of the
same Temper with God Almighty, we do as
it were engage his Inclinations to make us
happy. While we are thus affected, he can
no more be unconcerned about our Welfare,
than he can deny himself, or put a neglect
upon his own Attributes.—</p>
