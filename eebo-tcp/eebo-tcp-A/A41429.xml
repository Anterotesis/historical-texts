            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

leave of the College, and that he would not ſubmit himſelf to the Preſident and Cenſors, and affirmed that the Preſident and Cenſors had not any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over thoſe who were Doctors of the Vniverſity; For which cauſe the ſaid <hi>4</hi> Cenſors, <hi>ſc.</hi> Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Moundforde,</hi> Dr. <hi>Argent,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Dun,</hi> then being Cenſors or Governors, <hi>pro offenſis &amp; inobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia praed' adtunc &amp; ibid' ordinaverunt &amp; decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt, quod praed' Tho.

The Plaintiff replied and ſaid, That by the ſaid Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> it was further enacted, And where that in the Dioceſes of <hi>England,</hi> out of <hi>London,</hi> it is not like to find alway men able ſufficiently to examine (after the Statute) ſuch as ſhall be admitted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Phyſick in them, that it may be enacted in this preſent Parliament, That no perſon from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be ſuffered to exerciſe or practiſe Phyſick through <hi>England</hi> untill ſuch time that he be examined at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by the ſaid Preſident and thrée of the ſaid Elects, and to have from them Letters Teſtimonial of their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57185:98"/>
approving and examination, Exeept he be a Graduate of <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which have accompliſhed all things for his form without grace: And that the Plaintiff in the year of our Lord <hi>1595.</hi> was a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate, <hi>ſc.</hi> a Doctor in the Vniverſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and had accompliſhed all things concerning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée for his form without grace, by force whereof he had exerciſed and practiſed Phyſick within the City of <hi>London,</hi> until the Defendants had impriſoned him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which the Defendants did demur in Law. And this caſe was often argued by the Sexjeants at Bar in diverſe ſeveral Terms; And now this Term the caſe was argued by the Iuſtices, and the effect of their arguments who argued againſt the Plaintiff (which was divided into thrée parts) ſhall be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. The firſt was, whether a Doctor of Phyſick of the one Vniverſity or the other, be by the Letters Patents and by the body of the Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to practiſe Phyſick within the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond was, If the exception in the ſaid Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> hath excepted him or not. The third was, That his impriſonment was lawfull for his ſaid diſobedience. And as to the <hi>firſt,</hi> they did rely upon the Letter of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ratified by the ſaid Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> which is in the negative, <hi>ſc. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo in dicta Civitate, &amp;c. exercea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57185:98"/>
here neceſſary to recite. Alſo they ſaid, that the Statute of <hi>3 H. 8. cap. 11.</hi> which in effect is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> hath a ſpecial Proviſo for the Vniverſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> which being here left out, doth declare the intention of the makers of the Act, that they did intend to include them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this general Prohibition, <hi>Nemo in dicta Civitate, &amp;c.</hi> As to the <hi>Second</hi> point they ſtrongly held, that the ſaid latter clauſe, <hi>And where that in the Dioceſes of England out of London, &amp;c.</hi> this clauſe according to the words doth extend onely to places out of <hi>London,</hi> and ſo much the rather, becauſe that they purview for <hi>London</hi> before, <hi>Nemo in dicta Civitate, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo the makers of the Act put a diſtinction betwixt thoſe who ſhall be licenſed to practiſe Phyſick within <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> for they ought to have the admittance and allowance of the Preſident and College in writing under their Common Seal; but he who ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to practiſe Phyſick throughout <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>London</hi> ought to be examined and admitted by the Preſident and <hi>3</hi> of the Elects, and ſo they ſaid, that it was lately adjudged in the Kings Bench, in an Information exhibited againſt the ſaid Doctor <hi>Bonham</hi> for practiſing of Phyſick within <hi>London</hi> for divers months. As to the <hi>Third</hi> point they ſaid, That for his contempt and diſobedience before them in their College they might commit him to Priſon, for they have authority by the Letters Patents and Act of Parliament, And therefore for his contempt and misdemeanor before them they may commit him. Alſo the Act of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> hath given them power to commit them for every offence or diſobedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any Article or Clauſe contained in the ſaid Grant or Act. But there is an expreſs Negative
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57185:99"/>
Article in the ſaid Grant, and ratified by the Act of <hi>14 H. 8. Quod nemo in dicta Civitate, &amp;c. exerceat, &amp;c.</hi> And the Defendants have pleaded that the Plaintiff hath prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Phyſick within <hi>London</hi> by the ſpace of one month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Act of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> hath authoriſed them for to impriſon him in this caſe; for which cauſe they did conclude for the Defendants againſt the Plaintiff. But it was argued by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Iuſtice, <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> Iuſtices of the Common Pleas, to the contrary. And <hi>Daniel</hi> conceived that a Doctor of Phyſick of the one Vniverſity or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not within the body of the Act, and if he was within the body of the Act, that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the ſaid latter clauſe: But <hi>Warburton</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued againſt him for both the points: and the Chief Iuſtice did not ſpeak to theſe <hi>2</hi> points, becauſe that he and <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did agrée that this action was clearly maintainable for two other points. But to the <hi>2</hi> other points he and the ſaid <hi>2</hi> other Iuſtices <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did ſpeak, <hi>ſcil. 1.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cenſors have power for the Cauſes alledged in their Barr, to fine and impriſon the Plaintiff. <hi>2.</hi> Admitting that they have power to doe it, if they have purſued their power. But the chief Iuſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he argued the points in Law, becauſe that much was ſaid in the commendations of the Doctors of Phyſick of the ſaid College within <hi>London,</hi> and ſomewhat (as he conceived) in derogation of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Doctors of the Vniverſities, he firſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to the Doctors of the ſaid College within <hi>London,</hi> and did confeſs that nothing was ſpoken, which was not due to their merits; but yet that no compariſon was to be made between that private College, and any of the Vniverſities of <hi>Cambridge</hi>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57185:99"/>
and <hi>Oxford,</hi> no more than between the Father and his Children, or betwéen the Fountain and the ſmall Rivers which deſcend from thence: The Vniverſity is <hi>Alma mater,</hi> from whoſe breaſts thoſe of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate College have ſucked all their ſcience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (which I acknowledge to be great and profound) but the Law ſaith, <hi>Erubeſcit lex Filios caſtigare Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> The Vniverſity is the fountain, and that and the like private Colleges are <hi>tanquam rivuli,</hi> which flow from the fountain, <hi>&amp; melius eſt petere fontes quàm ſectari rivulos.</hi> Briefly, <hi>Academiae Cantabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae &amp; Oxoniae ſunt Athenae noſtrae nobiliſſimae, regni ſoles, oculi &amp; animae regni, unde Religio, humanitas &amp; doctrina in omnes regni partes uberrimè diffundun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> But it is true, <hi>Nunquam ſufficiet copia lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris, quia nunquam deficiet materia laudis;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Vniverſities excéed and excell all private Colleges, <hi>tanquam inter viburna cupreſſus.</hi> And it was obſerved that King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> his ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, and the King and the Parliament in the Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> in making of a Law concerning Phyſicians, for the more ſafety and health of men, therein have followed the order of a good Phyſician <hi>(Rex enim omnes artes cenſetur habere in ſcrinio pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſui)</hi> For, <hi>Medicina eſt duplex, removens &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movens; removens morbum, &amp; promovens ad ſalutem.</hi> And therefore <hi>5</hi> manner of perſons (who more hurt the body of men than the diſeaſe it ſelf) are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. <hi>1.

                        <hi>4.</hi> groundedly learned, <hi>5.</hi> profoundly ſtudied. And it was well ordained, That the profeſſors of Phyſick ſhould be profound, ſad, diſcreet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not youths who have no gravity and experience; for as one ſaith, <hi>In Juvene Theologo conſcientiae detrimentum, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene Legiſta burſae decrementum, in juvene Medico coemeterii incrementum.</hi> And it ought to be preſumed, every Doctor of any of the Vniverſities to be within the Statute, <hi>ſc.</hi> to be profound, ſad, diſcreet, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly learned, and profoundly ſtudied, for none can there be Maſter of Arts (who is a Doctor of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy) under the ſtudy of <hi>7</hi> years, and cannot be Doctor of Phyſick under <hi>7</hi> years more in the ſtudy of Phyſick: and that is the cauſe that the Plaintiff is named in the Declaration, Doctor of Philoſophy, and Doctor of Phyſick, <hi>quia oportet Medicum eſſe Philoſophum; ubi enim Philoſophus deſinit, incipit Medicus.</hi> As to the <hi>2</hi> points upon which the Chief Iuſtice, <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> gave judgment: <hi>1.</hi> It was reſolved by them, That the ſaid Cenſors have not the power to commit the plaintiff for any of the cauſes mentioned in the Barr, and the cauſe and reaſon thereof ſhortly was, That the ſaid clauſe which giveth power to the ſaid Cenſors to fine and impriſon, doth not extend to the ſaid clauſe, <hi>ſc. Quòd nemo in dicta Civitate, &amp;c. exerceat dictam facultatem, &amp;c.</hi> Which prohibiteth every one to practiſe Phyſick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> without licence of the Preſident and College; but extendeth onely to puniſh thoſe who practiſe Phyſick within <hi>London, pro delictis ſuis in non bene exequendo, faciendo &amp; utendo facultate medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> by fine and impriſonment: So that the Cenſors have not power by the Letters Patents and the Act to fine and impriſon any for practiſing of Phyſick
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57185:100"/>
within <hi>London,</hi> but onely <hi>pro delictis ſuis in non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> for ill and not good uſe and practice of Phyſick. And that was made manifeſt by <hi>5</hi> Reaſons called <hi>vividae rationes,</hi> becauſe they had their vigour and life from the Letters Patents and the Act it ſelf. And the beſt Expoſitor of all Letters Patents, and Acts of Parliament, are the Letters Patents and the Acts themſelves, by conſtruction and conferring all the parts together, <hi>Optima Statuti interpretatrix eſt (omnibus particulis ejuſdem inſpectis) ipſum Statutum;</hi> And <hi>injuſtum eſt niſi totâ lege inſpectâ, de una aliqua ejus particula judicare vel reſpondere.</hi> The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, that theſe two were two abſolute, perfect and diſtinct Clauſes, and as Parallels, and therefore the one did not extend to the other; for the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth <hi>Praeterea voluit &amp; conceſſit, &amp;c.</hi> and the branch concerning fine and impriſonment, is parcel of the ſecond Clauſe. <hi>2.</hi> The firſt Clauſe prohibiting the practiſing of Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth comprehend <hi>4</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties; <hi>1.</hi> Certainty of the thing prohibited, <hi>ſc.</hi> practice of Phyſick; <hi>2.</hi> Certainty of the time, <hi>ſc.</hi> practice for one month; <hi>3.</hi> Certainty of Penalty, <hi>ſc. 5 li. 4.</hi> Certainty of diſtribution, <hi>ſc.</hi> one Moyety to the King, and the other Moyety to the College; and this penalty he who practiſeth Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> doth incur, although he practiſe and uſe Phyſick well, and profitably for the body of man; and upon this branch the Information was exhibited in the Kings Bench. But the Clauſe to puniſh <hi>delicta in non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> upon which branch the Caſe at Barr ſtands, is altogether uncertain, for the hurt which may come thereby may be little or great, <hi>leve vel grave,</hi> exceſſive or ſmall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the King and the makers of the Act, cannot for ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57185:101"/>
offence impoſe a certainty of fine, or time of impriſonment, but leave it to the Cenſors to puniſh ſuch offences, <hi>ſecundum quantitatem delicti,</hi> which is included in theſe words, <hi>per fines, amerciamenta, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonamenta corporum ſuorum, &amp; per alias vias ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabiles &amp; congruas. 2.</hi> The harm which accrueth by <hi>non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> doth concern the body of man; and therefore it is reaſonable that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be puniſhed in his body, <hi>ſc.</hi> by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he who practiſeth Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> in a good manner, although he doth it without leave, yet it is not any prejudice to the body of man. But the clauſe of <hi>Non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe any time certain, but at what time ſoever he miniſtreth Phyſick <hi>non bene, &amp;c.</hi> he ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſaid <hi>2</hi> branch. And the Law hath great reaſon in the making of this diſtinction, for divers Nobles, Gentlemen, and others come upon divers occaſions to <hi>London;</hi> and when they are here, they become ſubject to diſeaſes, and thereupon they ſend for their Phyſicians into the Countrey, who know their bodies and the cauſes of the diſeaſes; now it was never the meaning of the Act to barr any one of his own Phyſician; and when he is here he may practiſe and miniſter Phyſick to another by <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> wéeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any forfeiture; for any one who wactiſeth Phyſick well in <hi>London</hi> (although he hath not taken any degree in any of the Vniverſities) ſhall forfeit nothing, if not that he practiſe it by the ſpace of a month; and that was the cauſe, that the time of a month was put in the Act. <hi>4.</hi> The Cenſors cannot be Iudges, Miniſters and Parties; Iudges to give ſentence or Iudgment: Miniſters, to make ſummons; and Parties to have the moyety of the
<pb facs="tcp:57185:101"/>
forfeiture, <hi>quia aliquis non debet eſſe Judex in propria cauſa, imo iniquum eſt aliquem ſuae rei eſſe Judicem:</hi> and one cannot be Iudge and Attorney for any of the parties: <hi>Dyer. 3 Ed. 6. 65. 38 E. 3. 15. 8 H. 6. 19, 20. 21 E 4. 47. &amp;c.</hi> And it appeareth in our books that in many Caſes the Common Law doth controll Acts of Parliament, and ſometimes ſhall adjudge them to be void: for when an Act of Parliament is againſt Common right and reaſon, or repugnant or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be performed, the Common Law ſhall controll it, and adjudge ſuch Act to be void; and therefore in <hi>8 E. 3. 30.

as to that point void. The Statute of <hi>Carliſle</hi> made <hi>35 E. 1.</hi> enacteth That the Order of the Ciſtertians and Auguſtines who have a Covent and Common Seal, that the Common Seal ſhall be in the keeping of the Prior, who is under the Abbot, and <hi>4</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the moſt grave of the houſe: and that any déed ſealed with the Common Seal, which is not ſo in kéeping, ſhall be void: and the opinion of the Court <hi>(Anno 27 H. 6.</hi> Annuity <hi>41.)</hi> was, that this Statute was void, for it is impertinent to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the Seal being in their kéeping, the Abbot cannot ſeal any thing with it, and when it is in the Abbots hands it is out of their kéeping <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> and if the Statute ſhould be obſerved, every Common Seal ſhall be defeated upon a ſimple ſurmiſe, which cannot be tryed.

Verba poſteriora propter certitudinem addita, ad priora quae certitudine indigent, ſunt referenda. 6 E. 3. 12.</hi> Sir <hi>Adam de Clydrow</hi> Knight brought a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> againſt <hi>I. de Clydrow,</hi> and the writ was, <hi>Quod juſte, &amp;c. reddat Manerium de Wicombe &amp; duas carucatas terrae cum pert. in Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drow,</hi> in that caſe the Town of <hi>Clydrow</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Mannor, <hi>quia non indiget,</hi> for a Mannor may be demanded without mentioning that it lieth in any Town; but <hi>cum pertinentiis,</hi> although that it cometh after the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall relate to the Mannor, <hi>quia indiget.

But it was objected, That where by the ſecond clauſe it was granted, that the Cenſors ſhould have <hi>ſuperviſum &amp; ſcrutinium, correctionem &amp; gubernationem omnium &amp; ſingulorum Medicorum, &amp;c.</hi> they had power to fine and impriſon. To that it was anſwered, <hi>1.</hi> That the ſame is but part of the ſentence, for by the entire ſentence it appeareth in what manner they ſhall have power to puniſh, for the words are, <hi>ac punitionem eorum pro delictis ſuis in non bene exequendo, ſaciendo ſeu utendo illâ facultate:</hi> ſo that without queſtion all their power to correct and puniſh the Phyſicians by this
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57185:103"/>

To which it was anſwered, That neither the Letters Patents nor the Act of Parliament hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them any Court, but onely an authority, which they ought to purſue, as it ſhall be afterwards ſaid. <hi>2.</hi> If any Court had béen granted to them, they could
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57185:104"/>
not by any incident authority <hi>implicitè</hi> granted unto them for any miſdemeanor done in Court, commit him to priſon without bail or mainpriſe, untill he ſhall be by the commandment of the Preſident and Cenſors, or their Succeſſors, delivered, as the Cenſors have done in this caſe. <hi>3.</hi> There was not any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor for which the Court might impriſon him, for he onely ſhewed his caſe to them, which he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Councel he may juſtifie, which is not any offence worthy of impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond point.</hi> Admitting that the Cenſors had power by the Act, if they have purſued their authority or not? And it was reſolved by the chief Iuſtice, <hi>Warburton,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that they have not purſued it for <hi>6</hi> cauſes. <hi>1.</hi> By the Act the Cenſors onely have power to impoſe a fine or amercement; and the Preſident and Cenſors do impoſe the amercement of <hi>5 li.</hi> upon the Plaintiff. <hi>2.</hi> The Plaintiff was ſummoned to appear before the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and did not appear; and therefore he was fined <hi>10 li.</hi> whereas the Preſident hath not any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in that caſe. <hi>3.</hi> The fines and amercements to be impoſed by them by force of the Act, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them but to the King, for the King hath not granted the fines and amercements to them, and yet the fine is appointed to be paid to them in <hi>proximis Comitiis,</hi> and they have impriſoned the Plaintiff for non-payment thereof. <hi>4.</hi> They ought to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Plaintiff preſently by conſtruction of Law, although that no time be limited in the Act, as in the Stat. of <hi>Weſt. cap. 12. De Servientibus, Ballivis, &amp;c. qui ad compotum reddend' tenentur, &amp;c. cum Dom' hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſmodi ſervientium dederit eis auditores compoti, &amp; contingat ipſum in arreragiis ſuper compotum ſuum</hi>

                        <hi>omnibus allocatis &amp; allocandis, arreſtentur corpora eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; per teſtimonium auditorum ejuſdem compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti mittantur &amp; liberentur proximae gaolae Domini Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis in partibus illis, &amp;c.</hi> in that caſe, although that no time be limited when the Accomptant ſhall be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, yet it ought to be preſently, as it is holden in <hi>27 H. 6. 8.</hi> and the reaſon thereof is given in <hi>Fogoſſa's Caſe Plow. Com. 17.</hi> that the generality of time ſhall be reſtrained to the preſent time for the benefit of him upon whom the pain ſhall be inflicted, and therewith agréeth <hi>Plow. Com. 206. b. in Stradling's Caſe.</hi> And a Iuſtice of Peace upon view of the force, ought to commit the offender preſently. <hi>5.</hi> For as much as the Cenſors had their authority by the Letters Patents and Act of Parliament, which are high matters of Record, their proceedings ought not to be by word, and ſo much the rather, becauſe they claimed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to fine and impriſon. And therefore if Iudgment be given againſt one in the Common Pleas in a Writ of Recaption, he ſhall be fined and impriſoned; but if the Writ be Vicontiel in the County, there he ſhall not be fined or impriſoned, becauſe that the Court is not of Record, <hi>F. N. B. in bre. de Recaptione,</hi> ſo in <hi>47 F. N. B.</hi> a Plea of Treſpaſs <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> doth not lie in the County Court, hundred Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they cannot make Record of fine and impriſonment; and regularly thoſe who cannot make a Record, cannot fine and impriſon. And therewith agréeth <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> Book of Entries: The Auditors make a Record when they commit the Defendant to priſon; A Iuſtice of Peace upon view of the force may commit, but he ought to make a Record of it. <hi>6.</hi> Becauſe the Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> hath given power to impriſon untill he ſhall be delivered by the Preſident and the Cenſors, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57185:105"/>
their Succeſſors, reaſon requireth that the ſame be taken ſtrictly, for the liberty of the Subject (as they pretend) is at their pleaſure: And the ſame is proved by a Iudgment in Parliament in this Caſe; For when this Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> had given power to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to impriſon, yet it was taken ſo literally, that the Gaoler was not bound to receive them which they committed to him, and the reaſon thereof was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had authority to do it without any Court: And thereupon the Statute of <hi>1 Mar. cap. 9.</hi> was made, that the Gaoler ſhould receive them upon a pain, and none can be committed to any priſon, if the Gaoler cannot receive him: but the firſt Act for the cauſe aforeſaid was taken ſo literally, that no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary incident was implyed. And where it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that this very Act of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> hath enlarged the power of the Cenſors, and that upon the word of the Act; It was clearly reſolved that the ſaid Act of <hi>1 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae</hi> did not enlarge the power of the Cenſors to fine or impriſon any perſon for any cauſe for which he ought not to be fined and impriſoned by the ſaid Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> For the words of the Act of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> are according to the tenor and meaning of the ſaid Act: <q>Alſo ſhall ſend or commit any Offender or Offenders for his or their offence or diſobedience, contrary to any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or clauſe contained in the ſaid Grant or Act, to any Ward, Gaol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> But in this Caſe <hi>Bonham</hi> hath not done any thing which appeareth within this Record, contrary to any Article or clauſe contained within the Grant or Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> Alſo the Gaoler who refuſeth ſhall forfeit the double value of the fines and amerciaments that any offender or diſobedient ſhall be aſſeſſed to pay; which proveth that none ſhall be received by any Gaoler by force of the Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:57185:105"/>
but he who may be lawfully fined or amerced by the Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> and for that was not <hi>Bonham,</hi> as by the reaſons and cauſes aforeſaid it appeareth. And admit that the replication be not material, and the Defendants have demurred upon it; yet foraſmuch as the Defendants have confeſſed in the Bar, that they have impriſoned the Plaintiff without cauſe, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhall have Iudgment. And the difference is, when the Plaintiff doth reply, and by his replication it appeareth that he hath no cauſe of action, there he ſhall never have judgment: But when the Bar is inſufficient in matter, or amounteth (as this Caſe is) to a confeſſion of the point of the action, and the Plaintiff replyeth and ſheweth the truth of the matter to enforce his Caſe, and in Iudgment of Law it is not material; yet the Plaintiff ſhall have Iudgment; for it is true that ſometimes the Count ſhall be made good by the Bar, and ſometimes the Bar by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſometimes the Replication by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the difference is when the Count wantethtime, place or other circumſtance, it may be made good by the Bar, ſo of the Bar, Replication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as appeareth in <hi>18 E. 4. 16. b.</hi> But when the Count wanteth ſubſtance, no Bar can make it good; ſo of the Bar, Replication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therewith agrée <hi>6 E. 4. 2.</hi> a good caſe, and mark there the words of <hi>Choke, vid. 18 E. 3. 34. b. 44 E. 3. 7. a. 12 E. 4. 6. 6 H. 7. 10. 7 H. 7. 3. 11 H. 4. 24. &amp;c.</hi> But when the Plaintiff makes a Replication, Sur-rejoynder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby it appeareth, that upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Record the Plaintiff hath no cauſe of action, he ſhall never have Iudgment, although that the Bar or remainder be inſufficient in matter, for the Court ought to judge upon the whole Record, and every

one ſhall be intended to make the beſt of his own caſe. <hi>Vid. Rigeways</hi> caſe in the <hi>3.</hi> part of my Reports <hi>52.</hi> And ſo theſe differences were reſolved and adjudged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen <hi>Kendall</hi> and <hi>Heyer, Mich. 25 &amp; 26 Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench. And <hi>Mich. 29 &amp; 30 Eliz.</hi> in the ſame Court betwéen <hi>Gallys</hi> and <hi>Burbry.</hi> And <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Iuſtice in the concluſion of his argument did obſerve <hi>7</hi> things for the better direction of the Preſident and Commonalty of the ſaid Colledge in time to come. <hi>1.</hi> That none can be puniſhed for practiſing of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in <hi>London,</hi> but by forfeiture of <hi>5 li.</hi> by the month, which is to be recovered by the Law. <hi>2.</hi> If any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Phyſick there for a leſs time than a month, that he ſhall forfeit nothing. <hi>3.</hi> If any perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Statute offend in <hi>non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> they may puniſh him according to the Statute within the month. <hi>4.</hi> Thoſe who may commit to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the Statute, ought to commit preſently. <hi>5.</hi> The fines which they ſet, according to the Statute, belong to the King. <hi>6.</hi> They cannot impoſe a fine or impriſon without a Record of it. <hi>7.</hi> The cauſe for which they impoſe fine and impriſonment ought to becertain, for the ſame is traverſable; For although they have the Letters Patents and an Act of Parliament; yet becauſe the party grieved hath not other remedy, neither by Writ of Error or otherwiſe, and they are not made Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor a Court given to them, but have an authority onely ſo to doe, the cauſe of their commitment is traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in an action of falſe impriſonment brought againſt them; as upon the Statute of Bankrupts, their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is under the great Seal, and by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet becauſe the party grieved hath no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, if the Commiſſioners do not purſue the Act and their Commiſſion, he ſhall traverſe, That he was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57185:106"/>
not a Bankrupt, although the Commiſſioners affirm him to be one; as this Term it was reſolved in this Court in Treſpaſs betwéen <hi>Cutt</hi> and <hi>Delabarre,</hi> where the iſſue was, Whether <hi>William Piercy</hi> was bankrupt or not, who was found by the Commiſſioners to be a bankrupt: <hi>à fortiori,</hi> in the Caſe at Bar, the cauſe of the impriſonment is traverſable; for otherwiſe the party grieved may be perpetually without juſt cauſe impriſoned by them: But the Record of a force made by one Iuſtice of Peace is not traverſable, becauſe he doth the ſame as Iudge, by the Statutes of <hi>15 R. 2.</hi> and <hi>8 H. 6.</hi> and ſo there is a difference when one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Record as a Iudge, and when he doth a thing by a ſpecial authority, as they did in the Caſe at Bar, and not as a Iudge. And afterwards for the ſaid two laſt points Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, <hi>nullo contradicente.</hi> And I acquainted Sir <hi>Thomas Fleming</hi> Chief Iuſtice of the Kings Bench with this Iudgment, and with the reaſons and cauſes thereof, who appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Iudgment which we had given: And the ſame is the firſt judgment upon the ſaid Branch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning fine and impriſonment which hath béen given ſince the making of the ſaid Charter and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and therefore I thought it worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and publiſhed.</p>

Phyſick which practiſed in <hi>London</hi> without their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and for the non-payment of it, brought an action of debt, and adjudged that it lay well; and that the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> extends as well to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates as to others, for it is general, and Graduates are not excepted in the Statute, nor in the Letters Patents, and all the miſchiefs intended to be redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this, are not expreſſed in that; and the Statute ſhall not be intended to puniſh Impoſtors onely, but all other which practiſe without examination and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. For two things are neceſſary to Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that is, learning and experience; and upon that there is a Proverb, <hi>Experto crede Roberto.</hi> And the Statute intends, that none ſhall practiſe here but thoſe which are moſt learned, and expert more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. And for that the Statute provides, that none ſhall practiſe here without allowance and examination by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> and four learned Doctors; But in other places the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is referred onely to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs; The reaſon of the difference is, for that <hi>London</hi> is the heart of the Kingdom, And here the King and his Court, the Magiſtrates and Iudges of the Law, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are reſident. And with this agrées the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other well-governed Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> and other Nations, as it appears by the preamble of the ſaid Letters Patents. And it appears by the Statute, that this was not intended to extend to Impoſtors onely, for that the word Impoſtor is not mentioned in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: And the Statute provides, that they ſhall be puniſhed as well for doing and uſing, as for ill uſing: And alſo it is provided by the Statute of <hi>1. Mary 1</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Chap. <hi>9.</hi> That the Gardians, Gaolers, or Kéepers of the Wards, Gaols and Priſons within the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57185:108"/>
City and Precinct of it, ſhall receive into their Priſons all ſuch perſon and perſons ſo offending, which are ſent or committed to them, and thoſe ſafely ſhall kéep without Bail, till the party ſo committed ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the ſaid Preſident, or other perſon by the ſaid College to that authoriſed; By which it appears, that the Gaolers and Kéepers of Priſons have power to retain ſuch which are committed: That then the Preſident ſhall have power to commit; for things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied are as ſtrong as things expreſſed; as it appears by the <hi>Com. Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgans</hi> Caſe: And alſo in the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe, where it is agréed, that Ioynture before Coverture cannot be waved; and this is implied within the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> And ſo the Statute of <hi>2 E. 6.</hi> provides that after ſeven years Tithes ſhall be paid, by which it is collected by Implication, that during ſeven years Tithes ſhall not be paid; And ſo he prayed Iudgment for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dodridge,</hi> Serjeant of the King, for the Plaintiff ſaid, That the Statute of <hi>24 H. 8. Chap. 5.</hi> and the Letters Patents give power to four Cenſors to puniſh for ill executing, doing and uſing the faculty of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; and the Plaintiff was not charged for ill exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of it, doing or uſing: But it is averred, Where <hi>revera</hi> the Plaintiff was nothing ſufficient to exerciſe the ſaid Art, and being examined, leſs apt to anſwer, thereupon they forbad him, and being ſent for and not appearing, he was amerced five pound, and order that he ſhould be arreſted; and being arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon his appearance being examined if he would ſubmit himſelf to the ſaid Colledge, he anſwered and confeſſed that he had practiſed within the ſaid City, being a Doctor of Phyſick as aforeſaid, as well to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57185:109"/>
him it was lawfull, and that he would practiſe here again, for which he was committed to Priſon: ſo that he was amerced for his contempt in the uſing of the ſaid Art, and committed to Priſon for his anſwer upon his examination: And he conceived that there are two queſtions conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if the College may reſtrain a Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of his Practice in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, admitting that they may, then if theſe are the cauſes for which they may commit by their Letters Patents. The firſt reaſon is drawn from the Letters Patents, and the ſaid Statutes, in which he ſaid, that the intent of the King was the end of his work: And this intent ſhall be expounded for thrée Reaſons apparent in the words contained in the Grant.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Tempeſtivè improborum Conatibus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Improborum hominum, qui Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam magis avaritiae ſuae cauſâ, quàm ullius bonae conſcientiae fiduciâ profitebuntur, audaciam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſcere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, which would invite learned men to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe here, <hi>Collegium perpetuum doctorum &amp; gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um virorum qui Medicinam in Urbe noſtra Londino &amp; Suburbiis infra ſeptem millia paſſuum ab urbe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaverſus, publicè exerceant, inſtitui volumus &amp; imperamus.</hi> And further he ſaith, that there are thrée ſorts of men which meddle with the body of a man.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is the Learned man, which reads all books extant, and his knowledge is ſpeculative, and by that he knew the nature of all Simples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:57185:109"/>
The ſecond is Practick, the knowledge of which is onely his experience; he may give <hi>probatum eſt;</hi> but is ignorant of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and the nature of the things which he applies for the cure of it.</p>
                     <p>And the third is an Impoſtor, which takes upon him the knowledge which he hath not. And every of theſe the College may puniſh for <hi>Malè utendo, facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, vel exequendo,</hi> by which way they will. And this was not the firſt care which was had; for in the <hi>9 H. 5.</hi> was a private Act made for Phyſicians, by which there is great regard to them which are learned and educated in the Vniverſity; And for that the Act provides that they ſhall not be prejudicial to any of the Vniverſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> (and with this agrées <hi>3 H. 8. 11.)</hi> and the priviledge of them. And the <hi>Docti &amp; graves homines,</hi> mentioned in the Letters Patents, are the learned men mentioned in the Act; for the Statute provides, that they ſhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh according to theſe Statutes, and late Edicts. And by the former Laws, the Vniverſities and their priviledges were excepted, and by their former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Letters Patents ought to be directed, for it is referred to them. Alſo the Statutes of this Realm have always had great reſpect to the Graduates of the Vniverſities, and it is not without cauſe, for <hi>ſudavit &amp; alſit,</hi> and hath no other reward but this Degrée, which is Doctor. And for that the Statute of <hi>21 H. 8.</hi> prefers Graduates, and provides that Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, or Batchelors ſhall be capable of two Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with Cure without diſpenſation: And ſo <hi>13 Eliz.</hi> provides that none ſhall be preſented to a Benefice above the value of thirty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> if he be not a Doctor or Batchelor of Divinity. And to the objection that none ſhall practiſe in <hi>London</hi> or ſeven miles circuit
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57185:110"/>
of it without licence, that this clauſe ſhall be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the matter, and to that he agréed; for the other branches of the Statute are made to cheriſh grave and learned men, and therefore it ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that this branch was made for the puniſhment of thoſe, but of others which the Statute intended to puniſh.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond Objection, that every Doctor is not the learned and grave man intended within the Statute, for the knowledge of many of them is onely ſpeculative without practice; to that he anſwered, That all their ſtudy is practice, and that if they have no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of themſelves, then they attend upon others which practiſe, and apply themſelves to know the nature of Simples.</p>
                     <p>And to the third Objection, that in <hi>London</hi> ought to be choice men, for the Statute appoints that they ſhall be examined by the Biſhop and Dean, and four others at leaſt; and for that there is a more ſtrict courſe for them, than in other places; to that it is agréed. But he ſaid, that in the Vniverſity there is a more ſtrict courſe than this; for here he ought to be publickly approved by many after he hath béen exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and anſwered in the Schools to divers queſtions, and allowed by the Congregation houſe: And <hi>35 H. 6. 55.</hi> Doctor is no addition, but a Degrée, <hi>(quia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datim &amp; progreſſione Doctrinae provenit)</hi> to that, and that Doctor is Teacher, and that he was firſt taught by others as a Scholar, and afterwards he is Maſter; and <hi>Doctor dicitur à docendo, quia docere permittitur,</hi> and they are called Maſters of their faculty; and that the original of Doctor came of the Synagogue of Iews, where there were Doctors of Law; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they had their Ceremonies in the time of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57185:110"/>
                        <hi>H. 1.</hi> And when a man brings with him the Enſign of doctrine, there is no reaſon that he ſhould be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined again, for then if they will not allow of him, he ſhall not be allowed, though he be a learned and grave man; and it was not the intent of the King to make a Monopoly of this practice.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond point that he propounded, it ſéems that the juſtification is not good; which is, <hi>Quia non comparuit</hi> upon ſummons, he was amereed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that he ſhould be arreſted; and being arreſted, and examined if he would ſubmit himſelf to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, he anſwered that he was a Doctor, and had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed and would practiſe within the ſaid City, as he conceived he might lawfully do; and for that ſhewing of this Caſe he was committed to priſon. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two things upon the Charter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that it doth not inhibit a Doctor to practiſe, but puniſheth him for ill uſing, exerciſing, and making; and ſecondly, that it impowers to impriſon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick and Impoſtor; And ſo prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>And after in <hi>Hilary</hi> Term in the ſame year this Caſe was argued by all the Iuſtices of the Common Bench two ſeveral days. The firſt day it was argued by <hi>Foſter, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Warburton</hi> Iuſtices, at whoſe arguments I was not preſent, but <hi>Foſter</hi> argued againſt the Plaintiff, and <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Warburton</hi> with him, that the action of falſe impriſonment was well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. And the ſecond day the ſame Caſe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued again by <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Iuſtice, and <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Iuſtice; and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> argued as followeth; that is, That the Statute of <hi>3 H. 8.</hi> was in the negative, that no perſon within the City of <hi>London</hi> or ſeven miles thereof, take upon him to exerciſe or occupy as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57185:111"/>
or Chirurgeon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he doth not know in any Caſe where the words of the Statute are nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that they admit any interpretation againſt that, but one onely, and that is the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge Chap. 4.</hi> which provides that no Lord ſhall diſtrain in one County, and the beaſt diſtrained drive into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther County. In which caſe though the words are negative, yet if the Lord diſtrain in one County, he may drive the beaſts to his Mannor in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which the lands, in which the diſtreſs was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were held. But it is equity and reaſon in this Caſe, that the Statute ſhould admit ſuch exception; for it is not of Malice, but that the beaſts may remain within his fée. But in the principal Caſe there is not the like reaſon nor equity. And alſo the King <hi>H. 8.</hi> in his Letters Patents recites as followeth, that is, <hi>Cùm regii officii noſtri munus arbitremur, ditionis noſtrae hominum felicitati omni ratione conſulere, id autem vel imprimis fore, ſi improborum conatibus tempeſtivè occurramus, apprimè neceſſarium duximus improborum quoque hominum, qui Medicinam magis avaritiae ſuae cauſâ quàm ullius bonae conſcientiae fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciâ profitebuntur, &amp;c.</hi> By which it appears, that it is the office of a King to ſurvey his Subjects, and he is as a Phyſician to cure their maladies, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Leproſies amongſt them, and alſo to remove all fumes and ſmells, which may offend or be prejudicial to their health, as it appears by the ſeveral Writs in theſe ſeveral Caſes provided. And ſo if a man be not right in his Wits, the King is to have the protection and Government of him, leſt he being infirm, waſte or conſume his Lands or Goods. And it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him that his Subjects live, but that they ſhould live happily, and he diſcharges not his office,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57185:111"/>
if his Subjects live a life, but if they live and flouriſh; and he hath cure as well of their bodies as of their lands and goods; for health for the body is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as virtue to the mind. And the King <hi>H. 8.</hi> to expreſs his extraordinary care of his Subjects made the ſaid Act in the third year of his Reign, which was the beginning of his Eſſence, to that purpoſe. And by the Common Law, any Phyſician which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Vniverſity, might practiſe and exerciſe the ſaid faculty within any place within <hi>England,</hi> without any diſpenſation, examination, or approbation of any: but after the making of the ſaid Act made in the third year of King <hi>H. 8.</hi> none may practiſe, exerciſe or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy as Phyſician or Surgeon within the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and ſeven miles thereof, if he be not firſt exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, approved and admitted by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> for the time being, calling to them four Doctors of Phyſick or Chirurgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that no practiſer may occupy or exerciſe the ſaid faculty out of the ſaid Precincts, if he be not firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, approved and admitted by the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, or in his abſence, by his Vicar General, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them calling unto him ſuch expert perſons in the ſaid faculty, as their diſcretions think convenient. And the reaſon of this difference, as he conceived was for that in this City and the ſaid Precincts, the King and all his Councill, and all the Iudges and Sages of the Law, and divers other men of quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition live and continue, and alſo the place is more ſubject to infection, and the air more peſtiferous; and therefore there is more neceſſity, that greater care, diligence, and examination be made of thoſe which practiſed here in <hi>London</hi> and the Precincts aforeſaid, than of thoſe that practiſe in other places of the Realm;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57185:112"/>
for in other places the people have better air, and uſe more exerciſe, and are not ſo ſubject to infection; and therefore there is no cauſe that ſuch care ſhould be uſed for them, for they are not in ſuch danger. And in the Statute there is not any exception of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities nor of thoſe which are Graduates there, and therefore they ſhall be tried by the ſaid Act; and the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8. Chap. 5.</hi> onely excepts thoſe which are Graduats of <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi> which have accompliſhed all things for their form without any Grace; and if this exception ſhall be intended to extend to others, then all the Vniverſities ſhall be excepted by it, and ſuch exception was too general. And over he ſaid, that the Plaintiff gave abſurd and contemptuous anſwer, when he being cited before them ſaid, that he would not be ruled nor directed by them (being ſuch grave and learned men) And for that he hath practiſed againſt the Statute, he was worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed and committed; for it ſhould be a vain Law, if it did not provide puniſhment for them that offend againſt it. And <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nihil eſt habere Leges, ſi non ſit unus qui poteſt Leges tueri;</hi> and for this here are four grave and diſcréet men to defend and maintain the Law, and to puniſh all Offenders againſt it, according to the Statute, by impriſonment of their bodies and other reaſonable ways; and the ſaid four men have the ſearch as well of thoſe men, as of other Medicines. And the Statute of <hi>1 Mary</hi> provides that the Kéepers of Priſons ſhall receive all which are committed by the ſaid four learned and grave men. And though there be great care committed to them by the ſaid Statute, and the ſaid Letters Patents, yet there is a greater truſt repoſed in them than this; for we commit to them our lives, when
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57185:112"/>
we receive Phyſick of them; and that not without cauſe, for they are men of gravity, learning and diſcretion; and for that they have power to make Laws, which is the office of the Parliament; for thoſe which are ſo learned may be truſted with any thing; and for the better making of theſe they have power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all the Commons of their Corporation, and the King allows of that by his Letters Patents, for it is made by a congregation of wiſe, learned and diſcréet men; and the Statute of <hi>1 Mary</hi> inflicts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon contempts, and not for any other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; And they hold a Court, and ſo may commit, as every other Court may, for a contempt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right, without Act of Parliament or Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other legal form of Procéeding thereupon; as it appears by <hi>7 H. 6.</hi> for a contempt committed in a Léet, the Steward committed the offender to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and it was abſurd to conceive that the Statute will allow of Commitment without cauſe. And it is a marvellous thing that when good Laws ſhall be made for our health and wealth alſo, yet we will ſo pinch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that we will not be tryed by men of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, practice and learning, but by the Vniverſity, where a man may have his Degrée by grace without merit. And ſo for theſe reaſons he concluded that this action is not maintainable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Iuſtice ſaid, That the Cauſe which was pleaded why the Plaintiff was committed, was, for that he had exerciſed Phyſick within the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by the ſpace of a month, and did not very fitly anſwer, for which it was ordained by the Cenſors that he ſhould pay a hundred ſhillings, and that he ſhould forbear his practice, and that he did not forbear; and then being warned of that, and upon that being
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57185:113"/>
ſummoned to appear, did not appear; and for that it was ordained that he ſhould be arreſted; and that after he was ſummoned again, and then he appeared, and denied to pay the hundred ſhillings, and ſaid, that he would practiſe, for he was a Doctor of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi> and upon that it was ordained that he ſhould be committed, till he ſhould be delivered by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the College; and upon this was the Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer joyned. And in pleading the Plaintiff ſaid, that he was a Doctor of Philoſophy and Phyſick; upon which the Lord Chief Iuſtice took occaſion to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a ſaying of <hi>Galen,</hi> that is, <hi>Ubi Philoſophia deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, ibi Medicina incipit,</hi> and he ſaid the onely queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Caſe depends not upon the payment of the ſaid hundred ſhillings, but upon the words of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of the King, and the ſaid two Statutes, the words of which are, <hi>Conceſſimus eidem Praeſidenti, &amp;c. Quòd nemo in dicta Civitate, aut per ſeptem mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaria in circuitu ejuſdem exerceat dictam facultatem, niſi ad hoc per dictum Praeſidentem &amp; communitatem ſeu Succeſſores eorum qui pro tempore fuerint admiſſus ſit, per ejuſdem Praeſidentis &amp; Collegii literas ſigillo ſuo communi ſigillatas, ſub poena centum ſolidorum pro quolibet menſe, quo, non admiſſus, eandem facultatem exercuerit, dimidium inde nobis, &amp; haeredibus noſtris, &amp; dimidium dicto Praeſidenti &amp; Collegio applicandum.

                     <p>The firſt, if any exerciſe the ſaid faculty by the ſpace of a month without admiſſion by the Preſident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall forfeit a hundred ſhillings for every month; be that good or ill, it is not material, the time is here onely material; for if he exerciſe it for ſuch a time, he ſhall forfeit as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Clauſe is, that the Preſident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall have <hi>Scrutinium Medicorum, &amp;c. &amp; punitionem eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pro delictis ſuis in non bene faciendo, utendo &amp; exequendo, &amp;c.</hi> And for that the Preſident and the College may commit any delinquent to Priſon: And this he concluded upon the words of the Statute; and he agreed with <hi>Walmeſly,</hi> that the King hath had extraordinary care of the health of his Subjects; <hi>Et Rex cenſetur habere omnes Artes in ſcrinio Pectoris,</hi> and he hath here purſued the courſe of the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that is, <hi>Removens &amp; promovens, removens</hi>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:57185:114"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>And it is an old Rule, that a man ought to take care, that he do not commit his Soul to a young Divine, his body to a young Phyſician, and his goods or other eſtate to a young Lawyer, for <hi>In Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene Theologo eſt Conſcientiae detrimentum, in Juvene Legiſlatore burſi decrementum, &amp; in Juvene Medico Coemeterii incrementum;</hi> for in theſe cannot be the privity, diſcretion, and profound learning which is in the aged: And he denied that the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians is to be compared to the Vniverſity, for it is ſubordinate to that, <hi>Cantabrigia eſt Academia noſtra nobiliſſima, totius Regni oculus &amp; ſol, ubi humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; doctrina ſimul ſluunt:</hi> But he ſaid, when he names <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he doth not exclude <hi>Oxford,</hi> but placeth them in equal rank: But he would always name <hi>Cambridge</hi> firſt, for that was his mother: And he ſaith, that there is not any time, <hi>pro non bene faciendo, utendo &amp; exequendo,</hi> for this <hi>non ſuſcipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> for ſo a man may grievouſly offend in one day, and therefore in ſuch a Caſe, his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be by Fines, Amerciaments, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Bodies and other ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if they practiſe well, though it be an offence againſt the Letters Patents and the Statute, yet the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be but pecuniary, and he ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; for if he offend the body of a man, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that his body ſhall be puniſhed, for <hi>Eodem modo quo quis delinquit, eodem punietur;</hi> but if a grave
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57185:114"/>
and learned Doctor or other, come and practiſe well in <hi>London</hi> by the ſpace of thrée wéeks and then departs, he is not puniſhable by the ſaid College, though it be without admiſſion, for peradventure ſuch a one is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the nature and diſpoſition of my body, and for that more fit to cure any Malady in that than another which is admitted by the College; and he ſaid, that it was abſurd to puniſh ſuch a one, for he may practiſe in ſuch manner in deſpite of the College; for all the Lords and Nobles of the Realm, which have their private Phyſicians, which have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their bodies, repair to this City, and to exclude thoſe of uſing their advice, were a hard and abſurd expoſition, for the old verſe is, <hi>Corporis auxilium Medico committe ſodali:</hi> And alſo he ſaid, that the ſaid Preſident and College cannot commit any Phyſician which exerciſeth the ſaid faculty without admiſſion for the ſpace of a Month, nor bring their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before themſelves, nor levy that by any other way or means; But ought to have their action, or exhibite an Information upon the Statute, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Book of Entries; for they ought to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their power which is given to them by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for otherwiſe the penalty being given, the one Moiety to them, and the other to the King, they ſhall be Iudges <hi>in propria cauſa,</hi> and ſhall be Summoners, Sheriffs, Iudges and parties alſo; which is abſurd. For if the King grant to one by his Letters Patents under the great Seal, that he may hold Plea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be a party, and if the King doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point another Iudge than the Grantée which is Party, the Grant is void, though it be confirmed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as it appears by <hi>8 H. 6. 44 Ed. 3.</hi> The Abbot of <hi>Reading</hi>'s Caſe; for it is ſaid by <hi>Herle</hi> in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57185:115"/>
                        <hi>8 Ed. 3. 30. Tregor</hi>'s Caſe, that if any Statutes are made againſt Law and Right, they are null; and ſo are theſe, which make any man Iudge in his own Cauſe; and ſo in <hi>27 H. 6. Fitz.</hi> Annuity <hi>41.</hi> that the Statute of <hi>Carliſle</hi> will, that the Order of Ciſtertians and Auguſtines, which have Covent and Common Seal, that the Common Seal ſhall be in kéeping of the Prior, which is under the Abbot, and four others which are the moſt Sages of the houſe, and that any Déed ſealed with the Common Seal which is not ſo in kéeping ſhall be void; and the opinion of the Court was, that this is a void Statute, for it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to be obſerved, ſeeing when the Seal is in their kéeping, the Abbot cannot Seal any thing with it, and when it is in the hands of the Abbot, it is out of their kéeping, <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> And if the Statute ſhall be obſerved, every Common ſeal ſhall be defeated by one ſimple ſurmiſe, which cannot be tried: and for that, the Statute was adjudged void and repugnant. And ſo the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> which gives <hi>Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> after the Ceſſer by two years to be brought by the Leſſor himſelf, was a good and equitable Statute: But the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter 2.</hi> Chap. <hi>3.</hi> which gives <hi>Ceſſavit</hi> to the Heir for Ceſſer in time of his Anceſtor, was judged an unreaſonable Statute in <hi>33 Ed. 3.</hi> for that the Heir cannot have the Arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges due in the time of his father, according to the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and for that it ſhall be void. And alſo the Phyſicians of the College could not puniſh any by Fine, and alſo by Impriſonment; for no man ought to be twice puniſhed for one offence. And the Statute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> doth not give any power to them to commit for any offence which was no offence within the firſt Statutes, and therefore he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57185:115"/>
ought not to be committed by the ſaid Statute of <hi>1 Mariae:</hi> But admitting that they may commit, yet they have miſtaken it; for they demand the whole hundred ſhillings, and one half of that belongs to the King: And alſo they ought to commit him forthwith, as well as Auditors which have authority by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to commit him that is found in Arrearages: But if they do not commit him forthwith, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commit him afterward, as it appears by <hi>27 H. 6. 9.</hi> So two Iuſtices of the Peace may view a force and make a Record of it, and commit the offenders to Priſon, but this ought to be in <hi>flagranti Oriente:</hi> And if he do not commit thoſe immediately upon the View, he cannot commit them afterwards. And the Phyſicians have no Court, but if they have, yet they ought to make a Record of their commitment, for ſo was every Court of Iuſtice to doe: But they have not made any Record of it. And Auditors and Iuſtices of Peace ought to make Records, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Book of Entries. So that admitting that they may commit, yet they ought to doe it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; But in this caſe they cannot commit till the party ſhall be delivered by them, for this is againſt Law and Iuſtice; and no Subject may do it, but till he be delivered by due courſe of Law; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment is not abſolute, but the cauſe of it is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable, and for that ought to Iuſtify for ſpecial cauſe. For if the Biſhop returns, that he refuſes a Clerk for that he is <hi>Schiſmaticus inveteratus,</hi> this is not good, but he ought to return the particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that the Court may adjudge of that: Though it be a matter of Divinity, and out of their ſcience, yet they by conference may be informed of it; and ſo of Phyſick. And they cannot make any
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57185:116"/>
new Laws, but ſuch onely which are for the better government of the old. And alſo he ſaid plainly, that it appears by the Statute of <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> That the former Statutes ſhall not be taken by Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for by theſe the Preſident and Commons have power to commit a delinquent to Priſon; and this ſhall be intended, if they ſhall be taken by Equity, that every Gaoler ought to receive him which is ſo committed: But when it is provided by <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> ſpecially, that every Gaoler ſhall receive ſuch Offenders; by this it appears, That the former Statute ſhall not be taken in Equity: And ſo he concluded, that Iudgment ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the Plaintiff, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

                     <p>THe Preſident of the College and Comminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faculty of Phyſick <hi>London</hi> brought debt againſt one <hi>George Butler:</hi> The Writ was, <hi>quòd reddat Domino Regi &amp; Praeſidenti Collegii ac Comminal' facultat' Medicor' London, Qui tam pro Domino Rege quàm pro ſeipſo ſequitur 60. li. quas eis debet.</hi> And the Declaration was in the name of the ſaid Preſident by the ſaid name, <hi>qui tam pro Domino Rege quàm pro ſeipſo ſequitur, &amp;c.</hi> which contained the Charter of <hi>H. 8.</hi> made <hi>Anno Regni ſui 10.</hi> and confirmed by Act of Parliament <hi>Anno Regni ſui 14.</hi> as it is contained in the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> and that the ſaid Defendant <hi>minimè ponderans</hi> the ſaid Statute or the Penalty thereof, exerciſed the faculty of Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> (although he was not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to do by the Preſident and the College or Comminalty of the faculty of Phyſick <hi>London)</hi> by the ſpace of <hi>12</hi> months before the ſaid Action brought, <hi>per quod actio accrevit eidem Domino Regi &amp; dicto Praeſidenti qui tam pro dicto Domino Rege quam pro ſeipſo ſequitur, &amp;c. ad exigend' &amp; habend'</hi> of the ſaid Defendant <hi>pro dicto Domino Rege &amp; eodem Praeſidente &amp; Colleg' praedict' 60 li. videlicet 5 li. pro quolibet menſe praedict' 12 Menſium praedict'.

The Defendant pleaded the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> whereby liberty is given to every one of the Kings Subjects that hath knowledge and experience of the nature of Herbs, Roots, Waters, or the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them by ſpeculation or practice, to exerciſe, apply and adminiſter to any external ulcer, wound, apoſtumation, outward tumor <hi>ſive morbo alicui alio</hi> any Herb, Ointment, Bath, Pulteſs or Plaſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the experience and ſcience of the ſaid diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or other Maladies <hi>eiſdem conſimil.</hi> or Potion <hi>pro calculo,</hi> Strangury, <hi>vel febr.</hi> without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, any Statute or other thing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And ſaith, that he was a Subject, and having experience and ſcience by ſpeculation and practice in the nature of Herbs, Roots and Waters, applied and miniſtred to divers of the Kings ſubjects Herbs, Ointment, Bath, Pulteſs, Plaſters and Potion to Vlcers, Diſeaſes, Maladies, Strangury and Ague, <hi>&amp; talibus aliis morbis illis conſimilibus, prout ei bene licuit.</hi> And to the reſidue pleaded Not guilty. The Plaintiff replied to the firſt Plea and pleaded the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> whereby the ſaid Charter and the ſaid Act of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> was confirmed in the whole. Whereupon the Defendant demurred and ſhewed for cauſe of Demurrer, that the Replication was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Declaration. And upon Argument in the Common Pleas Iudgment was given by the opinion of all the Iudges for the Plaintiff: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Error was brought in the Kings Bench. Two Errors were aſſigned; the one was the departure, the ſecond was, becauſe that the Writ was in the name of the King and the Preſident, and the Declaration was in the name of the Informer alſo. And after ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at the Bar by Council on both ſides, the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57185:117"/>
Iudges delivered their opinions. The Chief Iuſtice began, and then <hi>Jones, Whitlock</hi> and <hi>Crook.</hi> They all ſaid, that Iudgment ought to be affirmed. Firſt, they agréed, that the Writ and Declaration were good: and although ſome Precedents be, that upon a penal Law the Writ be to anſwer the Informer <hi>qui tam pro ſeipſo quàm pro Domino Rege ſequitur;</hi> Yet they thought that the moſt proper and better way of a Writ was to anſwer the King and Informer; for the debt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them by moieties; therefore it is not ſo proper to demand all for the Informer, and yet to have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral judgment for the King and the Informer for the moieties: and ſo is <hi>Partridge</hi> and <hi>Crokers</hi> caſe in the <hi>Comment.</hi> But when it is by information, there it ſhall be that the Informer informs for the King and himſelf. Another exception was taken to the Writ, becauſe it is in the name of the Preſident and not of the College alſo; And alſo it was contrary in the end of the Declaration, where it is ſaid <hi>unde actio accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> to the ſaid King and Preſident for to have <hi>60 li.</hi> of the Defendant: For the King one Moiety, and for the Preſident and College the other Moiety. But it was adjudged by the Court, that notwithſtanding it was good; for Firſt, although the Incorporation was by the name of Preſident and College, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſuite is by the Charter given to the Preſident, and there may be a Corporation by one name, to purchaſe lands and otherwiſe, yet it ſhall ſue by another name. <hi>11 E. 1.</hi> a Corporation was by the name of Maſter, Wardens, Brothers and Siſters of <hi>Rouncevill,</hi> and by the ſaid Patent it is ſaid they ſhould ſue by the name of Maſter and Wardens of <hi>Rouncevill. 2.</hi> Although that the Action is given by way of ſuite to the Preſident onely, yet the Recovery and money
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57185:118"/>
recovered ſhall be to the Preſident and College; therefore the Concluſion for to have the money to the Preſident and College was held good. The <hi>3.</hi> point was reſolved, that the Plea in Bar was not good; for the liberty given is disjunctive for outward medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to uſe Plaſters, Oyntment, Bathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for <hi>3</hi> diſeaſes (to wit) the Stone, Strangury and Agues onely; yet they jumble all together, that he miniſtred the Ointments and Potions to all the ſaid Maladies, which cannot be, for he may not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a Potion unleſs to the ſaid <hi>3</hi> diſeaſes and no other. <hi>4.</hi> It was reſolved that it was not any depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the Replication was ſubſequent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the Declaration. But for the main matter they ſaid nothing (to wit) whether the Statute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> took away the force of the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> for they gave their Iudgment upon the Bar by reaſon it was naught; Onely <hi>Crook</hi> ſpake to this point, and it ſéemed to him that the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed or avoided by <hi>1 Mariae.</hi>

And upon this it was demurred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a departure; for it intitles him by another Act, <hi>viz.</hi> the Statute of <hi>primo Mariae,</hi> which is not mentioned in the Count: and therefore 'twas aſſigned for Error. But all the Court here conceived, That
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57185:119"/>
it is no departure, becauſe it fortifies the Count, and is as to revive the Statute of <hi>decimo quarto Henrici octavi,</hi> if it were repealed in this particular by the Statute of <hi>triceſimo quarto Henrici octavi:</hi> And for that the Caſe of <hi>Woodhead</hi> was ſhewn to the Court, <hi>Mich. 42 &amp; 43 Eliz. rot. 397.</hi> where the Preſident of the College of <hi>All-Souls</hi> brings an action upon the Caſe for taking Toll in—, and ſhews a Charter of <hi>viceſimo ſexto Henrici ſexti</hi> to be diſcharged of Toll; The Defendant pleaded the Act of Reſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Liberties granted by <hi>Henry the ſixth,</hi> made—, and ſo the liberty gone.

The third and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Error aſſigned was, if the Statute of <hi>triceſimo quarto Henrici octavi</hi> be not repealed by the Statute of <hi>primo Mariae;</hi> and if not, Whether the Defendant hath made a ſufficient Iuſtification?

not deliver their opinions. But admitting, the Statute of <hi>triceſimo quarto Henrici octavi</hi> be in force, yet they all reſolved, the Defendants Plea was naught, and not warranted by the Statute; For he pleads, That he applied and miniſtred Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Plaſters, Drinks, <hi>Ulceribus, Morbis, &amp; Maladiis, Calculo, Strangurio, Febribus, &amp; aliis in Statuto mentionatis;</hi> ſo he leaves out the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal word in the Statute <hi>(Externis)</hi> and doth not refer and ſhew, That he miniſtred Potions for the Stone, Strangullion, or Ague, as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute appoints, to theſe thrée Diſeaſes onely, and to no other. And by his Plea his Potions may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to any other ſickneſs: Wherefore they all held his Plea was naught for this cauſe, and that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was well given againſt him; Whereupon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was affirmed.</p>

                        <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> with every Article and Clauſe therein ſhall ſtand and continue ſtill in full ſtrength, force and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Any Act, Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to the contrary notwithſtanding. And upon this the Defendant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred, and aſſigned for Cauſe, that the Replication was a departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henden</hi> for the Defendant, and he argued <hi>3</hi> points. Firſt, that the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> ſtands good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Statute of <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> and is not taken away thereby, but is ſtill in as good force as if the Statute <hi>1 Mariae</hi> had never béen made. By the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> it is plain, that it was but a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> for it approves and ratifies the ſame, and then the <hi>34</hi> is not touched thereby. And he cited the Counteſs of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> A man is attainted of Treaſon, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Parliament; this Confirmation does not repeal any thing done after the Attainder. <hi>2.</hi> This Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> doth not extend to the practice <note place="margin">Stat. 14 H. 8. cap. 5. Stat. 34 H. 8. cap. 8. Stat. 3 H. 8. cap. 11. 1 Mariae c. 9.</note> of Phyſick limited by the <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> But this is left at large out of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> which he proves firſt upon the reaſon and ground upon which the <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> was made, and this was not to meddle with the <hi>14 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> but to repeal <hi>3 H. 8. cap. 11.</hi> which Statute provides generally for the practice of Phyſick and Surgery; for any part of Surgery may attend upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and that none may practiſe there without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> calling to him <hi>4</hi> Doctors. Now the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> repeals this in three main points as to the practice of Phyſick, but doth not meddle with Surgery or external applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then follows the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a form to them, to which the <hi>14</hi> doth not extend, <hi>to wit,</hi> by outward applications. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57185:121"/>
the Statute of <hi>34</hi> recites the Stat. of <hi>3 H. 8.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by power was given as aforeſaid, and repeals it; <note place="margin">Stat. 34 H. 8. Stat. 3 H. 8.</note> then if the Statute <hi>34</hi> intended that this was within <hi>14,</hi> it might have repealed this as well as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>3.</hi> But becauſe that Surgery was clearly out of the Statute of <hi>14.</hi> it repeals the <hi>3 H. 8.</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>14. 3.</hi> The miſchief repealed by the <hi>34.</hi> for what end was it made? It repeals no misdemeanors of Phyſick, but of Surgeons which out of Covetouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reſtrain all perſons which may apply outward Medicines, and ſo abuſe the privilege given to them: ſo that <hi>34.</hi> ſaith, that every perſon may apply outward Medicines, ſuch as require not an Apothecary, as for the Stone, Strangury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the <hi>14</hi> extends to Phyſick made by Apothecaries. <hi>4.</hi> If this were within the <hi>14.</hi> there is a branch within <hi>34</hi> that repeals <hi>14.</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Any other Act to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi> But he conceived the <hi>14.</hi> doth not extend to the Statute of <hi>3.</hi> becauſe it repeals this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <note place="margin">Stat. 3 H. 8.</note> and for ſuretiſhip ſake all others.</p>
                     <p>

Caſe, and that is, that the King ought to have Moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the forfeiture, and therefore it ought to be where the King's Attorney may better attend. <hi>2.</hi> This is not an Action popular, but given onely to the College, <note place="margin">Action popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.

But before he came to matter in Law, he took exceptions to the Barr; for if it was inſufficient and no Barr to the Declaration, then if it were admitted that the Replication is bad, yet the declaration being good, the Plaintiff ſhall have Iudgment thereupon. <hi>Butler</hi> pleaded <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> to enable him to practiſe, but when he declares what manner of practice he uſed, he hath excéeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of this Statute by his own Confeſſion, and ſheweth ſuch practice as is within the <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> The words of the <hi>34</hi> be, <hi>That he may miniſter to any outward Sore or Swelling or any the like, &amp;c. and that he may give drinks for the Stone, Strangury and Agues. Butler</hi> ſhewed that he had experience in Herbs, and that he gave Oyntments, Plaſters, Poulteſſes and Potions to Sores, Maladies, the <note place="margin">Surgery. Stat. 34 H. 8. c. 8.

But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he gave them not onely in thoſe <hi>3</hi> Caſes, but in others, and the party was afflicted with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sores. Stone, Strangury and Agues were common known diſeaſes; But others, as outward Sores, may be with inward diſtempers more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, wherewith he ought not to meddle. And he ought to have pleaded in another manner alſo, for he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57185:123"/>
ſaith, Diſeaſes, Fevers, <hi>and ſuch like,</hi> and the words <hi>ſuch like</hi> ought to refer to outward Sores, not to other diſeaſes. And he ſheweth that he gave Potions, and this ought to have béen with an <hi>Anglicè drinks;</hi> as with <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Century Poſſett.</hi> But the Statute doth not allow Potions. Alſo the word is <hi>Agues,</hi> and he ſaith <hi>Fevers,</hi> and there is a great difference betwéen Agues and Fevers; Agues have intermiſſion, Fevers none: and a Fever may ſo inféeble a man, that it is not fit that ſuch as <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> give him Phyſick: But he ought to have ſaid <hi>Febribus Anglicè Agues.</hi> And then if the Plaintiff hath made a good declaration and the Defendant an inſufficient barr, if the Plaintiff upon his replication deſtroy his declaration, he ſhall not have Iudgment. But if the barr be inſufficient and the replication onely vain and idle, he ſhall have Iudgment upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. <hi>8 Rep. Dr. Bonham's Caſe,</hi> the main point adjudged: And <hi>6 Rep. Francis Caſe,</hi> the difference is taken, where the replication was not well, and made bad as to matter in Law. It was ſaid <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> doth not meddle with the <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> And it is plain, that the <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> did not intend to meddle but with Surgeons; for it recites the miſchief of their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; and therefore it appeareth that it was not the meaning of the Statute to take any thing from the Phyſicians. But the purview of the Statute <hi>34.</hi> meddles with the <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> that was a cauſe of <hi>1 Mariae;</hi> for if credit may be given to Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> it gives liberty to every one that hath skill in Herbs to miniſter Potions. Outward applications appertain to Surgeons, but the giving of Potions appertain to Phyſicians; for Potions plainly be Phyſick; and then <hi>34.</hi> takes therefrom
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57185:124"/>
that which was given to the College by the <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> and if it be permitted that they may give Potions for the Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the abuſes before remedied ſhall be reſtored. This being in the purview of <hi>34 H. 8. 1 Mariae</hi> was made, and repeals all that the <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> hath taken away from <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> And I do agrée, if two Statutes be made in the affirmative, and the <note place="margin">Stat. repeal.</note> latter controll the former, ſuch conſtruction ſhall be made that both may ſtand. But if the laſt be Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either in words or intention, the former ſhall be repealed. And here be ſuch words that it is not poſſible that the other ſhould ſtand. <hi>1 Mariae</hi> the words be, that it confirms <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> ſo that it <note place="margin">Stat. 34 H. 8. cap. 8. Stat. 1 Mariae.</note> ſhall be in force in every Clauſe. And it is all one as if the words of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> had béen contained within this Stat. <hi>1 Mariae.</hi> And then how can the <hi>14.</hi> and <hi>34.</hi> ſtand together? Alſo the very purpoſe of this Stat. <hi>1 Mariae</hi> is to repeal <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> For the rule, <hi>Dyer 347.</hi> is, that when <hi>2</hi> Statutes be, and one ſéems to croſs the other in ſubſtance, and no Clauſe <hi>de non obſtante</hi> in the latter, expoſition ſhall be made ſo as both may ſtand together if it may be. But here is ſuch a Clauſe, <hi>notwithſtanding any Statute, &amp;c.</hi> and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is apparent to repeal the <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> in that part which giveth liberty to unskilfull ignorant perſons to practiſe Phyſick. And <hi>1 Mariae</hi> doth ſtand upon <hi>2</hi> parts: <hi>1.</hi> It is a confirmation of <hi>14 H. 8. 2.</hi> It gives the College further privilege; And this part of the Statute were vain and idle, if <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> as to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick were not repealed; and ſome ſuch thing was in the minds of the makers of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> when they ſay, <hi>any Statute to the contrary notwithſtanding;</hi> and there is not any Stat. after the <hi>14.</hi> that impeaches this, but the Stat. of <hi>34.</hi>

And <hi>Trin. 6 Jac. B. R.</hi> which was Commenced <hi>Mich. 3 Jac. rot. 458.

THe ſame Term it was afterwards argued by <hi>Hedley</hi> for the Defendant, That all theſe <hi>3</hi> Statutes may well ſtand together by reaſonable <note place="margin">Lit. rep. 212.</note> Conſtruction. <hi>Leges poſteriores priores contrarias abrogant.</hi> But the averment ought to be there upon <hi>contrarias.</hi> But otherwiſe if upon reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they may ſtand, they ought; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety ought to be in matter, not in ſpecial words; general words cannot repeal particular. For gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular cannot be contrary. Statutes ought to be expounded by the meaning which ought to be found out partly by the words, partly by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they intend to remedy. Firſt where the Stat. <hi>14.</hi> by theſe words <hi>facultates medicinae</hi> includes Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery: <note place="margin">Expoſition of the word Medicina. Stat. 14 H. 8.</note> and it ſéems that this word <hi>Medicina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes external medicines as well as internal. <hi>3 H. 8. cap. 11.</hi> this was made for Phyſick and for Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to remedy <hi>all abuſes</hi> in them, and the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Stat. 3 H. 8. cap. 11.</note> of them that ſhall be permitted to practice, was done by the Biſhop who was Phyſician for the Soul; And they conceived that he would have more care of the body. Afterwards came the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> which doth not repeal this Statute in expreſs words, but yet in meaning is contrary; But they may ſtand together by Conſtruction: For the firſt is, that he ſhall not practiſe without licence of the Biſhop; the ſecond that he cannot practiſe without licence of the College; and therefore ought to have licence of both. But this was never the meaning of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> there it is taken that Chirurgery was not within the Stat. <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> but there it is <hi>outward Medicines,</hi> which prove <hi>Medicina</hi> to include Surgery. In this Statute they perceived that thoſe perſons licenſed did much hurt, for <hi>licentiâ</hi>

                        <hi>ſumus deteriores,</hi> and that they were as Butchers in Lent which be licenſed, that ſell the worſt and deareſt meat; and for this intent for ſuch diſeaſes where the cauſe was well known, they might practiſe to do more than contemplation; this Stat. gives licence for ſuch diſeaſes. After comes the Stat. <hi>1 M.</hi> which never intended to repeal <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> and reſtore licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; But the Statute was made to give the College more privilege than they had by the Stat. <hi>14. ſeil.</hi> that they might commit without Bail or Mainprize. But it recites <hi>14.</hi> and confirms the ſame; but they never intended to repeal <hi>14.</hi> And they confirmed their liberties, ſuch as were in force, and the <hi>34.</hi> is but an expoſition of <hi>14.</hi> And although <hi>1 Mariae</hi> confirm <hi>14.</hi> and all Articles, Clauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended all Clauſes in force. The Statute of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance recites that all <hi>former Statutes now in force ſhall be put in execution:</hi> And if thoſe words <hi>now in force</hi> were not there, yet ſhall it be ſo expounded. <hi>4 E. 3. 3 &amp; 4.</hi> there were divers Statutes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſition upon Wine, and there the Iudges agréed that they ought ſo to expound them that they may ſtand, no <hi>non obſtante</hi> being.

by the <hi>non obſtante.</hi> But after the Statute <hi>26 H. 8.</hi> that all inheritances ſhall be forfeited notwithſtanding any Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the force of the Common Law is not taken away, for a right of action is not by this forfeited. <hi>Co. 6.

And therefore ſuch part of <hi>14.</hi> which was made void by <hi>34.</hi> cannot be confirmed.</p>
                     <p>As to the exception to the Barr, the Barr in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is good, although he might have pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> yet he may plead the ſpecial matter, and it concludes <hi>abſque hoc</hi> that he is guilty <hi>aliter vel alio modo;</hi> he hath not juſtified more than the Statute warrants; for thereby he adminiſtred drinks, and in Latine it cannot be otherwiſe tranſlated than by the word <hi>Potiones.</hi>

And it is plain that the <hi>13 Eliz,</hi> doth not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57185:127"/>
take away <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> for it was in the affirmative, and commenced after, and therefore it is expounded not to extend to the Biſhop; As the Statute of <hi>contra formam collationis</hi> doth not include the Biſhop as it was there adjudged.

                        <hi>Athow</hi> for the Defendant. And before his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he would ſhew what was Surgery, and what a Surgeon might do. It appeareth by <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> that licence of Phyſick comprehends all Phyſick; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I collect that <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> and the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the College do not extend to Surgery. By thoſe Letters Patents and Statute, all the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians be a body politick, and if this extends to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57185:129"/>
then all the Surgeons in <hi>London</hi> be of the Corporation of the Phyſicians, which they be not, but a diſtinct Company, and out of their Iurisdiction and government. And Surgeons for their practice ſhall not be puniſhed, although they practiſe without licence. But the ſaid Statute and Patent extend to the learned part of Phyſick; for the knowledge of Phyſick is a learned art; and therefore the Statute was made to reſtrain unlearned men; and there is more learning in judging rightly of the diſeaſe than in curing thereof; for ſometimes <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> diſeaſes be in the body at the ſame time, and that which cureth the one, may increaſe the other; wherefore there the learning of Phyſick appears in applying ſuch remedy as may cure both together. But for the exerciſe of Surgery, knowledge of the Nature of Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſufficient. It hath béen ſaid, that for outward diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they are allowed; But I anſwer, that for the Stone and Strangury and Ague there néeds no great skill to diſcover them, and then the cure of them is more by experience and practice than learning. And I have heard of a Phyſician, that went <hi>100</hi> miles to know a Medicine for thoſe diſeaſes of an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had long time experience thereof. And drinks for Agues, Strangury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Surgery and not Phyſick properly. And this appeareth by the Statute of <hi>3 H. 8. &amp; 34 H. 8.</hi> In <hi>3 H. 8.</hi> Phyſick and Surgery be both joyned together, but in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of them, the Biſhop ought to call Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to allow Phyſicians, but Surgeons to allow Surgeons. Now <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> proves, that all that the Defendant hath done is Surgery. There is the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Statute of <hi>3 H. 8.</hi> and then it is ſaid that <hi>the Company of Surgeons, &amp;c. have troubled and</hi>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:57185:129"/>
                        <hi>vexed divers, &amp;c. who are indued with the knowledge of miniſtring to ſuch as be pained with cuſtomable diſeaſes, &amp;c.</hi> where there is not one word of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Then if Surgeons may do this, the College cannot reſtrain them, or correct them that do this. Another part of the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> is, that no perſon ought to be ſuffered to practiſe, but he that is profeſſed, ſage, diſcréet, and learned. It may be ſaid, that under colour of miniſtring of theſe drinks to Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one may miniſter them to other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Alſo I confeſs that an Ague is attending upon ſundry great diſeaſes; and for theſe Agues they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give drinks; but to ſingle Agues, that do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company other diſeaſes they may: and of theſe is our Iuſtification; and if he hath miniſtred to others, there is a fair Iſſue tendered, by which it may be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Stone, Strangury and Ague were never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Stat. <hi>14. H. 8.</hi> The expoſition of the Statute ought to be according to the intent, which is to be collected out of the preamble or body, or other words therein, and ſometimes out of the miſchief intended to be thereby remedied. <hi>Morgan's caſe Pl. Com.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>7 E. 6.</hi> is an example above all, where it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged that this Statute extends only to the Receivers of the King, which is collected out of the Act, and by other words in the Statute, inſomuch that the receivers of common perſons cannot take any money for receipt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the miſchief was, that no poor men ſhall have penſions of the King upon the Statute of diſſolution of Monaſteries. And it would be a great miſchief, if they upon non-payment always ſhould complain to the King, which miſchief cannot be in caſe of a common perſon, becauſe they may diſtrain for non-payment. So the Statute <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57185:130"/>
body and all the words in the Statute be againſt Chirurgeons. But the expoſition <hi>2 E. 4. 18.</hi> upon the Statute of Prerogative, and ſo Statutes of Wills, gives power to deviſe lands in ſoccage of any inheritance, and this doth not extend to Lands in Tail, although the Act of explanation had not béen made; but the Iudges would have made the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, becauſe that Lands in Tail cannot be demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable at the Common Law: But they would have expounded, that Lands in Tail ought a third part of them be allotted to deſcend upon the heirs, becauſe that they may deſcend. And ſo if it ſhould be doubtfull whether <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> extend to Agues and Strangury, the Statute <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> expounds it, that it will not be denied but that Surgeons may cut for the Stone, and if Ague or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> break in Vlcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may without queſtion cure them; by the ſame reaſon they may cure theſe Diſeaſes inwardly if they can.</p>

                     <p>The common law before <hi>3 H 8.</hi> was, that every one might exerciſe any lawfull trade; But there is a different conſideration betwéen the practice of Phyſick and other Mechanick Trades. In Mechanick Trades if any one undertake a thing, and doth not doe it duly, an Action upon the caſe lieth: But in the practice of Phyſick it is otherwiſe; for the miſchief that falls upon the party, takes away the remedy, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the death of the Patient by the unskilfulneſs of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57185:132"/>
the Phyſician. And for this inconvenience was <hi>3 H. 8. cap. 11.</hi> made, which Statute did not redreſs the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſufficiently, becauſe that the allowance or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance of Phyſicians was not referred to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Iudges; for the fitneſs of every perſon ſhould be tried by them which be experienced in the ſame kind, as <hi>8 H. 7.</hi> the Ordinary tries whether a Parſon <hi>ſit idoneus ad Eccleſiam;</hi> but here the Biſhop is to be Iudge of the skilfulneſs of Phyſicians.</p>
                     <p>Another imperfection in this Statute is, that the penalty is given and to be recovered by every one that will ſue, and therefore the care was in no perſon; and alſo there was not ſufficient care for practiſers in <hi>London:</hi> There was care that none ſhould practiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the negative, but what care was there in the affirmative? <hi>Sir George Farmars caſe, 8 rep. 126.</hi> Then came the Statute of <hi>10</hi> and the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> which do not extend to every one that giveth Phyſick, but to him that profeſſeth the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It hath béen ſaid that <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> doth not extend to reſtrain the practice of thoſe diſeaſes; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they be within the letter of the Statute, but not within the meaning; but by the Common Law they be taken to be within Phyſick. The Common Law takes notice of a Phyſician and Surgeon, but for an Empirick, he is not known to the Law. <hi>See the Entries fol. 187.</hi> A Phyſician may have debt for his fées, ſo may a Surgeon without doubt; but where is there any precedent for an Empirick, or Herbaliſt to have action? An <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> he may have, but not debt. Knowledge of Herbs pertains to Phyſicians, and ſo of Waters; for who can judge of Baths but Phyſicians, and thoſe that belong to the practice of Phyſick? <hi>See Entries fol. 463. Pl. 3.</hi> Action was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57185:132"/>
brought againſt one for practiſing of Medicines; and for that cauſe it was neceſſary to ſhew, what practice this was, <hi>ſcil. tam per viſus, &amp;c. quàm interiores po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.</hi> And there is another action there, where one that practiſed as Surgeon, practiſed <hi>ut Medicus;</hi> that where the Plaintiff <hi>ſuit aegrotus</hi> of the Colick, the Defendant <hi>ut medicus ſed indoctus, &amp; cupidus lucri,</hi> ſaith to the Plaintiff that he was troubled with thrée Impoſthumations, and adminiſtred to him <hi>medicinam inſalubrem &amp; intoxicatam,</hi> whereby the Plaintiff was in danger of his life. And in the ſame book <hi>fol. 463. Pl. 1.</hi> it is ſhewn what a Surgeon ought to do. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries fol. 127.</hi> and an appeal of <hi>Mayhem 46. Pl. 5. Regiſter treſpaſs fol. 139.</hi> The Statute <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> was apparent, that the Iudgment of the Parliament was, that Surgery was a member of Phyſick. And he ſaid there were <hi>2</hi> kinds of Surgeons, Barber-Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons who were incorporated <hi>1 E. 4.</hi> and Surgeons onely. He agréed that the Statute againſt the words may be conſtrued by equity, as <hi>Stradling and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's caſe,</hi> but to whom ſhall this equity extend? <hi>Poſito</hi> that it extends to Surgeons, yet it never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Empiricks. Equity againſt the letter ought to be grounded upon the intention, <hi>30 E. 3. 6. 1 H. 6. 3.</hi> The Statute of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi> there are nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words as here, that no perſon ſhall drive a diſtreſs out of the County, <hi>&amp;c. vide</hi> the Caſe: But <hi>poſito</hi> that a ſtranger ſhall diſtrain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the equity ſhall not extend to him. So in our Caſe, although a Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be tolerated, yet a Stranger ſhall not invade the liberty of Phyſicians.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> The Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> doth not reſtrain that which is within <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> but meddles with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief mentioned in <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> And it appeareth that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57185:133"/>
the intention of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> was not to raiſe a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but to tolerate the old. For the Statute is where many give Medicines without money, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for Charity and neighbourhood. And the purview is general, that <hi>ſuch, &amp;c.</hi> But the difference is, if any will within his own houſe or to his friend give Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, it is not within the Statute: But if he make profeſſion and ſet up a Bill, that he can cure ſuch and ſuch diſeaſes, it is otherwiſe. <hi>Pl. Com. 463.</hi> And if the queſtion had béen put to the makers of the Statute, whether they would raiſe a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it would have béen denied to be their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>8 Rep. fol. 129.</hi> Exerciſe of brewing is not every brewing for his own houſe alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but profeſſion thereof. And <hi>11 Rep. fol. 23.</hi> So here. But <hi>poſito</hi> that every one may exerciſe within <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> yet it is not a Repeal of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> but as it were a licence or diſpenſation therewith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if it were, yet <hi>1 Mariae</hi> repeals all <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> that any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaches <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> If it was made to ſuch purpoſe at firſt, this Act <hi>1 Mariae</hi> takes notice of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> and provides that <hi>ſtaret &amp; continuaret, &amp;c.</hi> Any Act, Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the contrary. And what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute can be to the contrary but the Statute <hi>34 H. 8?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Objection, that there wants <hi>ſtaret,</hi> and is onely <hi>continuaret,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>[&amp;]</hi> cannot be of any force, it ſhall be as if it were abſent: and then <hi>continuaret</hi> is not only a confirmation, but is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the impediment, which is the Statute <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> as it was before. And although that this Statute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> is a private Statute, yet the ſubſtance being pleaded is ſufficient. But the plea in barr is ill; this is Iuſtification by virtue of a Statute Law, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57185:133"/>
gives the Iuſtification in this manner, that he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſtifie generally. The application of Plaſters and giving of Potions to Sores, Agues, Stone, Strangury, <hi>&amp;c. &amp; talibus morbis,</hi> and doth not ſay <hi>ſecundum formam Statuti;</hi> and therefore ſhall not be conſtrued <hi>pro reddendo ſingula ſingulis. 15 H. 7. 10.</hi> where the conſtruction is made <hi>reddendo ſingula ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis, &amp;c.</hi> This form of pleading is alſo a new form, <hi>quoad</hi> thoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he juſtifies, and he doth not ſay this is the ſame practice whereof the Plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. And ſo to force the Plaintiff to a replication when the thing is intire, as here, that he had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>facultatem medicinae,</hi> he cannot ſever his plea and juſtifie theſe, <hi>Et quoad alia, &amp;c.</hi> plead Not guilty: But he ought to plead as it is ſaid before, or traverſe <hi>abſque hoc, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57185:134"/>
principal points of the Caſe which be; The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs declare that the Charter made to the College did inhibit, <hi>That none ſhall practiſe Phyſick, &amp;c. without licence, &amp;c.</hi> and that the Defendant contrary thereto had practiſed by the ſpace of <hi>12</hi> months, for which he had forfeited <hi>5 li.</hi> for every month, which amounts to <hi>60 li.</hi> The Defendant pleads the Statute <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> that made it lawfull for any skilfull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to adminiſter outward Plaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Potions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as to any other practice he pleaded <hi>Non culpabilis.</hi> The Plaintiffs reply, and ſhew the Statute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> which confirms their firſt Charter. <hi>Any Act to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi> Vpon which the Defendant demurred in Law; and our Ioint Reſolution is, that the Plaintiffs ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
                     <p>It hath béen objected againſt the Iurisdiction of this Court, that by the Statute of <hi>21 Jac.</hi> this action ought not to be brought here. But it is clear that it cannot be brought in any other place than in the Kings Courts of Record at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> For the Statute doth not mention in what Court it ſhall be brought, and the Statute <hi>21 Jac.</hi> which giveth power to Iuſtices, doth not give any other thing to them, but that whereof they have Power and Iurisdiction before; and before this they had not any Iurisdiction of this Cauſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Objection hath béen made, that the Action hath not béen well brought, becauſe it ought to be brought in the name of the Preſident onely. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Charter it ſelf is, that they may plead, and be impleaded by the name of Preſident onely; and the Action ſhall be brought by that name, by which the King enables them to bring their Action,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57185:134"/>
and to plead and to be impleaded, as <hi>11 H. 7. 27, 28.</hi> is; ſo that here is a good action and well grounded and by a good name. And as to the Plea in Barr it is inſufficient, becauſe he hath not pleaded according to the Statute. For his plea ought to have béen apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Statute, for by the Statute the power there given is <hi>to adminiſter to outward Sores</hi> or <hi>Diſeaſes, any Ointments, Plaſters, &amp;c. and other like,</hi> and this ought to be <hi>according to the skill and knowledge.</hi> And here the Defendant ſaith, that he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the nature of <hi>Herbs, Roots, and Waters, &amp;c.</hi> and did apply Oyntments, Potions, <hi>&amp;c. for the Stone, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ſuch other diſeaſes,</hi> and he ought to have ſaid, according to his knowledge in thoſe diſeaſes, and not in other like, <hi>&amp;c. 2.</hi> The Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ought to have béen to <hi>outward Tumours, &amp;c.</hi> and here <hi>outward</hi> is omitted, and he hath pleaded ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, whereby his plea goeth to the whole, and ſo miſtaken. <hi>3.</hi> Where potions may be applied to the Stone, Strangury, and Agues, the Defendant hath pleaded Potions <hi>pro ulceribus, morbis, &amp;c. &amp; talibus conſimilibus,</hi> which is a more large Authority than the Statute limits; And for theſe the plea is ill. It is a rule, that a plea ought to be iſſuable; but this is not, as it is pleaded; for the Defendant here ought to have diſtinguiſhed his plea, and have juſtified in part, as in <hi>applying outward Plaſters, &amp;c. to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſeaſes, and Potions to Stone, Strangury and Ague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Replication, it hath béen objected that it is a departure. To which I ſay, that if any new matter be pleaded, it is a departure; but here is none. For the Replication which ſupports and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces the Declaration is by the Statute <hi>1 Mariae,</hi>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:57185:135"/>
and this could not have béen alledged in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and there was no reaſon to ſhew the Statute <hi>1 Mariae</hi> untill the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> was pleaded by the Defendant.</p>
                     <p>And as to the matter in law, that is, <hi>how far</hi> the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> gave liberty againſt the Statute <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> to what perſons, and for what things, is the Queſtion. And upon conſideration of all the law of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> we be of opinion that this Statute doth not reach, neither in Words, nor in Intent and meaning, to give liberty to any perſon that practiſes or exerciſes for lucre and profit; and it is apparent by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, and the Statute alſo, that this was made principally againſt Chirurgeons which were covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Statute hath limited who ſhould practiſe, and for what diſeaſes, and the parties li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed thereby were thoſe which were good honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as old Women, and ſuch as would give neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly Phyſick for charity and piety, and not ſuch as look for gain thereby, as Empiricks, that do not doe any thing for piety and charity. So that this Statute excludes all thoſe that take any money or gain. And this Statute which was intended againſt Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in truth helps them; for it gives to them liberty to give Pills and Potions as well as to apply out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Medicines to outward diſeaſes, and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhall be made. And Surgery is onely that which is to be done with the hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And moreover we be of opinion that if this Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> had abridged the Statute <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> yet that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>1 Mariae</hi> hath ſetled all on foot again of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> in as large manner as it ever was before; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>any Act to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi> And it was made to ſuppreſs unskilfull men. But this
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57185:135"/>
Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Langton's caſe, Mich. 3 Jac. B. R. rot. 438. verſus Gardiner</hi> is expreſs in this point; yet there the plea was better than this is. And yet after it had depended <hi>3</hi> years, judgment was given againſt the Defendant. With this he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and commanded Iudgment to be entred for the Plaintiff againſt the Defendant.</p>

                     <p>THe Preſident and College of Phyſicians Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs againſt <hi>Huybert,</hi> Defendant.</p>
                     <p>The Plaintiffs ſued the Defendant upon their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of <hi>H. 8.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> which confirms the ſame Letters Patents, for practiſing of Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> for ſeveral months mentioned in the Declaration without any licence or leave of the College of Phyſicians, whereby he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits five pounds for every month.</p>
                     <p>The Defendant pleaded <hi>nul tiel Record, videlicet,</hi> that there is no Record of any ſuch Statute as the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs have ſuppoſed in the Declaration. And the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs having joyned iſſue thereupon in <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Term laſt, had then aday given to bring forth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thereof untill this preſent <hi>Hilary</hi> Term: And now the Tenor of the Record of the ſaid Statute was by way of <hi>Mittimus</hi> ſent out of the Court of Chancery into the Court of Kings Bench to prove the iſſue for the Plaintiffs, by which it appeared to the Court of Kings Bench that there is ſuch an Act of Parliament as the Plaintiffs did declare upon.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon the Counſel at the Barr for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant made two objections.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that ſearch had béen made by the Defendant among the Records of Parliament, and it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there that the Royal aſſent was to this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament mentioned in the Plaintiffs declaration and therefore there is not in truth or in Law any ſuch Act
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57185:140"/>
of Parliament. For when Statutes are enrolled, the Royal aſſent ought to be entred upon the Roll alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hales</hi> the Lord Chief Iuſtice anſwered, that this objection if it ſhould be allowed to be a good one, would endanger not onely this Act but many Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament which have never yet béen queſtioned. For there are many Acts of Parliament, upon the Rolls whereof, the Royal Aſſent doth not appear, eſpecially if they be ancient Acts; And yet they have béen ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as good Acts of Parliament. For the method of procéeding in the making of Acts of Parliament was anciently different from that which is now uſed: For formerly a Bill in the nature of a Petition was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Commons and by the Commons to the Lords, and then was entred upon the Lords Rolls, and there the Royal Aſſent was entred alſo. And upon this as a ground-work the Iudges uſed at the end of the Parliament to draw up the Act of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament into the Form of a Statute, which afterwards was entred upon the Rolls called the Statute Rolls, which were different Rolls from thoſe called the Lords Rolls or the Rolls of Parliament. Vpon which Statute Rolls neither the Bill or Petition from the Commons, nor the Anſwer of the Lords, nor the Royal Aſſent was entred, but onely the Statute as it was drawn up and penned by the Iudges. And this was the method till about <hi>H. 5 's</hi> time; and in his time 'twas deſired that the Acts of Parliament might be drawn up and penned by the Iudges before the end of the Parliament: And this was by reaſon of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint then made that the Statutes were not fairly and equally drawn up and worded after the Parliament was diſſolved or prorogued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:57185:140"/>
In <hi>H. 6 's</hi> time the former method was altered, and then Bills <hi>continentes formam Actus Parliamenti</hi> were firſt uſed to be brought into the Houſe. The Bills were (before they were brought into the Houſe) ready drawn in the Form of an Act of Parliament, and not in the Form of a Petition as before; Vpon which Bills 'twas written by the Commons <hi>Soit baile al Seigneurs,</hi> and by the Lords <hi>Soit baile al Roy,</hi> and by the King <hi>Le Roy le voet.</hi> All this was written upon the Bill, and the Bill thus endorſed was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the Clerk of the Parliament, and he was to enter the Bill thus drawn at firſt in the Form of an Act of Parliament or Statute upon the Statute Rolls, without entring of the Anſwer of the King, Lords and Commons upon the Statute Roll. And then iſſued out Writs to the Sheriffs with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of the Statute Rolls, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Bill drawn at firſt in the Form of a Statute, and without the anſwer of the King, Lords and Commons to the Bill, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Statutes.</p>
                     <p>Now this Record which is before us in Court upon the <hi>Mittimus</hi> is not a tranſcript of the Bill upon which the anſwer of the King, Lords and Commons was written, but it is a tranſcript of the Entry which was made upon the Statute Roll, upon which Roll it is not neceſſary that the Royal Aſſent muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. And though oftentimes the Royal Aſſent hath béen entred by the Clerk upon the Statute Rolls, yet 'tis not neceſſary that it ſhould be there to make a good Statute, it having béen before upon the Bill. There be many Statutes which have not the Royal Aſſent to them entred upon the Statute Rolls. This objection would deſtroy half the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that be. If in the body of the Statute it ſelf
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57185:141"/>
the conſent of the King, Lords and Commons doth not appear, 'tis a void Statute, 'tis <hi>felo de ſe;</hi> As in the caſe of <hi>4 H. 7. fol. 18.</hi> (which caſe is cited in <hi>Hobarts reports fol. 111.</hi> in the caſe there betwéen the King and the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> and the Counteſs Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Arundel</hi> and the Lord <hi>William Howard)</hi> upon an Act of Attainder of a particular perſon, the conſent of the Commons did not appear in it, and therefore ſaith the book, all the Iudges held clearly that it was no Act, and therefore he was reſtored. And yet it doth not hold true generally, that in the body of the Act the thrée Aſſents muſt particularly appear, eſpecially in caſes of Ancient Statutes: The reaſon is, becauſe the Forms of drawing up and wording ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were very various, as <hi>8 Cook Prince's Caſe,</hi> King <hi>Edw. 3. authoritate Parliamenti</hi> grants by an inſtrument in Form of a Charter, yet 'tis there held that it was a Statute.</p>
                     <p>And this very Act here in queſtion of <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> hath always béen taken to be a good Act, as in Dr. <hi>Bonham's caſe</hi> in the <hi>8 report,</hi> and in the <hi>4 Inſt.</hi> and in Dr. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's caſe</hi> in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> and in <hi>Jones's</hi> report.</p>
                     <p>But further <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, that in this caſe here the Court is bound up to give Iudgment upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that is certified unto the Court: And by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord certified it appears to the Court, that it is a good Act of Parliament; for in the Certificate made to the Court the thrée Aſſents of the King, Lords and Commons are contained in the body of the Act. There be other Satutes of the ſame Seſſions of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> which be as our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is, <hi>viz.</hi> without the Royal aſſent upon the Roll of the Statute, as the Act about the marrying of the Six Clerks, <hi>cap. 8.</hi> and the Act of the Port of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57185:141"/>
                        <hi>Southampton, cap. 13.</hi> and other Statutes of the ſame Seſſions; and yet they have not béen ever queſtioned: and in truth the Royal Aſſent was at the end of the Bills of that Seſſions.</p>
                     <p>If the Defendant thinks that the certificate here is falſe, it being of an Act of Parliament, whenas he thinks there is no ſuch Act; The party grieved by ſuch falſe Certificate is to take his remedy by way of Action upon the Caſe againſt the Perſon that made ſuch falſe Certificate, as the Clerk of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or the Clerk in Chancery; but the Defendant cannot be admitted here in this Court to averr contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Record certified, and ſo to relieve himſelf this way; for we have no power over thoſe Records; we cannot cauſe the Parliament Rolls themſelves to be brought into this Court, we take them to be as they are certified unto us.</p>
                     <p>Then the Counſel for the Defendant made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond objection, <hi>viz.</hi> The iſſue here is whether there be ſuch a Record or no, and this iſſue is to be tried by the Record it ſelf: For all Records are of that high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they can be tried onely by themſelves. Now here the Tenor of the Record onely, is certified and not the Record it ſelf, and therefore the iſſue here is not ſufficiently proved by the Plaintiffs in Law. And <hi>Pages caſe</hi> in the <hi>5 rep.</hi> was cited, where 'tis reſolved that the Tenor of a Record is not pleadable at Common Law; that 'tis not ſufficient at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law to ſhew forth to the Court the Tenor of Letters Patents, but that the Letters Patents themſelves muſt be produced to the Court. 'Tis the Record it ſelf onely that is pleadable, and not the Tenor thereof; and by conſequence 'tis the Record it ſelf that muſt be certified here to prove this iſſue of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57185:142"/>
                        <hi>nul tiel Record,</hi> and a Certificate of the Tenor onely, is not ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hales</hi> the Lord Chief Iuſtice anſwered, that though the Tenor of a Record be not pleadable, yet upon the iſſue of <hi>nul tiel Record</hi> the Tenor of the Record is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove that iſſue, the Tenor thereof being ſent by way of <hi>Mittimus</hi> into the Court where the iſſue is depending, upon that particular purpoſe onely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nul tiel Record</hi> may well be pleaded to a private Act of Parliament, but it cannot be pleaded to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Act of Parliament: the reaſon of the difference is, for that the Court is bound to take notice of publick Acts of Parliament, but not of private ones.</p>
                     <p>When execution may be awarded upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord certified, there a Certificate of the Tenor is not ſufficient, becauſe no execution can be granted upon a Tenor onely: the reaſon thereof is this, if execution might be upon the Tenor, then two executions might be, <hi>viz.</hi> one upon the Tenor in one Court, the other upon the Record it ſelf in the other Court, and 'twould be againſt reaſon, that two executions ſhould be for the ſame thing. But where the Writ which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Court below to certifie a Record, doth alſo tie up the hands of that Court from awarding any execution, there a Certificate of the Tenor onely is ſufficient, as in ſome caſes of Writs of Error upon Iudgment given in other Courts.</p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Certiorari's</hi> to remove preſentments, upon which proceſs may be awarded in this Court.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon why 'tis not ſufficient to plead the Tenor of Letters Patents or to ſhew or produce to the Court the Tenor of Letters Patents, as in <hi>Pages caſe</hi> is reſolved, is, becauſe the Letters Patents are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57185:142"/>
the private conveyance of a particular perſon, and therefore he muſt plead and ſhew forth and produce to the Court the Letters Patents themſelves, and the Tenor thereof was not ſufficient at the Common Law.</p>
                     <p>But upon <hi>nul tiel Record</hi> pleaded, a Certificate of the Tenor onely and not of the Record it ſelf hath always béen held a ſufficient proof of that iſſue, and the Tenor certified is to be filed in this Court and to remain here always to this purpoſe onely, <hi>viz.</hi> as a proof of this iſſue; but the Record it ſelf remains where it was before, to be made uſe of for any purpoſes that may happen hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the Iudges were of the ſame opinion, and ſo Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

                     <p>THe Preſident and the College <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> brought an action of debt upon the Statute of <hi>14 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> for ſo much money againſt the Defendant for practiſing Phyſick for ſo many months without licence of the College, whereby he was to forfeit <hi>5 li. per</hi> month, one moiety thereof to the King, and the other moiety to the Preſident and College.</p>
                     <p>The Defendant pleaded as to part of the money in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57185:143"/>
the Declaration mentioned <hi>nul tiel Record</hi> as the ſaid Act of Parliament; and as to the Reſidue of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the Defendant pleaded <hi>nil debet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Plaintiffs demurred to the Barr.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the demurrer was, for that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's plea was double, <hi>viz.</hi> it contained two matters, one whereof alone would go in anſwer to the whole money in the Declaration mentioned, and would of it ſelf be a good and full Barr to the Plaintiffs Action in caſe the ſaid matter be true as the Defendant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, and that is the matter of <hi>nul tiel Record;</hi> and therefore the pleading of <hi>nul tiel Record</hi> to part onely, and the pleading of other matter, <hi>viz. nil debet</hi> to the reſidue, makes the Defendant's plea in Barr to be vicious, and to be an ill plea in Law.</p>
                     <p>The Councel for the Defendant did then object, that the Plaintiffs Declaration is naught; 'tis an action of debt brought by the Preſident and College <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> upon the Statute, and an action of debt doth not lie: the Plaintiffs ſhould have brought an information upon the Statute and not an Action of debt upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for the Statute doth not give an action of debt, and therefore an action of debt doth not lie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> Iuſtice anſwered, that an action of debt doth lie by equity and conſtruction of the Statute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtice ſaid, that in the Statute of Tithes in <hi>3 Ed. 6.</hi> no action of debt is mentioned, and yet an action of debt lies upon that Statute, and ſo here.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon Rule was given by the Court that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be entred for the Plaintiffs.</p>

                     <head>A brief account of the College of Phyſicians Caſe drawn up in relation to their finding of Arms, keeping of Watch and Ward, or bearing any Pariſh offices.</head>
                     <p>IN the roth year of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Phyſicians of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and within 7 miles of the ſame, upon many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſons mentioned in their Royal Patent, were made a Body Corporate, and endowed with many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which in the 14th and 15th of his Reign were confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In the 32th of the ſame King's Reign ſeveral additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal privileges were granted them by a ſecond Act of Parliament, by which they were diſcharged from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Watch and Ward, or being choſen to any Office in <hi>London</hi> or the Suburbs thereof, and were thereby enabled to practiſe Surgery as well as Phyſick in the ſaid City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which clauſe, they were entituled to the privilege granted the Surgeons of being diſcharged from bearing Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
                     <p>In the 1 Q. <hi>M.</hi> 9. their Charter was a ſecond time confirmed by Act of Parliament and additional Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges granted to them: Which privileges, with a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from finding Arms, were continued to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption till 1588, and it being then a time of moſt imminent and publick danger, the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> and Court of Aldermen charged the College with Arms, whereupon they applied themſelves to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council, upon which Secretary <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> wrote a Letter to the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>London,</hi> that they ſhould no more trouble the College, but permit them to live quietly and free from
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57185:147"/>
that charge. After this, they met with no farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or moleſtation till the Reign of K. <hi>James,</hi> at which time the College being charged with Arms, Sir <hi>William Paddy</hi> pleaded their Privilege before Sir <hi>Thomas Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Lord Mayor and a full Court of Aldermen, and Sir <hi>Henry Mountague</hi> Recorder, an account of which is at large Printed in this Book.</p>
                     <p>But the iſſue thereof was (in ſhort) the following, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Recorder then peruſing every branch of the Statutes recited by Sir <hi>William Paddy,</hi> with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by him urged; and opening every part thereof at large, did conclude, that the Act of Parliament did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give the College as much immunity as in any ſort to the Chirurgeons. Whereupon the Court deſired a Liſt of the Members of the College, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately given them, and an Order entred for a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to the College from bearing of Arms; and alſo a Precept was then awarded by the Mayor and Court to commit all other Phyſicians or Surgeons refuſing to bear or find Arms, who were not of the College allowed, or Chirurgeons licenſed according to form.</p>
                     <p>About 3 years after this debate, King <hi>James</hi> granted the College his Royal Charter, wherein he confirms all former Statutes and Patents given them by his Royal Progenitors, and therein granted <hi>To all and every Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of the College to be wholly and abſolutely free from providing or bearing of any Armour or other Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> &amp;c <hi>any Act or Statute to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> After this, the College enjoyed this privilege without interruption during the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of glorious memory untill the times of the late Rebellion; in which, Rights both Civil and Sacred were invaded, and our College expoſed to publick ſale by mercenary Villains.

                     <p>Thus by the eſpecial grace and favour of the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> the College of Phyſicians have been freed from bearing and providing Arms; and though ſome particular Member may of late have been ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned upon that account by the Lieutenancy, yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on producing his Majeſtie's Patent and aſſerting his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's Natural right in diſpenſing with a Corporation of men from bearing and providing Arms (which was an inherent prerogative in the Crown; and therefore an Act of Parliament was made in 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 6. poſitively declaring, <hi>That the ſole and Supreme Power, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>

Accordingly he attended, and they told him that they were ſatisfied that the words of the Patent were ſufficient to exempt the Members of the College from bearing and providing Arms, and deſired that a Liſt of them might be given in under the College Seal, which was accordingly done.</p>

                     <hi>'TIs now about</hi> 165 <hi>years ſince your College was firſt founded by Royal Authority.

                  <p>And likewiſe duly conſidering, that by the rejecting of thoſe illiterate and unskilfull practiſers, thoſe that were learned, grave, and profound practiſers in that faculty, ſhould receive more bountifull reward; and alſo the induſtrious Students of that profeſſion, would be the better encouraged in their ſtudies and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>This is a work (I muſt confeſs) more fit for a large Volume, than an Epiſtle; a work, which I hope in due time may be attempted by a more able and elegant pen, than I can pretend to: and that, becauſe I know there want not good materials to encourage ſuch an honourable and worthy undertaking, ſeveral Authours having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written ſomewhat memorable of the Worthies of this our Royal College; our own Annals acquainting us with much more; and the learned Dr.</hi> Hamey <hi>having left behind him (in a Manuſcript of his own writing) the lives of above</hi> 50 <hi>of them. Some of which were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued for their knowledge in the learned Languages; others for being general Scholars, polite Latiniſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Grecians, eloquent Oratours, great Antiquaries, and deep Philoſophers. Others for the improvement of their own faculty in the Theoretick and Practick, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomick and Spagirick parts thereof; that they were and are no leſs valued and eſteemed in other Countries than in their own; having by their matchleſs and moſt incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works, not onely merited, but obtained the name of</hi> immortal. <hi>Some are admired and read in foreign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, as</hi> Hippocrates <hi>and</hi> Galen <hi>were of old; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo much valued for their late incomparable and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Medical obſervations; that the Diſciples of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Profeſſours are obliged to a diligent reading and carefull practice of them. No wonder therefore, that Emperours and Princes have courted theſe</hi> Aeſculapii <hi>of their ſeveral Ages, to attend them in their Courts; and foreign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities have been ſo ambitious of encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to aſcend their Chairs; their excellent learning and parts being of ſuch an illuſtrious extraction.

                     <hi>The firſt of which I ſhall mention, was the moſt famous Dr.</hi> Thomas Linacer, <hi>who was born at</hi> Canterbury, <hi>educated under the Learned</hi> Sellingus; <hi>and from him ſent to</hi> Oxford; <hi>where after a ſhort ſtay, he was</hi> An.

In which he made great proficiency in Learning, and then travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into</hi> Italy, <hi>reſiding chiefly at</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Florence, <hi>where he highly improved himſelf by daily converſation with the Learned men of that Age. No Engliſh man, ſaith Dr.</hi> Fuller, <hi>in thoſe times had ſo learned Maſters,</hi> viz. Demetrius <hi>and</hi> Politian <hi>at</hi> Florence, <hi>and</hi> Hermolaus Barbarus <hi>at</hi> Rome; <hi>So noble Patrons,</hi> viz. Laurence Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices <hi>Duke of</hi> Florence; <hi>who (whilſt he was beyond the Seas) was intimately familiar with him, admiring him for the greatneſs of his Wit and Learning; K.</hi> Henry 7. <hi>and K.</hi> Henry 8. <hi>upon his return into</hi> England, <hi>(to both which he was chief Phyſician;) So high-born Scholars, Prince</hi> Arthur <hi>(eldeſt Son to</hi> Hen. 7.) <hi>with many Lords Sons his contemporaries; So learned friends,</hi> Eraſmus, Melancthon, Ludovicus Vives, Grocinus, Latimer, Tonſtal, <hi>Sir.</hi> Tho. More, &amp;c. <hi>who, for his accurate skill in the Greek and Latine Languages, in other Sciences, and in his own profeſſion, eſteemed him the ornament of his Age; upon which account he gives him this following character,</hi> viz. <hi>That upon his return into</hi> England <hi>he brought Languages along with him, and was the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of Learning in our Nation. It is a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was a better Latiniſt or Grecian, a better Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian or Phyſician, a better Scholar or man for his moral deportment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He was created Doctour of Phyſick in</hi> Oxford, <hi>and made publick Profeſſour of that faculty; in which <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity he</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57185:153"/>
                     <hi>afterwards founded</hi> 2 <hi>Phyſick Lectures, and one in</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. <hi>From</hi> Oxford <hi>he was commanded to Court by K.</hi> Hen. 7. <hi>to take the principal care of his own and the Prince's health.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He was highly inſtrumental with K.</hi> Hen. 8. <hi>in the tenth year of his Reign, for obtaining his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for the founding of a College of Phyſicians in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp;c. <hi>In which he was named with great honour as one of thoſe</hi> 6 <hi>whom the King firſt made choice of for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting this Royal foundation. He was choſen the firſt Preſident of the College by the Phyſicians named in the King's Patent; and continued in that office by an annual choice of the Electors for</hi> 7 <hi>years together; he being by them highly valued for his profound Learning, great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and excellent government. He kept all the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> Comitia <hi>in his own houſe during his life; died Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the College, and at his death gave them for ever his houſe in</hi> Knight-rider <hi>ſtreet for a College and Library.</hi>

                  <p>His affection to the publick good and to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the faculty of Phyſick was ſuch, that by his laſt Will and Teſtament he gave <hi>200 l.</hi> to purchaſe a Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for the maintenance of an annual Lecture within the College of Phyſicians <hi>London.</hi> Which ſaid Lecture was to be performed from time to time by one of the four youngeſt Doctors in Phyſick of the ſaid College, and to be upon <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> or more Diſeaſes, as the Cenſors ſhould appoint or direct.

As particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may appear in his Book <hi>de motu Cordis &amp; Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in Animalibus;</hi> In which he hath refuted that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Ancients concerning Attraction, and given a moſt clear account, how the nouriſhment is conveyed to all parts of the Body; how Medicines (although out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly apply'd) have often ſo conſiderable an effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body; And how Contagion, either from the biting of a Mad Dog, Serpent, or otherwiſe in the <hi>Lues Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerea,</hi>

ſhould vitiate the whole habit of the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting the part touched; And how, after the wound is healed ſhould procure thoſe dreadfull ſymptomes ſo long after: All which, and many Problemes more, he hath ingeniouſly ſolved by this Doctrine of the Circulation of the Bloud, which hath conveyed the different particles tranſmitted into it, through the whole Body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by produced the ſymptomes attending the forementioned Diſeaſes. This Doctrine is of that great uſe, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can give no rational account of the cauſes of many Diſtempers, nor the operation of Medicines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

When he diſcourſeth <hi>de partu,</hi> he gives very ſtrange and memorable inſtances, to ſhew how much the <hi>Foetus</hi> doth conduce to its own birth. Beſides theſe, there are ſeveral remarkable obſervations ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the whole Book; as <hi>de partu difficili, de gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidatione falſa, de ulcere uteri, de uteri procidentia,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>An. 1654.</hi> Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> (though abſent) was choſen Preſident of the College; who, coming the next day, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his great obligation to the Electors, for chuſing him into a Place of the ſame Honour and Dignity; as if he had been elected to be <hi>Medicorum omnium apud Anglos princeps;</hi> but that his Age and Weakneſs were ſo great, that he could not diſcharge the duty incumbent upon that great Office; And therefore requeſted them to chuſe their former Learned Preſident Dr. <hi>Prujean,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:57185:164"/>
had been highly ſerviceable to the College, in his former diſcreet and prudent government.</p>
                  <p>About two years after, this Learned and Bountifull old Man came to the College, and after his making an Elegant Speech, he preſented them with publick Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Writing, whereby he gave them his Land of Inheritance to College uſes for ever; and then reſigned his Lecturer's Place (which he had for many years per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great honour) into the hands of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and incomparable <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh.</hi> About a year after, this our immortal <hi>Harvey</hi> died in the 80th year of his Age, at whoſe Funeral attended all the Members of the College.</p>
                  <p>Not long after his death, the following Character of this great Man was drawn up, and is now to be ſeen at the College in a Copper-plate, under his Picture.</p>

                  <p>Doctor <hi>Baldwin Hamey,</hi> Son of Doctor <hi>Baldwin Hamey,</hi> was born at <hi>London,</hi> took his Degree of Doctor in Phyſick at <hi>Leyden,</hi> was admitted Candidate of the College <hi>An. Dom. 1630.</hi> and three years after Fellow; After which he was choſen Cenſor, Anatomy-Reader, Elector, Regiſter, and <hi>Conſiliarius;</hi> and though often Preſident, yet he always refuſed that Office. His affections were ſuch to the College, that he was not onely a liberal and great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour to that Society himſelf, but encouraged his Friends to be the ſame, as particularly Mr. <hi>Francis Tyron</hi> Merchant Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt of <hi>London,</hi> who gave <hi>250 l.</hi> to the College, to be diſpoſed of to certain uſes mentioned in his Deed of Gift: He preſented the College with a moſt delicate and curious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn's Horn, which being richly adorned with Plates of Gold, was Preſented by the College to His Sacred Majeſty, upon his happy and glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to his Crown and Dignity. After the dreadfull Fire of <hi>London</hi> (in which the College was reduced to Aſhes) he gave at leaſt <hi>200 l.</hi> towards the building of a new one; And what he farther gave to this his beloved Society (together with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Character) is ſo admirably and elegantly deſcribed by our learned Preſident Doctor <hi>Whiſtler,</hi> in the College Annals, that I ſhall give the account thereof in his own words.</p>

                  <p>The College had that ſenſe of their great obligations to this their noble and worthy Benefactour, that near <hi>20</hi> years before his death, the following Decree was made in their publick <hi>Comitia: Omnibus Collegis Bonum factum viſum eſt, ut, in gratitudinis teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, Tabula marmorea in honorem Doctoris Hamaei (ut pote inſignis Benefactoris) in Bibliotheca Harveana extruatur.</hi>

Sir <hi>John Micklethwait</hi> was admitted Candidate of the College <hi>An. Dom. 1642.</hi> the year after Fellow; and the year following (though abſent) choſen Reader of Dr. <hi>Goulſton</hi>'s pathological Lecture. The learned Dr. <hi>Clerk</hi> long Preſident of the College, had that eſteem and value for thoſe excellent accompliſhments of mind and body, with which he was endowed, that he married him to his eldeſt daughter. He was of that repute in the College, that they choſe him no leſs than <hi>7</hi> or <hi>8</hi> times Cenſor, employed him in moſt of their Committee affairs, made him one of their Elects <hi>Anno Dom. 1659.</hi> and after that, Treaſurer of the College; and then Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which office he continued for <hi>6</hi> years and died Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. He was Phyſician for many years to the <hi>2</hi> famous Hoſpitals of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s, and in the time of his Sacred Majeſty's late ſickneſs at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> was ſent for by an Order of Council, where he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf with that gravity, prudence and judgment in his profeſſion, that the King (as a ſignal mark of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al favour) Knighted him, and was (as I am informed) much concerned at his death.

                  <p>From his youth he was very much addicted to books; he ſpent ſome time in <hi>Emanuel</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and for many years ſeldom ſtudied leſs than <hi>10</hi> or <hi>12</hi> hours every day; inſomuch that he had early paſſed through all manner of Learning both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as the Fathers, Schoolmen, Caſuiſts, the Civil and Canon Law; and was reaſonably well verſed in the Common Law; So that he did no ſmall honour to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in being admitted a Bencher of <hi>Gray</hi>'s-Inn, where he performed his exerciſe of reading in the Hall before his admiſſion, and then treated the Benchers, Bariſters and Students of that Inns of Court, with a noble and ſumptuous dinner.</p>
                  <p>In the year <hi>1649.</hi> He found himſelf of an ill habit of Body, cauſed (as he conceived) by a long ſedentary courſe of life, and trouble of mind for the barbarous and inhumane murther of his Sovereign, and the deplorable condition the Nation was in: He was recovered from this Chronical diſtemper, by the advice of the learned Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Prujean,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and others; who in a ſhort time brought him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a good ſtate of health. After which that he
<pb facs="tcp:57185:169"/>
might be as carefull to preſerve it, as he had been to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, he (at the age of about <hi>43)</hi> applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick: And though he fell to this ſtudy late, yet no man ever began upon a better foundation, nor purſued it with greater application; he having then gone through the whole body of Philoſophy, Mathematicks and all other Learning. After he had for ſome years dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick and Anatomy, His Lordſhip <hi>An.

                     <hi>liberaliſſimè effudit.</hi> This moſt illuſtrious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nobleman, in his Latine Oration made in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hall of the College upon his admiſſion into that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety expreſſed a great value for the Art of Phyſick, which (he ſaid) many Princes and great men had highly eſteemed, and made profeſſion of; And that for his own part, he took it for the greateſt honour (next to that conferred upon him by his Majeſty) to be ranked amongſt them; which eſteem he continued to that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Society to his laſt end; He having often been heard to ſay, that he did believe them the Learnedſt Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their profeſſion in the World; and therefore as a teſtimony of his value for them, he left them the beſt Library for Phyſick, Mathematicks, Civil Law and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lology, in any private hand in this Nation, for a choice collection of books, to the value of above <hi>4000 l.</hi> Which Library after the Marqueſs's death, was preſented to the College by his daughter the Right honourable the Lady <hi>Grace Pierrepont;</hi> Her Honour knowing it to be her Father's intention, in his life time.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, this Noble and great Lord was a man of that exemplary Loyalty to his Prince, and of thoſe great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and proficiency in Learning, that he merits a juſt volume to ſet forth his deſerved praiſes. He died upon the 8th of December <hi>An. Dom. 1680.</hi> in the 74th year of his age, of a Gangrene and mortification in his left Leg; which proceeded from an inflammation procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the rubbing off a little skin on that heel. He was carried ſome time after he had lain in ſtate at his houſe in <hi>Charter-houſe</hi> yard, to his ancient ſeat of <hi>Holme Pierrepont</hi> near <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where he lies interred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Anceſtours.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas Willis</hi> was bred in <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and in the time of the late Rebellion was one of
<pb facs="tcp:57185:170"/>
thoſe Scholars who voluntarily liſted himſelf (in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick Regiment) to ſerve his Sovereign; in which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he continued for many years, till that Garriſon was ſurrendred. After which, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick; retaining ſtill that affection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that when our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was thruſt out of our Churches, and it was rendred criminal to attend its Worſhip; he dedicated part of his houſe to thoſe holy uſes, that ſo the publick Prayers and Offices of the Church might be there performed; where he conſtantly attended twice a day, and had ſeveral friends with him thrice a week; there being likewiſe a Sermon preached and a Sacrament conſtantly adminiſtred the firſt Sunday in the month.</p>
                  <p>He during thoſe unhappy times improved very highly not onely in the knowledge, but likewiſe in the practice of Phyſick, being more admired and ſought to than any of his Contemporaries in that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, but ſtill reſolved that he would not take his Degree under the then preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Government. He wrote during his Majeſty's exile thoſe moſt incomparable Tracts <hi>De fermentatione, de Febribus, &amp; de Urinis;</hi> which he publiſhed <hi>An. Dom. 1659.</hi> In which book, he hath ſhewed himſelf to have been no leſs verſed in Chymiſtry than in other parts of Natural Philoſophy, having ingeniouſly aſſerted and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally proved, that the generation, perfection and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Natural as well as Artificial Bodies, do depend upon fermentations according to the different proportion and motion of their conſtituent principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water and Earth. According to theſe principles he hath given us the Analyſis of the bloud, with a new Hypotheſis of Fevers and excellent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them. In his Epiſtle before his Tract <hi>De Febribus,</hi> he gives this account, for inſtituting a

                     <pb facs="tcp:57185:171"/>
About a year after his publication of this book, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty was reſtored to his Crown and People; after which, he took his degree of Doctor in Phyſick and was choſen Profeſſour of Natural Philoſophy; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which, notwithſtanding the multiplicity of his practice, he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed for a conſiderable time of Reading once a week (in Term time) ſuch Lectures as invited more than an ordinary number of the moſt ingenious young Students and others of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity to be his conſtant Auditors. Whilſt he continued at <hi>Oxford</hi> he publiſhed <hi>2</hi> other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent books, One his <hi>Cerebri Anatome</hi> printed <hi>An. Dom. 1664.</hi> the other, <hi>De morbis convulſivis</hi> printed <hi>An. 1667.</hi> In the firſt of which, he hath given us a far more accurate Anatomy of the Brain than any before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and his ingenious conjectures about the uſes of its ſeveral parts, particularly the oblique aſcenſion of the Carotid Artery, and the cavity formed by the <hi>Sinus late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales</hi> before they enter the Jugular Veins. His diſtinction of the Nerves is worth remark, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome of them ariſe from the Brain, which are ſerviceable to voluntary motion; Others from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> which furniſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for involuntary: He hath alſo traced the Nerves, which are inſerted into all the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and by laying open their different originations, <hi>plexus</hi>'s and ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath given us a much clearer account of the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the ſeveral parts of the body either in their natural or preternatural State, than any we had before. He hath likewiſe in this book, given a moſt ingenious account how the Animal ſpirits are generated and inſtilled into the Brain, how their faculties are performed, how nutrition is cauſed and diſtributed, with many things more relating to ſenſe and motion and the explication of ſeveral abſtruſe diſeaſes, highly ingenious and probable.
<pb facs="tcp:57185:171"/>
He hath carried on his Hypotheſis about the Nerves, and given a very rational account of the affections of the Head, with their ſeveral cauſes and cures; and particularly in his Treatiſe <hi>De morbis Convulſivis,</hi> he hath ſhewn us, how much former Authors have been miſtaken in their notions concerning Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the moſt rational account that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the ſymptoms attending thoſe diſtempers, is by attributing them to convulſive motions: He likewiſe conjectures, that the Colick, Tympanites and ſome ſorts of Aſthma's are in great part nervous diſtempers, and then finiſheth that book with a moſt ingenious and excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Scurvy, as to its cauſes, differences, Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, Prognoſticks, Symptomatical diſeaſes, deriving their Original from it; with the different methods of cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An. Dom. 1667.</hi> He left <hi>Oxford</hi> and came to <hi>London,</hi> where he immediately fell into a very large and full prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; notwithſtanding which, he found time to write ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral excellent and uſefull books; as one againſt Dr. <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> in defence of his Hypotheſis <hi>De Hyſterica affectione &amp; Melancholia Hypochondriaca;</hi> with <hi>2</hi> other Tracts <hi>De ſanguinis accenſione &amp; motu muſculari;</hi> After that, he wrote a moſt Learned book <hi>De Anima Brutorum &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Capitis;</hi> then his <hi>2</hi> laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Pharmaceutices Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis pars prior &amp; poſterior;</hi> In which he hath given us a moſt accurate account of the Anatomy of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Inteſtines with their ſeveral coats; as alſo a deſcription of the ſeveral Membranes that compoſe the Veins and Arteries; likewiſe an excellent Anatomy of the Lungs; To which he hath added a rational account of the operation of Medicines, whether Emetick, Cathartick, Diaphoretick, Cardiack, Thoracick, Epatick, or Opiate; and endeavoured to render them intelligible by Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
<pb facs="tcp:57185:172"/>
principles. He hath alſo (in thoſe books) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the diſeaſes of the Breaſt, Liver and Spleen; as likewiſe concerning Phlebotomy, Haemorrhagies, Iſſues, Veſicatories and Cutaneous diſeaſes, illuſtrating the whole with many curious obſervations. The firſt of theſe books which he publiſhed <hi>An.

                  <p>I ſhall now conclude this Epiſtle with a brief and ſhort account of ſome of the works and ſome few late diſcoveries and uſefull improvements of the eminent Members now living and flouriſhing in this Royal foundation; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the preſent learned Preſident Dr. <hi>Whiſtler,</hi> who publiſhed his diſputation concerning the Rickets <hi>An. Dom. 1645. 5</hi> years before Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> put forth his book; though it was by a different name, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paedoſplanchnoſteocace,</hi> from the parts principally affected in that diſeaſe. Then he delivereth the diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns, as alſo what is to be found Preternatural in the <hi>viſcera</hi> of ſuch as died thereof. The <hi>cauſa continens</hi> he proves to be obſtructions of the <hi>viſcera</hi> from too thick and viſcid nutriment, part of which being retained in the <hi>viſcera</hi> they grow bigger; and the more ſerous and aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts being conveyed to the Muſcles of the armes and legs, renders them weak and flaccid. Amongſt the <hi>Cauſae procatarcticae,</hi> he reckoneth the too early giving fleſh to Infants. He affirmeth the <hi>viſcera</hi> to be affected before the Bones. He then proceedeth to the Prognoſticks, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
<pb facs="tcp:57185:173"/>
Method of cure and Medicines proper to anſwer that end. He ſheweth that the ſacrification of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of the ear ſeems to be eſtabliſhed by the Authority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and was the firſt that founded a practice upon the doctrine of the circulation of the bloud.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>George Ent</hi> (the Ornament of his Age) in his Apology for the Circulation of the Bloud, hath learnedly defended Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> againſt <hi>Pariſanus,</hi> rendred a very rational account concerning the Operation of Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and given ſeveral Reaſons for rejecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion about their Elective Operation; as alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded thoſe ſeveral Faculties which made ſo much noiſe in the Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame learned Author, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, wrote againſt Dr. <hi>Thruſton,</hi> hath propoſed ſeveral Opinions, and defended them with great wit and learning, As, that the finer part of the Alimentary Juice is conveyed from the Stomach and Guts to the ſeveral parts for their nouriſhment, by the mediation of ſmall concave fibres; That the ſame Alimentary Juice is that, which in the uſe of Vomits and Purges, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by theſe paſſages into the Stomach and Guts, and not by the lacteal Veins or Arteries; That the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifick matter in Intermittents is not lodged original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Bloud; That in the Small Pox the purulent matter is not derived out of the bloud, but out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Nutritious Juice, which likewiſe in Abſceſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that which ſuppurates; That the Membranes and Nerves ſuck in their nouriſhment from the Glands of the Mouth and Throat, whilſt we chew our Meat; That the bloud ſerves not to nouriſh the Body, but to keep it warm; That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine is not conveyed to the Kidneys by the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Arteries (which onely bring the bloud thither to cheriſh and keep them warm) but by the Nerves; That
<pb facs="tcp:57185:174"/>
the onely uſe of the Diaphragm is to facilitate Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by guarding the Heart and Lungs, that the lower <hi>Viſcera</hi> do not throng in to them; That Reſpiration is not needfull to the motion or Circulation of the bloud; That Animal Motions are not made by the influence of the Animal Spirits; but that in each part is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a private ſenſe, which is under the command of the Soul. And that therefore there are no Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but thoſe in the bloud, called by the Name of <hi>Calor nativus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh</hi> (Principal Phyſician to his ſacred Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York)</hi> was the firſt who introduced Geometrical and Mechanical Speculations into Anatomy, and applied them as well in all his learned converſation, as more particularly in his famous Lectures upon the Muſcles of Humane Bodies for <hi>16</hi> or <hi>17</hi> years together in the publick Theatre at Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons-Hall; which were Read by him with infinite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and admiration of all ſorts of learned perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town, who reſorted in great numbers to thoſe Readings. His <hi>Syllabus</hi> of the Muſcles is, and ever will be uſed there, It having a proſpect of two excellent ends eſpecially; One to ſhew all the Muſcles, as they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally riſe in diſsection, the other to place every one of them by his proper Antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Charlton</hi>'s very learned and laborious Works (as his <hi>Diatriba de Lithiaſi;</hi> His <hi>Oeconomia Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis;</hi> His <hi>Exercitationes Pathologicae;</hi> His <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiones Anatomico-Phyſicae;</hi> His Book <hi>de Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buto;</hi> His <hi>Anatomical Prelections</hi> in the College Theatre, with many other ingenious Treatiſes,) have given him a very high and deſerved Reputation in our own as well as foreign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities.

Several weighty obſervations are likewiſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by this ſagacious Phyſician, which other Authors have omitted, as particularly the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Air ſpecifically different, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon the manifeſt qualities thereof, but upon ſome inexplicable cauſes; and produce Diſeaſes as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically different; which Conſtitutions, after ſome time, give place one to another; and are accompanied with a peculiar and ſpecifically different Fever both as to its ſymptomes and cure; Theſe Fevers he calls Stationary, diſtinguiſhing them from the Sporadique, or Intercurrent Fevers depending upon the manifeſt qualities or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Air; The Ptyaliſme that attends adult perſons, and the Diarrhoea which uſually accompanies Children in the Flox-Pox; The day when the Ptyaliſme

                  <p>IN this King's Reign ſeveral Practiſers of Phyſick were examined by the College, and found ſo unfit for the practice of that Art, that they were rejected; Others were puniſhed according to publick Statutes, and others Fined.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth year of this King's Reign, in the month of <hi>September,</hi> one <hi>Grig,</hi> a Poulterer of <hi>Surrey,</hi> (taken among the people for a Prophet, in curing of divers diſeaſes by words and prayers, and ſaying he would take no money, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> was by command of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and others of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſet on a Scaffold in the town of <hi>Croidon</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> with a Paper on his breaſt, wherein was written his deceitfull and hypocritical dealings: And after that, on the Eight of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> ſet on a Pillory in <hi>Southwark,</hi> being then our Lady Fair there kept, and the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> with his Brethren the Aldermen riding through the Fair, the ſaid <hi>Grig</hi> asked them and all the Citizens forgiveneſs.</p>

                  <p>IN the ſecond year of this Queen's Reign, a great number of Empirical Impoſtors were proſecuted and puniſhed by the Cenſors of the College; amongſt whom was one <hi>Charles Cornet,</hi> a <hi>Flemming,</hi> (an impudent and ignorant Buffoon) who would not be reſtrained from his ill practices with the bills of his condemnation affixed at the corners of ſtreets, nor yet with impriſonment it ſelf; being patronized by <hi>Hugh Weſton,</hi> Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Roger Chamley;</hi> The College never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs by virtue of the Laws and favour of the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, ſeveral of the Nobility and the King's Phyſicians, (Dr. <hi>Roper</hi> and Dr. <hi>Vaughan)</hi> proſecuted him with all vigour and care; whereby he was forced not onely to flee the Town in ſpight of <hi>Weſton</hi> and <hi>Chamley,</hi> but likewiſe out of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged places where he had ſhelter'd himſelf (firſt in St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and after in <hi>Weſtminſter)</hi> They being alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, who in St. <hi>Martins</hi> had afforded him a retreat.

                  <p>After the College had thus diligently proſecuted ſome of theſe Empiricks and forced others to flee the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, they conceived it would highly conduce to the welfare

                  <p>According to the purport of the forementioned Letter, the College conſtituted ſeeral Viſitors, to whom they granted authority in their name, that they ſhould not ſuffer any to practiſe Phyſick throughout <hi>England,</hi> unleſs ſuch as had taken their degrees in <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford</hi> without grace; or were licenſed by them or the College under their publick Seals. All others were obliged to enter into recogniſance, that they would not practiſe, till they had been examined and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Preſident and Elects of the College under their Hands and Seals. Such as did refuſe to give obedience to theſe Laws, were by the Juſtices, Mayors and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers committed to Priſon till they ſubmitted to the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of the Queen's Reign, the Surgeons and Apothecaries were prohibited the practiſing of Phyſick; and the latter required, that they ſhould not divulge the names of Medicines, nor deliver Phyſicians Bills to the Patients, they often proving of dangerous conſequence to them. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Empiricks were likewiſe proſecuted and puniſhed, and others forced to flee the Town.</p>

                  <p>In the 12th year, the Wife of one <hi>Bomelins</hi> an <hi>Empirick</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving procured the Lord Treaſurer's Letter to the College, petitioned, that her husband might be diſcharged from priſon,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57185:181"/>
he having given ſatisfaction to the Queen's Majeſty for his violation of the Statutes, in practiſing unlearnedly and by Magical Arts. To this Letter the College anſwered, that her husband muſt firſt pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> for his practice and 15 <hi>l.</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in the ſuit, and likewiſe give ſecurity that he would not practiſe Phyſick for the future. After this, the Preſident of the College and Dr. <hi>Caius</hi> were appointed to wait upon Sir <hi>William Cecil</hi> (Secretary of State) he having wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the College in favour of <hi>Bomelins;</hi> upon whoſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Secretary was pleaſed to expreſs great reſpect to the College and all the members of it, aſſuring them that he ſhould be well pleaſed to have <hi>Bomelins</hi> baniſhed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Some time after <hi>Bomelins</hi> was releaſed from priſon by conſent of the College, having given Bond of 100 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not for the future practiſe Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> nor in any other parts of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was ordered by the College, that the Preſident ſhould enter an Action againſt Dr. <hi>Lewes</hi> (Judge of the Admiralty) for ſuffering <hi>William Rich</hi> an Empirick committed to his care in the Marſhalſea to practiſe Phyſick againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, his own truſt, in contempt of the College, and to the great prejudice of the Queen's Subjects.</p>
                  <p>A foreign Phyſician who had taken his Degree at <hi>Lovain</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> was ſummoned before the Preſident and Cenſors, and examined by what authority he practiſed Phyſick in <hi>England</hi> without licence: He pleaded his ignorance of the Laws, and was diſmiſſed upon promiſe of not practiſing in <hi>London</hi> nor any other parts of <hi>England;</hi> being likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to return into his own Country in a few days.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was ſummoned to appear before the College to anſwer ſeveral things objected againſt him by Dr. <hi>Corimbec,</hi> he having examined and admitted ſome Phyſicians in <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> and extorted above 100 Marks from ſeveral Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks in thoſe parts, whom he had licenſed to practiſe: He was Fined for not appearing, and Letters were wrote by the College to Dr. <hi>Corimbec</hi> to authorize him to cite thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks to appear before the College in order to their due puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Sylva</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> was charged before the Preſident and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57185:181"/>
Cenſors for evil practice, in that he undertook to cure an old woman by ſuffumigation, with which ſhe died; and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Stibium</hi> to another perſon troubled with an affection of his Lungs to his great prejudice. He was afterwards exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rejected by the whole College by reaſon of his egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ignorance in Philoſophy and Phyſick, and was fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> for having practiſed Phyſick for half a year to the apparent hurt of the Queen's ſubjects; and the year following was committed to priſon, in that he had practiſed without College licence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Pennye</hi> was ſummoned for practiſing Phyſick, but pleading that he had taken his Doctours degree, he was diſmiſſed, and ordered that he ſhould bring his Letters teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial to the Cenſors, which accordingly he did; but upon examination was found ſo ignorant in the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Philoſophy and Phyſick, that he was thought unfit for that employment, and prohibited the practice thereof, and afterwards impriſoned for contemning the Judgment of the College and adventuring to practiſe without their licence.</p>
                  <p>In the 13th year of this Queen a <hi>Surgeon</hi> was Fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> for practiſing Phyſick, but upon the interceſſion of ſome perſons of Quality the College forgave him 20 Marks of that Fine, upon condition that he bound himſelf in a bond of 100 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe for the future; which refuſing, he was forced to pay the forementioned 20 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Reynold</hi> was examined and rejected as being very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unlearned; But voluntarily confeſſing that he had practiſed Phyſick for 2 years, the College ordered that he ſhould be impriſoned untill he had paid 20 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 14th year, One <hi>Emme Baxter</hi> an impudent and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant woman was committed to priſon for practiſing Phyſick the 7th of <hi>February;</hi> Upon the 11th ſhe was brought before the College, where her husband <hi>William Baxter</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Staples</hi> (a Citizen) entring into bond to the College and their Succeſſors, that ſhe ſhould not practiſe for the future in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> nor any other parts of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe was diſmiſſed, paying all Fees due to the Officers of the Priſon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year it was argued in the Lord Mayor's Court before Sir <hi>William Allen</hi> then Lord Mayor, Whether the Surgeons might give inward medicines in the <hi>Sciatica, French</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:57185:182"/>
                     <hi>Pox,</hi> or any kind of Ulcer or Wound; Many arguments were uſed by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their practice in this manner: Dr. <hi>Caius</hi> the Preſident of the College being ſummoned by the Lord Mayor, in his own and the Queen's Delegates names did defend the illegality of their practice upon the forementioned accounts; After which it was agreed by all preſent, that they ought not to practiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the 23th year of the Queen's Reign, one <hi>Baptiſta</hi> an Empirick was fined by the Preſident and Cenſors 6 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which he paid to the Preſident.

                  </p>
                  <p>One <hi>Moſes</hi> was puniſhed 20 <hi>l.</hi> for illegal practiſing of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and gave bond to the College to pay that ſum within a twelvemonth.</p>

But returning again in K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Reign, He was complained of by Dr. <hi>Gulſton</hi> and a Gentleman who had taken Phyſick of him, whereby he fell into a great Vomiting and Looſneſs, Hiccough and great pains complicated with a paralytical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; And though this Gentleman ſent for him when he was in great extremity, yet he would by no means come: About a month after, he was ſummoned and brought by an officer to the College, where before the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors he confeſſed that he was no Graduate, that he underſtood not Latine or Phyſick, unleſs it were the Stone which he could ſo diſſolve in the bladder, that it might be diſcharged by gravell; and Fevers, which he could cure by external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. He denied what had been proved againſt him by the forementioned Gentleman and others. However the whole buſineſs being examined, the Preſident and Cenſors fined him 14 <hi>l.</hi> and committed him to priſon. About 5 years after, a poor woman complained that being ill of a ſtopping about her throat and breaſt ſhe went to him, who would and did ſee her Urine, and thereon ſaid, ſhe had an Impoſthume there and would ſoon die if not cured before Spring, her Spleen being come up into her Lungs. For which he was ſummoned to appear at the College, where he ſaid that an Impoſthume about the throat and breaſt might hold 3 months without growing worſe; that the Spleen was in the radical parts. Being told of ſome of his profeſſed tricks in Alchymy, and examined therein, his anſwers were all impertinent and ignorant. For which and his ill practice he was fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid preſently or committed to priſon, and he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted all practice for the future. But his Son paying this fine, and becoming Surety for him, he was releaſed.</p>

In the 29th, <hi>Henry Ieffry</hi> confeſſed his practiſing of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in <hi>London</hi> for 6 years; being examined in the rudiments of that Art, he was found very ignorant not onely in that, but all other learning; Wherefore he was prohibited prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and a ſmall fine laid upon him to be paid to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</p>

                     <hi>Godfrey Moſan</hi> was fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> at one time, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> at another, for his evil and illegal practice in Phyſick, and for his egregious ignorance. He gave bond to pay the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſums upon ſeveral days limited therein.</p>

                     <hi>Peter Piers</hi> was brought before the College and committed to priſon for giving Pills of Antimony, Turbith and Mercury Sublimate, by which he had killed ſeveral perſons.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Bright</hi> being alſo ſummoned, and not appearing, a Warrant was iſſued out for ſeizing him and committing him to the Fleet; Others were impriſoned for practiſing Phyſick, and others had their Bonds put in ſuit againſt them upon the ſame account.</p>
                  <p>In the 30th year of the Queen (being in the year 1588, a time of moſt publick and eminent danger) the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen ſent their Precept to the College of Phyſicians, requiring them to find Arms. This being looked upon as an infringement of College privileges, they deputed ſome of their Members to wait upon the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> Secretary of State, humbly to beg the favour of him to write his Letter to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to require them that they ſhould give the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege no farther trouble, but ſuffer them to live free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed; they being freed from finding Arms by virtue of Royal Charters given to them by the Royal bounty of their Princes and Acts of Parliament made in their favour: Which the Honourable Secretary was pleaſed to doe, and the College thereupon diſcharged from farther charge or trouble.</p>

                     <hi>Paul Fairfax</hi> a foreign Empirick gave out Bills ſtuffed with arrogance and oſtentation of the admirable virtues of a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he called his <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis,</hi> with which he cheated the People: He confeſſed that he had practiſed Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> for 4 months, and pretended that he had done ſeveral Cures with his water and other remedies, for which he was

fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> and required to give bond that he ſhould not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe for the future, which if he refuſed, he was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon. Upon this he procured a Letter from the Lord Chamberlain directed to the Preſident and College, which he delivered with Letters teſtimonial of having taken his Degree at <hi>Frankfort;</hi> which ſeeming to be fictitious, they were kept by the College and he forbidden to practiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.

                        </head>
                        <p>RIght Honorable and our very good Lord; Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from your Lordſhip in the behalf of one <hi>Paul Fairfax,</hi> for the liberty of his practice in Phyſick here in <hi>London,</hi> and underſtanding by the Contents of the ſame, that your Honor hath been miſinformed, as well of the quality of the man, as alſo of our dealings towards him: We moſt humbly beſeech your good Lordſhip to accept of our anſwer which we here preſent in moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiſe. Touching the Man, albeit by ſome travell he ſeemeth to have gotten ſome kind of Language, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall hath boldly put himſelf into ſome Empirical prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, more daungerous in trueth to the Patient then any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe commendable to the Practitioner: Yet upon juſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination we find the man very weak in the ſubſtance of all kind of good learning; and rather to be pitied for his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall conceits, and well weening of his owne ignorance, then any wiſe to deſerve toleration in ſo daungerous a function. A man never trained up in any good Schoole of Learning, ignorant in the very principles of the Art: and for lack of other good matter, furniſhed with certain ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous termes and childiſh phraſes, invented onelie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſimple hearer, and to delude the unlearned multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57185:186"/>
withall. And whereas he laieth ſome challenge to a Doctorſhip: He hath in deed ſhewed unto us the Letters Teſtimoniall for the ſame: Yet we being better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the coorſe of Univerſities then he, have a better opinion of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> then to think that wittinglie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie they would commit ſo foul an errour, as to admit either him, or the like. And having made good ſurvey of the Letters, find by evident proofs, that they are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to be ſuſpected, to have been rather by ſome ſiniſter means deviſed, than by any ordinary courſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                        <p>Touching us and our hard uſing of him, as he termeth it to your Lordſhip, as well by impriſoning his body, as by exacting the paiment of money to his great impoveriſhing: Maie it pleaſe your good Lordſhip to underſtand, that as yet he hath paied no one penny; but ſtandeth bound indeede, and that for a very ſmall ſumme, conſidering the quality of the offence, and the ſtraightneſs of our Lawes in that behalf: and yet for the paiment thereof hath as long a day as himſelf requeſted.</p>
                        <p>And as for his impriſonment, it was rather procured by his owne undiſcreet frowardneſs, then ment by us at all, if he had ſhewed any conformitie in time. For being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as himſelf ſaieth, and having ſo good acquaintance as he proteſted, being offered to be ſet at liberty if he would have put in but any one ſufficient ſurety (a matter of great eaſe for him to do, if the reſt of his talk had been to be credited) He as one rather contemning us, and our friendly dealing, then not able to ſatisfie our reaſonable requeſt, more upon ſtomach then diſcretion, made choice of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. Thus have we delivered unto your good Lordſhip a truth: beſeeching your Honor ſo to interpret of our dealing toward him, and all other in the like degree, as of men altogether abhorring from all extremity, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to do that little which we do, even by the very duetie that we owe to our Lawes and good orders, and by the conſideration of our ſtrict ſolemne Oth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in that behalf.

And after ſome ſhort time being ſent for, ſhe refuſed to deſiſt from practice, or to give bond for her due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Laws as before demanded, wherefore ſhe was for this contumacy of hers, remanded back to priſon.

He was afterwards charged for <hi>mala praxis</hi> upon ſeveral Patients (as his dropping of Oil of Sulphur into a Patient's eyes, from whence an inflammation enſued, and other ill accidents, which endangered a total blindneſs; His preſcribing Stupefactive Pills to a Citizen trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with an Iſchury, by which he fell into a total ſuppreſſion of Urine, and made not one drop of water for ten days, but died moſt miſerably on the 11th) which being proved before the Preſident and Cenſors, he was forthwith committed to priſon <hi>propter malam praxin &amp; immodeſtos mores,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 20 <hi>l.</hi> About a twelvemonth after, he was committed a ſecond time to priſon for offences of the like nature, but then procured a Letter from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (by the intereſt of the Dean of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> his great friend and Patron) for the procuring his freedom; But when the Archbiſhop underſtood by the Preſident and Cenſors how inſolently he had behaved himſelf and ſlighted the College's authority, he would intercede no further for him. About 5 days after, a freſh application was made to the College in his behalf, upon
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57185:190"/>
which they conſented to his enlargement conditionally that he gave a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe for the future.</p>

                     <hi>Edward Owen</hi> a <hi>Surgeon</hi> and bold practiſer in Phyſick was complained of by <hi>Ioan Apſeley,</hi> in that he had undertaken her cure for 40 <hi>s.</hi> of which he had received 10 <hi>s.</hi> in hand, and had given her a diet-drink, purging medicines with Mercury (by which her gums were ulcerated) and other medicines without any advantage. He was puniſhed by the Cenſors 40 <hi>s.</hi> After this, he was ſummoned a ſecond time for practiſing Phyſick, and offered that he ſhould either give a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe for the future; or elſe pay preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 40 <hi>s.</hi> to the College; and if after he practiſed, it ſhould be at his peril: If he refuſed what the Cenſors now profer'd, he was forthwith to be committed to priſon. But to prevent that, he promiſed the payment of the Fine impoſed, to the Preſident, within a few days. Not long after one <hi>Sharpe</hi> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Queen made great complaint to the College againſt <hi>Owen,</hi> and deſired their Letters teſtimonial of his illegal and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate practice, which were granted in the following form. <q>Be it knowen to all men by theſe preſents, that one <hi>Edward Owen</hi> of <hi>Surrey,</hi> a kind of Surgeon, as himſelf affirmeth, hath oftentimes been convented in our College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of <hi>London,</hi> for his bad and unlawfull practice in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and whereas we have found him not onely utterly ignorant in the ſame, but moreover we do certainly knowe the great daungers that many of her Majeſties Subjects have been brought unto thorough his ignorance, and lewd deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, as well by the juſt probation of others, as alſo by his owne confeſſion, as appeereth in our College Books of Records, and yeerly examynations: and for that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth unto us of the ſaid College, by vertue of our privileges graunted by her Majeſties Predeceſſors, and Act of Parliament, not only to have a care to ſeek out, but alſo to puniſh ſuch lewde Impoſtors, and abuſers of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good and true Subjects: In regard therefore of our dueties therein, we have not only from time to time (as we coold come by the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi>) puniſhed him partly by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, partly otherwiſe for his offences in that behalf:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57185:190"/>
but alſo have utterly forbidden him to deale in the practice and exerciſe of Phyſick, as he will anſwer it at his perill, according to the true intent and meaning of the Lawes of the Realme provided in that behalf, for all ſuch Intruders and Malefactors.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, ſeveral freſh complaints were made againſt him <hi>ob malam praxin,</hi> as his preſcribing purging Phyſick, which occaſioned ſuperpurgation and the Patient's death; a Mercurial fume which procured lameneſs in a ſecond Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and death in a third. For which evil and illegal prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice he was committed to priſon and fined 10 <hi>l.</hi> which ſum he paid to the College and readily diſcharged both Serjeants and Beadles fees.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Harman</hi> a <hi>foreigner,</hi> was complained of to the Cenſors for practiſing of Phyſick and taking money beforehand in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of cure; upon appearance, he was interdicted practice and ordered to return half the money received.</p>
                  <p>In the 33th of the Queen's Reign, One <hi>Salthowſe</hi> an <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi> having preſcribed Phyſick to one <hi>Robert Cade,</hi> he fell into a ſuperpurgation and died within 7 days; wherefore he was adjudged by the Cenſors to be forthwith committed to priſon and fined 10 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roger Powel,</hi> a very eminent and famous <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> was cited to appear before the College for that he had hanged up a table in ſeveral parts of the town, wherein he boaſted of his great cures and long experience: being examined, he confeſſed himſelf illiterate, but withall affirmed that he had great and eminent experience in Phyſick, that he had cured very many of dangerous diſeaſes and had long practiſed in <hi>London.</hi> He had Letters from the Queen, which gave an account of his poverty, and fortunate ſucceſs in Phyſick. The College not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding paſſed the following ſentence upon him, that he ſhould be committed to priſon and fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> But out of reſpect to the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> (to whom he had ſome relation) they were willing he ſhould be releaſed from priſon, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he gave bond to the College with ſufficient ſecurity that he never after would practiſe Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> or within 7 miles. Some years after, there were ſeveral freſh informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and complaints exhibited againſt him; upon which he was
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57185:191"/>
condemned by the Cenſors for his ignorance in Phyſick, fined 4 <hi>l.</hi> and committed to priſon untill he could give better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his skill in that Art; or at leaſt, untill he entred bond that he would never practiſe for the future. After this he was again accuſed for undertaking the cure of a woman ill of a Tympany, who died under his hands. He confeſſed that he had been puniſhed 20 years paſt for practiſing Phyſick, but having paid his fine, he thought he might lawfully prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: He confeſſed that he had given medicines and uſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal applications for an <hi>Anaſarca:</hi> But being asked what a Tympany or an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> was, he could not tell. Wherefore he was fined 5 <hi>l. pro mala praxi,</hi> to be paid the next Cenſors day, and ordered to reſtore the money received in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned caſe.</p>
                  <p>In the 34th, <hi>Robert Walmeſly</hi> was puniſhed by the Cenſors 4 <hi>l.</hi> for illegal practice; Afterwards being examined by them, he was found unable to give the definition of a diſeaſe, or any tolerable account of any queſtion propoſed to him in Phyſick; wherefore he was required to give bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe for the future.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Forreſter, Maſter of Arts</hi> and <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> was ſummoned before the Preſident and Cenſors, where he confeſſed that he had practiſed Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> for three years; being examined, he anſwered <hi>ridiculè &amp; ineptè:</hi> He ſaid, that he was ignorant of the Laws and Cuſtomes of the College, and therefore requeſted that he might be pardoned for what was paſt. He was interdicted practice for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and told that if he were found guilty he ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for what was paſt. After this, <hi>Forreſter</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by ſome Patients, of whom he had received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſums of money without any advantage; By others, in that he had bargain'd with them for their Cures, taking part in hand and reſerving the other part till the Cure was performed. Wherefore he was admoniſhed to appear before the Cenſors, which he promiſed; but neglecting, a Warrant was iſſued out for his impriſonment, and a Fine of 10 <hi>l.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for his illegal and ill practice and not giving obedience to College ſummons. About 3 years after, freſh complaints were brought againſt him, for preſcribing a Vomit and Purge
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57185:191"/>
upon the ſame day to a woman with child (and one who not long before was troubled with ſpitting of bloud) by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of which ſhe miſcarried, and died within 3 days. One <hi>Margaret Peacock</hi> likewiſe made complaint of <hi>Forreſter</hi>'s killing her husband by a Vomit, preſcribed him at 5 in the afternoon one day, which gave him an hundred ſtools, and wrought ſo violently by Vomit, that he died next evening at 9 a clock, wallowing in his own bloud and humours diſcharged by the violent operation of the forementioned medicine. Others charged him with agreeing for 20 <hi>l.</hi> for a cure, of which he had received 10 <hi>l.</hi> yet by his negligence or ignorance the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was dead. Of others he had received 5 <hi>l.</hi> upon the ſame account without any advantage to the Patient. Upon theſe and the like complaints, he was again ſummoned to appear at the College, but having obtained a Licence for practice from the Univerſity, he ſent that to the College, and refuſed to come: Wherefore Orders were given for a ſpeedy proſecution of him according to Law, for his evil and illegal practice. Upon which, he makes friends to the Attorney General, who requeſted the College to be favourable to him, <hi>Forreſter</hi> being willing to pay 10 <hi>l.</hi> that the Suit depending might fall, or he be admitted of the College, which was denied upon his impudent and inſolent behaviour.</p>
                  <p>In the 35th of the Queen the following letter was wrote by the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> to the Preſident of the College in the behalf of Dr. <hi>Butler</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that he might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed liberty of practiſing Phyſick in <hi>London,</hi> when he came thither upon private buſineſs or was ſent for by any Patient.</p>

                  <p>To this Letter the College returned this anſwer, That a free liberty of practice ſhould be allowed Dr. <hi>Butler</hi> when he came to <hi>London;</hi> provided that if he came to live in Town, he would ſubmit to the cuſtomary examinations of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and pay the uſual Fees due upon that account.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Raphael Thorey,</hi> who had taken his degree at <hi>Leyden,</hi> was ſummoned to appear at the College for practiſing of Phyſick: He confeſſed that he had practiſed for 3 years, but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the French and Foreigners. He was complained of by one Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> for preſcribing a Vomit to his Wife being a Phthiſical woman, with which ſhe died ſuffocated in a few hours. The College propoſed 3 things to his choice; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the College for his illegal practice; or be obliged in a Bond, that he would not practiſe Phyſick for the future in <hi>London</hi> or within 7 miles; or elſe to be impriſoned and proſecuted according to Law. He readily accepted of the firſt condition of paying a ſum of money to the College, and promiſed for the future to ſubmit himſelf to their pleaſure. He afterwards was examined and had a Licence given him.</p>

                     <hi>Simon Forman,</hi> a pretended <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> and great <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before the Preſident and Cenſors confeſſed that he had practiſed Phyſick in <hi>England</hi> 16 years, and 2 years in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> He pretended that he had cured many Hectical and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid people by the uſe of <hi>Elect. è Suc. Roſ.</hi> in Wormwood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He boaſted that he made uſe of no other help for the diſcovery of diſtempers but his <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> and that by the heavenly Signs, Aſpects and Conſtellations of the Planets, he could preſently know every diſeaſe. Being examined in the principles of Aſtronomy as well as in the Elements of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, he anſwered ſo abſurdly and ridiculouſly, that it cauſed great mirth and ſport amongſt the Auditors. He was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted practice and puniſhed <hi>propter malam &amp; illicitam praxin</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> which he readily and faithfully promiſed to pay. About 2 or 3 years after he was examined a ſecond time, and found very ignorant. He confeſſed that he had never read any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in Phyſick but one <hi>Cockis</hi> an obſcure Engliſh writer, and of no reputation. He then acknowledged (as before) that he onely practiſed Phyſick by his skill in Aſtrology, in which Art being again examined, he was found not to underſtand the common principles of it. Wherefore he was committed to Priſon and fined 10 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid to College uſes, <hi>propter illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citam praxin &amp; inſignem audaciam.</hi> After a month or 6 weeks impriſonment, he was releaſed by an Order from the Lord Keeper; upon which, the College order'd that the 4 Cenſors with Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould wait upon his Lordſhip to acquaint him with the cauſe for which they had committed ſo notorious an Impoſtor to Priſon, and to Petition his Honour that he might be again recommitted by virtue of the former Warrant ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cenſors of the College. Nine months after, this bold and impudent Impoſtor appearing before the College, confeſſed that he had preſcribed a compound water to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in a burning Fever, upon the taking of which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately died. Being asked upon what grounds he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Phyſick or durſt adventure to give medicines to the ſick; he anſwered that he underſtood the nature of diſeaſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedies onely by Aſtrology. Being then examined a third time in that Art by the Queen's Phyſician, he was again found a mere Impoſtor and ignorant in that as well as in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57185:193"/>
Phyſick. Wherefore he was by a Warrant from the Cenſors committed again to Priſon. This ſo humbled <hi>Forman</hi> that after he got out of Priſon, he fled to <hi>Lambeth</hi> as a place of protection from the College Officers; Wherefore the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege preſented the following Letter to the Moſt Reverend the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> againſt him.</p>

                        <p>AFter our very hartie commendacions. Among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laudable Ordinances and Statues, confirmed by her Majeſtie's Royal aſſent, and authority of the High Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, It is not unknowen to you, upon what ſubſtantiall and grave advice, by the authority aforeſaid, Our Society of this her Majeſtie's Citie of <hi>London</hi> is inveſted with a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, touching the practiſing of Phyſick within this ſaid Citie and certaine circuits thereunto adjoyning, expreſly named and limited by the ſaid Statutes concerning the ſame: and that none whoſoever are to meddle therein without our expreſs conſent and allowance. And for that we are bound by Oth, and otherwiſe charged in dutie and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſee the ſaid Statutes duely from point to point ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo much as ſhall lie in our power ſo to do; and for that intent and purpoſe have ordained among our ſelves certaine ſolemne meetings and aſſemblies (which are in the yeare 16 times at the leaſt) only for the ſufficient inquirie of the Premiſes: Theſe be to ſignifie unto you, That as we oftentimes find manie offendors in that behalf, by intruding themſelves into our liberties, and that to the great daunger

of her Majeſtie's Subjects, and manifeſt infringing of her Lawes; So among that number ſo offending it falleth out that no few of your Company are culpable in the ſame, whom we for the moſt part have hetherto forborne ether to puniſh or moleſt; and that only for the good will that we have always born to you and your Societie. But for that we now ſee by daily experience, that upon our lenitie and ſufferance, this inconvenience more and more increaſeth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that both in credit and otherwiſe, it ſeemeth to touch us more neere then well can be indured; We have therefore thought it good to put you in mynd thereof, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all earneſtly and freendlie to requeſt you, that among your ſelves ſome ſuch diſcreet Order may be taken heerin, that the like offence heerafter maie not be committed by them, or any of theirs.

                  <p>In the 38th, 1596. <hi>Roger Ienkins</hi> and <hi>Simon Read,</hi> were both char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for illegal practice: The firſt (being a <hi>Surgeon</hi> by profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) denied his being guilty thereof, which notwithſtanding was proved by his giving judgment upon Urines, undertaking cures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he was enjoyned to pay a fine to the College, give bond not to practiſe, and interdicted that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. He ſubmitted to the cenſure of the College, and promiſed to give bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe in Phyſick. But that being afterwards proved againſt him, the Cenſors committed him to priſon with <hi>Read</hi> and others, by the authority of the College ſigned with their Common Seal.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Read,</hi> he being examined by the Cenſors in Latin according to the Cuſtome of the College, refuſed to anſwer
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57185:195"/>
in that language; being then permitted to anſwer in Engliſh, he likewiſe refuſed it; Being then allowed to anſwer in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what account he could give of any diſeaſe which he would make choice of, he choſe a <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined what that was, he told them it was a flux of the Womb proceeding from groſs humours in the Stomach. He was judged illiterate and altogether unskilfull in Phyſick. At the ſame time he was complained of by one <hi>Cuckston</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the cure of his wife labouring under Melancholy, whom he had bled, purged, and hanged a paper charm about her neck. The Cenſors fined him 5 <hi>l.</hi> and committed him to Priſon.</p>
                  <p>About a month or 5 weeks after, <hi>Read</hi> procures a Letter to the College from a perſon of Honour in his behalf, upon whoſe account the College agreed to deal favourably with him upon the following conditions. 1. That he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe a poor man out of Priſon, which he laid in Gaol under the knaviſh pretence of a debt of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> unjuſtly taken from him under the pretence of curing his wife. 3. That he ſhould be obliged to the College (with good Sureties) in a bond, that he would not practiſe Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> nor within 7 miles of the ſame. Which conditions being performed, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors order'd his releaſe from Priſon and forgave him his fine. After this he was ſummoned a ſecond time before the Cenſors, and charged for illegal practice; he confeſſed it and declared that he could live by no other employment; wherefore he was again committed to priſon and fined 20 <hi>l. propter illicitam ſuam praxin.</hi> About 2 months after, <hi>Ienkins</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> procured a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from Sir <hi>Iohn Popham</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> for their appearance before him; the full account of which is thus entred in our Regiſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 8. 1602. There was an aſſembly of the Preſident, Cenſors and Fellows of the College convened in order to hear and conſider what <hi>Ienkins</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> (whom they had lately committed to priſon) could ſay for themſelves, why they ſhould be diſcharged; they having falſely made complaints of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57185:195"/>
the ſeverity and injuſtice of the College, by which means they had procured a Writ, called <hi>Corpus cum cauſa,</hi> from Sir <hi>Iohn Popham</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> in order to a full hearing of this cauſe before him: Wherefore the College de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Cenſors to wait upon the Chief Juſtice to acquaint him with the truth and Juſtice of their proceedings, and to expect his Lordſhips judgment therein.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly they met <hi>Ienkins</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> at the Chief Juſtice's houſe, highly complaining of the wrong done them by the Preſident and Cenſors of the College, by whoſe authority they were committed to priſon for illegal practice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there for ſome weeks. One Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> a Counſellour at Law appeared in behalf of <hi>Ienkins</hi> and <hi>Read.</hi> The Chief Juſtice having diligently read over the Statutes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom relating to Phyſick; demanded of <hi>Ienkins</hi> how he durſt practiſe that Art without a Licence from the College. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he firſt denied practice, then anſwered ambiguouſly and with heſitation. At length fearing leſt the Chief Juſtice ſhould give him his Oath, he confeſſed that he had ſometimes practiſed, but as he thought not illegally. What, ſaith the Judge, did you ever procure the College Seal to juſtify your practice? No ſaith <hi>Ienkins,</hi> but I practiſed as a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and in that art the uſe of inward Remedies is often neceſſary. To which the Chief Juſtice anſwered, That in ſuch caſes a Phyſician was to be called, it being upon no ſuch account lawfull for the Surgeon to invade the Phyſician's Province. The Counſel for theſe Empiricks objected, that the Preſident and Cenſors had no authority to commit to Priſon, but onely to leave their cauſes to be determined by other Judges. The Chief Juſtice repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Counſel, and declared that the Authority of the College in committing to priſon was very legal and valid. <hi>Ienkins</hi> then complained very much, <hi>quod ob raram praxin,</hi> and that by the preſcription of others he ſhould have ſo ſevere a fine inflicted; upon which the College Regiſter was ſearched, and there it appeared that before this Fine he had been 6 times accuſed for practice, and ſeveral times had been fined in ſmall mulcts. Upon which account, the Chief Juſtice declared, that he thought it moſt reaſonable that after he had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo great clemency (and yet render'd himſelf incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible)
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57185:196"/>
he ſhould have a ſevere Fine inflicted upon him. And by reaſon that Phyſicians bills were often pleaded to juſtifie illegal practice, he thought it moſt adviſable that all Phyſicians for the future ſhould write upon all their bills their Patients names and day of the month and year, by which means the Cheats of Empiricks and other Impoſtors might more eaſily be detected. Thus the Chief Juſtice having heard this cauſe, and well approved of the cenſure of the College, ordered that <hi>Ienkins</hi> ſhould be forthwith returned back to Priſon, untill he had given ſatisfaction to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Cenſors. Some friends of <hi>Ienkins</hi> moving that he might give ſecurity for his appearance and not be reimpriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Chief Juſtice anſwered, that it was not in his power to grant their requeſt, for the Laws of the Kingdom had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that, as a Privilege belonging to the Preſident and Cenſors. It was then objected, that by the Law no Citizen of <hi>London</hi> could be impriſoned <hi>per forinſecum aliquem.</hi> The Chief Juſtice reading the words of the Statute and obſerving that they would bear no ſuch ſenſe; replied, that by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations they might likewiſe infringe his authority.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Read,</hi> he complained that the College had fined him more than the Statute would allow; upon which complaint the Chief Juſtice diligently looked over the words of the Statute, and declared, that the College might inflict what penalty they pleaſed, but the Keeper of the Priſon was not obliged to detain his priſoner, if they exceeded the fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> He then juſtified his practice by a Statute made in the 34, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 8. By which it was lawfull for any perſon having the knowledge of herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to practiſe at leaſt in ſome diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; to which the Chief Juſtice anſwered, that this he ought not to do, becauſe he was not admitted by the College.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the ſum of the Chief Juſtice's opinion in hearing and deciding this cauſe was the following.</p>

                  <p>After this, upon the ſubmiſſion of <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and requeſt of the Chief Juſtice, a third part of the fine (of 20 <hi>l.</hi> impoſed upon <hi>Ienkins</hi> by the Cenſors) was remitted, and he diſcharged from Priſon. <hi>Read</hi> likewiſe by the intereſt of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> procured his diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>About 2 years and 4 months after, <hi>Ienkins</hi> was again char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for practiſing of Phyſick, which he denied, but ſeveral inſtances of it being given, he confeſſed that to ſome few Patients of Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he had preſcribed purging phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being then charged with ſelling of one ſort of drink to all that came for it, he confeſſed that he had ſold ſuch a Medicine, but for the future would never do it, and if in this manner or any other hereafter he ſhould act contrary to the privileges of the College he would readily ſubmit to the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Upon this modeſt confeſſion of his and promiſe of not offending for the future, but more eſpecially out of reſpect to the Lord Chancellour, in whoſe ſervice he was, the Cenſors inflicted no puniſhment upon him, but onely interdicted him
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57185:197"/>
practice; and then order was given by the College that 2 of their Members ſhould wait upon the Chancellour to acquaint him how ill <hi>Ienkins</hi> had behaved himſelf towards the College, and how candidly they had dealt with him upon his Honour's account. This was taken very kindly by the Lord Chancellour, who returned the College thanks for their kindneſs to <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and promiſed that for the future <hi>Ienkins</hi> ſhould behave himſelf inoffenſively to the College; otherwiſe he was willing that he ſhould be puniſhed, as they ſhould ſee reaſon for it. After this, freſh informations were brought againſt him, all which he denied a great while; But at laſt deſired to have all that was paſt remitted, and on that condition faithfully promiſed that for the future he would give no advice upon the ſight of Urines nor any inward Phyſick; and if therein he was found faulty he willingly offered to pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> for every time ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Upon which promiſe, and ſubmiſſion he was again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bartholomew Chappell</hi> appeared before the College and was fined for practiſing Phyſick without Licence. About 3 months after he procured Letters to the College in his behalf from the Lord Treaſurer, Lord <hi>Shandois, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which account the College deferred any further proſecution of him till <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term; at which time being examined, he was found unfit for practice, and afterwards interdicted and bound in a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> not to practiſe for the future.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Patrich Brownegold</hi> was cited before the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and charged for preſcribing Phyſick, which he ſtoutly denied, but being proved by 2 or 3 witneſſes preſent, it was ordered that he ſhould give a bond of 10 <hi>l.</hi> for his appearance the next month, and in the mean time ſhould deſiſt from practice; He appeared at the time prefixed and gave a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that he would not practiſe for the future.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rawlins,</hi> Maſter of Arts in <hi>Oxford,</hi> appeared upon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before the College and confeſſed that he had practiſed Phyſick, having cured a woman (as he ſaid) of an <hi>immodicus menſium fluxus</hi> by <hi>attenuating remedies;</hi> which flux proceeded (according to his opinion) from an imbecillity of the Muſcles and infirmity of the Stomach: He was bound in a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> to abſtain from the practice of Phyſick. Two months
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57185:198"/>
after, he was examined by the Preſident and Cenſors, but giving no ſatisfaction in his anſwers, he was adviſed to greater diligence in his Studies. Near a twelvemonth after he was a ſecond time charged for practiſing Phyſick, which he denied; but confeſſed that he had given a medicinal drink for ſtopping a Dyſentery, which he would not allow to be practiſing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he declared that he gave this drink becauſe he found the Patient to have a weak and languid pulſe, from whence it plainly appeared that he had practiſed Phyſick, and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his bond. But becauſe he behaved himſelf ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and confeſſed his fault, the Cenſors were kind to him and diſmiſſed him without puniſhment, onely interdicting him practice and admoniſhing him not to be guilty of the like fault for the future. About 2 years after he was again ſummoned for practiſing Phyſick (although he had taken his Doctours degree in <hi>Cambridge.)</hi> He deſired that he might be examined in order to his admiſſion, which was done, and he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding fined <hi>propter praxin praeteritam.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph Smart</hi> a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> was charged for practiſing Phyſick, which he did not much deny, but modeſtly defended the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it. He was puniſhed 5 <hi>l. propter malam &amp; illicitam praxin,</hi> if for the future he ſhould be found guilty of practice within the College liberties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edmund Meſſenger,</hi> a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> was complained of to the Preſident and Cenſors for his practiſing of Phyſick. He was ſummoned and appeared: confeſſed that he had given ſeveral purging potions to a Patient, but this he had done in a caſe relating to Surgery. He acknowledged that he had bled a man very weak, and reduced to an extreme low condition with a looſneſs. He owned likewiſe that he had given him ſeveral cooling and medicinal Potions. He was interdicted practice, and for this his illegal and ill practice committed to priſon with a fine of 5 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>In the 39th, <hi>John Carter,</hi> Maſter of Arts of 20 years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was fined <hi>propter praxin praeteritam</hi> 3 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> to be paid within a quarter of a year. Being afterwards ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear before the Preſident and Cenſors, and not coming; It was ordered by the Cenſors, that for this his contempt he ſhould be impriſoned as ſoon as he could be found.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57185:198"/>
About 2 years after, he appeared before the Cenſors, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he would forthwith leave the City and never return to practiſe in it any more.

Being afterwards charged by Mr. <hi>Bredwell</hi> for giving purging Phyſick to one <hi>Morgan, &amp;c.</hi> ſhe was fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> and committed to priſon <hi>ob hoc ſuum factum &amp; illicitam praxin.</hi>

                     <hi>Richard Powel,</hi> a Dyer, appeared before the Preſident and Cenſors, and confeſſed that he had given purging Phyſick to a man and his wife; wherefore he was fined 40 <hi>s.</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57185:199"/>
and had cured 20 or more of divers diſeaſes, to whom he had given purging and vomiting Phyſick; to others, a diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick medicine prepared from Gold and Mercury, as the caſes required: But withall acknowledged that he had no Licence to practiſe. He was examined in the ſeveral parts of Phyſick, and found very weak and ignorant: Wherefore he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted practice. About a month after, he was committed to the Counter priſon and fined 5 <hi>l. propter illicitam praxin,</hi> in that he preſcribed Phyſick againſt the Statutes and privileges of the College; But within a fortnight or 3 weeks he was by a Warrant from the Lord Chief Juſtice taken out of Priſon and reſtored to his liberty. Wherefore it was ordered, that the Preſident and one of the Cenſors ſhould wait upon the Chief Juſtice with a Petition from the College to requeſt his favour in defending and preſerving the College privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; upon which <hi>Anthony</hi> ſubmits himſelf to the College's cenſure, and begs their favour. Wherefore it was ordered that he ſhould forthwith pay to the Treaſurer of the College the 5 <hi>l.</hi> due ſor his fine, which he <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ed to do, and was likewiſe interdicted practice. Not long after he was again accuſed of practiſing Phyſick, which he confeſſed, wherefore he was puniſhed 5 <hi>l.</hi> for practiſing againſt the Statutes of the College and his own promiſe; But he reſuſing to pay it, was committed to priſon and fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> About 8 months after, order was given by the Cenſors for proſecuting him at Law, he having confeſſed 3 years practice within the City, and his preſcribing medicines lately to one that died and to another in great danger. After this <hi>Anthony</hi>'s wife petitioned the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that they would deal mercifully with her husband and reſtore him to his liberty. This Petition was rejected, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now out of the College's power to ſet him at liberty, the ſuit depending being commenced in the Queen's name as well as the College's. Wherefore about 2 months after, Mrs. <hi>Anthony</hi> delivered a ſecond Petition to the College with ſo great importunity and tears, that partly upon that account, and partly upon the account of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they granted the following Warrant to the Keeper of the Priſon.</p>

                  <p>Two years after <hi>Anthony</hi>'s releaſe from priſon, Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> with 2 Phyſicians more of the College and ſome other perſons complained againſt him for preſcribing Phyſick to ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, amongſt which one died upon the uſe of his remedies; another loſt all his teeth, a third fell into ſuch violent vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and looſeneſs that the day after he died, and charged his death upon <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had ſaid that when all other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies failed him, he uſed this as his laſt and extreme one, which in the nature of it would either kill or cure. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Cenſors gave order for his proſecution according to Law. After which order ſeveral freſh complaints were brought againſt him, as his preſcribing his <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> to a Reverend Divine, who upon his deathbed complained that this medicine had killed him, he falling upon the uſe of it into an incurable inflammation of his Throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 43th, <hi>Richard Edwards,</hi> a ſervant of an <hi>Apothecary</hi> lately dead, was charged for practiſing Phyſick. He confeſſed that he had given Clyſters and other medicines to ſome ſick perſons, but not of his own invention, but ſuch as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from bills on the file: he likewiſe confeſſed that he had given various remedies to a woman troubled with the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he was ſent to priſon and fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> A ſecond time practice being proved againſt him he was fined 40 <hi>s. ob illicitam praxin.</hi>

A month after appearing before the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, he was required to give an account why he ſold a Pint of Cinnamon water for 5 <hi>l.</hi> He anſwered that the College had no power to examine him; that he made uſe of an extraordinary purging remedy, and was maſter of another for Fevers made out of Mummy, communicated to him by <hi>Hugo Plat;</hi> that the book intituled <hi>Tuba Apollinis</hi> was wrote by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was thrice admoniſhed to think of a better courſe of life; but notwithſtanding obſtinately perſiſting to violate the Laws of the Land and privileges of the College, was fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> and ordered commitment to Priſon: but making his eſcape out of the cuſtody of the College Officer, he procured a Protection from the Lord Chamberlain; upon which account the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege directed the following Letter to be drawn up and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of their Members to the Right honourable the Lord Chamberlain.</p>

That as we are bound by the Lawes and orders of the Realme, and by a ſolemne Oath taken of every one of us particulerly for the ſtrict obſervation of the ſaid Orders: So alſo we have had of late her Majeſtie's Princely expreſſe commaundement, that we ſhould have a diligent care and circumſpection for the puniſhment and weeding out of all

ſuch ignorant perſons, as under pretence of practiſing of Phyſick, do mightily abuſe her Majeſtie's Subjects in that behalf, as well to the great endaungering of their lives, as alſo to the manifeſt exhauſting of their goods. And for that the numbre of thoſe ill diſpoſed abuſers are moe in number then we can well find out, and more ſubtle in their crafty devices, then we can well expreſs: we have therfore of late obtained my Lord Chiefe Juſtice's moſt honorable Warrant for our better aſſiſtance in that behalf. And now whereas one <hi>Clark</hi> among others hath been greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of unto us by divers, as a notorious offendor and malefactor among the reſt; and finding his dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be very offenſive, and to deſerve juſt blame and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and the man himſelf to be very weak and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the true principles of Phyſick: beſide the manifeſt contempt and breach of our privileges, whereunto we are ſo preciſely ſworne; We could do no leſſe in diſcharge of our duty then to inflict ſome condigne puniſhment upon him for the ſame.

to 25 grains. She declared that ſhe knew whether any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was with child by her Urine, and ſhe was ſo certain in this, that ſhe ſeldom was deceived in four of an hundred: She preſcribed to a young man ſick of a burning Fever half a ſpoonfull of Mithridate in 6 ſpoonfulls of <hi>Aq.

She was ordered a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after to appear upon the forfeiture of a bond of 20 <hi>l.</hi> which ſhe had given for her appearance. About five or 6 years after, ſome members of the College were appointed to wait upon the Lord Treaſurer to requeſt his favour and leave for the proſecution of her, ſhe having procured a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from his Lordſhip. The Lord Treaſurer returned this anſwer, that the College had their free liberty to proſecute her as they ſaw reaſon; and that not onely in this, but in all other concerns he would expreſs all the favour and kindneſs he could to their Society.</p>

her Majeſtie's ſervice; a matter of noe ſmall moment touching her Majeſtie's health and ſafety. Wherein we are thus much to ſay, in reſpect of our bounden duty, and upon our credits: That this ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> in the year 1591. made his appearance at our College upon one of our ſolemne meeting daies, there to be examined for his skill and ſufficiency in Phyſick, and there being orderly oppoſed in the Latine tongue according to our cuſtome and as we are bound to do, ſtood mute and anſwered not one woord, ether for that he woold not or coold not underſtand us. Then being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Engliſh, what part of <hi>Galen,</hi> or other good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he had read; He anſwered that he had read <hi>Galen</hi> all over. Then being required to name ſome one book or other of the ſaid Author that he ſaid he had read, to the end he might have been examined with all favour in that book which he was beſt acquainted with, He coold not ſo much as name any one book of his. And for that he then ſhewed us certain Letters teſtimonial of his Doctorſhip at the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Leyden,</hi> (gotten by what corrupt and indirect means we know not) we requeſted him to impart thoſe queſtions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, wherein he anſwered when he proceeded Doctor. But herein alſo he refuſed to name any one of them unto us. Whereupon his ignoraunce ſo manifeſtly appeared unto us, as we coold do no leſſe upon our Oathes then to forbid him from practice at that time: and thereupon immediately wrote our Letters to one <hi>Heurnius</hi> Doctor of the Chair there, ſharply reprehending him for committing ſuch an error, and for ſuffering ſuch groſſe abuſes to the great diſcredit of themſelves and their Univerſity: who promiſed the like fault ſhould never be committed again. And from that time till now of late, we never heard more of this <hi>Saul:</hi> and doe not a little marveile, how he cometh by this credit in Phyſick, unleſſe either by infuſion, learning hath been powered into him; or els by ſome extraordinary means, he hath of late obtained a ſpecial gift of healing. And thus having moſt faithfully diſcharged our dutie to your good Lordſhip, not with any malitious mind to the party, but in regard of our loyall fidelitie to her Majeſtie; we moſt humbly take our leave.</p>

                  <p>This Petition was rejected by the Parliament and thrown out, to their no ſmall diſappointment and regret. After this ill uſage of the College, the Surgeons deſired a conference to take away all occaſion of future offence and to maintain mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendſhip, being informed how highly the College re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this ill action of theirs. They proteſted that there was nothing attempted by them to infringe College privileges, yet confeſſed that their Bill was very unjuſt and unreaſonable; which (they ſaid) was not theirs but their Councels fault; who deſigning to expreſs great cunning and ſubtilty in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, perverted the true ſenſe, intended by them. The Preſident replied, that it had been more prudently and fairly acted, if they had conſulted the College and taken their advice, before they attempted the paſſing of a Bill of this nature, for it was now apparent that they endeavoured clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and by mean tricks to have procured an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the great prejudice of Phyſicians and the very ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the College. They endeavoured to excuſe themſelves by declaring that they never intended any ſuch thing. But the caſe was ſo plain, that there was no denial of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Preſident told them, that if they had any thing to offer to the College, they ſhould bring it in writing; which if thought juſt and reaſonable, they might expect the Colleges encouragement and aſſiſtance; provided they brought not along with them any member who had behaved himſelf rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſolently towards the College; whereof one of them having been guilty, and afterwards ingenuouſly confeſſing his fault, was pardoned and received again into favour.</p>
                  <p>About this time it was ordered by the College, that Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Keeper of <hi>Woodſtreet</hi> Compter ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57185:205"/>
at law, for releaſing an Empirick (ſent to his Priſon by the Cenſors Warrant) without their conſent.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Jacob Domingo,</hi> being accuſed of practice and behaving himſelf inſolently and rudely towards the College, was by the Cenſors committed to priſon; but afterwards acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his fault and declaring that what he ſaid, was in paſſion and precipitantly, for which he was heartily ſorry and begg'd pardon, he was diſcharged from priſon without a fine, upon condition of his payment of the Fees due to the Keeper of the Priſon, and abſtaining from practice for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. After this, he was cited and appeared, and being asked by what authority he practiſed Phyſick, he told them that he had a Licence to practiſe; which being demanded, it was found that he had a Licence to practice in the Countrey but not in <hi>London</hi> nor within 7 miles of the ſame. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore order'd by the College, that he ſhould be committed to priſon <hi>propter contemptum.</hi> Not long after being cited again, he appeared before the Cenſors and paſſed his examination for Licentiate <hi>intra urbem,</hi> which was granted him, he being found worthy thereof, and obliged to pay the uſual Fees due from Licentiates.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bonham,</hi> being examined by the Preſident and Cenſors, was diſmiſſed <hi>quia minus aptèreſpondit;</hi> About 7 months after he was examined a ſecond time, but giving no ſatisfaction, he was required to follow his Studies more diligently, and to appear at the next general Court. A twelvemonth after he was examined a third time, but becauſe he gave little ſatisfaction to the Cenſors, he was fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> for practice, to be paid the next <hi>Comitia;</hi> or elſe to be committed to Priſon. About 6 months after, it was order'd by the Cenſors, that ſeeing Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi> had been often cited and not appeared, he ſhould be arreſted by the authority of the Cenſors, and committed to Priſon with a fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> About a month after, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Preſident and Cenſors, and behaved himſelf very inſolently, declaring that he had and would practiſe Phyſick in deſpight of the College, neither would he give any obedience to the Preſident or Cenſors, they having no authority over thoſe who had taken their degrees in Phyſick in our own Univerſities. And to prove this, he
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57185:205"/>
brought his Councell along with him, who endeavoured to diſtort the Statutes to that ſenſe. But the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors conſidering the whole cauſe with its circumſtances, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Doctor forthwith to Priſon. In the ſame month Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe was heard before the Judges of the King's Bench, by whoſe authority he was releaſed out of priſon: But upon new practice proved againſt him, he was again committed; after which, he procured Letters in his behalf from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but upon the application of the Preſident, Cenſors and Regiſter to his Grace, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with the whole matter of fact, their proceedings at Law, the opinion of the Judges, their ſucceſs in their triall, their readineſs to pardon him upon his ſubmiſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his errour, and revocation of that Suit commenced againſt the College; He declared himſelf fully ſatisfied with the Juſtice and equity of the College in their proceedings, and profeſſed that in caſe he did not ſubmit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the terms propoſed, he was unworthy their favour, neither ſhould he for the future intercede for him.</p>

                     <hi>William Foſter,</hi> a <hi>Surgeon</hi> in <hi>Fanchurch</hi> ſtreet, was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of for hanging out a table at his door, in which he expoſed to ſale a powder for the Green-ſickneſs. Being charged with this, he pretended that it was his Wife's doing without his conſent. Some of the Fellows declaring that they had heard the powder was dangerous and had prejudiced ſeveral perſons; he replyed, that his Wife had injured none by the uſe of it, but relieved many, naming 2 perſons. Upon this, it was order'd that he and his Wife ſhould appear next Court, and bring along with them the receipt of this powder; which if he neglected, the College would proceed to a more ſevere cenſure againſt him. Accordingly he and his wife appeared at the time appointed, and endeavoured to excuſe this crime by the example of others, who were guilty of the ſame; to which was anſwered, that they likewiſe in due time ſhould be cited and puniſhed. They acknowledged their fault and begged the College's pardon, which was granted them upon condition that for the future they medled not with the affairs of Phyſick.</p>

                     <hi>Arthur Dee</hi> was ſummoned before the Cenſors for much the ſame crime; he having hanged out a table, in which he expoſed to ſale ſeveral Medicines, by which many diſeaſes were ſaid to be certainly cured. This crime was eſteemed ſuch an intolerable cheat and impoſture, that the Cenſors ordered him to appear with his remedies in order to the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due penalty upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alphonſus de Sancto Victore</hi> was brought before the Cenſors for practiſing Phyſick without Licence. Being examined, he was found a very ignorant man, educated in the Camp not in the Schools. He was charged for killing a <hi>London</hi> Merchant ſick of a Dropſie, whom he bled under the tongue and took above 3 pints of bloud from him: likewiſe for undertaking the cure of another perſon for 20 <hi>l.</hi> of which he had 5 <hi>l.</hi> in hand, and left him in a much worſe condition than he found him: He was therefore interdicted practice.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hutton,</hi> an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> being often ſummoned by the Beadle to appear before the Cenſors, and yet refuſing, the Cenſors gave order that he ſhould forthwith be committed to priſon for this his contempt. But he coming to the College and humbly begging their pardon, and promiſing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he would ſolely apply himſelf to his trade, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors pardon'd him his former faults upon condition of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preſent engagements.</p>

                     <hi>William Turner, Batchelor</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> having lived 2 years in <hi>London</hi> and practiſed Phyſick therein, was cited to appear before the Cenſors; by whom being asked by what authority he practiſed in <hi>London,</hi> he firſt pleaded his privilege as having taken a Degree in Phyſick in one of our Univerſities, then as being a Citizen of <hi>London;</hi> But when it was ſhewn him, that neither of theſe could bear him out in the breach of thoſe privileges granted to the College of Phyſicians by Act of Parliament, he ſubmitted to the Cenſors judgment and was ordered next <hi>Comitia</hi> to paſs his examination, as a teſtimony of his ability, and was in the interval forbidden practice. He afterwards was examined, approved and admitted of the College.</p>

He was afterwards ſummoned upon the ſame account, when upon examination he confeſſed that he had given a certain Pill, which he called <hi>Pantalagogon,</hi> and a Cathartick diet.

                     <hi>Henoch Clapham</hi> appeared before the Preſident and Cenſors, being charged for ſetting up Bills on ſeveral poſts in the City, wherein there were large promiſes made of the cure of ſeveral diſeaſes. This he confeſſed, but withall he ſaid, that he was ignorant of the College Privileges, neither had he committed any thing willingly againſt the Laws. Wherefore he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden practice, which he promiſed not to be guilty of for the future.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Tenant</hi> was accuſed by Mrs. <hi>Randol,</hi> who came before the Preſident and Cenſors in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> and witneſſed that Dr. <hi>Tenant</hi> had viſited a ſervant of hers about a month before, and had given him purging pills 4 days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and likewiſe powders 4 days more, with which he had
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57185:207"/>
been purged ſo much beyond his ſtrength, that ſhe deſpaired of his life. She farther teſtified that the Dr. had undertaken his cure for 6 <hi>l.</hi> (of which he had received 40 <hi>s.)</hi> Which cure he was ſo far from performing, that whereas he had a tolerable ſtomach before, ſince the Doctor's undertaking him he had not taſted any thing, but pined away and now was dead of a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi> Not long after, an Apothecary complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. for his preſcribing to a ſervant 2 pills for which he had 12 <hi>s.</hi> and at night a little Syrup for which he had 20 <hi>s.</hi> and after that ſome other Syrup for which he received 12 <hi>s.</hi> which were no advantage to the Patient, he dying in a few days of a flux of bloud.

He was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and unconſcionable in the rating of his medicines, that he charged one Pill at 6 <hi>l.</hi> and an Apozeme at the ſame price. After this, one Mrs. <hi>Whitney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fulres</hi> came to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Cenſors, and charged Dr. <hi>Tenant</hi> with <hi>mala praxis,</hi> in that he had given to her husband (not very ill, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a gentle preternatural heat) one Pill of the bigneſs of a peaſe, for which he had 6 <hi>s.</hi> the operation of which was ſuch, that it never ceaſed from Vomiting and Purging him from Friday morning till Sunday, at which time it had given him 40 Vomits and 30 Stools, with ſo great violence, that he ſhortly after died. He was arreſted by order of the Preſident and Cenſors for evil practice and contempt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> and committed to Priſon. Afterwards, an order was given for proſecuting him at Law, upon which he engaged a perſon of Quality to be his Advocate to the College that they might not proceed in their Suit againſt him; which was granted upon the payment of 20 <hi>l.</hi> fine, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> for practice and Coſts of Suit. He was interdicted practice; yet it was proved again upon him in a ſhort time, having taken of one 27 <hi>l.</hi> for the cure of a Quartan Ague which ſtill remained: Of another 20 <hi>l.</hi> for the cure of the Stone without advantage; of another 6 <hi>l.</hi> for the cure of a Lientery. Upon his ſight of the Urine of one of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57185:207"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Chamberleyne</hi> a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> was charged by Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> for preſcribing an Electuary to Mr. <hi>Lile</hi>'s ſon; and Pills to a Girl, which procured a continual purging for 3 days. The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reproving him for practiſing Phyſick againſt the Laws, told him, that if he did not deſiſt from practice, he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be dealt with more ſeverely. About 3 months after, Dr. <hi>Rawlins</hi> accuſed him of illegal and evil practice, in that he had undertaken the cure of a perſon complaining of an Arthritick diſeaſe, by Unction, Sweating Potions, Purging Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which he was fined 5 Marks, and obliged to give bond for the payment. He paid 3 <hi>l.</hi> 4 months after, and upon his ſubmiſſion was remitted the reſt. He was again charged by Mr. <hi>Patinſon</hi> for practiſing Phyſick upon one Mrs. <hi>Bloſſe,</hi> which at firſt he would have excuſed; but then inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſed it, and was onely fined 4 Marks.

After this, he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a very inhumane and unskilfull practice upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in labour, by which both Mother and Infant periſhed, which was proved againſt him by the Midwife: Wherefore the Preſident and Cenſors order'd his repayment of 5 <hi>l.</hi> which he received by agreement, and required a bond of 200 <hi>l.</hi> that he ſhould never profeſs or practiſe Midwifery for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                     <hi>Edward Putman,</hi> an old <hi>German Impoſtor,</hi> brought a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Exceter</hi> in favour of himſelf; Wherefore he was examined <hi>leniter tentandi cauſa</hi> by the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; But found ſo egregiouſly ignorant that he knew not the definition of a diſeaſe nor the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was agreed by the Cenſors, that out of reſpect to the Right honourable the Earl of <hi>Exceter,</hi> he ſhould be pardoned for his former Practice, but interdicted for the future; and that a Letter ſhould be ſent to the Earl to acquaint him with the proceedings of the College in this affair.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Sadler,</hi> being charged of illegal practiſing Phyſick, ſhe appeared with 3 or 4 of her Neighbours, and confeſſed that ſhe had given ſome Compoſitions, which by chance might purge twice or thrice; but ſhe gave no Medicines. This vain excuſe of hers deſerved a greater puniſhment; but at that time the Cenſors onely order'd, that her Neighbours which ſhe brought along with her ſhould engage on her behalf, that ſhe ſhould not practiſe for the future; which they did, by ſubſcribing their names to a Paper drawn up for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philippus Bernardinus,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> was charged for ſelling a purging Medicine, which he pretended was not brought into <hi>England</hi> by him, but vended for a Merchant, to whom he was
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57185:208"/>
to give an account; but withall confeſſed, that he had given one doſe of it to a perſon ſick of a Fever. Wherefore he was obliged in a bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> to appear at the next <hi>Comitia;</hi> which he did, and was by the Cenſors fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> and ordered to be impriſoned untill that ſum was paid.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Paine,</hi> a bold and impudent <hi>woman,</hi> was complained of by a Gentlewoman for practiſing Phyſick and undertaking the cure of ſeveral perſons; amongſt whom, was a Son of hers of 13 years old, to whom ſhe gave (as ſhe ſaid) gentle Pills, which wrought the ſame day 40 times, and the day after near as many: She then anointed the Child's body, head, and all parts (the Stomach onely excepted) for 3 days, and for 9 days after ſweat him with hot tyles, never ſuffering him to go out of his bed; Notwithſtanding a ſalivation appeared not, but his Jaws and glands ſwelled ſo violently, that they deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Child's life. After this, a ſervant of one Mr. <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> appeared before the Preſident and Cenſors, teſtifying that he was ſent to Mrs <hi>Paine,</hi> and that ſhe alone (without any other advice) had undertaken the cure of his Maſter, and had received of him 5 <hi>l.</hi> which ſhe thought too mean a reward, having neglected more valuable Patients at the ſame time. At her firſt coming to him he was ſo well, that he could walk about his Garden; but having taken from her a Vomit and preparatory Medicine, and after that been anointed thrice on his head, back, breaſt, armes and thighs with a Mercurial Ointment, he died under her cure. She being hereupon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear before the Preſident and Cenſors, pretended that all ſhe had done was by the order and authority of Dr. <hi>Bonham.</hi> But being a ſecond time cited to appear before them upon a penalty of 40 <hi>s.</hi> and yet neglecting to come, ſhe was fined 10 <hi>l.</hi> and order given for her commitment to priſon, with a total prohibition of practice.</p>
                  <p>In the 7th year of this King's Reign, the following War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was ſent from the King's Council to the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>London</hi> for the attachment of Empiricks.</p>

                        <p>TRuſty and welbeloved, We greet you well. Whereas the Art of Phyſick by many unlearned men (making gain by the profeſſion thereof to the great hurt and prejudice of many of our loving ſubjects) is much abuſed in many places in this our Realm, but eſpecially in our City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbes thereof, the government whereof (as touching the practice of the ſaid Art and the practitioners thereof) being by the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto you the Preſident and Cenſors of our College of Phyſicians, and you having alſo from us by our Letters Patents more ample authority for the ſuppreſſion and correction of ſuch Delinquents; We therefore minding, ſo farre as in us lyeth, the ſpeedy reformation of all ſuch abuſes and inconveniences, do by theſe preſents, as heretofore, yet more ſtrictly, charge and command you the Preſident and Cenſors aforeſaid to call before you all ſuch irregular and ignorant Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, as contrary to our Lawes and authority do abuſe that Art, and to examine their ſufficiency; and ſuch as you ſhall find not ſufficient, to puniſh for their ſaid practice, according to our Lawes in that caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. And whereas we are credibly given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that many having been puniſhed and warned by you to deſiſt from any further practice, do yet obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately notwithſtanding perſiſt in the former contempt of our Laws and commandments, We will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you that you proceed againſt ſuch Delinquents with all ſeverity according to the tenor of our ſaid Letters Patents and the due courſe of our Lawes by fine and impriſonment, or by cauſing them to enter
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57185:210"/>
into Recogniſances with condition reſtraining them to offend any more, or otherwiſe as the caſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and is agreeable to Iuſtice. And our will and pleaſure is, that ſuch offendors as ſhall be ſo impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall there remaine without being enlarged, unleſſe it be upon their conformity and ſubmiſſion to you the ſaid Preſident and Cenſors, or other due courſe of Law. Wherein we require all our Iudges and Iuſtices, that they be very carefull and circumſpect not to do any thing that may give encouragement to ſuch offendors, by enlarging any ſuch too eaſily without due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cauſes of their Commitment, firſt calling thereto the Preſident and Cenſors or ſome of them, to declare the true reaſons and cauſes thereof. And whereas we are given to underſtand that oftentimes upon the ſollicitation of ſome or other friend or perſon of Quality, ſuiter to you for the ſad Delinquents after their conviction, you have been moved to wink at their faults and neglect their puniſhment, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the health of many of our poor ſubjects, Our will and pleaſure is, and we do hereby ſtreightly charge and command you, that henceforth neither for favour, friendſhip, or reſpect of any you forbeare the juſt cenſure and puniſhment due by our Lawes to ſuch Delinquents, as you ſhall anſwere us on the contrary at your peril; and that you require the aide and aſſiſtance of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of our City of <hi>London</hi> (whom by our Letters we have ſo required to do) for your better expedition in the execution of this our Royal will and commandment, not doubting but that you with more care will ſeek to ſuppreſſe ſuch intolerable abuſes, and ſatisfy our truſt in this caſe committed to you.

Dr. <hi>Eyre</hi> was cited before the College for practiſing phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in <hi>London</hi> without Licence. Upon his appearance he gave no ſatisfaction to the Preſident and Cenſors, wherefore they order'd his proſecution at Law, and had a Verdict againſt him <hi>de praxi illegitima;</hi> upon which he applyed himſelf to the College, begged their friendſhip, and promiſed ſubmiſſion. Then he was examined by the Preſident and Cenſors; but not giving ſatisfaction of his ability for practice, He was rejected; and about 2 years after ſummoned to give an account by what authority he practiſed Phyſick in <hi>London;</hi> He replied that he practiſed in the Countrey not in the City, but thought he might, as being born here. But practice being proved againſt him, the Cenſors told him that they would ſue him <hi>de praxi illegitima pro ann.</hi> But he paying 20 <hi>l. de praxi praeterita</hi> to the Treaſurer of the College, the Cenſors let fall their ſuit. But he being after guilty of ill practice (which was proved againſt him) the Cenſors unanimouſly fined him 10 <hi>l.</hi> and order'd his impriſonment, which latter was diſpenſed with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that he would at the next publick <hi>Comitia</hi> own his obligations to the Preſident, Cenſors and College for this their favour, which he readily promiſed and performed both in perſon and writing, paying likewiſe the fine impoſed upon him. After this he was examined in order to his admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the College; which examination having paſſed, He was required to take great care and caution in his practice, and in difficult caſes to call to his aſſiſtance ſome of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> having been in Orders and now practiſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in <hi>London,</hi> was ſummoned before the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to give an account by what authority he practiſed in this City contrary to the Statute-Law of this Kingdom. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly conſeſſed; Not by any authority, but by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the College; and told them he had formerly offered himſelf to examination, though he had not yet been exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Preſident replied, that by a Statute of the College (which was read by the Regiſter) they could not examine, admit, or permit any to the practice of Phyſick, who had been in Holy <hi>Orders.</hi> Beſides, if the Statutes of the College would allow it, He told him, that an admiſſion to a perſon
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57185:212"/>
that had been ſo qualified, was repugnant to the Statute Laws of the Kingdom and Canons Eccleſiaſtical. He replied with great temper and candour, that he would not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict either the one or the other, but lay down practice in <hi>London.</hi> After this, he was convened a ſecond time before the Preſident and Cenſors and interdicted the practice of Phyſick within the College Liberties, to which he ſubmitted, and promiſed that he would ſpeedily betake himſelf to the Country. Some of the Fellows of the College were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of for conſulting with him.</p>
                  <p>About the 10th. year of this King's Reign, the following Letter was ſent to the College of Phyſicians (upon the death of the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland)</hi> by the Right Honourable the Lord Viſcount <hi>Liſle,</hi> to ſummon before them one Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> a Fellow of <hi>Merton</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> to enquire into the Medicines preſcribed by him in this noble Ladies Caſe, that ſo they might find whether either by preſumption or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs her Honour's end was procured or haſtned; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of which Letter are the following.</p>

Of this no man can better ſpeak than three of your owne College Dr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fox</hi> and Dr. <hi>Poe,</hi> who came unto her when ſhe left the other, and took great pains with her: Likewiſe at her death, and ſome days before Mr. <hi>Abraham</hi>

                           <hi>Allen</hi> the King's Surgeon did attend her.

                  <p>In the 12th. year of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, ſome of the Members of the College being required to find Arms, the College appointed two of their Fellows, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>William Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> to ſolicite their cauſe (with the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen) in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Fellows, Candidates and Licentiates for immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the charge of ſervice for Men or Armour: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sir <hi>William Paddy,</hi> accompanied with Dr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> before Sir <hi>Tho. Middleton,</hi> Knight, then Lord Mayor, and a full Court of Aldermen, upon the fourth of <hi>October,</hi> 1614. after a ſhort preamble made (that is to ſay, that the Fellows of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians of <hi>London</hi> became Suiters unto the Lord Mayor and that honourable Court, that it would pleaſe them to take into their conſiderations the privileges granted unto the College by Acts of Parliament, whereby they were, as heretofore they have been, exempted from the charge of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) proceeded to the Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, applying his ſpeech to Sir <hi>Henry Montague,</hi> Recorder for the City, he deſired him that he would indifferently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57185:213"/>
the words in the preamble of the Act of Parliament reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus, <hi>In conſideration,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Herein may it pleaſe this honourable Court, not onely all Articles, Graunts and other things contained in the Letters Patents, but alſo for enlargement of further Articles for the ſaid College, are to be interpreted available to the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in as large and ample manner as may be taken, thought and conſtrued by the ſame 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Then may it pleaſe you to obſerve, that in the 32d. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. they and every of them of the ſaid Body Corporate or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and their Succeſſours ſhall at all time and times after the making of the ſaid Act be diſcharged to keep any Watch or Ward in the ſaid City of <hi>London</hi> or the ſuburbs of the ſame. And here the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> requeſted them to note the word <hi>[any]</hi> which in true weight of conſtruction was to be extended, as if that Clauſe had been in more words expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Then he farther urged <hi>that</hi> for the Chirurgeons, where in the firſt entrance of the Act, it was thought expedient by the wiſedom of the Land to provide for men expert in the Science of Phyſick and Chirurgery.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when it followeth, that in this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the Chirurgeons by expreſs word are exempt from the bearing of Armour, it may truly inferr, that Phyſicians are exempted (as before) from any Watch or Ward; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Phyſicians here recited in the preamble, ſhould receive a greater or at leaſt the ſame immunity; eſpecially ſince Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are by their Science Chirurgeons without further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and approbation to be had from the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whereunto mere Chirurgeons are ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Then a grave and reverend Knight, an Alderman of the Bench, replyed, That he took, the words in the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the Chirurgeons (viz. <hi>bearing of Arms)</hi> were to free their perſons, and not to exempt them from the charge of the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto Sir <hi>William Paddy</hi> anſwered, under his favour and the Judgment of the Bench and Mr. Recorder, that the difference between <hi>bearing</hi> and <hi>wearing</hi> of Armour was ſuch, that the very <hi>Etymon</hi> of the word <hi>bearing,</hi> as in many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, comprehended both, and therefore ſhould give immunity from both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:57185:214"/>
And therewithall Sir <hi>William Paddy</hi> added this Reaſon, that by the wiſedom of the Land it muſt needs be intended Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the College ſhould be exempted from this and other like ſervices for that in the time of all outward War or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, they or ſome of them do attend the Armies in perſon; whereof he there exhibited a Catalogue of divers he had from the Regiſter. And now may it pleaſe you my Lord Mayor and this honourable Court, we addreſs our ſelves onely to you, under whoſe government we are ſeated, and with love we ſeek from you favourable conſtruction for juſt relief; which as in your worth you have always afforded to all, ſo do we aſſure our ſelves you will diſpenſe unto us, who live beſt by your love, and will ever be ready to do you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Recorder peruſing every branch of the Statutes recited, and the reaſons urged, and opening every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at large, did gravely and judicially conclude, that the Acts of Parliament did ſurely intend to give to the College as much immunity as in any ſort to the Chirurgeons.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Court deſired to have a true Catalogue of the Fellows, Candidates and Licentiates of the College in number then forty and one, which Sir <hi>William Paddy</hi> and Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> from the Regiſter did immediately deliver up unto them; Which Catalogue the Court then (upon this reaſon) required, leſt others not of the College ſhould delude them, and ſo claim privilege.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon was ordered a diſpenſation for the College from bearing of Arms, and immediately after a Precept was awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord Mayor and Court to commit all other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians or Chirurgeons refuſing to bear or find Arms, who were not by the College allowed, or Chirurgeons licenſed according to form.</p>
                  <p>In the 13th. the following Letter was ſent to the Preſident of the College concerning the death of the Lady <hi>Arabella.</hi>

                  <p>According to the King's command, ſome Phyſicians of the College met at the Tower, and, upon a diligent inſpection of the body of the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> were of an opinion, that the cauſe of this noble Lady's death was a long chronical ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the ſpecies of her diſeaſe was a Cachexie, which daily encreaſing (partly by her own neglect and partly by her averſation to medicine) did at length bring her into a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med indiſpoſition of her Liver and extreme leanneſs, from which cauſes death muſt needs enſue.

                     <hi>Iohn Bartley,</hi> a practiſer in Phyſick, was accuſed by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary for ill practice; after which upon a Cenſors day a Reverend Divine with his Wife made complaint, that this <hi>Bartley</hi> having through ignorance and unskilfulneſs preſcribed a very violent Medicine to their daughter, had thereby haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her death; An exact relation of all the particulars, with the names of the perſons preſent, (drawn up in writing and ſigned with both their hands) they offered to the Cenſors, earneſtly deſiring that the Officers of the College would take cogniſance thereof, and by their cenſure give them all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they could, they intending to proſecute <hi>Bartley</hi> and bring him to trial for the death of their daughter. The ſum of their Narrative was this, That the ſaid <hi>Bartley</hi> being by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Women recommended to them, and having bargained for the cure, and received part of the money in hand, he gave their daughter amongſt other Medicines a remedy which both vomited and purged her (notwithſtanding ſhe had long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under an old Cough) from which time ſhe began vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to ſink and died in a few days after. The Cenſors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering on the one hand the prayers and tears of the Parents, and on the other hand <hi>Bartley</hi>'s not being preſent to anſwer for himſelf, thought they ſhould do what became them, if they condemned the fact for <hi>mala praxis,</hi> as it ſtood reported in the Narrative.</p>

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Brouuart,</hi> a <hi>Leyden</hi> Phyſician, was charged for practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Phyſick in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. contrary to Law; He replyed, that it was neceſſity that obliged him to practiſe, and that he was ignorant of the College authority. The Preſident told him, that practiſing without licence, was entring upon the lawfull poſſeſſion of others, againſt all right and reaſon; But becauſe he had behaved himſelf modeſtly, he was reſpectfully diſmiſſed. He requeſted a connivence from the College if he might not have their admiſſion. The Preſident told him, that neither the one or the other was to be granted without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. About two months after, he applied himſelf to the Preſident and Cenſors, and deſired that they would permit him to enjoy the privileges granted him by the Univerſity; and therefore He would put on the hat of honour (as he called it) which the Univerſity had put on him, and not ſtand bare. The Preſident told him, that it was their cuſtome, and a good one too, that men ſhould be examined uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that this honour was not ſo much paid to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Cenſors, as to the College in which they (under the King's Majeſty) bore the Character of Magiſtrates. He therefore, pulling off his hat, told them that he had been a Doctour four years, and profeſſed Phyſick in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and in <hi>France.</hi> The Preſident demanded how that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and whether he had any Patent or Letters Teſtimonial; which he not then being able to produce (having left them, as he ſaid, in his own Country) the Preſident told him, that he could neither practiſe nor proceed any further towards the procuring a Licence till he brought his Patent, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards muſt be examined, which he refuſed. But when
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57185:216"/>
he underſtood that it was unavoidable, He took out of his pocket the King's Letter wrote to the Preſident and College in his favour. After which he was again ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Preſident and Cenſors, and being by them examined, he was permitted to practiſe.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Brown,</hi> a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> was complained of for giving inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Medicines in affections of the Eyes, which was proved againſt him and he fined 50 <hi>s.</hi> which if not paid in fourteen days, he was to be impriſoned: but this he prevented by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fine to the Treaſurer of the College at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Blanke, Chandler,</hi> confeſſed his practiſing of Phyſick, yet owned he underſtood no Latin, but thought he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it: He was interdicted practice, and threatned fine and impriſonment, if found guilty for the future. Not long after, he was accuſed, and confeſſed his giving of Medicines to one, who (he ſaid) had a convulſion of the Stomach, with infection of the Liver, and raiſed his Lungs into his Throat; which he brought down by applying a Tench to his back. He ſaid, that he may, muſt and will purge as others did. Wherefore for his ill and unlawfull practice the Cenſors committed him to the Compter with a Mulct of 40 <hi>s.</hi> which he paid and was releaſed within three days. He was again convented, and declared, that he practiſed but in trifles; as Fevers. He preſcribed to one man a Medicine compounded of Cordials, Purgatives and Opiates. Being charged with giving a Vomit, he ſaid that all accuſations againſt him were as the witneſſes againſt Chriſt, that in three days he would deſtroy the Temple and build it again; and to anſwer before the Preſident and Cenſors, was but as to <hi>Herod</hi> and the reſt that would harden their hearts. For erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Figures, he confeſſed he uſed it. As for <hi>Surgery,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked if he had his Letters of admittance, had been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or were of the Lecture Bill, he knew not what it meant; Onely for his money he had been tranſlated from the Chandlers to the Barber Chirurgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For his evil and illegal practice, he was cenſured impriſonment and fined 5 <hi>li.</hi> which paying before his commitment, the Preſident told him, that if hereafter he were found guilty of the like, he
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57185:216"/>
ſhould be more ſeverely treated. Notwithſtanding practice was again proved againſt him, and two very unlearned Bills of his writing preſented by the Preſident, upon which he being examined, could anſwer nothing but with ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, not knowing what or whence or to what uſe the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcordium</hi> was, for which he wrote; but ſaid the Preſident and Cenſors would uſe him as they did Chriſt, taking that for the Temple which he meant his body, and ſuch like. The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors unanimouſly fined him 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ordered his commitment to the Compter. After which he appeared with ſeveral of his Patrons, to whom the Preſident gave an account of their fair and juſt procedure towards him. He told them, that he was no better than his Maſter, who was God the Saviour of us all. He was charged, that for pains in the Back he cauſed hairs to be cut; and being asked why, he anſwered becauſe the vapours ſpread: But he ſaid that thoſe pains were a <hi>Sciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> a moiſture falling from the Head into the Whirlebone. Being asked what a Dropſie was, he ſaid it came firſt from an indiſpoſition of the Liver, ſometime too hot and ſometime too cold, about the Navel or about the whole Body. He was remanded back to priſon with his former fine. But the Sheriff taking him home, he went abroad, braved and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unlawfully, as was proved by his Bills, which he ſaid were to draw water between skin and fleſh by Urine. Being asked amongſt other things whether Mugwort had that virtue; he replied, Ay by <hi>Dodonaeus.</hi> Upon this, the Cenſors made a new Warrant for his commitment, and encreaſed his fine to 15 <hi>l.</hi> Some ſhort time after, he appeared again, denied ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rude and inſolent words proved againſt him, ſaying, that the great ones words in this World were as Goſpel, but the little ones as <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> He behaving himſelf rudely and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging no pardon, was again remanded to priſon; But within a few days a petition was ſent by his Wife and Children to beg of the College, that he might be freed from Priſon and his fine remitted; upon which the Preſident and Cenſors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating the miſerable condition of his family, remitted part of the fine, and took his promiſe for not practiſing for the future within the College Liberties. About 3 years after, practice was proved againſt him, for which he was ordered
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57185:217"/>
to pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the College for a fine, and give bond of 20 <hi>l.</hi> to practiſe no more. Within a twelvemonth, he procured the following Letter from the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> then Lord Keeper.</p>

                  <p>After this he was complained of for preſcribing a ſuffumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in an acute diſeaſe, upon which the Patient was in danger of being choaked; and being examined in that and the like diſeaſes, he deſired to be excuſed from anſwering; upon which the Preſident adviſed to put his bond in Suit. Not long after, an Apothecary charged him for preſcribing a Powder to a Gentlewoman, who complained of being highly inflamed and burnt up upon the uſe of it. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give an account by what authority he practiſed Phyſick, he produced Letters from the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him liberty to practiſe within the liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> As to the witneſs which appeared againſt him, he ſaid, He which died upon the Croſs, died by falſe witneſs. He was by the Cenſors proceeded againſt, and an Action entred. He was likewiſe accuſed for practiſing Phyſick unlawfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly upon the perſon of one Mr. <hi>Bonner: Blank</hi> appearing
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57185:218"/>
upon ſummons, confeſſed that he had practiſed Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> 13 years, that he did it by Licence according to the Statutes of the Kingdom, having my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence fortified by the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this plea, (for his bad practice upon Mr. <hi>Bonner,)</hi> he was ſentenced by the 4 Cenſors to pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> and to lie in <hi>Newgate</hi> till he paid it. About 4 days after, he brought Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patent granted him from the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and confirmed by the King: However he was committed to <hi>Newgate, ob peſſimam praxin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitz-Williams</hi> atteſting that Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi> was killed by ſleeping Pills of his Preſcription. A week after, Mr. Preſident propoſed that the cauſe of <hi>Blank</hi>'s impriſonment by the Cenſors (being by <hi>Blank</hi> queſtioned in the King's Bench) ſhould be exemplified and regiſtred, <hi>viz.</hi> How he was by ſentence of that Court remanded unto his Priſon from whence he came by virtue of a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> After this, Mr. <hi>Emmery</hi> a Scrivener came to the College to pay the fine impoſed upon <hi>Blank, viz.</hi> 20 <hi>l.</hi> which was then received and a Warrant ſigned for his enlargement. About a month after he again appeared upon ſummons, where he was admoniſhed upon pain of the ſevereſt puniſhment by the Laws to be inflicted upon ſuch Delinquents as he was, that he ſhould not adventure any more to practiſe Phyſick, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an employment by him ſo little underſtood. Yet 3 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was brought again before the Preſident and Cenſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Meſſenger, and being admoniſhed to ceaſe from practice, having neither learning nor licence ſo to do, he juſtified his practice by the Statute made in the 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8. and appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Law for his defence; Wherefore it was reſolved to put him in ſuit, which accordingly was done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Butler,</hi> being cited to appear before the Preſident and Cenſors, returned this anſwer, That he was the King's ſervant and muſt attend his Majeſty. About 3 years after, upon a freſh ſummons he appeared, and confeſſed the giving of Phyſick, to cleanſe the body, being ſuch as made way for Surgery. He ſhewed a Licence from his Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which gave him liberty to practiſe Surgery, and Phyſick ſo far as was neceſſary and convenient to that Art; which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was confirmed under the great Seal. About <hi>Eaſter</hi>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:57185:218"/>
following, he gave 3 Pills to Mrs. <hi>Style</hi> for a ſore Leg and ſtopping at the Stomach; by which ſhe died that night ſhe took them. To another woman he gave Pills under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a ſore Leg between 7 and 9 of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with which ſhe grew ſick and vomited with great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and died about 5 of the Clock in the evening, being very well before, and going up and down. He left his Patent with the Preſident and Cenſors, they never requiring or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him; upon which, application was made to his Grace the Lord Arch-biſhop, to the Right Honourable the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the Maſter of the Rolls and Attorney General, that <hi>Butler</hi>'s Letters Patents might be recalled; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to. About 2 months after, <hi>Butler</hi> appearing before the Cenſors, was asked if he would ſtand to his former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for practice; he anſwered he would ask his Councell. Being then required to give over the practice of Phyſick; he anſwered, I mean ſo to do. He knew not that his Licence was called in by the Lord Chancellor, nor that a <hi>Vacat</hi> was ſet on it. Mr. Preſident charged him that he employed one to ſell his Medicines, which he denied; but for a ſore Leg or the like he confeſſed he gave ſomewhat inward: But now underſtanding that it was unlawfull, he promiſed to do ſo no more. He ſaid he was never told of my Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s diſpleaſure at his Licence. In ſhort, he was interdicted all practice in Phyſick. But not long after, <hi>Butler</hi> came to the Preſident and Cenſors, being recommended to them by the Lord Chief Juſtice, upon which the Preſident asked him if he did profeſs Phyſick; He ſaid, No. Being then asked, do you give Phyſick? he ſaid, No. Being charged with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral proofs againſt him, he denied them. He confeſſed he was no Graduate nor of any Univerſity, but ſaid that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Latine, and that he practiſed as a Surgeon. Being then examined in Latine, he denied to anſwer; which was told him, ſhould be related to the Lord Chief Juſtice that ſent him to the College. He replied, that he cared not three pence for their Information. He confeſſed that he had cauſed Medicines to be made, and that the Apothecaries took of him 100 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> In his Surgery cures, he owned that he gave Phyſick to kill the cauſe inwardly. Being asked what the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57185:219"/>
Pox was, he anſwered an infection taken in nature afore action. Upon this examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors drew up the following Letter, which they forthwith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Lord Chief Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>MAy it pleaſe your Lordſhip to be informed, That whereas according to your Lordſhip's command <hi>George Butler</hi> appeared to be examined of his ſufficiency and knowledge in Phyſick and his practice therein, before us the Preſident and Cenſors of the College of Phyſicians, Firſt he acknowledged himſelf not to be learned, Graduate, or of any Univerſity, neither indeed do we find him to have any learning, by ſuch ſpeeches which he let fall from him in conference: and as for examination in Latine and in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, he refuſed to anſwere: And for the point of practice, amongſt many particulars alledged againſt him, he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in generall, that he doth give inward Phyſick, if his Patients in Surgery doe need it, and that the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caryes doe take of him 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year for Medicines and drugs. And being charged with 2 ſeveral practices, the one on the perſon of Mrs. <hi>Style,</hi> as doth appeare by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Butler</hi>'s confeſſion in our Regiſter, for a ſore Leg and a ſtopping in her Stomach, when ſhe had no ſore Leg, but under that pretence he gave her Pills, of which ſhe dyed (according to the words of the Regiſter) the ſame day: The which practice we the Preſident and Cenſors do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for ill and unlawfull. The other practice was upon the body of <hi>Margaret Shover,</hi> now againe confeſſed by him, who took upon him to cure her (as he ſaith) of the Pox; but being by the Cenſors asked what diſeaſe the Pox is, he did not give any reaſonable anſwere, ſuch is his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: But her diſeaſe upon Regiſter doth not appear to be ſoe, although he gave her the Unction for the Pox, and other purging Phyſick, neither according to Science or Conſcience.</p>

                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:57185:219"/>
Not long after he was complained of by a woman to whom he gave 25 Pills, for which he expected 30 <hi>s.</hi> a piece; To another he gave 4 Purges, and had her petticoat in pawn. He promiſed her help within 7 days or to give her 100 <hi>l.</hi> But after 9 days ſhe was very ill and continued in great weakneſs. Upon this and the like complaints the Cenſors fined him 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ordered his impriſonment for 14 days, and that he ſhould not be releaſed but by the Preſident's order. About 3 years after, he was again complained of for giving Pills of <hi>Opium</hi> to a Woman, by which ſhe was ſtupified. Being called, he blew up a powder into her Noſe, promiſed her recovery, but ſhe died in one hours time. The like evil practice he was guilty of upon two more: For which the Cenſors order'd him to be arreſted; but he petitioned that he might anſwer the College action without an arreſt; which was granted, provided he would find Sureties to anſwer the College Suit if he were caſt at Law. Which being done, and this Cauſe appointed to be heard at the King's Bench Bar, 6 of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the College were deputed to attend there; and after this hearing Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> the Treaſurer, and the 4 Cenſors were deſired to take ſpecial care in the future management of the College's cauſe againſt <hi>Butler;</hi> who had procured a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Lord Chamberlain, upon which account 4 of the Fellows were ordered by the Preſident to wait upon his Lordſhip to take off his protection, that the College might proceed in their Suit againſt him. The Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain upon their application declared his readineſs to comply with the College's requeſt, and ordered his Secretary to write the following reference againſt <hi>Butler.</hi>

                  <p>About 8 months after, ſeveral freſh complaints of great miſchief done by <hi>Butler</hi> in his practice were exhibited againſt him: As particularly for giving a ſleeping potion to one Patient, who was ſound dead in his ſleep. The wife of this man thus murthered, applied her ſelf to the Cenſors, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> might be puniſhed for profeſſing that, which he did not underſtand; which ſhe preſſed the more, becauſe (ſhe ſaid) ſuch a man as he, might kill many both Body and Soul, every one being not ſo well prepared for death as her husband. She deſired a Certificate from the College concerning Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> and his ill practice. After this, <hi>Butler</hi> ſent a Letter to the Preſident and College, which being read, was rejected. After this a ſervant of <hi>Butler</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Cenſors, that while ſhe dwelt with him, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to him for Cure, who within 3 weeks died and was carried away ſecretly, without tolling the Bell, or any Miniſter being called. Upon this information, <hi>Butler</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to impriſon this ſervant, uſing all arts to take her, which occaſioned her application to the College for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, complaining of the many injuries ſhe had received from Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> ſince her appearing againſt him. Wherefore the Preſident ordered the following Letter to be drawn up and preſented to the Lord Chief Juſtice, in her behalf.</p>

He excepted againſt the Ceremonies, yet owned himſelf a Preacher, and acknowledged his practiſing of Phyſick. In ſeveral parts whereof he was examined, but giving no ſatisfaction, and being perverſe as to Eccleſiaſtical affairs, He was by the Preſident and Cenſors interdicted practice. After this, endeavouring to procure a Licence, it was denied him, becauſe in Holy orders, the Statutes of the College declaring that none ſuch ſhould be admitted into the College, or permitted to practiſe: Wherefore he was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time forbidden practice. But he ſtill perſiſting to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in <hi>London</hi> or within 7 miles, was arreſted, and afterwards cenſured, <hi>tanquam infamis,</hi> he having been cenſured in the Star-Chamber, and loſt his ears.</p>

                     <hi>George Houghton, Apothecary,</hi> was accuſed for giving of Pills to one <hi>Robert Roe,</hi> by which he had in 2 days threeſcore ſtools, fell into a bloudy Flux, and the Emrods, and died therewith, upon which there was a ſuſpicion of poyſon: but he ſaid that they were onely Maſtick Pills, and that but 3. The Cenſors deferred their ſentence for the preſent, he being bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this miſcarriage in a higher Court. After this, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors paſſed the following Judgment upon <hi>Houghton</hi>'s practice upon the body of Mr. <hi>Robert Roe</hi> Counſellor at Law, That it was altogether unlawfull for him to give Pills or any other Medicine without the Counſel of ſome approved Phyſician. For the Pills, which the ſaid <hi>Houghton</hi> ſays were <hi>Maſtichinae,</hi> it is not probable they could work any ſuch violent effect, being familiar and gentle Pills in themſelves. He was by a general conſent of the Cenſors adjudged to pay the ſum of 40 <hi>s.</hi> which he was contented to doe. After this, ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the College accuſed him of preſcribing Phyſick to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, for which he was ſummoned, and appeared, confeſſed his fault, beg'd pardon, was interdicted practice, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to be guilty for the future. But ſome time after he was complained of for giving a drink wherein was <hi>Lac Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> for which he took 5 <hi>s.</hi> and agreed to have 5 <hi>s.</hi> more, if it did the Patient good. He took it thrice, and after the third taking fell into a great Fever, and ſo continued burning, ſtill complaining that the Rogue <hi>Houghton</hi> had killed him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his taking this, he walk'd up and down the houſe and did eat his meat, which he never did after to his death. <hi>Houghton</hi> confeſſed the giving of the ſaid <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> but he thought he might doe it without offence, ſaying he did give it in Charity; but that was contradicted by his taking money for the medicine and compounding for more. He confeſſed it was mixed with Cinamon water, by which it was made much more hurtfull to the Patient, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be in a deſperate caſe; Yet he gave him this <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> not eſteeming it phyſick: but nouriſhment it is not, and is therefore phyſick or poyſon. This caſe being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Cenſors was by general conſent found to be evil
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57185:225"/>
practice, for which he was fined 20 <hi>li.</hi> and committed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to <hi>Newgate.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Leighton</hi> the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> after ſome time ſuffering <hi>Houghton</hi> to eſcape, had the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter ſent to him.</p>

Several witneſſes were examined againſt him, who proved his giving of potions, powders and other medicines, for which he received 10 <hi>li.</hi> and had got 40 <hi>li.</hi> in few months. Being asked what the Palſie was, he could not tell; nor what the Gout was. Yet as to the kinds of the Gout, He ſaid there were the running and ſtanding, and that in ſet parts. Whence it had its Original, he knew not; but for the ſigns of it he could feel them with his fingers. As for his Medicine, he made it not; and ſor the Ingredients he would not diſcover them: What Doſes he gave of his powder and whereof it was made, he could not tell. The Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> returned thanks for reſpect had to his Letters, and deſired that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, but ſome favour might be ſhewn to <hi>Tobie Simſon;</hi> who being preſent and continuing in his ignorance, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to reveal his Secrets, the Cenſors did agree that his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was evil practice, and therefore fined him 20 <hi>li.</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his impriſonment.</p>

After this, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by Dr. <hi>Crooke</hi> for giving purging pills to a woman in a Fever, and Phyſick to another perſon, for a year and half: Dr. <hi>Spicer</hi> likewiſe exhibited ſeveral informations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to the Preſident and Cenſors: As likewiſe one Mrs. <hi>Fitten,</hi> to whom (for a ſmall pain and redneſs in her leg and arme) he had given a powder in white Wine, which purged her vehemently upward and downward above 25 times, and 12 times the next day. After which he gave her 4 fluxing pills (of which ſhe took onely 2) which cauſed a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57185:230"/>
ſalivation for above 20 days, for which ſhe was forced to ſeek eaſe from Dr. <hi>Argent. Vanderlaſh</hi> denied not this fact, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched that he gave her the phyſick by directions from Dr. <hi>Read.</hi> But becauſe he confeſſed that he had no bill from the ſaid Doctour, the Cenſors took it for his own practice, which they declared to be very bad: and ſent him to <hi>Newgate</hi> thereupon, with a fine of 20 <hi>li.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruſſel Hutton, Surgeon,</hi> was complained of for giving pills of <hi>Turbith Mineral</hi> to one afflicted with a Dyſury, upon which he fell into piſſing of bloud, ulceration of the mouth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill ſymptomes. He was puniſhed 40 <hi>s.</hi> which if not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the next Cenſors day, he was to be committed to priſon for <hi>mala praxis.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Du Pont</hi> was accuſed for preſcribing Mercurial powder to ſeveral perſons, who had received great miſchief by them; One of them having loſt 14 teeth; Another by a Mercurial fumigation (preſcribed by him) fell into ſwooning fits, loſt her teeth and was ſo dangerouſly ill, that 2 Phyſicians were called in for her relief. <hi>Du Pont</hi> being taken by the Beadle and brought before the Preſident, was releaſed upon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's engagement for his appearance before the Cenſors, but he broke his word; his brother excuſing him that he durſt not come, leſt he ſhould be impriſoned. But though he did not appear, yet evil practice being proved againſt him by ſeveral, the Cenſors fined him 20 <hi>li.</hi> and ordered his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (till it was paid) as ſoon as the College Officer could take him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Buggs, Apothecary,</hi> was complained of for practiſing phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; being charged therewith, he ſaid that he would not accuſe himſelf, but that being proved againſt him, he refuſed to give any anſwer, behaving himſelf very inſolently and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily. After this, He was accuſed by a Gentleman to whom he gave great hopes of curing his Son (pretending himſelf a Phyſician) but when he ſaw that he would dye, he engaged this Gentleman to the Tavern, demanded money of him, and after a week ſent him a bill. <hi>Buggs</hi> gave a Vomit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which wrought ſo churliſhly, that for 3 hours the ſick perſon was in continual lipothymies. One <hi>Watſon</hi> took phyſick of <hi>Buggs,</hi> who dyed under his hands. Dr. <hi>Grent</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57185:231"/>
the Cenſors that a Pewterer complained of <hi>Buggs,</hi> who by his phyſick put out his Eyes. Complaint was likewiſe made, that he gave phyſick to one <hi>Burton,</hi> who dyed by 3 a Clock the next morning: the particular account of which is the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laurence Relfe,</hi> ſervant to Mr. <hi>George Burton,</hi> Haberdaſher, ſaith, that he was ſent by his Maſter to call Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> to him; and he thinketh that Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> was with his Maſter <hi>Maii</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> in the morning, and further ſaith, that his Maſter was that day abroad in divers places, and that coming home he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that he was ſtuffed in the ſtomach and could hardly fetch his breath, and that having ſitten a while and reſted himſelf, he found himſelf well. But he having met with Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> in the evening, and complaining that he was ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the ſtomach, Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> promiſed ſpeedily to help him, and thereupon in the evening ſent him a Clyſter, which Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> then refuſed to take, finding himſelf well, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as he ſaid, a good ſtomach to his Supper, he would firſt ſup. After Supper Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi>'s man came again, the riſing from the Table he went to his Chamber, where the Fellow gave him the Clyſter, upon which he fell preſently very ſick, ſo that the Fellow went home to tell his Maſter how ill Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> was; who preſently ſent him ſome things to take (which was after acknowledged to be Syrup of Violets and <hi>Flos Sulphuris.)</hi> But he growing worſe and worſe, <hi>Laurence Relfe</hi> was ſent to fetch Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> himſelf, who brought him by twelve a Clock at night to his Maſter, where preſently Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> did let Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> bloud: after which ſeeing him to grow ſicker, Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> went home, ſaying he would ſend him ſome things to give him eaſe, which he ſent by his own ſervant, being three things, each of the bigneſs of a pryone, which he took all ſeverally, and dyed by 3 a Clock in the morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Wallye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi>'s man, being called to inform the College the truth of this buſineſs concerning Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith, that he knew Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and that he dyed on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, and that his Maſter made a Clyſter for Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> which was ſent by his younger Fellow and given about 7 at night, and that about 12 at night his Maſter let Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> bloud,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57185:231"/>
but this <hi>Wallye</hi> was not with his Maſter at the doing thereof, for he was at the Tower, giving one Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> a Clyſter, which his Maſter ordained and ſent him to give: and more he knoweth not.</p>
                  <p>Upon this and the like informations the College proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> at Law, whereby he was made a priſoner in the Fleet; after which, the Preſident preſented to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the following Letter ſent from the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas about granting Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for the Summer Vacation.</p>

Yea and ſince his eviction in this our ſuite, he hath yet perſiſted in his evil courſes, and hath been an unfortunate Practitioner upon one Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> who having well ſupped, and then received certain adminiſtrations from the ſaid <hi>Buggs,</hi> who alſo let him bloud that night with his own hands, the Patient dyed before morning, as we are informed, and this very day we purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to examine this buſineſſe, but that in tenderneſſe to your Honour we did forbeare till we had given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of him and his dangerous wayes. As for the other Creditor, we are informed that the debt was but ſuppoſed from the beginning, onely to remove him from the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Fleet, and therefore that conſent was eaſy.

                  <p>After this, the Clerk of the Apothecaries Hall came to mediate for <hi>Buggs,</hi> deſiring that his Fine might be paid at 2 ſeveral payments. It was thereupon agreed between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, Cenſors and <hi>Buggs,</hi> that he the ſaid <hi>Buggs</hi> ſhould pay 10 <hi>l.</hi> preſently, 20 <hi>l.</hi> at 6 months end, and 20 <hi>l.</hi> at 6 months after; and that he ſhould ſeal a Releaſe of Errours both to the College and all Miniſters and Officers uſed by the College in this buſineſs; which he agreed to, and ſince hath paid 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ſealed the Bond and Releaſes. Within 2 months after this Dr. <hi>Hawlye</hi> accuſed Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> for giving Phyſick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon order was given for his citation, but producing Dr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> his Bills for the Phyſick given, he was diſcharged. He was likewiſe accuſed for ſuing one <hi>Smith</hi> in the Exchequer for Phyſick, and that in his Plea he termed himſelf <hi>[in Medicina peritus]</hi> and ſued <hi>pro curatione luis venereae.</hi> But to this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he ſaid, that one Dr. <hi>Cartmeale</hi> gave directions to that <hi>Smith</hi> for cure of the Pox. In <hi>Iuly</hi> 1633. Dr. <hi>Fox</hi> preſented to the College Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> his Bond, which was forfeited for not paying of 20 <hi>l.</hi> which his Sureties neglected and refuſed to pay, though they were put in mind thereof. It was therefore thought fit by the College that an Action ſhould be entred againſt them. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Towneſend</hi> and Mr. <hi>Broomſall</hi> (Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> his Sureties) appeared, but refuſed to pay the money due to the College for which they ſtood bound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Bond was forthwith put in ſuit by the College. After this, Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> his Bills were brought to the College, and he complained of by Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi> for practice. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57185:233"/>
ordered by the College that <hi>Buggs</hi> ſhould be arreſted with a <hi>Quo minus</hi> out of the Exchequer, notwithſtanding he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Doctour's degree at <hi>Leyden.</hi> After this, the Phyſicians place in Chriſt's Church Hoſpital being void by the death of Dr. <hi>Clement,</hi> and it being juſtly feared that <hi>Buggs</hi> or ſome other irregular man was like (by the favour <hi>Buggs</hi> had with the Officers of that houſe) to get into that place, to the prejudice and diſhonour of the College; It was therefore conſidered how to prevent that miſchief. Some made him incapable, becauſe he could not practiſe in this City without authority of the College, which was held a cauſe ſufficient to exclude him. Others ſaid that the Founder of that place, Mr. <hi>Beale,</hi> gave it firſt to Mr. <hi>Bredwell,</hi> and ordained, that after him one of the College ſhould always ſucceed into the vacancy. That reaſon was alſo allowed effectual as the other. In fine it was concluded, that a Letter ſhould be written from the College to the Lord Mayor to give him notice of both: which was accordingly done and preſented by Dr. <hi>Baskervile.</hi> After this the <hi>Preſident</hi> having heard by Dr. <hi>Oxenbridge,</hi> that there was further cauſe for the excluſion of <hi>Buggs</hi> found in the Regiſter of Chriſt's Church, of this tenour; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Phyſician that is to be choſen to that place, is to be a Learned man, well qualified, and approved by the College of Phyſicians in <hi>London;</hi> He went himſelf together with Dr. <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> to the Lord Mayor, to advertiſe him of the intention that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Chriſt's Church Hoſpital had to thruſt in <hi>Buggs</hi> as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to that Hoſpital contrary to all Law and Reaſon, and the expreſs words of the Donour found in the Regiſter. By whom they were received reſpectfully, and with a great deal of aſſurance, that he would ſee the College ſhould have right and favour ſhewn them: and thereupon he ſent immediately the Sword-bearer to the Preſident of the Hoſpital to certify him of the College's reaſons. Mr. <hi>Buggs</hi> after this upon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons appeared, and being demanded how long he had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Phyſick, he anſwered that he had practiſed 2 years or more, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince he returned with the title of Doctour from <hi>Leyden.</hi> Being further demanded in what School or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he had been bred and brought up, he anſwered, that he had never been an Academick, or brought up in any Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57185:233"/>
but yet he had been bred in ſuch a way as might well enough enable him to become a <hi>Doctour</hi> of Phyſick, which was in a Poticary's ſhop; which he held ſufficient to make a Phyſician. Upon which Mr. Preſident gave expreſs charge to the ſaid <hi>Buggs</hi> that he ſhould not any more preſume to practiſe Phyſick, being contrary to the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which were then read out of the book of Statutes to him. He then asked how he ſhould live, or what he ſhould doe? It was replied, that he ſhould return to his trade, and ſet up an Apothecary's ſhop; ſo he might live honeſtly in the profeſſion wherein he had ſpent his life, and have the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the College, which had been formerly offered by ſome of the Fellows, who for his better encouragement had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him half their practice. But he ſaid, that would be too great a diſhonour to him. Whereupon the Beadle was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take out the Copy of an Information given in againſt <hi>Buggs</hi> in the Court of Exchequer, <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. for 2 years prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, being an exact pattern drawn by great <hi>Councel</hi> to direct the College for the future in their proceedings againſt unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſers; whom the College till this time had ſued onely for one years practice. It was alſo ordered by the Preſident and the College, that out of hand a Suit ſhould be commenced againſt <hi>Buggs</hi> for 2 years practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iames Winter, Surgeon,</hi> was complained of by <hi>Ioan Kelloway,</hi> in that ſhe being lamiſh and troubled with a running pain, <hi>Winter</hi> undertook her Cure about <hi>Midſummer</hi> was 2 years; for which cure, he was to have a Hen and 20 Chickens, and a Lamb when ſhe was well. After this, <hi>Winter</hi> ſent her ſome <hi>Diaprunis</hi> (as he called it) to purge her, by his Wife; who alſo after 3 days gave her a Pill, upon which ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould ſpit. At <hi>Michaclmas</hi> following he gave her the unction, anointing her Legs, Thighs and Arms twice, upon which ſhe ſpit 20 days. After this, he gave her Purges, Diet-drinks and Pills; He uſed alſo Cupping-glaſſes, Veſicatories, and made Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues in her Legs, promiſing to make her well: And for this cure he had 10 Sheep valued at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> onely he gave <hi>Harry Kelloway</hi> her husband 10 <hi>s.</hi> in money back. His wife alſo after her anointing, took from this complainant her Waſtcoat, her Smock and her Head-geer, ſaying they were her Fees if they
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57185:234"/>
were worth 20 <hi>l.</hi> But this complainant yet not finding her ſelf well, about <hi>May</hi> laſt, by his appointment, ſhe had the Unction again, and Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> was once preſent at her anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Upon this ſhe fluxed more than before, which he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid, that now ſhe would be a ſound woman; and after, he gave her diet-drinks and pills, and then his wife gave her 2 Clyſters; for which ſhe had a brood Gooſe and 2 Goſlings; for this he alſo challenged further content, but the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give it unleſs his wife were well, and then he would give him 20 <hi>s.</hi> more.</p>

                     <hi>William Trigge, Shoemaker,</hi> was ſummoned to appear before the Cenſors for practice objected againſt him; He confeſſed his practiſing Phyſick in the Rickets, bloudy Flux, Plague and Gout; but now he underſtood that he ought not, he would obſerve the Preſident's commands and abſtain totally from practice. Yet notwithſtanding this engagement, <hi>Elizabeth Goodridge</hi> within 5 months exhibited complaints againſt him, for giving her husband Phyſick, of whom he received 20 <hi>s.</hi> for which ſhe was conſtrained by reaſon of her poverty to pawn divers of her cloaths and houſhold-ſtuff; And he was to have 40 <hi>s.</hi> more at the end of the Cure. <hi>Trigge</hi> preſcribed him Drinks, Pills, Plaſters, Vomits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being called and asked whether he were the King's or Queen's ſervant, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to anſwer, but ſaid he was God's. He confeſſed his giving the Phyſick charged againſt him by <hi>Goodridge.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cenſors taking into their conſideration the practice of the ſaid <hi>William Trigge</hi> upon <hi>Thomas Goodridge,</hi> and examining particularly the manner thereof, did cenſure it to be evil, and therefore fined him 10 <hi>l.</hi> and committed him to the Compter priſon in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> till he ſhould pay his fine. About 4. months after this cenſure, Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> the Surgeon informed, that upon the 13th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1631. <hi>Trigge</hi> came to a woman ſick of a burning Fever, to whom he gave a Clyſter and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and on the 14th a Vomit of his own preparing; after which ſhe grew worſe, ſtill declining, till the 18th, upon which day ſhe died. <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. <hi>Philip Tiller</hi> of <hi>London-bridge</hi> Cloth worker and <hi>William Ley</hi> of <hi>Lumbardſtreet</hi> (who were bail for <hi>Trigge)</hi> deſired to be releaſed from their bail by the College. Anſwer was made, that if they reſtored the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57185:234"/>
they ſhould be freed. Dr. <hi>Winſton</hi> likewiſe propoſed to the Preſident and College the following requeſt from the Warden of the Fleet in reference to <hi>Trigge,</hi> viz. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was 25 <hi>l.</hi> recovered from <hi>Trigge,</hi> to the which the Warden of the Fleet is liable, in regard of his Eſcape: Yet now the Warden of the Fleet requeſts a mitigation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the priſoner is eſcaped; and is willing forthwith to pay to the College 20 <hi>l.</hi> The College at the motion of Dr. <hi>Winſton</hi> was not unwilling to accept that ſum, leaving the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Dr. <hi>Winſton</hi>'s diſcretion; giving him full authority to receive the ſaid 20 <hi>l.</hi> to the uſe of the College; with this proviſo, that if hereafter the ſaid Warden of the Fleet ſhall recover the full ſum, that then he ſhall pay the other 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the College, and not otherwiſe. Which 20 <hi>l.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hodſon</hi> paid Dr. <hi>Fox</hi> the College Treaſurer, having received it of the Warden of the Fleet as part of the debt due from <hi>Trigge,</hi> with a promiſe of paying the reſt in caſe he recovered it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Dr. <hi>Spicer</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hodſon</hi> gave an account to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Trigge</hi>'s practice, and Dr. <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> complained of his undertaking to cure an Hydropical woman by way of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſis,</hi> and that the patient died within 14 days. Upon this <hi>Trigge</hi> was ſummoned, but not appearing, his wife came to excuſe her husband's abſence; She confeſſed he was by his breeding a Shoemaker, but now he made profeſſion onely of diſtilling waters, and that he did uſe to give certain Powders and Cordials to ſuch as were infected with the Plague. <hi>Henry Aron, Surgeon,</hi> appeared and averred that he being called to view the body of one Widow <hi>Thompſon</hi> (whom <hi>Trigge</hi> had undertaken to cure of a Dropſie by <hi>Paracenteſis)</hi> found, that the ſaid <hi>Trigge</hi> had opened her belly himſelf in a place not proper for that operation, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the midſt of the direct Muſcle on the right ſide. Dr. <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> and Dr. <hi>Rant</hi> were likewiſe preſent with Mr. <hi>Aron</hi> at that time, and were witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that indiſcreet and Artleſs operation. Wherefore <hi>Trigge</hi> being brought to the College by a Meſſenger of the Council table, and charged with opening the body of an Hydropical woman, whereupon death enſued; he confeſſed the fact. And being demanded how he durſt preſume to undertake ſuch an operation, being a Laſt-maker by his profeſſion; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57185:235"/>
that he had ſeen Mrs. <hi>Nobes</hi> a Midwife open a body dead of a Dropſie, and that thereby he learned to make ſome obſervations, touching the diſſection of Mens bodies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he excuſed himſelf, that what he did was done in the preſence and with the aſſiſtance of a Phyſician, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But the Cenſors judged it a bold, dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull practice, for which they committed him to <hi>Newgate</hi> and fined him 20 <hi>l.</hi> After this <hi>Trigge</hi>'s wife appeared in the behalf of her husband lying in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and being queſtioned touching his practice; ſhe confeſſed that he made his Pills and Electuaries himſelf, and particularly Mithridate and <hi>London</hi> Treacle. That he had practiſed Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> 4 years ſince he came from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and that otherwiſe he could not have lived. In concluſion, ſhe paid 20 <hi>l.</hi> for her husband's fine; deſiring he might be releaſed from <hi>Newgate.</hi> Whereupon a Warrant was ſigned by the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for his Enlargement. A week after he was again ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to appear before the Cenſors, who interdicted him the practice of Phyſick any more, upon pain of the ſevereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. He then profeſſed, that he was bred and brought up in diſtilling of waters, to which trade he purpoſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf. And complained that many Diſtillers of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> in <hi>London</hi> made uſe of the Lees of Starch Waſh and ſuch traſh to the great abuſe of the King's Subjects, which he was able to make out. But practice being afterwards proved againſt him, he was proſecuted at Common Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Cooke, Surgeon,</hi> being charged for practiſing Phyſick, confeſſed that he gave ſome few medicines to the Poor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked how he came to underſtand that profeſſion, he ſaid from his Maſter <hi>Mollins.</hi> He was admoniſhed to abſtain from future practice, which he promiſed, and ſo was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. But about 3 months after, Dr. <hi>Winſton</hi> complained that he had Salivated a Woman, upon which Salivation ſhe died in 4 days. Wherefore, he was ſent to Priſon and fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> But upon his payment of 40 <hi>s.</hi> and confeſſing his fault, he was taken out of Priſon. After this, he was again convened and accuſed for giving Mercurial Pills; he craved pardon for his offence, and promiſed never to offend again, and ſo he was ſent away. Yet within a few years, he was again
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57185:235"/>
queſtioned concerning the death of a perſon of great Quality, to whom he gave (as he affirmed) firſt half an ounce of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and the like quantity of <hi>Manna</hi> for a bole, then <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> 5 times. The flux began to riſe the third day: In concluſion this honourable Lady died. His Cenſure was, 1. To give ſecurity by bond of 100 <hi>l.</hi> not to practiſe the ſame way of fluxing by Mercury. 2. To acknowledge his ill practice to the Lady <hi>Knevet,</hi> and to bring back a teſtimony from her to the College, that he had confeſſed the ſame. He according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought the enſuing Letter.</p>

                     <hi>Humphrey Beven, Chymiſt,</hi> was complained of for giving a Vomit to one <hi>Royſton</hi>'s daughter, who in the time of her vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting fell into convulſions and died.

The Preſident and Cenſors did not think this buſineſs fit for them to cenſure; and therefore it was referred to the Courts of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Bowden, Surgeon,</hi> confeſſed that he directed ſeverl Medicines (as Purges, Diet-drinks, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to a Patient for the <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> and thought it lawfull, he being ſo taught by his Maſter. The Cenſors examining the caſe could not diſcover it to be a <hi>Gonorrhoea impura,</hi> but onely a ſtrain gotten by a fall, which cauſed the running of the reins. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice having been 2 or 3 years paſt, the Cenſors inflicted no other puniſhment upon him, but onely diſcommuned him untill he ſubmitted to the College, which was done by the conſent of all the Fellows, and ſignified by the Beadle to all their Members. About the ſame time one <hi>Flud</hi> an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary was likewiſe diſcommuned, who afterwards ſubmitted himſelf to the College, and craved a releaſe from their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; which was granted, he paying the mulct of 20 <hi>s.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sweno</hi> Clark and Executour to one Mr. <hi>William Turner</hi> preſented a Petition againſt Mr. <hi>Clapham,</hi> an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> for giving phyſick to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> whoſe bills of charges he preſented. Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> appeared, to whom Mr. Preſident declared the complaint made againſt him concerning his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Phyſick upon one Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> and of his ſuing the Patient's Executours, and required him to produce what Doctours bills he had in that caſe. Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> anſwered, that he had Dr. <hi>Peter Moyden</hi> alias <hi>Muden</hi> his Bills, even from <hi>September,</hi> 1630. till the latter end of <hi>March</hi> following: which
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57185:237"/>
Dr. <hi>Moyden</hi> was ſometime his fellow-ſervant in Mr. <hi>Garret</hi>'s houſe, but afterwards fell to the ſtudy of Phyſick. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the Doctour never was with Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> onely ſaw his urines at Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi>'s ſhop, and was inſtructed by him of the diſeaſe. He ſaith farther that Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> much deſpiſed Phyſick and Phyſicians, yet relied upon him, and was content at the laſt that Dr. <hi>Bruart</hi> ſhould be brought to him, who came (as he ſaid) too late.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Margaret Woodman,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Alhallows</hi> in the Wall, who kept Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> in his ſickneſs, ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> did uſually look upon Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s urines, cauſing them often to be turned, ſometimes liking and ſometimes diſliking them: and that all the time ſhe was with him, which was 10 weeks, ſhe knew of no other Doctour but Mr. <hi>Clapham:</hi> and ſhe ſaith farther, that by his bathing and medicining him, his Legs did not onely ſwell, but that his Toes rotted, and his Legs became extremely noiſome.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>William Kerbye,</hi> in <hi>Maiden lane, Merchant,</hi> ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> being taken with a giddineſs fell, and by his fall hurt his Hip, for which he did adviſe him to uſe Counſel, and he anſwered, he uſed Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> who was his old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; but Mr. <hi>Kerbye</hi> wiſhing him to uſe better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he ſaid that Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> told him he had the Counſel of a Doctour, and further ſaith, that then he could uſe his armes well, and that even to his death almoſt he had his ſenſes well: and he ſaith that he told Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> had received of him 50 <hi>li.</hi> to which he anſwered that he had had of him twice as much. And he ſaith that Mr. <hi>Bruart</hi> coming to him, ſaid he was called too late.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Shelberrye, Scr.</hi> faith that Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> had his fall about the 7th. of <hi>October</hi> laſt, to whom Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> ſaid he feared the ſwimming of his head, of which he had a fit 20 years ago coming from <hi>Paul</hi>'s; and he asked Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> whoſe Counſel he uſed? he ſaid Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> was his ancient Apothecary and one that knew his body well, yet that he had moneys from him for a Doctour.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Slater</hi> ſaith, that he was with Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> the day he dyed, and that he heard Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Maid blame Mr. <hi>Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who ſhe ſaid had received of her Maſter in his ſickneſs well near 100 <hi>li.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> ſaith, that if he would have taken 5 <hi>li.</hi> or 6 <hi>li.</hi> for his Bill, that then this complaint had not been made.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do certify to all whom it may concerne, that we have juſt cauſe to think that the Patient hath been unconſcionably and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably dealt withall.

By this Letter, the College is commanded to take exact information from the relation of ſuch as were preſent, of Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>'s ſickneſs, of the manner of his death, and what hath been obſerved upon the view and opening of his body, as alſo from the ſight of the <hi>bolus</hi> which was left. It being therefore enquired of Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Apothecary (of whom without the Counſel of any Doctour he took phyſick) what ſickneſs Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> had, he anſwered that he was not ſick, but that he was deſirous to take a Medicine, which Dr. <hi>Poe</hi> had heretofore appointed him; and which he ſince had taken ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times. The Medicine (he ſaid) was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>℞ Pulv. Sanct. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>jſs. Syr. Auguſtan. ℥j. Vini albi</hi> ℥iij ſs. <hi>m. f. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> This he took upon <hi>Monday,</hi> and he had thereby 7 or 8 ſtools: But not thinking himſelf ſufficiently purged he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Maſter <hi>Matthewes</hi> that he might have it again, which Maſter <hi>Matthewes</hi> accordingly prepared on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> for <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday;</hi> but he took not this Medicine till <hi>Friday</hi> following; upon the taking of which (after the walking 5 or 6 turns) he vomited and grew ſick. The Medicine alſo did work downward much, even to the purging of bloud, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> gave Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> a Cordial of <hi>Diaſcordium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> was called to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and can ſay nothing what was done before. He then found that Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> did caſt and ſcowre much, and that he was feveriſh, his breath ſtinking, his mouth black, eſpecially on the right ſide and about his gumms. The Doctour the nappointed him Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of milk, and to drink milk and water. On <hi>Monday</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt night, he did appoint him a <hi>Bolus</hi> with <hi>Laudani Parac.</hi> gr. j. ¼, which night he vomited the <hi>Bolus</hi> and purged much more than before, caſting and ſcowring bloud after the <hi>Bolus.</hi> On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Doctour gave him ſome <hi>Diacodium</hi> and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Water. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> he appointed him <hi>Laudani</hi> gr. j. <hi>conſ. flor. garyophyllor.</hi> ℈j. <hi>Cromwell</hi> was ſent for this <hi>Bolus</hi> who returned not home in half an hour. The Apothecary's man ſaith it was ſent gilt, but the gilt was broken, and being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be more in quantity than was appointed, it was taſted, and it made their mouths ſore that taſted it, and then it being ſearched, there appeared a white powder in it. And it is confeſs'd that <hi>Cromwell</hi> came to Mrs. <hi>Bacon</hi>'s ſhop and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57185:239"/>
bought 2 drams of Sublimate there, which he pretended to grave knives withall; and with a third part thereof he then and there did engrave a knife, the other 2 parts he carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him, of which he being queſtioned, denied the ſame, making this excuſe, that the asker was neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable nor Juſtice: and being further queſtioned what he did with the reſt of the Sublimate, he ſaid it was between the window and his desk, where a piece of Sublimate was found but not the powder. Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> did think that there was a mortification in his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> did anſwer to 2 Objections made concerning the poiſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Corps was outwardly fair. <hi>Reſp.</hi> The evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did prevent the coming of the poiſon to the skin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was ſaid, the bottom of the ſtomach was not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Reſp.</hi> The ſides of the ſtomach were offended, and the evacuation came ſo ſuddenly upon the taking it, that it did not ſettle.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> ſaith, that he was called with others to view the body of Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> which they found outwardly fair, his lips onely appearing white as if they had been bliſtered. Some blackneſs there appeared in his mouth, and his Tongue was black and hard, but from his throat to his ſtomach it was very fair: The ſtomach its ſelf in the bottom was fair; but the upper part had a blackneſs, round about which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; the blackneſs he ſcraped off with his nail, but the other coats were ſound. In the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> there was ſeen no offence, but one lobe of the Lungs ſeemed to be rotten; and one part of the Liver was pale and ſcirrhous.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Meverell</hi> ſaith, that he being on <hi>Saturday</hi> to view the body, he found an <hi>Eſchar</hi> between the gumms and the Cheek, with blackneſs of the teeth, the tongue alſo black and hard, but the <hi>gula</hi> all fair and clear. In the Stomach in the upper part, a circular inflammation with a blackneſs in the middle, which with his nail was eaſily ſcraped off. His Liver was hard and his Lungs bad, yet not ſo as that they ſhould cauſe his death. At the Seſſions he ſaid the ſame, but there the Lord Chief Juſtice asking him, that if the Circumſtances which were alledged by the ſworn witneſſes were added to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:57185:239"/>
that he ſaw whether then he thought him poiſoned; The Dr. anſwered, that he did think that he died of poiſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francis White,</hi> ſervant to Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> ſaith, that hearing that the <hi>Bolus</hi> was diſliked, he went and did fetch back the <hi>Bolus;</hi> and that opening it he found Sublimate in it, which he ſhewed <hi>Cromwell;</hi> and after this, <hi>Francis</hi> going home, <hi>Cromwell</hi> followed him, and wiſh'd him by <hi>Fleet-bridge</hi> to caſt it away, which he refuſed to doe.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> did further declare that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had 2 powders, one white which was ſublimate, the other black which was ſome <hi>Amalgama</hi> of Quick-ſilver, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſaid he had out of his Maſter's pocket. He did alſo deſire the College to take into their conſideration what Scammony could doe, whether by that the mouth and ſtomach could be made black ſo ſuddenly, and to cauſe an Ulcer with an Eſchar upon the ſide of the mouth. After the forementioned examination of ſeveral Witneſſes, the following Letter by his Majeſtie's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſent to the College.</p>

                  <p>BY this ſecond Letter the College was required to reſolve two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whether Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> died of poiſon or no?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether the Potion which was made by the Apothecary, and taken by Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> had any poiſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients therein, which might produce this effect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Preſident was deſirous to hear what might further be informed by the Aſſiſtants, Doctours, or any other: and firſt there preſented himſelf</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Baniſter</hi> of <hi>Bedford;</hi> who came to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> his Son-in-Law, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> about 2 or 3 a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. There he found the ℞ of Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi>'s <hi>Bolus,</hi> which he ſent by <hi>Cromwell</hi> to Mr. <hi>Matthewes;</hi> who after ſome long ſtay, brought it to Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> which ſhe did preſently deliver to this Mr. <hi>Baniſter</hi> her Father; which he ſeeing, thought it more than was directed by the Doctour; and preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, he found it ſharp, offending his tongue: Then he ſent for one <hi>Walter</hi> Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> his man, to whom he ſaid, the <hi>Bolus</hi> was not rightly prepared; and therefore cauſed him to go to make another <hi>Bolus</hi> according to the direction: Which <hi>Bolus</hi> being brought Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> took, and it did well with him: and <hi>Francis</hi> the Apothecary's man coming thither on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, Mr. <hi>Baniſter</hi> cauſed him to taſte the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> of which he preſently complained; and that night both the Apothecary's men came and ſhewed him the Sublimate in it, by which both their mouths were diſtated; and on
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57185:240"/>
this <hi>Thurſday</hi> Mr. <hi>Baniſter</hi> told Dr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> that there were the ſymptomes of Mercury, for his evacuations were bloudy, his tortions great, his mouth black, exulcerated, ſtinking, and withall he had convulſions.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Lane,</hi> ſiſter to Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> who was in the houſe from his firſt falling ſick, ſaith, that upon <hi>Friday,</hi> upon the taking the purge, he preſently after half a dozen turns in a little room fell a vomiting, and vomited black humour and bloud, and that upon every ſtool he was ready to faint; and ſhe ſaith, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> found fault with the maid for giving the Child Pills in that Porringer out of which Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> took the Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Foxe,</hi> before he would make report of what he knew in this buſineſs, produced the Copy of a Report made by himſelf, Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Dr. <hi>Meverell,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ramſey</hi> which was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are of opinion that having found in this body ſome inflammation and mortification, whereof muſt neceſſarily follow death, by the force of them, and that yet the ſame inflammation and mortification might proceed from ſome other cauſes; it cannot be reſolved by Art, whether this Gentleman died by Poiſon or other means.</hi> Which he preſſed much to be aſſented to by the whole College (and the other Doctours did acknowledge this Note to be the ſenſe of that which they ſubſcribed unto) but the College thought fit a little to adviſe thereon.</p>
                  <p>Then Dr. <hi>Foxe</hi> related that he was called to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> by a ſtranger to him, and that he found ſome paſſion in the houſe. After ſome time the body was opened, and the mouth, <hi>gula</hi> and ſtomach were found ſo as hath been formerly related: and ſaith that the Chirurgion ſaid the Guts were fair. Then Dr. <hi>Foxe,</hi> as a Cenſor, began to enquire after the Phyſick gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> and who gave it; and calling for Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> he enquired of the Potion, by whom he was informed what it was. After this, the Dr. coming to conſult, ſoon found cauſe to ſuſpect poiſon. Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> conceived other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by whom Dr. <hi>Foxe</hi> was partly led, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apothecary was found to have given one irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar medicine; and the Dr. related how one <hi>Ioſlyne</hi> died by Phyſick given him upon an old receipt of Mr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:57185:241"/>
Dr. <hi>Ramſey</hi> ſaith, that about Noon one told him his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> was dead, upon which he went thither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and heard their complaint: and then he look'd upon his gumms and teeth. Next day he came to meet the other Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and found things as formerly have been related. And he acknowledged that he ſet his hand to the Note former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, and thought all had been done; but withall he proteſted that he was and is of opinion, that Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> was poiſoned.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pindar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coxe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dixon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being all at the opening of the Body, do ſeverally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the blackneſs and Eſchar in the mouth, and the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the ſtomach; and Mr. <hi>Coxe</hi> ſaith, that a quarter of a yard beneath the Stomach he found an inflammation inclining to a blackneſs.</p>
                  <p>After this information had, Mr. Preſident propounded to the Collegues to give their opinions whether Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> died of a violent death or naturally.</p>
                  <p>They every one ſeverally were of opinion that he died a violent death upon ſome external cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. Preſident propounded to the Collegues whether they thought him to have been poiſoned or not.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion being conſidered ſeverally by the Fellows, 18 of them were of opinion that he died of poiſon: but 4 of them (namely, Sir <hi>William Paddy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Dr. <hi>Crooke,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cademan)</hi> did impute his death to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Mr. Preſident deſired the Collegues opinions concerning the medicine ſent from the Apothecarie's, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had in it any poiſonable thing, which might produce ſuch an effect.</p>
                  <p>To this all the Fellows with one conſent made anſwer, that they could not give a direct cenſure concerning the Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delivered by the Apothecary, and made without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a Doctour: but if it were no other than <hi>pulvis San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi> formerly ſet down, that then they were of opinion that there was no poiſonable thing in it, which might produce ſuch an effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:57185:241"/>
But in the <hi>Bolus</hi> which remained there was found poiſon, and all the Fellows did acknowledge it to be Sublimate.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Foxe</hi> preſſed the Collegues for their opinion concerning the Note by him exhibited; and their general opinion was, that they having had no proofs but onely the inſpection of the body, they could not certifie aſſuredly of the poiſon.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> was requeſted by the Preſident and the College, to draw up the opinion of the Collegues to be preſented to his Majeſty and to ſend it to Mr. Preſident, which he accordingly performed: and the Friday following it was delivered to his Majeſty by Mr. Preſident, Dr. <hi>Clement,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hodſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Meverell</hi> at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> in theſe words.</p>

                        <p>THe College of Phyſicians in <hi>London</hi> being lawfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by the command of their Soveregin Lord the King, about certain queſtions propoſed concerning the death of <hi>Ioſeph Lane,</hi> reported to be killed by poiſon, and having made a diligent ſearch, and well conſidering all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relating, 1. As to the ſtate of the body of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Lane;</hi> 2. As to the diſeaſe which (by a long ſeries of violent ſymptomes) brought him to his end; 3. As to the kind and appearance of his death; 4. As to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations made upon his dead body by the Phyſicians and Chirurgions preſent; 5. As to the conjectures taken from the ſtrict examination of a <hi>Bolus</hi> extremely ſuſpicious, whoſe parts were artificially ſeparated, found in Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>'s houſe when dead, and after brought into Court before the Judges, and from thence to the Phyſicians at their College: To whom (by the command and in the name of the King) Letters were wrote from the Right honourable Sir <hi>Iohn Cooke</hi> principal Secretary of State, that they might diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and give a faithfull account to the following Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. Concerning <hi>Lane</hi>'s death, whether it was procured
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:57185:242"/>
from poiſon? 2. Their opinion about a purging potion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the 4th of <hi>April,</hi> 1632. from Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary's ſhop to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>'s houſe, and taken by <hi>Lane</hi> the 6th, whether it had any thing of poiſon in it? The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege after very mature deliberation, did humbly preſent the following Decree to his ſacred Majeſty as a teſtimony of their obedience.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Lane</hi> did certainly dye of a violent death. 2. That he had taken poiſon, and that corroſive. 3. That they could determine nothing certainly concerning the Potion ſent and given by Mr. <hi>Matthewes</hi> the Apothecary to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> without the advice of any Phyſician, becauſe many of their medicines were too negligently prepared by their ſervants. But if that Potion did only conſiſt of thoſe ingredients which he had given an account of, and for which we have ſolely his word, then there was nothing of poiſon contained therein. 4. In the remainder of the foreſaid <hi>Bolus</hi> there was found Mercury Sublimate, not ſweet, but the moſt harſh and highly cauſtick, which was ſeparated from the reſt of the <hi>Bolus</hi> and ſhewn to the whole College; In teſtimony whereof the College by the unanimous conſent of the Preſident and Fellows and all preſent at this conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſigned this Decree with their own hands, and ſealed it with the College Seal, that it might appear more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe that from the beginning of the world to this very day good and wholſome Laws have derived their original from evil manners, the whole College of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe moſt humbly beſeech your moſt Sacred Majeſty that, as the Father of your Country, you would conſult the health and welfare both of your City Subjects, and would by your Royal Proclamation ſtrictly command that for the future, No Grocer, Drugſter, Apothecary, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, or any other perſon preſume to ſell Arſenick, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, Sublimate, Precipitate, <hi>Opium, Coloquintida,</hi> Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Hellebore, or other Druggs either poiſonous or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, to poor ſorry Women or poor people (which hath been too common) but only to thoſe who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give their names; that if there ſhould be occaſion,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57185:242"/>
they may give an account of the reaſon of their buying theſe dangerous medicines.</p>
                        <p>May it likewiſe pleaſe your Majeſty to iſſue out your Royal Edict under the moſt ſevere penalties, that no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary for the future ſhall dare to compound for the Well, or adminiſter to the Sick any medicines, eſpecially Vomits, Purges, Opiates, Mercurial or Antimonial remedies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſcription of Phyſicians then living; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription they ſhall be bound to produce upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or requeſt of the Cenſors of the College.

                     <hi>Francis Roes,</hi> alias <hi>Vintner,</hi> was accuſed by <hi>William Clarke</hi> of ill practice, who (as he affirmed) undertook to cure his wife of a Tympany, of which diſeaſe <hi>Vintner</hi> told him he had cured 40. and amongſt thoſe named one <hi>Ingram</hi>'s wife. He had of <hi>Clarke</hi> 4 <hi>l.</hi> when he began, and 3 <hi>l.</hi> after for medicines, and 4 <hi>l.</hi> more he was to have when he had perfected the Cure. <hi>Vintner</hi> did not deny the accuſation, and being demanded by what authority he practiſed, he anſwered he was a Phyſician and Student in <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> of which College he had been a year or two; and further ſaid that he had been inſtructed in Phyſick from a Boy by his Father, meaning Mr. <hi>Vintner</hi> the Empirick. Being asked what medicines he gave <hi>Clark</hi>'s wife and <hi>Ingram</hi>'s; at firſt he refuſed to diſcover them, ſaying he had them noted in his books; but after long
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57185:243"/>
expoſtulation, he named <hi>Ialap</hi> and <hi>Elatorium</hi> (as he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the word) and being queſtioned what <hi>Elatorium</hi> was made of, he ſaid it was compoſed of 3 or 4 things, whereof <hi>Diagridium</hi> was one. He was cenſured for giving <hi>Elaterium</hi> (a medicine he knew not) and particularly to a woman at his own houſe, whom he afterwards ſent home through the open ſtreets, telling her it was a Cordial. He was fined 10 <hi>l.</hi> and committed to Priſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Hammond, Surgeon,</hi> was complained of by <hi>Iohn Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for that he undertook to cure his child of a Dropſie being 9 or 10 years old. He gave him a Clyſter, after which he fell into a looſneſs and died. <hi>Hammond</hi> confeſſed that he gave the Child a Clyſter made of Ale, Moloſſos, and white Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, which wrought ſo violently that the Boy died there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. <hi>Walton</hi> likewiſe affirmed that there was a red powder in the Clyſter, which he judged to be red Mercury. For this ill practice he was fined 5 <hi>l.</hi> and committed to the priſon of the Compter in <hi>Woodſtreet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iames Virott, Apothecary,</hi> was accuſed by the Wardens of the Apothecary's Company for decayed and ill medicines found in his Shop, which they brought. The Cenſors refuſed to take any notice thereof, becauſe they had not viſited his Shop which they promiſed ſpeedily to do, and accordingly within a few days they with the Wardens did viſit it, and deſtroyed his corrupt and ill medicines.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Preſident made complaint of the Apothecaries diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in general and in particular of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s, who being ſerved with a <hi>Sub-poena</hi> to appear as a Witneſs in a College cauſe, neglected to come. Whereof being reproved by Mr. Preſident, that it was an affront to the College, he told him he might take it as he pleaſed; and being adviſed by Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> to come to the Preſident to compoſe this breach, <hi>Smith</hi> told him that he ſeared no body under the degree of a Privy Councellour for any good or harm. Upon this complaint, it was thought fit to put it to the table, whether Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould be excommuned for uſing Mr. Preſident ſo unworthily, till ſuch time as he ſhould reconcile himſelf to the Preſident and the College; By ſcrutiny he was excommuned, till he ſhould ſo reconcile himſelf. About 3 weeks after, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:57185:243"/>
came to excuſe the offence done to the Preſident, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf ſorry that he ſhould give any ſuch offence, and craved the favour of the Preſident and College; wherefore his ſuſpenſion was remitted, and he again entertained into the favour of the College.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suſan Dry</hi> was complained of for giving Phyſick to one <hi>Margaret Foxe,</hi> to whom ſhe gave drinks of 10 <hi>s.</hi> a bottle. She gave phyſick to one <hi>Matthew Evans,</hi> of whom ſhe had 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> in money; with an Apron and Pillow-bear: She took another Womans Ruff. She was committed for evil practice and fined 3 <hi>l.</hi> Upon her ſubmiſſion Mr. Preſident took 30 <hi>s.</hi> of her and releaſed her. He delivered the money to the Beadle, the moſt of which was diſtributed to pious uſes.</p>
                  <p>In the 9th year of this King's reign, the College by advice of their Councel ſent the following Letter to the Maſter, Wardens, and Fellowſhip of the Apothecaries concerning the examination of their ſervants in order to their freedom.</p>

I have obſerved and grieved to ſee ſometimes a Miniſter, ſometimes a Serving-man, ſometimes an Apothecary, oftentimes Maſters of Arts (whereof ſome have afterwards aſſumed holy Orders) admitted to a Licence to practiſe in Phyſick, or to be incorporated to a Degree without giving any publique teſtimony of their learning and skill in the Profeſſion. And what hath followed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57185:246"/>
The Miniſter hath neglected his own Calling and treſpaſſed upon anothers, not without endangering the Souls of the people of God, and the loſſe of the Lives of many of the King's ſubjects. The Serving-man and Apothecary upon a Licence obtained have been preſently made Doctors by the breath of the people, and Doctors indeed underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. Maſters of Arts after Licence obtained have taken, as I ſaid, holy Orders, that if one profeſſion did faile them, another might ſupply them. And Incorporation being in an inſtant obtained by a little ſumme of money, which by orderly proceeding (I ſpeake concerning the Doctor's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) would coſt 12 years ſtudy in the Univerſity, beſides performance of exerciſes and much expence; It is come to paſſe, that in the Univerſity at this time I doe proteſt I doe not know any one that intends the ſtudy of Phyſick, and practice thereof according to the Statutes. Chirurgeons and Apothecaries are ſought unto, and Phyſicians ſeldome but in a deſperate caſe are conſulted with, when the Patient is ready to dye, and in this kind we have too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. The conſideration of theſe miſchiefs redounding to the Church, Commonwealth, Univerſity and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, hath often troubled me, when I had no power to prevent them. But now ſeeing it hath pleaſed God and the King to conferre ſuch power upon me, that without me neither Licence nor Degree in Phyſick can be obtained at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (for I have ſolicited Dr. <hi>Nichols</hi> and Dr. <hi>Allet</hi> to joyne with me; and I have prevailed ſoe farre with them, that they will doe nothing without me) I doe intend by the grace of God to give way unto noe man to obtain a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or Degree without keeping an Act at the leaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſſe it ſhall happen that with ſome one particular man it ſhall be diſpenſed withall by ſupreme Authority or in ſome extraordinary caſe.</p>
                        <p>But all this will be to little purpoſe, unleſſe your ſelfe and the College will ſolicite Dr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> his Majeſtie's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and others of the faculty there, to doe the like; or rather Petition to my Lord's Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who out of his innate goodneſſe and clemency, and zeale for the good of the Church and Commonwealth, and the

honour of the Univerſities, I am fully perſwaded, will grant what you deſire, againſt Apothecaryes and Chirurgions, and all others which without Licence or authority do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Phyſick. I could wiſh there were ſome courſe taken; I know there be already good Lawes, if they were put in execution.</p>
                        <p>Thus much in haſte, (as you may perceive by my writing) I thought good to ſignify unto you, out of the gratefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which I beare unto your ſelfe and the whole College, tendring the honour of our common Profeſſion, which I will maintain as much as in me lyes, and vindicate from the invaſions of Uſurpers and Intruders. I have exceeded I feare the bounds of a Letter, but that you will pardon, I hope, conſidering the occaſion. And ſoe with a gratefull acknowledgment of your love and favour towards me, and an ingenuous profeſſion of much ſervice I owe unto you, I take my leave, as one that will be ready, upon the leaſt ſignification, to embrace your commands, and execute them with all alacrity.</p>

                     <hi>Mary Butler</hi> was complained of for giving Phyſick; ſhe undertook the cure of the dead Palſie on a Woman, of whom ſhe had 10 <hi>li.</hi> and alſo a promiſe of 10 <hi>li.</hi> more when the Cure was performed, for which ſhe ſued the party. After this, ſhe was complained of by one Mrs. <hi>Elliſon</hi> for taking upon her to give Phyſick, and in particular for undertaking to cure her the ſaid <hi>Elliſon,</hi> to whom ſhe gave C <hi>s.</hi> in hand with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of as much more when ſhe performed the Cure; but this was ſo far from being obtained, that ſhe was never well ſince ſhe took her medicines. <hi>Mary Butler</hi> denied not that ſhe gave her Phyſick, but profeſſed that ſhe learnt her skill of a Jew: and firſt avowed that ſhe was authoriſed to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Phyſick by Mr. <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Clowes;</hi> and when ſhe underſtood that they could not licenſe her ſo to
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:57185:247"/>
practiſe, ſhe ſtick'd not to affirm, that ſhe had authority from the King; and for the evidence and proof thereof, ſhewed a Writ under Seal out of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that had not paid her for a Cure ſhe pretended to have done: which Seal ſhe made her Neighbours believe was a Licence for her practiſing of Phyſick. She confeſſed ſhe gave Phyſick to Mr. <hi>Richard Shipwright</hi> from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſo continues ſtill. She hath given him inward me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and likewiſe cupped and ſcarified him: ſhe cauſed him to be let bloud in the forehead, and under the tongue and in the foot: and ſo ſhe directed Mr. <hi>Whittel</hi> the Surgeon now dwelling in <hi>Croched Fryars.</hi> For which her pains and phyſick ſhe hath had already C. <hi>s.</hi> and is to have a C. <hi>s.</hi> more when he is well. The Cenſors thought fit to ſend her to <hi>Newgate</hi> for theſe miſdemeanours, and fined her xv. <hi>li.</hi>

                     <hi>Iohn Hogsfleſh, Surgeon,</hi> was accuſed by ſeveral for giving Phyſick, having no skill nor authority ſo to doe. Others complained of his giving purging Phyſick and Mercurial Unctions, particularly one <hi>Anne Harvey</hi> made complaint for giving her husband phyſick for the Pox, who died of that phyſick with his mouth full of Ulcers. He had conſiderable ſums of money from many; And was charged for giving to one <hi>Iohn Gladwin</hi> 3 pills every other day for twice, whereupon he vomited ſo vehemently, that his ſight and hearing failed him for a time. This was proved by his own Letters as well as by <hi>Gladwin</hi> and his Wife, and a third perſon. The Cenſors condemned him to priſon and fined him 10 <hi>li.</hi>

                              <p>Preſent  Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> Preſident, Dr. <hi>Argent,</hi> Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Caddiman,</hi> Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Dr. <hi>Winſton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hodſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Meverell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spicer,</hi> Cenſors.</p>
                              <p>This day there was brought by Mr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Counſellour of <hi>Gray</hi>'s Inn, an Order from the Lords dated the 20th. of <hi>October</hi> laſt, concerning the practice of one <hi>Leverett,</hi> who there appeared at the ſame time, together with divers Men, Women and Children that he ſaid he had cured, and pray'd the College to examine them. The College anſwered that it was not in their order to look back, but to go forward, and therefore wiſhed the Patients for that time, that they would forbear and leave the ſaid <hi>Leverett</hi> according to the Lords direction to the College, which they did, the College then promiſing that they would take a time to examine them likewiſe.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Preſident at the ſame time preſented ſeveral Articles of Mr. Serjeant <hi>Clowes</hi> againſt this <hi>Leverett,</hi> of all which he was examined; and firſt he was demanded whether he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtody of a Meſſenger; he anſwered he came of his own accord.</p>
                              <p>He ſaith that he is 60 years of age, that he is the 7th. Son of 8 his Father had, and the 9th. which was laſt, was a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter named <hi>Anne,</hi> but he did not challenge any virtue by being the 7th. Son.</p>
                              <p>He ſaith likewiſe that about 3 years ſince and a half he did his firſt Cure upon his own Wife, who had been full of pain 3 quarters of a year from her Wriſt to her Elbow: In all which time although he did live with her, yet he never tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her Arme, till at laſt upon her entreaty ſhe deſired him
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57185:248"/>
to take off the ſplints and rowlers and look on it, which he did; that being bound up by a Surgeon, he felt it and ſought for Kernels, but found none. His Wife found preſent eaſe and therefore deſired him to hold her by the Wriſt, which he refuſed, but ſhe earneſtly deſiring it, ſaying ſhe felt eaſe, he did it, and the next day ſhe was perfectly cured of her pain and was weeding in his Garden.</p>
                              <p>Some 6 months after, a Maid dwelling in <hi>Thames Street</hi> was his ſecond Patient; who deſired to be touched by him for a pain in her Elbow, which he did, and ſhe was cured. The third was a Woman in <hi>Turn-ball Street,</hi> who coming to him and craving his help for a pain in her Arme, he anſwered ſhe was a fooliſh Woman; but ſhe ſaid, God had given him the gift of healing. So by her importunity ſhe prevailed that he touched her, and ſhe was very well: their names he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
                              <p>In the touching of theſe he did not uſe any words, nor till he had cured above a dozen; but ſince, he hath uſed theſe words, <hi>God give a bleſſing, I touch, God heals.</hi> He ſaith that upon touching ſome 30 or 40 in a day, he finds himſelf wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the Virtue which goes out of him, more than when he was a Gardiner by digging up 8 roods of ground; ſo that he is brought to that weakneſs by touching, that he is forced to go to his bed to recover his ſtrength, which in his daily labour he was not wont to do.</p>
                              <p>He ſaith, he is not always diſpoſed to touch, eſpecially if his hands be cold. He ſaith he hath cured 300 at the leaſt, he takes money for his Cures, but not by contract; if he ſhould not take money, he might ſtarve, having forſaken his Trade by the calling of God. He denies Virtue to be either in his Gloves or Linen, or any thing that toucheth his naked body, although that was then objected againſt him.</p>
                              <p>He ſaith that whilſt he dwelt at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> he was aſſaulted in the High-way one evening by ſome Surgeons or Phyſicians, and his Thumb was wrung and ſtrained; but by his own tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching he cured it; and that he ſtood in fear of his life from ſome Phyſicians and Surgeons, but of whom he knoweth not.</p>
                              <p>He cures the King's Evil, Dropſies, Fevers, Agues, all Diſeaſes and Sores in any part of the body, but he promiſeth
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57185:249"/>
not any Cure to any, as he is a Sinner, but God cures and he doth his duty.</p>
                              <p>He ſaith that he toucheth none above twice or thrice, and that the firſt time they find eaſe and good effect of his touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                              <p>He was commanded by the College to attend the Tueſday following, which was 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                                 <hi>Novembris,</hi> and was promiſed to have divers provided by the College for him to touch. He ſeemed to be very joyfull at it, and inſiſted that they might be of the King's Evil, for that he had cured thoſe that the King had touched, and alſo ſome of them under the Surgeons hands, which could not be cured by them.</p>

                              <p>This day he retracts that any Virtue goes out of him, but ſaith he is grown weak by touching, which is as much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. He ſaith he muſt touch 4 or 5 times before they be cured. He profeſſeth himſelf at this time to be in good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to touch; Whereupon one <hi>Richard George,</hi> aged about 23 years, and who had complained about 2 years of a tumour in his right knee, was preſented to him to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. When he ſaw his knee, he ſeemed to be diſcontented, and asked if it were not out of joynt; he was anſwered that it was not. He lamented that the College did not, according to promiſe, preſent to him thoſe that were troubled with the Evil; yet in fine he touched this <hi>George.</hi> He began with theſe words, I do not promiſe any Cure, God Cures, God give a bleſſing, I do but my duty. Then bowing down and laying both his hands a little above the knee, ſtroaking it down, he ſaid to the Patient, You muſt pray to God to give a bleſſing to my hands that they may take effect: And ſo he touched and ſaid, very ſoftly, <hi>God bleſs, I touch, God</hi>
                                 <pb n="451" facs="tcp:57185:249"/>
                                 <hi>heals.</hi> Theſe words he repeated twice or thrice, ſtill ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards, and then ſpake to the Patient with ſome iterated vehemency to pray to God to give a bleſſing to his hands. In putting on the Linen to his knee, the Patient touched his own knee with his fingers, whereat he grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Choler, and ſaid that he had ſpoiled all, for neither he nor any body elſe muſt touch it, nor any Oils nor Ointments nor Plaſters muſt come upon it, and ſo he touched it twice as before, and repeated the words 6 times again. Then he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his hand about the cloth on both ſides, and ſo pinned the Linen about his knee himſelf, and commanded him not to touch it again till himſelf ſhould ſee it. And likewiſe that the Patient ſhould pray to God for a bleſſing upon his hand, that his hand might take effect. And further commanded the Patient to drink no ſmall beer but ſtrong, nor waſh his hands or face in cold water, but warmed.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond Patient was <hi>Elizabeth Appleton,</hi> aged about years; ſhe was all ſwell'd in the Neck and under the Ears, which is the King's Evil. To which Patient he ſaid as he did to <hi>Rich. George</hi> the firſt Patient, onely he ſeemed to croſs her Cheek and Neck, where the knots and tumours were.</p>

                              <p>Alſo <hi>Iudith True,</hi> who had a running ſore in her breaſt. <hi>Heſter Fiſher,</hi> and <hi>Sarah Anderſon</hi> ulcerated and tumify'd fingers.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Henry Welch</hi> was preſented then to him to be touched for a pain in his left hand, from which aroſe vapours ſometimes, which brought him into Convulſion fits; of which Diſeaſe <hi>Leverett</hi> ſaid he had cured ſome Patients, but he denied to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:57185:250"/>
touch the ſaid <hi>Welch,</hi> ſaying that he did not know but there might be ſome miſchief in his hand that might doe him harm: Yet at the ſame time he would have touched one whom he appointed to meet him at the College, that was troubled (as the party ſaid) with Convulſion fits; but the College would not ſuffer him to be touched in their preſence, till it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them that he was really troubled with thoſe Fits.</p>
                              <p>His touching of Sores is different from the former tumours; for firſt he lays his whole hand, and ſays his charm or words thrice; then he puts conſtantly the top of his middle finger and repeats his Charm thrice more, and ſo till he hath done 9 times.</p>
                              <p>The binding up is different, for he takes a piece of Cloth and wreaths it into a Circle, then he puts that over the ſore, ſo that the Cloth toucheth it not. And herein he is very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that it touch not the ſore. Then he binds a broader Cloth all over it, and exhorts the Patient to pray to God his hand may take effect.</p>

                                 <hi>William Butts,</hi> Meſſenger, preſented <hi>Leverett</hi> to the College, and <hi>Leverett</hi> brought divers with him, 3 whereof were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe preſent, as he preſented them. The firſt was <hi>Robert Monday,</hi> Son of <hi>Richard Monday</hi> of <hi>Chelſey,</hi> Waterman, aged about 8 years, for a Sore (as was conceived by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege a Bile) under his left Arme. He ſaith that he had been Patient to <hi>Cooke</hi> a Surgeon, and was healed by the ſaid <hi>Cooke;</hi> Yet afterwards the ſore brake forth again, but not deep: <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verett</hi> touched him 4 times, and the party ſaith, he put a brown paper upon it; <hi>Leverett</hi> ſaid it was a linen cloth.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Richard Monday,</hi> the Father of the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> aged 37 years, ſaith that his Child had the ſore for one year and a half. He was touched 3 times in leſs than a months ſpace, but his Wife knew better: He put a cloth on it, <hi>Leverett</hi> wrapped his Child's hands in a cloth leſt he ſhould touch it; It was dried up in a quarter of a years time as it began. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verett</hi> took no money for his Cure.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Elizabeth Monday,</hi> Mother to the ſaid Child, aged 29 years, ſaith, that her Child was ſore about 12 months, it brake of it ſelf; <hi>Cooke</hi> the Surgeon gave her ſalve, which almoſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. Then it brake forth again; <hi>Leverett</hi> touched it 3 times in 9 days, and ſo it wore away and dried up by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>April</hi> and <hi>Midſummer. Leverett</hi> uſed words in touching.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond Patient was <hi>Elizabeth Maye,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Maye,</hi> aged about 11 years. She ſaith, that ſhe had the King's Evil in her eyes 7 years, with ſcales in her face, which hung by Geometry. She learned that word from her Father. Her head likewiſe brake forth, and was well and ill of it ſelf. <hi>Leverett</hi> laid his hands onely on her eyes and bid her ſerve God. <hi>Leverett</hi> touched her 3 times in 9 days, and 3 days intermiſſion between every time. She fell into a looſeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he touched her. She had been with the King 2 years
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:57185:251"/>
before, and carries the Angel ſtill, but was not well by the King's touching, but within 9 days after <hi>Leverett</hi> touched her, ſhe was well.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Martin Maye,</hi> Father of the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> dwelling in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-lane, Cook,</hi> ſaith, He was Hoſt to <hi>Leverett</hi> half a year, and that <hi>Leverett</hi> touched her many times, but how often he knoweth not.</p>
                              <p>The third Patient was <hi>Peter Norris,</hi> aged 6 years. <hi>Leverett</hi> ſaith that he had the King's Evil in his left eye. He ſaith he hath touched it many times, but the Child ſaith it is not yet well, and it ſo appeared unto the College.</p>

                              <p n="4">4.

                        <p>THeſe are to certify whom it may concern, that <hi>James Leverett,</hi> by profeſſion a Gardiner, hath heretofore undertaken to cure all diſeaſes with the touch of his hand, but more particularly the King's Evil, which he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to cure in my Child, pretending that he would take no money, nor make any bargain: But I did find by the carriage and paſſage of all his proceedings, that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and expect nothing more than money and profit; for notwithſtanding he had ſufficient ſecurity by the promiſe of a friend for his ſatisfaction when he had done his work, yet he would conſtantly perform nothing in the Cure as was expected, unleſs he were daily fed with Wine and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and other gifts, as alſo with much entreaty; for his pretence was (in theſe words) that if he ſhould touch ſo often, he ſhould feel virtue and ſtrength go from him ſo much that he could not go up ſtairs to his bed but upon all four. But I think it was rather Drink and Tobacco that
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57185:253"/>
did weaken, than any virtue that could go from ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; for I can prove that he was ſo drunk upon a Sunday ſome 3 or 4 months paſt, that he was fain of neceſſity to creep up ſtairs to his bed upon his hands. And I do think he is a mere Impoſtour and Couſener of the King's Subjects. <hi>Nov.</hi> 14. 1637.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I was preſent when he would not touch a Maid unleſs ſhe would kiſs him, to which ſhe did offer her ſelf.</p>

I told him I did not believe he could do me any good by that means, the infection being in my Liver. He replied, that he could do by way of touching my breaſt, and could give me as many ſtools as the cauſe required, by the way of touching with his hands. And he often touched my hand and breaſt, yet did me no good at all, nor had no purging operation.

                        <p>THat according to your Honours order dated the 20th day of <hi>October</hi> laſt, we the ſaid Preſident and Fellows of the College of Phyſicians have called before us the ſaid <hi>Iames Leverett,</hi> whom we find by the Certificate annexed, to be the 4th Son of one <hi>Simon Leverett</hi> late of St. <hi>Clements Eaſt-cheap</hi> Butcher deceaſed, and examined him and made trial of him 6 ſeveral days according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning his 3 years and a half practice; for ſo long he pretends to have had the gift of healing, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken his trade, and lived by means acquired by touching of diſeaſed perſons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt he ſaith, that when he began to take upon him to cure he uſed a bare touching without words, but being told, by a woman (whoſe name he knoweth not) that came to him to be touched for a pain in her Arm, that God had given him the gift of Healing, he afterwards uſed words whilſt he was touching; but who put thoſe words into his mouth, or the certain time when or where, or to whom he firſt uſed thoſe words he will not confeſs.</p>
                        <p>Among many whom he pretends to have cured, he made choice of 3 of them, and brought them and others with him to the College to be examined concerning the Cure he had done upon them; namely, <hi>Robert Monday</hi> aged 8 years, the ſon of <hi>Richard Monday</hi> Waterman, for a ſore under his Arm, which 3 months after his touching dried up of it ſelf: <hi>Eliz. Maye</hi> aged 11 years for the King's evil in her Eyes; She was cured by a flux of belly which happened before and continued after: and <hi>Peter Norris</hi> aged 6 years, for the Evil, as is pretended, in the left Eye, which
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57185:254"/>
is not yet well, as appeareth to us, nor bettered by his touching, as the Child ſaid. And likewiſe Serjeant <hi>Clowes</hi> brought ſome others, as their Certificates annexed do ſhew, whom he the ſaid <hi>Leverett</hi> hath formerly touched, but none of theſe are bettered by his touching.</p>
                        <p>In obedience to your Honour's command, we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him 6 more, which he touched, for that he deſired to touch thoſe, and eſpecially if the King have touched them: and he hath touched thoſe 6 diverſe times in our preſence, according to his own appointed times, without the leaſt contradiction or interruption by us made, to which he promiſed, if not preſent cure, yet eaſe; But we find that ſome of them immediately upon his firſt touching grew worſe, and deſired the College that they might be no more touched by him. Yet to remove all ſcruple and for the better ſatisfaction of your Lordſhips we cauſed him to touch them again, albeit they were nothing bettered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by when they laſt appeared at the College, and therefore we remitted them to thoſe who formerly had them in cure.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>The manner and faſhion of his touching is as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He obſerveth in his touching to lay his hands in certain forms upon the places affected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He obſerveth his own diſpoſition of body or indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to touch; for if his hands be cold he will not touch, or if he be ill affected in his body, as he was the 17th of <hi>Nov.</hi> laſt, when he abſolutely denied to touch any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He mutters whilſt he toucheth a certain number of ſet words, <hi>viz. God give a bleſſing, I touch, God heals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He toucheth the parts ill affected a certain number of times, as thrice, thrice and thrice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He covereth the part himſelf with a Cloth, firſt wiping the Cloth on both ſides with his hands.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He exhorteth the Patient to call upon God, that his hands may take effect.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He profeſſeth that what he doth is by the ſpecial gift and calling of God, and that he doth but his duty in theſe practices.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="462" facs="tcp:57185:255"/>
8. In touching he never uſeth the bleſſed name of Jeſus or Jeſus Chriſt, and denies to give his reaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. After his touching he enjoins, that neither the Patient nor any other touch it till he himſelf take off the cloth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In touching of Sores, if the circled cloth do touch the Sore, then his touching is in vain for that time, and he muſt touch again.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He commandeth the Patient that during the time of his cure no oils, ointments or ſalve touch the cloth or the part affected.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. He commands the Patient to eat the beſt meat, and to drink ſtrong beer, and to waſh his hands and face in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in no caſe to touch cold water.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. He ſaith he is the Seventh Son of the Eight his Father had.</p>
                  <p>To this ſuperſtition he adds firſt this blaſphemy, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon touching he doth find virtue to go out of him, ſo as he is weakened more by touching 30 or 40 in a day, than when he digged 8 rods of ground in a day. And it is credibly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to us by a perſon of good reputation, that the ſaid <hi>Leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rett</hi> hath ſaid, that if he touch a Female, he is much more weakened.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly he adds ſcorn and contempt towards thoſe whom the Sacred hand of his Majeſty hath touched for the Evil, as appeareth by the Certificate of Mr. <hi>Edward Pate.</hi>

                        <p>UPon conſideration taken of this Petition hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, preſented unto the Preſident and College of Phyſicians by the Midwives, We the College of Phyſicians conceiving the ſaid complaint to be grounded upon juſt grievance, and to conduce to a general good, in the timely prevention of ſo growing an inconvenience, Have particularly informed our ſelves concerning the ſaid buſineſs, and do certify that the like project was formerly attempted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is now intended by the Doctour, and therefore was referred by K. <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory to the Lords of the Council, and by their Lordſhips to the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to certify their opinions thereof; who upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation made report to their Lordſhips of the unfitneſs of the ſaid propoſition, there being no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ever uſed either here or in any other Kingdom. Whereupon the ſame was rejected and died. And whereas we underſtand that the ſaid Doctour doth ground his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint upon the inſufficiency of Midwives, whom he would undertake to teach, though licenſed by your Lordſhips Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, whom we do believe to be as carefull in admitting of Midwives as they are in other Kingdomes; Onely we are informed that divers do practiſe without Licence, and ſome are Deputies to others, through whom we probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome abuſes to grow, becauſe their abilities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of lives and converſations are not teſtified upon oath as others are who are licenſed. But for adding ſufficiency to them by the Doctour's inſtruction, he is not otherwiſe able to inſtruct them than any other the meaneſt Fellow of our College, unleſs he underſtand it by the uſe of Iron inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Phyſicians and Chirurgions may practiſe if they pleaſe; and ſome do and have done with as good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and dexterity as himſelf, and therefore there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſole dependence upon him. And it being true that is reported by the Midwives, the Doctour doth often refuſe to come to the poor, they being not able to pay him according to his demands; and for the rich he denies them
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:57185:257"/>
his help untill he hath firſt bargained for great rewards; which beſides that they are in themſelves diſhoneſt, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and unconſcionable courſes, they are alſo contrary to the Laws and Statutes of our College, to which by Oath he is bound. We therefore for this and other reaſons we can alledge, conceive his ſuit to be unreaſonable and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. And ſo do humbly leave the ſame to your Lordſhips grave judgments, unto whom his Majeſty referred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Shambrooke,</hi> one of the Wardens of the Apothecaries, preſented 2. Apprentices to be examined. He was asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had been examined and approved by their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He anſwered, they had not. Whereupon Mr. Preſident gave him to underſtand that the College would not hereafter examine any of their Apprentices, except they were firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and approved by their own Officers; for ſo and no otherwiſe the College had decreed to proceed in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary-Peak</hi> was complained of for undertaking the cure of one <hi>Major</hi>'s daughter, for which ſhe had 20 <hi>l.</hi> and 10 <hi>s. per</hi> week for diet. Yet was ſhe ſo far from curing her, that ſhe had left her in a worſe condition than when ſhe undertook her Cure. She was by the Cenſors fined 10 <hi>l.</hi> for her fooliſh and deſperate practiſing Phyſick. Her impriſonment was remitted for ſome conſiderations, provided ſhe gave ſecurity for the payment of her Fine within 26 days.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> appeared before the Preſident and Cenſors upon ſummons, he was rebuked for his practiſing upon Mad-men without calling any Phyſician to the cure according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his permiſſion granted him by the College and his own promiſe. Upon ſome excuſes made by him, his ſubmiſſion to the College Cenſure, with freſh promiſes of better confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hereafter, he was diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>Phyſicians of the College of <hi>London</hi> are bound to write the day of the month and the year of our Lord upon their Bills or preſcripts, and to ſubſcribe their proper names thereto, and the Apothecaries ſhould not make any ſuch medicine, as is not ſo noted and ſubſcribed; except they know the hand to be the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:57185:257"/>
hand-writing of ſome one of the Phyſicians of the College of <hi>London,</hi> or that ſuch Apothecaries with their own hands do firſt date ſuch bills, and note down the names of the Phyſicians ſo directing them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtopher Barton, Weaver,</hi> was accuſed for practiſing the Art of Phyſick unskilfully and to the hurt of many. One charged him for taking money to cure an old Cough, for which he gave him onely white Wine and Sugar, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited him nothing. Another complained that ſhe had given him money to cure her, but was nothing the better. Upon theſe complaints he was left to the Meſſenger till the next Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors day; when appearing, 4 perſons more brought freſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt him for his illegal and ill practice. This <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> affirmed of himſelf, that his Cures were by virtue of his hand, and not by the drinks and liquours he gave. This he underſtood by his mother, who wiſhed him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſcald head, to ſtroke his head with his own hand, whereby he was cured. And therefore ſometimes he uſed onely his hand, ſometimes he gave Wine, whereinto he dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his finger, that the people might have ſomewhat to take, but the virtue came from his hand. <hi>Barton</hi> was cenſured to pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> and to remain a priſoner in <hi>Woodſtreet</hi> Compter till releaſed by the Preſident, where he continued till the 19th of <hi>October</hi> following, never having all that time petitioned the College for his liberty: And then by virtue of a Writ of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> which he had ſued forth of the King's Bench, he was carried with his cauſe to the King's Bench Bar at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> The Copy of which Warrant and the Return thereof, here immediately enſue.</p>

reſpited the cauſe untill <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 24th of <hi>October</hi> following, when all parties appearing with Councel on both ſides, the Warrant and Return was read and the Cauſe debated, and there the Court plainly declared that he ſhould not be Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being againſt the Law, and the Letter of the Warrant grounded upon the Statutes.
