            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is enough for him to haue broken the yſe, and to haue ſhewed the waye for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, miniſtring matter of further deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, what manner courſe ought to be taken for the taming and maiſtering of this ſo fierce and cruell a Dragon, (for ſo I reade this ſickenes of the plague

<pb facs="tcp:1935:11"/>
For ſuch a plague is wont to happen not by common tokens, yea and very ſeldome, and that myraculouſly. And I nothing doubt that God doth winke at many things, and doth not at all times defend vs, which thing notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee is able for to doe: or to ſpeake more properly, that he doth oftentimes vſe the Diuel, yea, men alſo, and which more is, our ſelues, to trye our ſelues withall: ſo farre of is it that I woulde by any meanes denie it. Moreouer this likewiſe is a rare thing, &amp; ſuch as many old men haue not ſeen in all their life, that a plague ſhould growe of the infection of the common ayre. For in this caſe it muſt needes bee that many &amp; manifeſt ſignes goe before. Wherefore wee ſee the Aſtrologers many times to be fouly deceiued for want of due conſideration of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For how can they alwayes without errour obſerue and marke ſo hidden natures of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and ſo diuers coniunctions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions of all the ſtarrs? Therefore foraſmuch as it is not lawfull, neyther altogether to ſhut out God, nor raſhly to make him the Authour of our errour and ouerſight, according vnto the iudgement of the moſt learned and graue men, both Philoſophers and Phiſitions, and alſo Diuines: this may well bee affirmed, that euerie peſtilence in deede, like as other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

And this is a moſt heauie caſe, and growing ſodenly, rageth verie hotly againſt thoſe (for we do not affirme the chaſtizing of the Lorde to bee like a bickering in the dark) who are not marked: the which we cannot auoid either by flying or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or ought to ſeeke to auoid, but the way is only by ſupplication, prayer, and purgings.

For the olde Writers as well Greekes as Latines vſe to call that holye or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, which is vnuſuall, vehement and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Be it ſo, yet this is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the teſtimonies of learned and godly men, that, as hath bin ſaide
<pb facs="tcp:1935:15"/>
in the beginning, it is not alwaies a puniſhment immediately ſent from God, as they either of ignoraunce, or too much ſcrupuloſitie and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cednes of conſcience haue perſwaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. <hi>S.

many times thought, and hereafter wil think, if God ſpare me life, according to my power, to perfourme the ſame, in mine own proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, that is, in the Phiſicke of the bodye.</p>
            <p>But whereas I haue ſpoken of Diuinitie,<note place="margin">The ſtudie of diuinitie apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taineth vnto al.</note> I would not haue it ſo taken, as if I meant raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thruſt my ſickle into an other man his har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueſt, &amp; to play the buſie body.

            <p>Wherefore they doe very wickedly, whiche doe ſo follow their wordly buſines, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or priuate, that they haue either none at all, or elſe verye ſmall regarde of diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and not like men, which for the ſtudie of diuinitie doe for ſlow their matters at home &amp; abroad.

to breed euery where through out al our countrie of Germanie in a manner, &amp; is very hot in ſome places not farre from vs, and as it goeth, like vnto a Canker, eateth vppe all the thinges that are next vnto it: manye learned Phiſitions haue written diligently of the curing of thoſe, which are taken with this diſeaſe, &amp; alſo of the preſeruation of euerye perticular perſon, &amp; haue left their counſails in whole bookes, a practiſe greatly doubtleſſe to be commended: but beecauſe I haue perceiued this their endeuour not to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is daily neuertheles increaſed, &amp; gro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth with his ſtirring, &amp; gathereth ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by going, eſpecialy becauſe there is no publike courſe &amp; order taken for the auoyding of this euil, I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that there is need of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e greater help, namly, which muſt be vſed by the authority of the magiſtrat, in whoſe trauel the chief hope of ſtaying this miſerie conſiſteth &amp; lieth.

that albeit the magiſtrate ought not to cure the diſeaſes of euery ſeueral man, or preſerue them from ſuche as doe not openlie raunge, nor haue common cauſes, (for this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duetie of the Phiſitions) yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they holde it to bee belonging to their charge, by their ſeruice and authoritie to performe, that their ſubiectes may liue commodiouſly: who ſeeth not, that this commodiouſnes doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appertayne vnto the health of the bodye?

For they that hitherto haue had no care of true godlynes, cannot profitably exhort any man thereunto. And the vntemperate will bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe moſt of the time vpon their cups, and wil be vnprofitable vnto them ſelues, much more vnto others: eſpecially ſeeing this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſetled in the heartes of many, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thinke drunkennes and plenty of wine to be a notable remedy againſt this ſicknes. As for the incontinent, there will be great peril, when as in theſe times many occaſions of

               <p>They therfore which hold, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuate receiuinge of the Lordes Supper maye or ought to be left vndon of the ſick, giue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,<note place="margin">Of priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Lords ſupper.</note> that whatſoeuer ſuch rites ought to be done, be done in time, and in the publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that in that ſame extreame neceſſity there be no neede of this carefulnes,<note place="margin">Reaſons of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deny it.</note> whiche they ſay proceedeth partly from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance of the common people, partly of diſtruſt, and not to be without ſuſpition of a kinde of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when as amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt other things, the Supper is as it were a certaine ioyful and ſolemne confeſſion and calling to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1935:40"/>
remembrance of the death and benefites of Chriſte, that it cannot conueniently &amp; come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee done of ſuche as are halfe dead, and ſtroken with the feare of death. Thirdly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> albeit they doubte not that it was ordeined for the ſtrengthening of faith: yet that there are remaining other remedies for ſuche as are in this caſe: namely, the preaching of the worde, of the which there is the like po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and like effect, which is of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Fourthly, when as the Churche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> many times is vncertaine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> repentance &amp; tryall of the ſicke, eſpecially ſuch as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with this deadly diſeaſe, when as ſhee knoweth not, whether they bee moued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto rather through feare of death, or truſte in the worke done (as they tearme it) or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome rather then of a right mind which rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon alſo in ſom place is obſerued as touching malefactours or euill doers) they thinke it with more ſafetie to be left vndone, then to bee giuen. For albeit euery man is not bounden to examine others, but themſelues, according vnto the counſaile of the Apoſtle: yet that the church ought to do nothing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to haue diligent regard, what, who, with what fellowes, wherefore, howe, when the Sacraments are to bee miniſtred, leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:1935:41"/>
ſhee caſt roſes and pearles vnto ſwine, and giue that which is holie vnto dogges. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that alwaies the receiuers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are not this way benefited, but that many times damnation is miniſtred vnto them in ſteede of ſaluation, and iudgement in ſteed of life, not onely the Apoſtle himſelf being witnes, but alſo <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> himſelfe, who hath ſaid of vnwholeſome or vncleane bodies, that the more they are nouriſhed, the more they are hurt. Which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in like maner affirme of vncleane ſoules, vnto which if you offer holſome and nouriſhable ſpeeches: that is, admoniſh them of vertues or vices, they waxe not onely not the better, but alſo the worſe. Wherefore wiſe Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when as they doubt of a diſeaſe, or of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the ſick body, &amp; therfore what will be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iſſue, they are wont to folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ſafe &amp; eaſie medicines, &amp; not ſuche as may bring into danger. Laſtly, they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not ſo much as the forme, which giueth vnto euery thing his beeing, is obſerued and kept in that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate miniſtration vnto the ſicke. For Chriſte vnto his Apoſtles, that is, vnto the Church preſent, and gathered in one, and not to one particuler perſon, deuided the Supper, and ſaid not <hi>take,</hi> but <hi>take yee</hi>: nor <hi>eate,</hi> but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1935:41"/>
                  <hi>eate yee</hi>: Finally, not <hi>drinke,</hi> but <hi>drinke yee</hi>: wherefore S. Paule in rehearſing the ordinance of Chriſte, badde not euerie man to eate his owne Supper, but one to tarry for another, that it might truly bee called a Communion, and that by the breaking and partaking of one loafe, might bee ſhewed a liuely growing together in charitie to bee made, and alſo an incorporation into Chriſt, and our neighbours and the receiuers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And theſe thinges are ſo liked of the one ſide, that they woulde neuer haue this ſacrament miniſtred to any, but in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſembly. For whereas it ſeemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome, that as the worde may bee preached euery where, and ſet foorth to men alone ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſicke or whole: ſo alſo this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our Communion, may priuately bee rightlie miniſtred vnto one, they think that the compariſon is not alike. For that euery kinde of miniſterie hath his maner &amp; forme as it were, without the which they cannot be the thing that they are called, albeit all thinges tende vnto the ſame end. What that properly it is no part of the miniſterie, vnto ſicke men, or vnto others priuately without the publike aſſemblie to haue the woorde read, preached, and with the ſame, others to be admoniſhed, inſtructed, and comforted.
<pb facs="tcp:1935:42"/>
For that this may bee done of any, and ſo is wont to bee, yea euen of women, vnto whome notwithſtanding the publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie is not permitted, wherefore they think that here is a diſlikelihood, and that theyr cauſe as yet ſtandeth: namely, that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought not to be priuate, but publike, and common vnto many.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The reaſons of them that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine priuate receiuing.</note>On the contrary ſide, others contende that this vſe and cuſtome of priuate recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Supper of the Lorde ought to be reteined, if not at all times, yet at leaſt wiſe, when the whole congregation recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it in the Church. For albeit Chriſt (ſay they) peraduenture did it not, as who helde the Supper only once with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, heereof yet it followeth not, either that it is not lawful, or that the Apoſtles and the Church which followed them, did it not. For ſuch as were abſent might be letted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lawfull cauſes, as by ſickneſſe, or age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or other occaſions, ſo that they could not reſort vnto the publike aſſemblie. Hereupon the olde fathers of the true primatiue Churche, vſed to imparte it as well to ſuche kinde of perſons being in health, as to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were ſick, to the one as the cognizance, and badge
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1935:42"/>
of peace and agreement of faith, and to the other as a paſport to them that were going away. For when as the Church is as it were one vnited and whole bodie, and that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per appointed for the whol Church, there is no cauſe (they ſay) why ſhee may lawfully denie it vnto ſome certaine members being abſent, vpon ſome ceraine lets. And wheras it is ſaide that the Churche is vncertaine of the faith and minde of ſuche perſons, albeit this peraduenture may haue place in thoſe whom it is manifeſt to haue led a looſe and lewde life before, &amp; in ſuch as are vnknowne vnto the Church: yet this principle oughte to be reteined, which hytherto hath byn vſed: The Church doth not iudge of things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are hidden, and whoſoeuer doe confeſſe with vs with one conſent Chriſt, and in plaine words acknowledge that they repent of their ſins, being by Baptiſme ingrafted into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bodie of the outwarde congregation, that of theſe wee ought to hope well, and to make them partakers of the outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of the Church. For (ſay they) ther is not ſo great danger, as ſeemeth vnto others for to bee, and that here there is no more poyſon giuen in ſteede of medicine vnto them that craue it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is to thoſe that are in body
<pb facs="tcp:1935:43"/>
bodie preſent, and gathered together in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that we muſt not ſo much regarde vnto whom it is giuen (ſo that they be not open enemies of religion, or by force of the diſeaſe driuen out of their wittes) then what is giuen. For that the chief end of this Sacrament is, that Chriſte ſhould aſſure vs, yea, &amp; make vs partakers of his promiſe, &amp; benefites purchaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his own blood (which on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> high altar of our redemption he ſhed to ſet men at libertie) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould arme vs with faith &amp; hope, knit Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s together with the bond of mutuall loue, &amp; enflame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were with a certain fire of loue. Moreouer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacraments are a part of the word, &amp; as it were certain viſible words, the which alſo according vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of others, bring no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word it ſelfe preached &amp; heard, albeit they doe it by another meane, they ſay there is no cauſe why ſufficient, wherefore wee ſhould more withhold them then this from any man, who thus farre, as concerneth outward conuerſation, haue byn our brethren: for who can iudge the hart, but God alone? If they haue heretofore liued ſomwhat more at large, may it not be that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſhort admonition of the miniſter, or a litle breathing of the holy Ghoſt, may rayſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1935:43"/>
vp in them ſome ſmall ſparke, the which by all meanes to cheriſh, ſo as it be not againſt godlines, ſhall not be vnprofitable? Howe I pray you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it choſe but be againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſdom of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to depriue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thanks ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of the Lords death, who in their heart feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be moued to celebrate &amp; keepe the ſame with the church, that is, with their body, albeit in ſituation of place abſent therfro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wold declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be a member therof, &amp; to be ſhort, are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to teſtifie before others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their former life? Laſt of al, theſe leane ſo far to this opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thinke the ſupper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord to be no where more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtred, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the ſick. For here is in deede reteined the true forme thereof, in the which it was firſt inſtituted: namely, at the point of death, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other vrgent &amp; great perill, ſome ſharp admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goyng before. And to be brief, a liuelie faith, hope of ſaluation, earneſt prayers, &amp; an ardent mind folowing: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, altogether earneſtly. Which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration hath ſo far liked ſome, that they haue thoght y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there could be not better refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the maſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuſed ſupper of the Lord, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue it made by this rule.</p>

hereunto, and haue beene ſpoken as it were beſides the cauſe, and that I my ſelfe leaue the matter in ſuſpence to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by my maſters the Diuines and Gouernours of the Churche: yet heereof woulde I haue our diſeaſed people to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, that touching this matter they quiet themſelues, and bee not troubled in minde, if happily either through the crueltie of ſickneſſe, or for other cauſes, they cannot at that time bee partakers of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the outward ceremonie. For if the Heathen Poet haue iudged it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>ſo farre as able thou ſhalt bee, the immortall Gods to ſerue:</hi> why ſhould not rather wee Chriſtians, who by the ſonne of God are deliuered from all bondage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues the ſame, and beleeue that God, who ſearcheth the heartes and reynes, and requireth not ſo much the fact, as the mind, will as well be preſent with vs by his ſpirite, as if in the very deede we had fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Ceremonie? For this is that ſpirituall eating or Communion, which our Elders alſo beleeued to bee done in minde, and faith, and to make vs no leſſe partakers of the body of Chriſte bringing ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they are which vſe the outwarde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:

               <p>And firſt concerning Churchmeetinges,<note place="margin">Of order to be kept in the church.</note> this counſel is to be giuen, that they come not by heapes, or by thronges, neither in, nor goe out, and that they flocke not by great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers into one Church, where they ſhalbe driuen to fit ſtreightly and neere together, eſpeciall in one Citie: whereas there are more places fit for this purpoſe, in the whiche the diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that is, the expounding of the woorde of God, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments may be done. For albeit theſe thinges may peraduenture ſeem vnto ſome to be but ſmal, and of little importance, yet nothing is to be omitted, which by any meanes may make for the turning away of the infection.

For it can ſcarſe bee ſaide, howe great and preſent daunger doth hereby grow vnto the whole citie. For which cauſe I haue ſeene in the moſt famous citie of <hi>Padway,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſame manner meate daylie by the common charge allowed, not onely vnto the poorer ſort, but alſo vnto them of reaſonable wealth, which eyther had been with the ſicke, or were them ſelues infected, that ſo muche the more eaſilie they might bee kepte within their owne walles at home.<note place="margin">Of mainteining the poore.</note> And it were a thing highlie to bee wiſhed, that not onely in theſe times, in which eſpecially neceſſitie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth require the ſame, but continuallie and alwayes care were had of all common wealthes, that the poore might bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mainteyned, then by this ſhamefull, and vnto Chriſtians reprochefull, running vppe and downe, by whiche they inure themſelues vnto nothing but idle life, and all kynde of naughtineſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:1935:50"/>
there is ſcarſe any village ſo meane, but that it were able in ſome reaſonable ſorte to mainteyne their poore, if ſo be the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates did mind the matter, and that wiſedom and order were vſed.

               <p>This alſo in this place I haue thought good to call into counſaile, becauſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes there are manye fearefull, manye weake by nature, and vnfitte to doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the common neceſſity, whom it were better to liue ſome where els, that it might be both more commodious for them, and the common wealth alſo leſſe charged, whether it may be ordeyned, to ſet theſe at libertie, to get them ſelues for a time vnto ſome other place.

               <p>There is alike fault vnto this, and too abhominable (the which I maruaile to bee ſuffered in worſhipfull Cities, and I ſhame to ſpeake it) that the ſtreetes, and allies, yea and the Church yards alſo, are euerie where in ſome places ſo defiled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doung of ſhameleſſe Roges and Beggars, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che way ſo euer you turne your ſelfe (with reuerence bee it ſpoken) you will thinke you ſee not a publike and commendable way in the Citie, but a vile and beaſtlye Iakes.

But we who being enlighted with the light of the Goſpell, ought to eſteeme of euerye thing not by the abuſe but by the lawful vſe, doe in ſuch ſort vſe it, that we acknowledge it to be giuen not by the counſel of man, but by the benefite of God, for the prolonging of life, ſo farre as concerneth outwarde helpes and aydes. The iudgement of <hi>Luther</hi> in a little Dutch booke of the plague, ſet foorth at <hi>Wittenberge</hi> in the yeere 1527. is moſt graue and godlie, and a doctrine fitte for this our buſineſſe in hand: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath created phiſicke,</hi>

               <p>And firſt of all concerning the matter, the ſame muſt not be clay,<note place="margin">The matter of the Plague houſes.</note> lome, turfs, or ſtraw, but wood, ſtone, lime, becauſe that putrifiyng doth more eaſily happen, and the infection hang more longer in them, then in theſe.</p>

The fourth fell downe dead likewiſe.

matter, ſituation, and forme of the buylding: I wil go forward to recite the wealth, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and vſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly therefore,<note place="margin">The riches of the Plague houſes.</note> prouiſion muſt be made for the rich, wherwith our plague hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are to be furniſhed: which being once appoynted according vnto the eſtate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of euery Cittie, it is to be hoped, that by little and lyttle, through the lybera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie of good menne, they will wax grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and increaſe euerye day. Although in this caſe no other riches are ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then ſuch as are needfull for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of thoſe that neede, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the buylding. And becauſe the Plague doth not alwayes reigne, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ſhall not neede to be any yearely charges made, but, as I haue ſayde, ſo much as ſhall be requiſite for the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If there be anye ouerplus, that ſhall be layd vp, eyther for the neceſſitie to come, or to be to beſtowed vppon the vſe of the poore.</p>
               <p>Nowe I ſayde at the beeginning,<note place="margin">Two Plague houſes.</note> that two ſuch houſes were to be buylded: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, the one for ſuch as are yet ſounde and well, but yet by reaſon of the companye at home, which they haue hadde with the ſicke,
<pb facs="tcp:1935:85"/>
are to be ſuſpected and feared: and the other for thoſe which lye ſicke, infected with the plague.</p>
               <p>And as for other poyntes, they may bee like, but they muſt be conuenient waye, the one from the other. For it hath beene marked, that this ſickly infection hath bene increaſed, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the incloſures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, and ſtanding and touchinge of the houſes together. And they muſte in ſuch order bee ſeuered the one from the other, that in receyuing the North wynde, and Sunne beames, the one bee not an hinderaunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, nor bee anye let to receiue the free ayre: eſpecially that the South winde out of the houſe of the ſicke with his blaſte, bring no diſeaſe and plaguy vapour or ſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch into the ground of the whole and ſounde. Therefore alſo it ſhal be more conueniente, at that ſide to haue no windowes at all, or elſe to keepe them ſhut.</p>
               <p>And hereof nowe alſo (that which in the laſt place was ſet downe) appeareth the vſe of theſe houſes.<note place="margin">The vſe of the plague houſes.</note> For, when as wee iudge this diſeaſe to bee by all meanes to be auoyded, as a preſent and deadly poyſon, the which vnleſſe it be diligently taken heede of, doth moſt vndoubtedly infect, therefore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1935:85"/>
the firſt vſe of this new buylding ſhal bee, to receiue thoſe, who are infected as it were with a deadly lepry, that the other citizens may be in ſo much the leſſe daunger. The which of how great weight it is, if any man will beleeue me, who neither haue any cauſe to lye, and am ſory that there are many, who in their bookes doe lie notoriouſly (let it bee lawfull for me to ſpeake ſo with <hi>Galen,</hi> in a good teſtimonie of my conſcience) I canne ſhewe by many moſt true hiſtories, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which partely I haue ſeene and liued, and partely haue heard of others worthy credite. For when as being yet a boy, I went to ſchoole in the Citie of Dauentrie, where was then a moſt floriſhing ſchoole, one of the ſchollers was taken with the Plague,<note place="margin">A ſcholler of Dauentry.</note> which dwelled in his brothers houſe, ſurnamed <hi>Hercules,</hi> becauſe of the ſingular ſtrength of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, my bourdfellowe, who, becauſe hee was remooued beetymes into a priuate houſe, vnto the which others had no acceſſe, neuer a one beſides was infected with this diſeaſe, or died. Afterwardes, when being a young man I ſtudyed Philoſophy at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in the College of Artes, a certaine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman our ſchoolfellow, one amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt many,<note place="margin">A ſtudent of Colain.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time no plague, died of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague:
<pb facs="tcp:1935:86"/>
to witte, becauſe his diſeaſe being knowne, he was by and by caried vnto a peculiar and an appoynted place for this purpoſe. Three yeares after, when I dwelled at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Colledge of <hi>Monachus,</hi> I ſawe among two thouſand boyes only one cooke viſited with this ſickneſſe, and by and by carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide vnto a little cottage, which was builded in a large Orcharde for this purpoſe, to die there,<note place="margin">A Cooke of Paris.</note> the reſt of the company remayning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſafe and ſound.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which it delighteth me often to remember, when as there I haunted the Phiſicke Schooles, I ſawe ſomewhat hotte beginninges of the plague, the which notwithſtanding by this wiſdome, and putting a part into ſuch hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (for they haue them alwayes in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) and by ſeuering the hole and the ſick, beſides other kinds of pollicie, and paine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in a very ſhort time for the moſte part were appeaſed So true is the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, <hi>He that will flye ſmok, muſt flie the fier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ende ſhall ſtand them more in ſteede, whom the danger in deede is nigh, but which yet are not infected with the ſame. For when as the houſes of many are verye
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1935:86"/>
vncommodious, and more apt to nouriſh the corruption, then to remedy the ſame: alſo when as the men that dwell in them, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten poore, or ſeruile perſons, or weake of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which do tremble at the verye name of ſuch a ſore diſeaſe, whereupon alſo they are in the more daunger, I would ſo haue them carried out of their infected houſes, that they ſhould forthwith be brought in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague houſe, and there in euery point after the ſame maner to be handled, after which I ſaid, they were to be handled before, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they were ſhut vp in their own houſes, ſauing that here they may haue free ayre, and libertie to goe abroad, if they will walke forth, for the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of their minde ſake. But how many daies are requiſite for the cleanſing of thoſe, which are ſo carryed forth, that they maye freelye returne againe into the Cittie and company of men, becauſe that the ſame time neither ought nor can with ſafetie inough be preſcribed and appoynted vnto al, this iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be left vnto the Phiſitions, as it were vnto the Prieſts for this cruell leprie. To which purpoſe ſo ſpeaketh Luther in his book of the Plague,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> handling the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we now haue in hand: <hi>If GOD</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>in the olde Teſtament willed
<pb facs="tcp:1935:87"/>
thoſe to be ſeuered, and put apart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citie, which were defiled with the lepry, to auoide the infection, howe much more iuſtly may we doe the ſame in this daungerous ſickneſſe, that forth with, ſo ſoone as one is infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, hee either of his owne accorde remoue himſelfe, or cauſe him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, that the infection may in time bequenched, not of that ſick perſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but of the whole ſocietie and all the Cittie, the whiche, if the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted haue free leaue to goe out vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may by this meanes be infected. For ſuch is at this tyme our plague of Witeberge (hee ſpeaketh of the yeere,</hi> 1527.) <hi>namely, that it maye ſeeme as begunne onely by infection, ſo alſo gon thus farre as it is. For the ayre (thanks be to God) is hitherto pure and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye, and of meere raſhneſſe and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſome, and the ſame in deede verye few, haue ben infected: albeit ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with vnwoonted feare doe trouble vs, and make vs cowardharted.

ſoeuer of theſe thinges is done, that it is not done for the helpe of the dead (as our Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly beleeued) but for the comfort of them that be aliue (as <hi>S.

But if any wil pretend and alleadge the duety of charitie, the whiche by this meanes may ſeeme to be diminiſhed, and as it were withdrawen from the poorer ſort, they ſhal eaſily be pacified, when as they ſhall ſee the ſame order to be obſerued in all.

                  <hi>And this I am aſſured of that among the olde as well Iewes as Gentiles, as well godly as vngodly, this was the cuſtome, to haue their burials and graues without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who notwithſtanding were no leſſe wittie nor wiſe then wee. That whiche I haue ſaid, the Goſpel of Luke doth ſhew, when as Chriſte before the Citie Naim raiſed from death the ſonne of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe. For the text ſaith, that he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without the Citie to be buried, and that many followed him. So that there is no doubt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the vſage of this one place, that thoſe men had their burials without the walles of the Citie: as alſo it is euident that the ſepulchre of Chriſte himſelfe was without the Citie Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Abraham bought himſelfe a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar place in the fielde Ephron, where all the fathers vſed to be buried, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo the Latine worde hath his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that the dead are ſaide to be carried out, that is, to bee carryed out of the towne or Citie, which we call to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to burying.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1935:104"/>
But if it were in an other place ſeuerally without the citie, whereunto there were no common entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or paſſage through for euery body, then doubtleſſe it would ſeeme a thing religious, honourable to behold, and holy, which might ſtirre vp the commers thither vnto the ſtudye of godlyneſſe.

For, albeit it be reported of certaine people, that they vſe euery man in his owne houſe to keepe their dead put in Coffins, like as wee in a manner as fondly bury in Churches, ſuch as many tymes are not worthy of the high way: yet that is too barbarous, and vnleſſe they bee well dreſſed with manye precious things, vntolerable.</p>
               <p>Now, concerning the ſituation and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of buylding,<note place="margin">The ſituation of the churchyard.</note> it ſhall bee more agreeable
<pb facs="tcp:1935:105"/>
vnto reaſon, that it be lying more towarde the North, then the South: and that it be ſet rather in a high and dry place, then in a low and wette place. For as it hath beene ſayde before, when as there aryſeth alwayes out of Church-yardes aboundance of infectious exhalations and breathes, and corrupteth the ayre, the ſituation, lownes, and moyſtnes of the ground, may not a litle increaſe this inconuenience: which they witneſſe, who ſometimes white linnen cloathes there.

                  <note place="margin">De ciuit. dei.</note> it was rather a defiling and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, in deede not common, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſent by God, then a diſeaſe of the body, and (as hee ſpeaketh) rather a blemiſh of the colour and ſkin, then of health, or of ſounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſenſes and members. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture alſo doth oftner vſe the worde of <hi>cleanſing</hi> then of healing, when as it ſpeaketh of the curing of this griefe. And in my iudgement certaine famous Phiſitions doe very well diſtinguiſhe this our Leprie, whiche is called of the Greekes, <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> from that of the Hebrews, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is named <hi>Saharath,</hi> and of the whiche mention is made in <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> and in the Euangeliſts. For this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe (ſay they) is not of them, which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe errour are wont to happen in ſixe not naturall thinges, where as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a griefe proceeding from the wrath of GOD,<note place="margin">Amat. Luſi.</note> whiche according to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1935:115"/>
nature of the ſinne is wont to happen not onelye vnto the bodyes of menne, but alſo vnto garmentes, and the walles of houſes, in the which thoſe tranſgreſſours dwelled: according to the greatneſſe (I ſay) of the faulte. For if the fault were ſmall, certaine ſmall ſpottes dyd aryſe in the walles of the houſe: if it were greater, they did cleaue vnto garments: but if it were a moſt greate ſinne, then the bodie of the ſinner was defiled with the ſame. And thoſe that were ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this Leprie, were iudged of the hygh Prieſte by the ſpace of fourteene dayes, whether they were to bee ſhutte out of the companie of men or no. For there was no neede of the helpe of man to the curing of the ſame, but onely of the hande of GOD. All which this (lyke as manie other) are nowe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>But concerning this our <hi>Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacall Leprie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Elephantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, or Leprie of our time.</note> which doth moſte greatlie differ from this other, this is manifeſte out of the bookes of Phiſitions, and nature of the ſame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a diſeaſe comming of the fault of the bowels, &amp; humours, very fierce
<pb facs="tcp:1935:116"/>
and as it were a canker of the whole bodie: the which in times paſt (as hiſtories report) was peculiar vnto <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and not ſeene in <hi>Italie</hi> before the age of <hi>Pompeius Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> What? that euen at this day it is more ſeldome in <hi>Italie,</hi> then in our countrie of <hi>Germanie,</hi>

For they indifferently &amp; without any choiſe or order feede on fiſh, podware, ſome fruits, milke,<note place="margin">Nat. hiſto. 26. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> and white meates. The Leprie called <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Plinie</hi> after this maner, that it is ſaide oftentimes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the face, firſt in the noſe, as it were a little Lentill, anone going ouer the whole bodie, ſpottie, of diuers colours, and the ſkin vnequall, in ſome place thicke, in ſome

But theſe thinges are not for this place.

For peraduenture they were for this cauſe ſeparated among our auncetours from other men, becauſe it was a fouleneſſe and

certaine filthineſſe that God woulde not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in his people: as whiche it behooued to excell in the cleanneſſe as well of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye as of mynde: or for that they whiche were defiled with theſe ſpottes, ſhoulde ſuſtayne ſome puniſhement: to witte, that both they ſhoulde abſtayne from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of others, &amp; others likewiſe from theirs: which thing in the iudgement of ſome was an Image of our excommunication at this daye, whiche they commonlye call <hi>banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>abannition,</hi> that is abſence for one yeere.

bright fiers and flames. For in a generall ſickeneſſe the purenes of the ayre is a chiefe remedie, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and all auncient wiſe men doe witneſſe. And the fire dooth cleanſe, drye vppe and purifie all thinges, and is vnto the ayre, as it were the Sunne, ſoule, and lyfe:<note place="margin">Pli. hiſt. nat. 56. cap. vlt.</note> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as looke what that notable preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Triacle dooth vnto compound bodies, that dooth fire vnto the ayre, of all ſimple bodyes, as in place, ſo alſo in vertue the higheſt elemente:<note place="margin">De var. rer. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <hi>By howe much the ayre is better, by ſo much the minde is better.</hi> For men for the moſt part are diſpoſed according vnto the qualitie of the ayre.</p>
               <p>Dogges alſo, Cattes, Goates, and other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> tame beaſtes, which are woont to runne vp and downe, and euery where to wander in the ſtreetes, are not to be ſuffered, or at leaſt wiſe muſt be kept at home, for ſuch may cary about &amp; bring vnto others y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague, albeit they them ſelues many times remaine vnhurt: the which is manifeſt both by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, and alſo hiſtories worthy credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1935:130"/>Wherefore ſuche as cannot eaſilye bee kepte at home, as Cattes, it is better that they bee killed, then ſuffered, and in the roome of them, to vſe ginnes and mouſe trappes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> No ſtraungers, nor Citizens which come out of infected places, are to be receyued into the Citie, without a teſtimoniall of health. And ſuch teſtimonialles in papers ſealed or written, they muſte require of the Preſeruers: But if this order of our polly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be not yet receiued in ſome places, they then muſt be craued at the handes of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or Miniſter. Such as haue none, muſt keepe them ſelues without the Citie a conuenient time of certaine daies. For there muſte greater care bee had for the publike health, then priuate wealth. That whiche I haue ſaid of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, muſt alſo be vnderſtood of the thinges which they bring with them: as wares, packes, houſholde, &amp;c. For in theſe many tymes there doe lye great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For the ayre of the plague may hange a long time in them, as it is moſt euidente concerning woollen garments. For wool is woont marueilouſly to nouriſh &amp; increaſe this infection. And it is knowne of many lewd perſons, whoe by this meanes haue
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1935:130"/>
ſcattered the preſente ſickeneſſe farre and wide.</p>
               <p>Into whoſe houſes the Plague is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> they forthwith by the commaundement of the Preſeruers, ought to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues within, and muſt not haue leaue to go abrod, vnleſſe they goe noted with ſome eſpeciall marke, which ſhall pleaſe the Preſeruers: whereby notwithſtanding they ſhall not bee yet at libertie, to ſhuffle them ſelues into the companies of men, or to go into other mens houſes. The houſes alſo them ſelues muſt be noted with ſome markes, namelye by hanging before the doore a blacke, redde, or white ſheete: or ſetting vp of clubbes, or ſwathes of ſtraw, or torches vnlighted: al which are ſignes of ſickeneſſe or death. If any alſo of his owne accorde haue gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch houſes, in like manner hee ſhall not come abroad by the ſpace of 14. dayes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome marke. The ſicke and thoſe of the houſe muſt prouide for them ſelues, the one by healing, and the other by preſeruing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own charges, which be able to beare it, or by the publike charges, which are poore. For Phiſicke is the gifte of GOD, and Phiſitions the Miniſters of God, by whoſe ſeruice the Lord many times

giueth health: albeit when hee wil, hee can doe it without them, which can do al things. But it is not lawfull to tempt him, neyther ought wee to aſke myracles, when as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracles, wee maye obtaine the thinge which we require.</p>
               <p>Hereunto alſo appertaineth, that regard be had of women in trauell, which are not to be forſaken for feare of infection, but if they be ſuſpected, they are faithfully to be holpen, eſpecially of the midwiues &amp; other women, which by a publike ſtipend muſt be hired for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Two houſes, called Plague houſes muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> be built, large inough, of ſound matter, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated towards the North, of an apt forme, in ſome out corner of the Citie, or rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cittie by the running waters ſide: The one for the vſe of the hole, but yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and the other for the ſicke: not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge together, nor hindering one another in receiuing the North winde: with Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſomewhat high, but not darkiſhe, with windowes open vnto the Eaſt. For the cloſe aire is very hurtfull, of the which there haue beene ſeene fearefull examples. And theſe thinges muſt bee looked vnto in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſicknes, when the number of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1935:131"/>
infected is ſmaller. For in a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſicke perſons, and in an vniuerſall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of the citie, theſe things wil ſcarſe be ſufficient, albeit al things be well obſerued.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate, when as the neceſſarye perſons and matters of the common wealth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> be prouided for, may giue leaue vnto certain to go aſide, as vnto women, Children, tender perſons, and old men, and other vnprofitable folke, which can doe no good, but maye doe great harm, as it vſeth to be done in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burninges and firinges, or beſiegings of Cities: and he that ſhall then departe, is not to be condemned of reproch, or forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of brotherlye charitie. Otherwiſe it is lawefull for no man to flie, eſpecially if by famine, which is an other plague, he bee not driuen to ſeeke an other place.</p>
               <p>But if it be plaine by euident tokens, that this puniſhment is ſent immediately by god, without the negligence of men, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, ſo farre of is it that wee ſhoulde flye awaye, that wee ought rather patiently to abide his fatherly correction, and humbly to pray for mitigation and ſlacking of the ſame. But euery plague cannot properlye be called the plague of God, but commeth ſometimes by nature, ſomtimes by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb facs="tcp:1935:132"/>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> If there dye any (which at that time is a daily thing) they ought neither too ſlowely, nor too haſtily to be carried forth and buried. For on both ſides there is daunger and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience. Wherefore a moderation and meane muſt be vſed. This ſhall be doone by ſuch as are thereunto eſpecially appoynted, as Burſars, Grauemakers, Cleanſers: who ought quietly and modeſtlye to execute this charge, folowing holy men in times paſte, and, that which is more, the Angels of God, who themſelues alſo ſometimes did this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. It muſt alſo be done without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of men: and if ſo be that any ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie muſt be vſed, the ſame muſt be finiſhed with as little comming together and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as may be, leaſt ambition and pride may ſeeme to be ſought in death, and the old ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of pompous funeralles or buryalles be licked vp againe.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> The Church yarde, in which they are to be buryed, muſt be builded without the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Citie, of a conuenient largnes, in a place neither lowe nor moyſt, towardes the North, of around figure, compaſſed with

               <p>After that the Corſe is carryed forth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> the infected houſe, &amp; al thinges in it, are with ſingular diligence to bee cleanſed &amp; purged, ſetting open the windowes, to be perfumed with fire, and the walles to be whited with lyme. Thinges of no great value are to be burnt, others to be waſhed in lye. Laſtly, al things are to be ſtrowed with ſweet hearbs, flowers and fruites. And theſe things muſt be done by thoſe whom we haue named O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeears about buryals, Cleanſers, &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryars forth to burying, or by thoſe of the houſhold, if they be there.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Theſe orders euery one according to his abilitie and office, muſt indeuour diligently to obſerue, as moſt profitable and neceſſarye both priuatelye for him ſelfe, and for the whole ſocietie and fellowſhippe.

But he that of ſlouthfulneſſe or waywardnes ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the publike health, let him know, that he greatly hurteth charitie, and as it were ſinneth againſt his own body.</p>

               <p>And thus farre hath hytherto beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the duetie of a faythfull and wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be vſed in the time of the plague. Which if it ſhall ſeeme peraduenture newe vnto any man, albeit that in manye places it is not altogether vnuſuall: let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that wee goe about a newe woorke: Newe, I ſay, in ſome place perchaunce, or at leaſt wiſe in ſome parte newe, but yet notwithſtanding not vnprofitable, or not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye.

Do there not dayly come abroad new medicins, the vſe whereof beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto our Elders, hath beene with great fruite and profite knowen vnto vs?</p>
               <p>Wherefore they which iudge thus, that which is vnto anye man ſtraung and vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the ſame by no meanes is to bee receiued and allowed: do tye the Magiſtrate vnto too

               <p>When as therefore there are ſome Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ouer al offyces of the common wealth, who eſpeciallye take charg of thoſe things, the dooinge whereof is committed vnto them, leaſte anye thinge ſhoulde bee doone amiſſe, or diſorderlye: I hope that wyſe Magiſtrates will heerein eaſily alſo agree, to receiue this neweneſſe into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. The whiche albeit it ſhall peraduenture ſeeme ſomewhat harde vnto ſuch as are not acquainted with it: yet by vſe it will waxe milde, and by the profite thereof make it ſelfe by litle and litle more commendable. But if quarrellars ſhall crye out, that I haue taken ſome thinges out of other Authours into this Treatiſe, I haue examples, by which examples I thinke it lawefull for mee to doe that, which they haue doone. Howe many thinges, naye
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1935:134"/>
almoſt al things hath <hi>Terence</hi> taken into his Commedies out of <hi>Menander</hi>?<note place="margin">Terence.</note> And <hi>Virgil</hi> into his poeſie out of <hi>Homer, Cicero</hi> although of ſinguler wit &amp; eloquence,<note place="margin">Virgill.</note> nay the father of eloquence, was not aſhamed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where out of the Greekes, to conueigh ſo many things into his writings, that hee may ſeeme rather the Tranſlator then Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſome things. In the law, Phiſicke, Diuinitie, the new writers haue almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little, the which they haue not taken from the olde: out of whoſe bookes alſo they are not afraide to write out many thinges worde for worde, and to ſtuffe them in their workes for the maintenance of their cauſe, albeit ſometimes not without ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſhood. And theſe thinges they often do in the ſame matter which hath ſometimes beene handeled before by others: with how much more right I then who doe handle a matter not perhaps ſo verye newe, yet throughly &amp; as it were from point by point, ſet foorth hitherto by no man, that I knowe, if out of the workes of good Authours I haue fitted to my purpoſe ſuche thinges as ſeeme to ſerue the turne.

For it is a great prayſe diligently to ſearch the writings of our Elders: but a greater, faithfully to keepe the things found out: for they haue by their vertues opened the way of labour, and by theyr wiſedome left vnto vs the path of vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Now if many of the things which I here require ſhall ſeeme hard to be compaſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſome lacke wealth, ſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, ſome wiſdome: yet is it not to bee diſalowed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beſt rule be ſet down, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the which, euery man ſo farr as he may, may order his matters. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example and pattern, according vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which a thing ought to bee done, ought in euery point to bee moſt perfect,<note place="margin">The moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way is in euery thing to be ſet downe, though it cannot be by others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto.</note> that the following of the ſame may be moſt commodious.

great prayſe vnto the follower, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the next degree he come neere vnto that whiche hee hath purpoſed to follow. The Poet ſaith: <hi>Looke what wee can attaine vnto, ſome praiſe it is, though that we can performe no more:</hi> And of the wiſe men in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it is ſaide in a common verſe: <hi>They went ſo farre as they could goe, where that they coulde no further paſſe, there ſtoode they ſtill.</hi> I know it to be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to giue counſaile then to follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: yet notwitſtanding the beſt counſaile is to be giuen. For if ſome thing bee wanting in the ſetting downe how a thing ſhould bee done, no doubt ſome thing will bee wanting in the action it ſelfe, that muſt according to that rule be performed. There was neuer ſuch an Oratour as <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> do deſcribe vnto vs: Nor ſuch a Phiſition, as <hi>Galen</hi> requireth: nor ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth as <hi>Plato</hi> ſhapeth, nor ſuch a Preacher, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> painteth out: Nor finally ſuch a Church as Chriſt deſireth.
