            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this sacrament, euen the authour of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad

            <p>The enemie therfore of Christes sacraments

Wherin is it then that these men haue so

hath bene their most studie. Wel they lacke no

they say, whych thyng you wyll proue, in thys
sort I trowe. Bycause the Priest doth by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
spirituall, execute as a Minister, and
Christ doth transmute his creature. A sira, here
is pithy geare, and stronge argumentes. Your
wordes sowne as much as if you should saye, it
is so, and whi is it so? Forsoth because it is so.
I would all the subtile Sophisters of Oxford
and Cambrige, would prynte these your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes

enlarge the limyttes of their arte. For in all

            <p>But in that you say that the priest executeth
and God transmuteth: a man myght demaund
you this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whether of these two, is the
chiefe workeman, the priest or God? Your olde
fathers of Italie would say the priest, for they
would alwaye haue the most worthy first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But what shall we say to the matter? Is
not the priest the chiefe workeman? Yes true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in mine opinion, for he receyueth all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb facs="tcp:9609:19"/>
for the worke when it is done. Yea, &amp; God
neuer medieth with any transmutation, tyl the

setteth the priest on worke, and couenaunteth

saye, that by thys deacon or minister: is mente
your priest, your consecrater, &amp; sacrificer. Not
so syr. For Paul described him not to be such

they knewe that the caulfe whiche they hadde

thinckeinge that you can not otherwise haue
the fruishion of his presence then by a visible

that Christ ordayned his law to fulfil that law
So that you make one lawe figure of another
and one sacrament to be the thyng signified by

No signe or remembraunce of a thynge, can be
