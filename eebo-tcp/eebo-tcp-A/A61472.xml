            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>great</hi> Examples.</p>
            <p>Is not this the beaten way of <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> with his

Heavenly glory of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in <hi>this last</hi> Appearance, which is
<hi>now</hi> from the midst of its <hi>Thunders, Lightning</hi> upon the

            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> I hambly intreat your Patience a little
further, while I present you faithfully with my Sense in the
<hi>Comparison</hi> which I make between the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and <hi>Rigid

<hi>Presbytery,</hi> to excell the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as the fairnesse of the
Moon, doth the darknesse of the Night. I allow it to be in the <hi>first
Rank</hi> of the purest outward Forms, although not the <hi>first</hi> of that
Rank. I believe it the duty of every Christian to follow after the best Forms.
Yet is there a more excellent way, which is that of <hi>Love.</hi> My Brethren,
our <hi>Joseph,</hi> our <hi>Jesus,</hi> chargeth us not to fall out on the
<hi>way,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 31.</note> though we walk in
different <hi>paths.</hi> We are <hi>Brethren,</hi> let no outward Forms divide
us one from another, if they divide us not from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> if they have
not in their own nature an enmity to the <hi>naturall Image</hi> of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> which is <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, Morality;</hi> or the <hi>Heavenly
Image,</hi> which is <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality:</hi> Let us receive one another into
the Glory of GOD, 
<note place="margin">Rom. 15 7.</note> as <hi>CHRIST</hi> receiveth
us, though that Cloathing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form be not of the <hi>same
fashion</hi> upon all, nor on some so well shap'd, as on others, to the
Proportion of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is <hi>CHRIST</hi> The Lord
<hi>JESUS</hi> hath his <hi>Concubines,</hi> his <hi>Queens,</hi> his
<hi>Virgins;</hi> Saints in <hi>Remoter.</hi> Forms, Saints 
<note place="margin">Can. 6. 8</note> in <hi>Higher</hi> Forms,
Saints <hi>unmarried</hi> to any Form, who keep themselves single for the
immediate embraces of their Love. But <hi>CHRISTS Dove</hi> in all these is
<hi>One,</hi> the <hi>New</hi> Creature in CHRIST, the spirituall birth of the
Spirit, the only One of her Mother, that <hi>Hierusalem above,</hi> which is
the City compact, that Band of Peace, that Unity of Saints, the <hi>Holy
Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Persons;</hi> Fathers, and Brethren of the
Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! You together with me, desire after, sit drwn under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
feed upon the sweet fruit of the same <hi>Apple-tree,</hi> in the 
<note place="margin">Can. 2. 2</note> midst of the trees of the
Forrest, though not of the same <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Bough</hi> of that
<hi>Tree.</hi> I would not in any thing offend you, who are in the number of
the excellent Ones, in which is all 
<note place="margin">Psa. 16. 3</note> 
               <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> Delight on
earth. If I grieve you, what shall <pb n="7" facs="tcp:38519:3"/> make me glad? There are
of you, who are ready to answer this government of <hi>JESUS CHRIST, as</hi>
Peter <hi>did CHRIST; Thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> Feed then the sheep,
feed the Lambs, in those fresh Pastures into which <hi>He</hi> now leads you.
You who are of another mind, appear to me, like good old <hi>Zachary:</hi>
Though an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven witnesse, that the things now come to
passe, are the very <hi>answers</hi> to those pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers 
<note place="margin">Luke 1</note> which <hi>your selves</hi> put up
many years agone: yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, because the <hi>way</hi> is not in
the ordinary track of your <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Expectations.</hi>
Therefore are you struck <hi>dumb</hi> for a season, that you cannot make a
good confession of these Appearances of GOD. But when the <hi>Child</hi> shalbe
born, the <hi>Glory</hi> perfectly brought forth then your selves shal name it
<hi>John,</hi> which being interpreted, is <hi>Grace;</hi> then shall even
<hi>your</hi> tongues be loosed, to praise this <hi>Day-spring from on high,
which hath visited us;</hi> then shal you acknowledg that <hi>this</hi> was the
<hi>gate of heaven,</hi> though you were not <hi>aware</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord himself bring it to pass that all you, who in your
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st dispensations have been
fathers to these present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, may suddenly turn your hearts to your
children, lest he come, and for your sakes smite the earth, even all flesh with
a curse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to <hi>Principles.</hi> The marriage between our
Saviour and the Soul is a marriage of <hi>Spirits,</hi> a marriage in <hi>one
spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> No union with any <hi>form</hi> makes this Marriage, or dissolvs
it. That which alone stands in enmity to these Heavenly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spousals is union
with a strange spirit. This <hi>strange</hi> spirit is the <hi>Great Whore
Babylon, Mother of fornications.</hi> One of her names is <hi>Mystery,</hi>
because she puts her self into all forms, from the lowest to the highest; from
the most outward to the most inward; from the darksomest among men, to the
lightsomest amongst Angels. This is the great work of a Saint, to
<hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>watch</hi> the Spirit of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as be 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38519:4"/> makes his <hi>removes</hi> out of one Appearance into
another; to <hi>watch</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as that
also shifts its forms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honorable,</hi> For this I have desired in my
<hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in my <hi>Prayers,</hi> to work with GOD, even for the
opening of the eyes of men to see, that the same <hi>spirit</hi> which lay in
the polluted Bed of <hi>Papacy,</hi> may meet them in the perfumed Bed of
<hi>Presbytery;</hi> that the fornications and sorceries of this Whore are then
greatest, when they are most <hi>Mysterious,</hi> that she is able by her
sorceries to bewitch those that have attained to a great degree of spirituality
as the <hi>Galatians.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose have I in my Sermon represented the
same spirit which dwels in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> when it enters into the
<hi>Purer form of Presbytery,</hi> as fuller of <hi>mystery,</hi> so fuller of
<hi>despight,</hi> of <hi>danger,</hi> not to make the <hi>form</hi> or
<hi>persons,</hi> but that Principle, that spirit unfit to be cherished by any
<hi>Person</hi> in any <hi>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Wickeanesses are those, which are most <hi>Spirituall. Now,</hi> O Christians,
you <hi>fight not with Flesh and Blood, but Principalities and Powers,
spirituall wickednesses in Heavenly forms.</hi> But this is your comfort,
spirituall wickednesses ascend as high as the Heavens, even into Angelical
forms: but spiritual God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse goes up above all Heavens, together with
CHRIST into the bosome of the Eternall Spirit, from whence it looks down upon
the Angels, and all forms, as ministring to it. In vain is the snare laid
before those <hi>Doves,</hi> which have these spirituall <hi>eyes</hi> and
<hi>wings.</hi> In the number of which, that you may be ever found, is the
Prayer of</p>

great and wide Sea of <hi>that last</hi> loving kindnesse.</p>
            <p>I shall not spend that Time which I would be thrifty of, in any
larger opening, or further dividing of the Words, but fall presently upon that
<hi>Doctrine</hi> which I have designed from these words, for the Ground-work
to my present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>It is the way of GOD to make his</hi> last Mercies
<hi>to his people better than the</hi> first. 
<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> I shall give you <hi>one Argument</hi> from the
Scriptures to prove it; which Argument shall be a Demonstration of 
<note place="margin">Reason.</note> this Truth from the proper
<hi>Reason</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> is made up of <hi>three parts,</hi> which
all <hi>three</hi> laid together, make <hi>one</hi> full proof.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Part.</hi> The great <hi>Design</hi> of GOD from the
beginning, 
<note place="margin">1. Part.</note> hath been, and still is, to
bring forth JESUS CHRIST the <hi>second</hi> time into the midst of men, in
<hi>that Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Appearance,</hi> in which <hi>He</hi>
now sitteth at the Right Hand of the Father: Our Saviour signifieth to his
Disciples this grand Project of the Father. <hi>Ioh. 6. verse 62. What, and if
ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up, where he was before?</hi> The Weight of
the sense in this Scripture, lyes upon those <hi>two</hi> words, <hi>See,
Before.</hi> It is a frequent thing for that which is <hi>First</hi> in
<hi>Being, Dignity, Design,</hi> to be <hi>Last</hi> in <hi>Discovery.</hi> 
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:38519:5"/> That which GOD hath chiefly in <hi>Design</hi> all along,
is the <hi>Manifestation</hi> of CHRIST to men at <hi>last</hi> in that
<hi>Divine</hi> state, in which <hi>He</hi> was at the <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have the same thing held forth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 23. It was
said in the verse before, that <hi>All judgment</hi> was <hi>committed to the
Son.</hi> The reason of it is given in this verse; <hi>that all men should
Honour the Son, as they do the Father.</hi> Behold the <hi>Purpose,</hi> and
counsel of GODS Heart, why he doth All, that he doth; why he puts the great,
and last <hi>judgement</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Son;</hi> namely, that
the <hi>Son</hi> may appear to All Creatures in <hi>One, Spiritual, Eternal
Glory</hi> with the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Part.</hi> All the Works of GOD are in order to this
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Part.</note> this <hi>Discovery</hi> of
<hi>IESUS CHRIST, Coloss. 1. v.</hi> 16. All things are said to be Created
<hi>for Christ.</hi> In what sense is the <hi>whole Creation</hi> for
<hi>Christ?</hi> Is it to make any <hi>Real</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Blessednesse, or
Glory to the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> This cannot be. For the
<hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was compleat in Glory before any thing was
made, that was made. Nay, when our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> took flesh, and in our
Nature ascended, was glorified; yet then was there no <hi>new Glory</hi> put
upon <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For, as the <hi>humane nature</hi> was assumed into
the <hi>Personality,</hi> so was it into the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi>
of GOD. It was taken up to <hi>subsist</hi> in <hi>one person,</hi> and
<hi>shine</hi> in <hi>one glory</hi> with the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how then was the <hi>World</hi> made <hi>for Christ?</hi> Our
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> answer it by that Distinction of Glorifying GOD
<hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially,</hi> and <hi>manifestatively.</hi> We say, that all the
Creatures <hi>Glorifying</hi> of GOD is no more than a <hi>Manifestation</hi>
of the <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD. So GOD in the Creation, in the conduct, and
management of the affairs of the Creature, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End,
aimes at <hi>this mark</hi> to <hi>manifest Iesus Christ</hi> at the
<hi>end</hi> of time, in <hi>that glorious Appearance</hi> with which
<hi>He</hi> was cloathed <hi>before</hi> all times.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Part.</hi> This <hi>designe</hi> of GOD is his <hi>last
end,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of 
<note place="margin">3. Part.</note> all his works. When GOD shall
have brought forth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38519:6"/> Judgement, this Spiritual Discovery of JESUS CHRIST to
perfection, to a full victory over all fleshly Appearances; then will he cease
from all his works, and enter into this <hi>Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as his
<hi>Rest.</hi> When man begins his work, his End lyes lowest, and least
appears: but as he goes on, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Finishing of his work, his
End riseth up, and makes more clear Discoveries of it self. So it is with GOD,
at the beginning of his works, this <hi>Designe,</hi> the <hi>Discovery of
CHRIST,</hi> is Little, lyes low, and hid But, as GOD goes on to work, and
drawes to a consummation of all things; this <hi>Discovery</hi> which was at
<hi>first</hi> as a grain of Mustard-seed, hidden in the Earth, grows up, and
spreads its self. This <hi>Manifestation</hi> of CHRIST was at the first
Creation, as a small spring onely, but a living one. From the Fall, to the
Giving of the Law, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s Spring
drives along upon the face of the Earth, thorow all manner of mixtures, a very
weak store and strength of Waters. From thence it begins to make a channell to
it self, and to run along in a fair stream. At the Incarnation, and Ascension
of JESUS CHRIST this Stream enlarged it self into a Broad River. But our LORD
shall come the <hi>Second time,</hi> then shall this River become a great, and
wide Sea, covering the face of the whole Earth. Then shall the <hi>end</hi> be,
when the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fleshly discoveries</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
shall empty themselves into his <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>Spirituall
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if you please to lay together these <hi>three parts</hi> of
the <hi>Reason,</hi> you will have from them all in consort, a full Harmony
with, and a clear Demonstration of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If</hi> this be the <hi>Designe</hi> of GOD, to <hi>discover
Christ</hi> in the <hi>Spirit; if</hi> all GODS works, and mercies toward the
Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be <hi>in order</hi> to this <hi>Discovery;</hi> if this be the
<hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>last</hi> of all GODS Wayes; then it follows
naturally from hence, that as <hi>this discovery</hi> growes, so likewise must
all GODS <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> to his people grow in the same
Proportion; the <hi>later discoveries</hi> Brighter, the <hi>later works</hi>
Better, and Greater than the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>two Uses,</hi> which I intend; and those are <hi>two
Exhortations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:38519:6"/> 1. <hi>Use.</hi> An <hi>Exhortation</hi> to us
to be like GOD, to answer 
<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> his <hi>Blessings</hi> with our
<hi>praises,</hi> in the same way and Method. As the pleasant Colours of the
morning have a glorious Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in the clearer light of the Day: so is it the
way of God to make former Mercies, which are in themselves very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet
to be but as <hi>thinner eares,</hi> as <hi>leaner kine</hi> to ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mercies, and to be devoured of them, as the <hi>fuller,</hi> the
<hi>fatter;</hi> contrary to that which was in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dream.
Accordingly my <hi>Text</hi> commands us to make it our way in our
<hi>Praises,</hi> to wrap up, and overwhel me the memory of <hi>precedent</hi>
favours, with the more joyfull mention of <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> ones; as in the
Tabernacle, boards of Wood were hid under, and over-laid with Silver, or Gold.
As the <hi>Moon</hi> ascendeth towards the midst of heaven, so doth the
<hi>Sea</hi> rise, and swell; thus should our <hi>praises</hi> rise, as the
<hi>Mercies</hi> of the LORD rise, to overflow their former Channels, and
Banks.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Duty</hi> which is enjoyned in my <hi>Text. It
shall no more be said, the Lord liveth, that brought up Israel out of the land
of Egypt, but the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the
land of the NORTH.</hi> This is the <hi>Duty,</hi> which is grounded on my
<hi>Doctrine; It is the way of the Lord to make his last Mercies better then
his first.</hi> If the LORD make <hi>former</hi> mercies in comparison with
<hi>later</hi> ones, but as the <hi>Foot-stool</hi> to the <hi>Throne,</hi> but
as the <hi>tuning</hi> of the Instrument to some more excellent Melody: then is
it also fit, that our <hi>praises</hi> for <hi>former</hi> mercies, in
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with our Praises for <hi>later</hi> mercies, should be onely as the
lifting up of our Feet on the <hi>Footstool,</hi> in order to our sitting down
upon the <hi>Throne;</hi> or as the <hi>tuning</hi> of our voyces, to
<hi>sing</hi> some Pleasant Song of our <hi>Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable!</hi> God hath given us the <hi>Former</hi>
and the <hi>Later</hi> Rain of his Loving-k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>dnesses. With the <hi>Former</hi> Rain He preserved us, and
cherished us, when we lay, as seed in the Dust of the Earth. Such a
<hi>former</hi> Rain was our deliverance from the <hi>Papacy,</hi> by many
signal providences and preservations, amongst which is this most eminent one of
our Preservation from the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason,</hi> which <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38519:7"/> we celebrate on this Day. But the LORD hath given us the
<hi>Later</hi> Rain also; by which he hath made us to spring up out of the Dust
into a Pleasant Garden; He hath made us as a Garden enclosed with the
<hi>Quick-set</hi> hedge of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisedom, and Power, that no Wilde-Boar
hath been able to break in upon us; He hath watered us with his own
<hi>Foot,</hi> walking up and down in the midst of us, that our Beds and Plants
are <hi>green.</hi> Let us now say with a <hi>loud</hi> voice of Thanksgivings,
<hi>The Lord liveth, who hath brought us up from the Romish-Papaoy,</hi> which
is <hi>Spiritually Egypt, by a mighty Deliverance, and manifold preservations,
as this Glorious one of the immediate prevention of a dreadfull Blow by
Gun-Powder.</hi> But then let us say again with a <hi>louder</hi> Noise of
praises, that may drown the former voice: <hi>The Lord liveth, who hath brought
us up out of the Scotch Tyranny, and Scotch Presbytery, which came like a
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest from the NORTH.</hi> As the husband and children of the Wise Matron
say to her; <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. verse 29. <hi>Many daughters have done
vertuously, but thou excellest them all:</hi> so may <hi>England</hi> say now
to the LORD; <hi>In many mercies, as especially that of saving us from this
bloudy Designe of the Egyptian Papacy, Thou hast done Graciously, and
Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully: but this last mercy, by which thou hast saved us from the Black

all.</hi>

               <hi>Cautions. Right Honourable,</hi> and you <hi>Beloved,</hi> who

<note place="margin">Cautions.</note> hear me this Day, I intreat you
all to take notice of the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which I here interpose, before I
enter upon this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,</hi> that I may separate the <hi>vile</hi>
among <hi>Principles,</hi> from the <hi>precious</hi> or innocent among
<hi>principles,</hi> or <hi>persons.</hi> I profess not at all to speak against
the <hi>forme of Presbytery,</hi> if considered in its <hi>simplicity,</hi> in
its <hi>virginity;</hi> as it is meerly a <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> in
which <hi>Saints</hi> have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>each
with other,</hi> according to their <hi>present light;</hi> as it kisseth the
golden Scepter of the <hi>Spirit, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>subordinating</hi>
it self unto the rule of <hi>that Spirit,</hi> being desirous of no more, no
other <hi>power, authority,</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,</hi> than what <hi>that
Spirit</hi> shall <hi>put upon</hi> it, by <hi>putting forth</hi> it self in
it. Much lesse would I grieve, or cast contempt upon any <hi>little one</hi>
among my <hi>Fathers Children,</hi> any honest, sanctified heart, that walks in
that <hi>form of Presbytery,</hi> with humility and integrity, believing that
so it ought to worship GOD. But <hi>that Presbytery,</hi> which I compare with
the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> is <hi>such,</hi> as appropriateth to the <hi>Outward
Form,</hi> those things which pertain only to the <hi>Power of the Spirit:
such</hi> as by vertue of an <hi>Outward, Church-form,</hi> assumes a
<hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>Civil power</hi> to it self; <hi>such</hi> as out
of the <hi>Golden cup</hi> of a glorious Profession, makes it self drunk with
the wine of <hi>Fornications,</hi> with <hi>Earthly powers</hi> and
<hi>interests; such</hi> as takes to it self the Iron Mace of <hi>fleshly</hi>
force and fury, to break in pieces at pleasure <hi>Common-wealths, Crownes,
Consciences, Estates,</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of men. <hi>Right Honorable,
this</hi> is <hi>that Presbytery,</hi> on which <hi>those Enemies,</hi> whom
the LORD hath last of all subdued before you, had founded, and built up that
<hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> by which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38519:8"/> the Glorious out-goings of GOD before you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Agreement, Both</hi> joyn in setting up the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Word of God outwardly exprest,</hi> as the
<hi>Letter</hi> of that Law, by which all things of Christianity and Religion
are to be judged. So <hi>Scotus</hi> himself teacheth in his Preface to his
Disputes upon the Sentences, that <hi>Religion</hi> must be grounded upon a
<hi>Revelation.</hi> In this, not onely the <hi>Romish-Papist,</hi> and
<hi>Scotch-Presbyter,</hi> but all who pretend with any face to any thing of
<hi>GOD,</hi> or <hi>CHRIST,</hi> do concur. But there are <hi>two</hi> things
in a <hi>Revelation.</hi> There is <hi>Lex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velata:</hi> and <hi>Lumen
Revelationis,</hi> that is, the <hi>Law Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> and the <hi>Light of
Revelation. One</hi> is the <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Master:</hi> but the
<hi>other</hi> is the <hi>Forme,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of a <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now these <hi>Two Parties</hi> meet in this, to
magnifie the <hi>first</hi> of these, the <hi>Law Revealed.</hi> This they make
the foundation of their Throne, the Scepter of their Government, which as taken
singly by it self, is but a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Carkass, or a Dead Letter. Herein a

for the Determining of those <hi>two</hi> Grand <hi>Questions;</hi> First,
<hi>what is Scripture;</hi> Secondly, <hi>what the sense of that Scripture
is.</hi> The <hi>Romanists</hi> say, that <hi>this Iudge</hi> is the
<hi>Pope,</hi> or an <hi>Oecumenicall Councell.</hi> The <hi>Scotch
Presbyter</hi> is for a <hi>Nationall Assembly,</hi> or rather an
<hi>Oecumenicall Assembly,</hi> if the <hi>Civil</hi> Government would 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38519:8"/> bear it. <hi>This Presbyter</hi> condemns the
<hi>Papist</hi> justly, because he suffereth not the people to read the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> in their <hi>own Tongue.</hi> But who art thon, O man, who
condemnest another, and dost thy self the same thing, while thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddest
private persons to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with their <hi>own Eyes?</hi>
Thou confinest them to <hi>Spectacles</hi> of the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies</hi> making,
while thou permittest the <hi>Reading,</hi> but prohibitest the
<hi>Interpreting</hi> of the <hi>Spriptures</hi> according to that sense, which
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> brings forth to every man in his own spirit, if it be
not stumpt for Currant by the Spirit of the <hi>Generall Assembly.</hi> Why
dost thou judge the <hi>Papist</hi> for exalting <hi>un-written Traditions</hi>
to an Equall Authority with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> when thy way maketh the
<hi>Scripture</hi> it self, in the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of it,
a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Elders?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Agreement. Both</hi> these <hi>Sects</hi> have a very great

shall come, and take away both our place, and Nation:</hi> So say these
<hi>two,</hi> the <hi>Romish,</hi> and <hi>Scotch Principles</hi> in the hearts
of men: <hi>If we yeeld to this, to let the Spirit alone, and to suffer all men
to believe on the Holy Ghost, as the onely witness and evidence of Divine
Truth: if we give way to this, as sound doctrine, that it is the proper office
of the Third Person, the Spirit, and of him alone, to Apply Truth
Authoritatively, as it is of the second Person to Act, of the first Person to
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: that it belongs to this Spirit alone, authoritatively to testifie in
the spirits of Men, what those words are which himself hath taught, what the
meaning of the Spirit is in those words: if this be once granted, that nothing
is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as Divine Truth, but that which brings an Epistle of
Commendations along with it, written by this finger of the Living GOD upon the
Heart, then farewell all Religion; all manner of Sects, Heresies, Heathenisme
will break in upon us, and take away the very face of a Church from amongst

which are his <hi>Saints,</hi> is numbred among <hi>Whimsies, Fancies, Fanatick

things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as <hi>Innovation;</hi> although S.
<hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us still, to be <hi>transformed in the Renewing of our
Mindes, that we may prove what the good and acceptable will of GOD is;</hi> and
this to Saints already <hi>converted,</hi> as a <hi>continual</hi> duty, in
which they are ever to be exercising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they may have <hi>new

<hi>new mindes</hi> again tomorrow, in comparison with their mindes to
<hi>day;</hi> yet the <hi>same Iesus, yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> As
in some places of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> you have Wyers set up quite crosse
the River, and basket nets laid in those Wyers, to catch those
<hi>Lampries</hi> that come swimming up against the stream: so both in
<hi>Papacie,</hi> and in <hi>Rigid Presbyterie,</hi> all Constitutions,
Methods, frames of Doctrine, and Discipline, seem to be as <hi>wyers</hi> with
nets in them, set crosse the whole stream of <hi>civil</hi> and
<hi>Religious</hi> conversation, to catch every <hi>discovery</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> every <hi>manifestation</hi> of the Gospel, which comes up
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>present Tide,</hi> the general Current of <hi>Principles</hi>
and <hi>Positions.</hi> They labour, as to hedge in the Wind, to binde up the
sweet influences of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they will not suffer it to blow
<hi>where</hi> it lists, because they know not <hi>whence</hi> it comes, or

            <p>5. <hi>Agreement,</hi> in Annexing the <hi>Spirit</hi> to

               <note place="margin">5. Agreem.</note> Like <hi>Simon Magus,
Both</hi> seem to believe, that the <pb n="19" facs="tcp:38519:9"/> Gifts, and Ministery of

Moral honestie, formal Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ceremonious Observations</hi> of
outward Rites. So is their way laid, so are all their practices managed, as if
by a kind of <hi>Simoniacal Magick,</hi> that power which alone can aw or
secure us from the divel, were shut up within the <hi>circle</hi> of their
<hi>custemary,</hi> and <hi>solemn Forms.</hi> VVhen the LORD saith,

<note place="margin">6. Agreem.</note> and Power. JESUS CHRIST saith,
<hi>My Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> But say <hi>these two Factions, Our
Kingdom is over this world.</hi> We rule in Earthly things, by an Earthly
<hi>strength,</hi> though not from an Earthly <hi>Title.</hi> The
<hi>Heavenly</hi> power of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Scepter</hi> in our
Hand: but the <hi>fleshly</hi> power of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> is the
<hi>sword</hi> in the Hand of our Minister, and Guard, which is to be
subordinate to our Scepter. By this means they bring all manner of
<hi>civil</hi> affairs within the compass of their <hi>Cognisance,</hi> by
vertue of their <hi>spiritual ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories:</hi> they dispose of
<hi>Governments, Nations, Crowns,</hi> by vertue of their <hi>Ecclesiastick
censures.</hi> As the <hi>Pope</hi> baited <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> with his
<hi>Bul,</hi> and gave away the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> so did the <hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> now judge,
condemn the <hi>Present Government</hi> set over us by the glorious might of
Divine Power, and give away this Nation to their <hi>Scots King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Agreements</hi> of these <hi>two;</hi> I
come now to compare them in their <hi>Differences;</hi> and that onely those,
in which the <hi>later</hi> Enemy appears worse than the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> that
so the <hi>former Mercy</hi> may be made the <hi>sweeter</hi> to us, in being
exceeded and swallowed up by this <hi>later</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as a stream
running into a greater river.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38519:10"/> The <hi>Differences</hi> between these
<hi>two</hi> Enemies are <hi>four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Difference.</hi> Our <hi>first enemies</hi> pleased not
<hi>GOD,</hi> but 
<note place="margin">1. Differ.</note> yet were agreeable to
<hi>men</hi> in their wayes. Being false to a <hi>divine,</hi> and
<hi>spiritual interest,</hi> they are true to principles of <hi>humane
policy.</hi> Being severe in the imposall of <hi>superstitious rites,</hi> and
those <hi>principles</hi> which descend immediatly into the <hi>practice</hi>
of such <hi>rites;</hi> they take, and give a large scope to the
<hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> in <hi>generous
contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> in <hi>mystical divinity.</hi> Wanting that <hi>bread of
heaven,</hi> that <hi>new wine</hi> of the Kingdom, the <hi>beauties</hi> and
<hi>sweetnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of GOD in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which should feast the
<hi>inward</hi> man; they entertain the <hi>fancy,</hi> and <hi>senses,</hi>
with all objects sutable to them, with a pretence of a subserviency to
<hi>devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as in the <hi>Temple</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>On the other side, our <hi>last enemies</hi> please not
<hi>God,</hi> and are contrary to all <hi>men.</hi> These <hi>contemne</hi> the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and its <hi>Impressions</hi> upon the heart, when they are set
up for <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of fire</hi> to go before us in this dark night of flesh,
as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasmes.</hi> At the same time they <hi>condemne humane
poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as <hi>profane.</hi> They check the delights of <hi>sense</hi>
and <hi>fancy,</hi> as <hi>vain;</hi> rejecting also the <hi>openings</hi> of
the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>mutuall enterviews, walkes,
embraces, kisses</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Whimsicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is necessary for me here to professe, that I have no meaning to
justifie the <hi>sensualities</hi> of the <hi>Papacy</hi> in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
while by pretending these things as <hi>Spirituall inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Spirituall
warmings;</hi> they intend them for a <hi>vail</hi> upon the Spirit. There is
no such way to <hi>draw</hi> us up to the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as
by <hi>his Crosse,</hi> to which the <hi>pleasing,</hi> and <hi>heightning</hi>
of the <hi>flesh,</hi> for the most part, carries a very great <hi>enmity.</hi>
Therefore do I not desire to cast any dif-esteem upon a <hi>severity</hi>
towards the <hi>outward</hi> man, even to the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving</hi> of it, to the
<hi>beating</hi> of it <hi>black</hi> and <hi>blew,</hi> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi>
used it, so this be not to <hi>the puffing up of the fleshly mind.</hi> But my
<hi>Iustification,</hi> or <hi>Condemnation</hi> of these things is, as they
stand in the <hi>comparison</hi> between these <hi>two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> 
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:38519:10"/> and as they may stand upon the <hi>root</hi> of the same
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> in each party. Upon this account, as
<hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was by <hi>Witchcraft</hi> raised out of his grave, to appear
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Saul,</hi> with his mantle upon him: So <hi>both these,</hi> the
<hi>Romish Papacy,</hi> the <hi>Scotish-Presbytery,</hi> as it hath been
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly stated by me, appear like the <hi>Ghost</hi> of <hi>Iudaisme</hi>
raised from the dead by that <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor,</hi> the <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

forme of <hi>Christianity.</hi> But there is this <hi>difference;</hi> The
<hi>former</hi> is the <hi>Ghost</hi> of <hi>Iudaisme</hi> cloathed with the
<hi>Mantle</hi> which it wore in its life time, appearing in the same
<hi>outward pompe,</hi> with the same <hi>delicious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of
<hi>pictures, Musick, Perfumes,</hi> &amp;c. as of old. But the <hi>later</hi>
is <hi>Iudaism undrest,</hi> like an <hi>apparition in chaines,</hi> or
<hi>Lazarus</hi> when he came forth from the grave with the <hi>grave
cloathes</hi> bound about him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Difference.</hi> Our <hi>Southern enemies</hi> are
<hi>richer:</hi> our <hi>Northern ones poorer.</hi> Prov. 28. 3. <hi>A poor man

Let not this at all discourage any poor soul, which under a <hi>Legall
dispensation</hi> waites for <hi>Christ.</hi> It is spoken only of the
<hi>proud, poor ones;</hi> not of the <hi>poor ones oppressed</hi> under a
sense of <hi>divine wrath,</hi> but <hi>oppressing</hi> with the fury of a

            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Difference.</hi> The <hi>Scotch Presbyterie</hi> hath the
<hi>purest form,</hi> and in respect to the <hi>outward form,</hi> is a good,

<note place="margin">3. Differ.</note> great degree of
<hi>reformation</hi> from the <hi>Papacy,</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to
<hi>discipline</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi> as to the <hi>letter.</hi> Now who
knows not, that the corruption of the best things is the <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38519:11"/>
worst of all corruptions? <hi>Naturalists</hi> say, that the Marrow of a man,
in which his strength lies, the Brain of a man, in which his wisedome is
seated, by Putrefaction in death, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates oft times a <hi>Serpent.</hi> In
like manner, the exactest Image of that Heavenly Man <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> if
for want of the <hi>Quickning Spirit</hi> it corrupt, converts its highest
excellency, the strength and wisedome of the <hi>letter,</hi> to the enmity of
the <hi>serpent</hi> against that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Heavenly
man</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>The most implacable hatred is in the nearest competition. <hi>The
falling out of brethren is as walls and bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

stirres up the most frequent, and fiery persecutions against the <hi>son</hi>
of the <hi>Free-woman.</hi> It is the <hi>son</hi> of the <hi>Free-woman</hi>
alone, who darkneth the glory of his <hi>Brother Ishmael,</hi> who puts in
between him and the <hi>inheritance,</hi> who carries away the love of the
Father from him. If the <hi>spirituall seed</hi> were out of the way, the
<hi>Iew</hi> in the <hi>letter,</hi> the <hi>Legall Professour</hi> were the
only <hi>Saint;</hi> neither would there be any, that could step into Heaven
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. If therefore the <hi>spirituall</hi> seed be not sowne in the
heart of this <hi>Iew,</hi> he still cryes concerning him who is born after the
<hi>Spirit; Let us stay him.</hi> When the <hi>single divel</hi> had left the

<hi>seven divels</hi> more. The <hi>Scotch Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is a house, which

Prayer is, that being un-inhabited by the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> there be not

those, as they

had framed those <hi>Laws,</hi> which had shed the blood of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints by
Martyrdome, which had laid so many bonds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But this
<hi>Zeal-Plot,</hi> laid more deeply, more dangerously than the
<hi>Powder-plot,</hi> even in the <hi>hearts</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi>
which dwelt in the midst of us; this aim'd at the Ruine of <hi>Governours,
Government, People,</hi> and all, by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made up of <hi>Highlanders,</hi>
who never knew <hi>Christianity</hi> or <hi>Civility;</hi> whose rage would
have blown up, have torn in pieces all before it with a greater fury, than that
of <hi>Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> All this was intended upon <hi>this Government,</hi>
as it came forth <hi>new washt</hi> in the <hi>blood</hi> of many precious
Persons, who sought it with the losse of their <hi>lives;</hi> as it was busie
in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the lives of those <hi>lawes,</hi> which had shed the blood of
the Saints, and in taking off all <hi>bonds</hi> from the Gospel, that it might
runne freely, and be glorifyed. That former <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was against an
<hi>old power,</hi> founded upon <hi>old principles,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which (as

was the voice of <hi>Angels,</hi> (as is supposed) saying, <hi>Let us be gone

himself</hi> was heard, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let us be gone.</hi> But this <hi>later
Conspiracy,</hi> was against a <hi>new power,</hi> built upon <hi>new
principles,</hi> concerning which (if I do not deceive my self, and I
comfortably hope, that I do not deceive my self) I have heard in my spirit the
voice of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Spouse,</hi> with the
<hi>Angels</hi> attending, speaking after this maner one to another: <hi>Let us
make our abode here. Let us go forth into these fields, to see how the

               <hi>puts forth its green figs, and the vine her tender

            </p>
            <p>Thus, Right Honourable! you have seen your two <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
compared. You see how much the later exceeds the former in <hi>enmity,
opportunity, design.</hi> I shall now compare the <hi>manner</hi> of your
<hi>deliverances</hi> in <hi>two</hi> things, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this
<hi>Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>powder plot,</hi> all was ready, brought
within a very few houres of execution, the train laid, the Match lighted: yet
all vanished without giving any blow, or making any noise. <pb n="24" facs="tcp:38519:12"/>
In the <hi>Scotch plot,</hi> long and mighty preparations were made, a great
Army formed, every thing brought to maturity, and ripe for action; the design
it self put furre into motion, like a Granado shot up, and falling into the
very midst of us. Yet these Preparations Armies, Actions, scatter in a moment,
like a Mist. The way of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and of the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> in
both these attempts against us, hath been, through the Blessing of our God,
like the <hi>way of a serpent upon a stone,</hi> rising up out of his nest in
the Earth, sliding back into his first darknesse, and leaving no
<hi>track,</hi> or <hi>impression</hi> behind him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The LORD first delivered us from the <hi>Romish
Papacy</hi> by a <hi>Child, Edward the sixth.</hi> But this proved like the
Flower, a <hi>fading</hi> Mercy. When we were relapsed into Popery, we were
again raised out of it by the Hand of a <hi>Woman, Queen Elizabeth.</hi> We had
been of late retrived, and brought back under the Power of the same
<hi>Principles,</hi> cloathing themselves with the <hi>New Garment</hi> of
<hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> if that our God had not again delivered us by those of
the <hi>New Modell,</hi> who were in <hi>scorne,</hi> esteemed as
<hi>Children,</hi> in the Eye of flesh; who in <hi>simplicity</hi> behaved
themselves, 
<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 19.</note> as <hi>Children,</hi> to
<hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable!</hi> I humbly beseech you, whose <hi>Hearts,
Heads, Hands,</hi> as <hi>Saints, Counsellors, Souldiers,</hi> the LORD
<hi>Iesus</hi> hath made use of to bring great things to passe; do not (I
perswade my self, that you do not) think it your dispa ragement, but your Glory
rather, to be accounted, as <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> in these
Mighty Works: as <hi>children,</hi> who have been led all along in the Hand of
their Father, who have been altogether guided by His Eye; as <hi>Women,</hi>
who have had a <hi>Covering</hi> upon <hi>your Heads,</hi> a <hi>vaile</hi>

of GOD to

upon you. If this also prove not a <hi>fading</hi> mercy; as GOD hath
<hi>founded</hi> his Praise, and our Peace; so will he also <hi>perfect</hi> it
in the <hi>Mouths,</hi> by the <hi>Hands</hi> of <hi>Babes</hi>

Word.</p>
            <p>But to finish this <hi>Use. Right Honourable!</hi> Hath the LORD

these, which are at this present come down from Heaven upon us in so Glorious a
manner. If we have seen Great things, which we could not have believed,
<hi>now,</hi> that the LORD hath brought us up out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> what
Wonders, what Glory shall our eyes behold, when the Lord shall bring up his
People out of the <hi>NORTH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the more clear prosecution of this <hi>Use,</hi> and
explication of my intent in it, I must propound, and answer, <hi>Four 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38519:13"/> Questions.</hi> First, <hi>What is signified by
Egypt,</hi> as to the <hi>Iews.</hi> Secondly, <hi>What by the NORTH.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>what by Egypt to Christians.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>What by the
NORTH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Question.</hi> What is signified by <hi>Egypt</hi> to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Question</note> and what by their being
<hi>brought up</hi> out of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is plain in the <hi>Letter</hi> of the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> and 
<note place="margin">Answer.</note> needeth no answer, to those who
have read <hi>Moses,</hi> and his Book of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Question.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>NORTH,</hi> as to 
<note place="margin">2. Question</note> the children of
<hi>Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer. Babylon</hi> stood <hi>NORTH</hi> to the
<hi>Holyland,</hi> and 
<note place="margin">Answer.</note> the Return from the Captivity at
the end of the <hi>seventy</hi> years, was a <hi>Bringing</hi> up of the People
of GOD from the <hi>NORTH.</hi> But that cannot be the Meaning here, for
<hi>Three Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Reas.</hi> The Return from <hi>Babylon</hi> was not with
such an 
<note place="margin">1. Reason</note> out-stretched Arm, with such a
Glory of Miracles, of the Divine Presence, it was not to such a <hi>Rest,</hi>
as the comming up out of <hi>Egypt</hi> had been.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reas.</hi> The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not all
brought 
<note place="margin">2. Reason</note> back from the <hi>NORTH</hi> at
that time; only <hi>Two Tribes,</hi> and these but in part.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Reason,</hi> My <hi>Text</hi> joyns with the bringing up of
<hi>Israel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. Reason</note> from the <hi>NORTH,</hi> the
<hi>bringing</hi> of them from <hi>all places</hi> into which they have been
scattered, which was never yet done. These <hi>two universalities</hi> of the
Promise, <hi>for all Israel,</hi> and <hi>from all places,</hi> remain
unaccomplished to this day.</p>
            <p>When GOD brought up <hi>Israel</hi> his son out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
He planted him, as a vineyard, with a <hi>Legall Dispensation,</hi> with
<hi>fleshly Ordinances,</hi> a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> a <hi>Temple,</hi> a
<hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> a <hi>Presence,</hi> a <hi>Glory,</hi> appertaining to
these. But <hi>Ieshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run</hi> waxed fat with these <hi>fleshly VVorships.</hi>
He kick'd the Heel against his <hi>Master</hi> that fed him, his
<hi>Father</hi> that brought him up. He set up the <hi>Temple</hi> above the
<hi>LORD</hi> of the Temple: he holds up the <hi>Ordinances</hi> against him,
when he <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38519:13"/> came, who was <hi>Greater</hi> then the
<hi>Ordinances,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of them all. Then did God thunder
from Heaven against his <hi>Holy Things,</hi> and consume them with his
<hi>Lightnings,</hi> Then did he scatter <hi>Israel</hi> into a
<hi>Dispersion,</hi> a <hi>Desolation,</hi> where he wanders, abides shut up,
without <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi> even untill now.</p>
            <p>When the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> was taken away,
<hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the <hi>Letter</hi> immediatly succeed into their
place. They 
<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17, 18</note> sit down at a
<hi>Table</hi> of <hi>fleshly Ordinances.</hi> They also are in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared by
their <hi>Table.</hi> Their Hearts grow <hi>fat,</hi> their Eyes 
<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 9.</note> are closed up with
<hi>flesh.</hi> They see not to the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and
therefore cannot own the <hi>Lord, that Spirit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 13. &amp;c.</note> when <hi>He
comes</hi> to those who are under the <hi>Letter,</hi> as to his own,
<hi>Christians</hi> succeeding the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in
<hi>Idolizings</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> in <hi>rejection</hi> of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of the <hi>letter,</hi> for, the
<hi>leter</hi>'s sake, <hi>succeed</hi> them also in their <hi>desolations,
dispersions;</hi> and shall at last <hi>accompany</hi> them in their
<hi>return</hi> to their everlasting <hi>rest.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 12.</note>

            <p>These are the <hi>Particular Notes</hi> upon this
<hi>chapter,</hi> which I have collected out of it unto this End, to found upon
these <hi>Notes, three Observations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Observation.</hi> When the Lord brings his People out of 
<note place="margin">1 Observat.</note> the <hi>NORTH,</hi> he comes
in a <hi>tempest</hi> of a <hi>whirle-wind,</hi> a <hi>Great cloud,</hi> and of
<hi>fire. He</hi> comes to bring Desolation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Holy city,</hi> the
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> which now is. <hi>He</hi> comes, 
<note place="margin">Ezek. 43. 3.</note> as a <hi>whirl-wind,</hi> to
shake dreadfully the whole Earth. <hi>He</hi> comes, in a <hi>cloud</hi> to
bring Darknesse, Trouble, Confusion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirits of all Mankinde.
<hi>He</hi> comes as a <hi>fire,</hi> to burne upon all <hi>flesh,</hi> till he
have quite consumed it. When <hi>He</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, to raise His Spouse from
under the Power of his <hi>Death,</hi> which is the scattering of his People
among the Nations, and <pb n="33" facs="tcp:38519:16"/> under the rage of
<hi>Anti-christ,</hi> who sits in the sides of the <hi>NORTH,</hi> driving his
people into the wildernesse of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 14. 13.</note> then will our Lord
<hi>Iesus</hi> after this manner take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of all the Nations among which
they have been scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and bewildred.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Observation. Iesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> is the
<hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> comes riding in the midst of this
<hi>whirle-wind, cloud,</hi> and <hi>fire.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Observat.</note> He taketh up his Saints also,
whose Hearts are upright with the Father, as his heart is, into <hi>His
Chariot.</hi> They also, though in their <hi>flesh</hi> they melt away with the
servent heat of this <hi>fire;</hi> yet in their <hi>Spirituall Man</hi> they
come riding on upon the <hi>Third Heavens</hi> together with their King.
<hi>The Lord my God thus comes, and all the Saints with thee.</hi> While 
<note place="margin">Zach. 14. 5.</note> a <hi>cloud</hi> of
darknesse covers the whole World, <hi>you,</hi> O ye Brethren of the Great
King, sit in the <hi>secret</hi> of this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, upon a Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e in the midst of this <hi>cloud</hi>
upon a Bed of Love, in fellowship with your beloved <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
While the <hi>Tempest</hi> tears up this Creation from the very Roots of it;
you sit <hi>within</hi> it, as <hi>above</hi> it, as <hi>ruling</hi> it, as
<hi>flying</hi> upon the Wings of it: you see a new Heaven, and a New earth in
the midst of it, as in a <hi>womb,</hi> from which <hi>they</hi> together with
your selves are ready to spring forth. Fear not <hi>you,</hi> O ye meek ones,
when the <hi>storm</hi> rageth most violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are the <hi>Swift
motions</hi> of your <hi>Chariot-wheels,</hi> which now make haste, that raise
this <hi>Storm.</hi> Fear not <hi>you,</hi> when the starry Roofe of the
Kingdome of this World, shall drop like melted Lead upon the Heads of the
Inhabitants of it; when the Foundations of it, laid in the Dark parts of the
Earth, shall be devoured by fire. While all this is working, you have the
<hi>firmamen</hi> of the <hi>third heavens,</hi> the True <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat</hi>
for a <hi>Pavement</hi> under your feet.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Observation.</hi> When <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> shall have
suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently 
<note place="margin">3 Observat.</note> avenged himself of his
Enemies, then shall the <hi>Whirl-wind, cloud, and fire,</hi> altogether vanish
in a moment, as by a Divine Appointment. The <hi>old heavens,</hi> and the
<hi>old earth</hi> shall vanish in the midst of this storme. Then shall the
<hi>Lord</hi> appear on <hi>his Chariot,</hi> and fill <hi>All.</hi> The bright
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38519:17"/> 
               <hi>Wheels,</hi> with their <hi>high</hi> and
<hi>dreadfull Rings</hi> full of <hi>eyes,</hi> shall shine out, as the <hi>New
Earth</hi> of this <hi>visible frame,</hi> made all of <hi>One Precious
stone,</hi> The <hi>Living Creatures,</hi> which draw those <hi>wheeles;</hi>
shall sparkle forth, as the <hi>New Heavens</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and
<hi>Holy Angels,</hi> who are <hi>burnish'd Brasse</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their
<hi>Naturall, Angelicall Glory;</hi> but <hi>flaming</hi>

               <hi>Lampes,</hi>
fill'd with the <hi>Oyle</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in
respect to their <hi>New</hi> State in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
But above the <hi>Heads</hi> of these, in <hi>that Day,</hi> shall discover
themselves the <hi>Third heavens,</hi> which are <hi>that firmament,</hi> that
<hi>expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Divine Glory.</hi> These <hi>Heavens</hi> shall be seen
onely, as a <hi>floore</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> for the <hi>Throne,</hi> the
<hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>city of the Great King.</hi> Then shall the
<hi>Heavenly man,</hi> and the <hi>Glorious Trinity</hi> standing each in
other, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi> appear as the <hi>Temple</hi> in this
<hi>heavenly Ierusalem.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 22.</note> In the midst of this
<hi>Temple</hi> are seen all thy <hi>Saints,</hi> O GOD. Here they have their
<hi>Mansions,</hi> as the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Levits</hi> had their
<hi>Chambers</hi> round about in the <hi>Temple</hi> of old. Here they live
continually with GOD, as <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> never to go
forth more. From hence they extend the <hi>Line</hi> of their <hi>Divine
Priesthood</hi> the <hi>Scepter</hi> of their <hi>Everlasting kingdom,</hi> all
over the <hi>New heavens,</hi> and the <hi>New Earth.</hi> From hence they
<hi>sow</hi> themselves over all things, as a <hi>seed;</hi> they <hi>grow</hi>
up out of all things, as the <hi>fruit,</hi> of <hi>joy, glory,</hi> and
<hi>immortality,</hi> O! who is there now among all the Saints, that can
forbear to cry; <hi>Blow ye Whirl winds, fly ye clouds, thou fire make haste,
and bring my Beloved: come thou, come quickly Lord Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As surely as the Lord liveth, and hath of old brought up the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> so surely will our Lord
<hi>Iesus</hi> thus come, and bring <hi>his Saints</hi> with Him, out of the
<hi>NORTH.</hi> But why do I say, that <hi>he</hi> shall come <hi>thus?
Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> saith in the <hi>last verse</hi> of his <hi>first chapter,</hi>
that all this is but the <hi>Likenesse of the Appearance of the Glory of
God.</hi> As much as <hi>Earthly similitudes</hi> fall short of <hi>heavenly
things;</hi> as much as <hi>fleshly shadowes</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> fall short
of <hi>Spirituall Substances, and Truths:</hi> so much doth all the
<hi>Glory,</hi> that <pb n="35" facs="tcp:38519:17"/> can be now <hi>exprest,</hi> or
<hi>thought,</hi> fall short of the Glory of the <hi>Appearance of our heavenly
Bride-groom.</hi> All <hi>former glories</hi> shall be remembred no more for
ever. A <hi>new,</hi> a <hi>New glory</hi> shall fill thine <hi>Eyes,</hi>
thine <hi>Eares,</hi> thy <hi>heart,</hi> O <hi>thou the Lambes Bride;</hi>
even such a <hi>Glory,</hi> as thine <hi>Eyes</hi> never saw any <hi>Image</hi>
of, thine <hi>Ears</hi> never heard any <hi>Tydings</hi> of, thine
<hi>Heart</hi> never took in any <hi>Degree</hi> of, untill <hi>that
Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable!</hi> I shall not conclude, untill I have
endeavoured to raise your joyes, and your Praises yet high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by setting before
you a <hi>Double interest,</hi> which (to say no more) you seem to have in
<hi>This comming</hi> of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> with <hi>his people</hi> out
of the <hi>NORTH. One</hi> is the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>this
Common-wealth.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>this
Age,</hi> and time of the World, in which <hi>you</hi> live.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Interest.</hi> Of <hi>this Common-wealth</hi> in the

take the 
<note place="margin">1. Interest.</note> Boldnesse here to Propound
to you <hi>severall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which may be, all put together, the
Ground of a Modest Hope to a Sober Christian, that the LORD JESUS intends that
Honour to <hi>this</hi> Nation, that it shall be said to it <hi>first</hi> of
all the Nations, concerning the <hi>heavenly Bride-groom,</hi> that, <hi>he was
born here; here he first of all appeared in an Eminent and signall Manner, to
bring his People up out of a fleshly servitude, and Death, into a Spirituall
Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Consider.</hi> This is one of the Remotest Parts of the

whether the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Rome, Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Anti-christ</hi> hath extended it self. It is Master
<hi>Brightmans</hi> observation in his <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> that, Among the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi>

<note place="margin">2. Consid.</note> Christians, who have travelled
over Books, Countreys, and <pb n="36" facs="tcp:38519:18"/> Spirits of men, that no where
upon the face of the Earth do there appear to be any Number of hearts
<hi>Spiritually</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, <hi>Spiritually</hi> conversing with our Lord
<hi>Iesus,</hi> in any Degree of Heavenly <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi>
save in this Poor, small spot of Ground. This looks, as if
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> were driven hither, as to the
Outmost Bound of the Habitable World, here to make a <hi>Stand,</hi> here to

            <p>Let me add to this, that the Power of our <hi>Dear Saviours

the most Learned among the <hi>Iews,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> as I remember:
that; <hi>A generall Tradition divides the Prophesies of the old Testament into
unfixed; fixed. The fixed are such, as be determined to some certain Place. In
the number of the fixed Prophesies is that of Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, chap. 24. and 13, 14,
15, 16. [When thus it shall be in the midst of the Land, among the People;
there shall be as the shaking of an Olive Tree, as the Gleaning of Grapes, when
the vintage is done. They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
Majesty of the Lord, they shall cry aloud from the SEA. Wherefore glorifie ye
the Lord in the fires; the Name of the Lord God of Israel in the ILES of the
Sea. From the UTTERMOST Parts of the Earth, have we heard Songs, Glory to the
Righteous.] The place,</hi> said he, on which this Prophesie is fixed by the
constant Reception of the Rabbins, is this Ile of Great Brittain.</p>
            <p>I cannot but lay to <hi>these verses</hi> before cited, another
<hi>verse</hi> out of the same <hi>chapter:</hi> verse 21. <hi>And it shall
come to passe in that day, that the Lord shall punish the Hoast of the High
Ones, on high: and the Kings of the Earth, on the earth.</hi> Of a truth, he
that peruseth this whole <hi>chapter,</hi> and compares it with the
<hi>first</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> will finde <hi>Both</hi> to speak of the

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>First Scripture</hi> is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. ver. 9,

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Party Iudging. Laodicea,</hi> the Name of the
<hi>seventh Church,</hi> made by Master <hi>Brightman</hi> a Type of
<hi>England,</hi> is compounded of two words; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which

signifies <hi>Iudgement.</hi> Both together represent the <hi>Iudgement of the
people of God;</hi> or the <hi>people of God in Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is this <hi>Laodicea</hi> interpreted by the <hi>Angels,</hi>
that poure the <hi>fifth viall</hi> upon the <hi>Seat</hi> of the
<hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>sixth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> upon the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi>
the Defence of the <hi>Great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> These <hi>Angels</hi> are
described, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. ver. 6. <hi>The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Angels came out of the
temple, having the seven plagues cloathed with white linnen, and having their
brests girded with golden girdles.</hi> As the <hi>seven Churches</hi> had
their <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Angels, Rev.</hi> 1. v. 1. so have <hi>severall
Dispensations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> whether they be at
<hi>once</hi> or in <hi>Different seasons. Angels</hi> are the
<hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Divine dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as they descend from
the <hi>Spiritual</hi> unto the <hi>natural</hi> man of a <hi>Saint.</hi> These
<hi>seven Angels</hi> powring forth these <hi>vials,</hi> do upon this account
denote <hi>seven dispensations,</hi> or <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of</hi> JESUS CHRIST
coming forth from the <hi>secret</hi> 
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:38519:20"/> of the
<hi>spirit</hi> into an <hi>outward manifestation,</hi> through the flesh of
the <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> These poure forth the <hi>vials</hi>
of Wrath upon the children of Wrath, by the pouring forth of Grace upon their
lips; as the LORD consumes the Man of sin by the <hi>brightnesse of his
coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you have this <hi>Laodicea,</hi> these <hi>Angels</hi> from
the <hi>Temple</hi> plainly discovered by <hi>Daniel, 7. 9. The Ancient of
Dayes did sit, whose garments was white</hi> as <hi>snow.</hi> Behold
<hi>One</hi> in the same <hi>Raiment</hi> with the <hi>Angels</hi> of the
<hi>Vials, ver. 22. Untill the Ancient of dayes came, and judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Saints of the most High, v 26. The judgment shall sit, and THEY shall
take away, &amp;c.</hi> Behold the <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>white!</hi> Behold
the <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Laodicea!</hi> The
<hi>Ancient</hi> of <hi>Dayes</hi> coming forth, appearing in <hi>his
Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> These are his <hi>judgment Seat,</hi> his <hi>Iudges.</hi> This
is the <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of the <hi>judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Party judged.</hi> The <hi>sixth vial</hi> falls
upon the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi> which encompasseth <hi>Babylon,
mystery,</hi> the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fornications. Waters</hi> hold forth a
<hi>Spirit,</hi> in which the <hi>flesh,</hi> or <hi>letter</hi> stands, lives,
and flourisheth, as the <hi>Earth</hi> in the <hi>Waters.</hi> A <hi>River</hi>
is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> either having the <hi>power,</hi> or putting on the
<hi>form</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi> Under the same
<hi>Vial</hi> is made mention of the <hi>false Prophet,</hi> out of whose
<hi>mouth,</hi> an <hi>unclean spirit,</hi> yet a <hi>spirit of miracles,</hi>
goes forth. See the <hi>River,</hi> which defends the <hi>spirituall
Egypt,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this false <hi>Prophet</hi> he, who would seem to be the
<hi>River of Iordan,</hi> making glad the City of <hi>Laodicea</hi> with his
pleasant stream; when he is as the <hi>dead Sea</hi> in the midst of her; who
saith, <hi>I am rich, and want nothing; and knowes not, that he is miserable,
poor, blind and naked?</hi> This is he, 
<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 14.</note> who falls in to uphold the
<hi>Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Beast,</hi> who sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all the Kings of the
Earth to battell in this common Quarrel against the Saints.</p>
            <p>Is not this that very <hi>little horne,</hi> of which
<hi>Daniel</hi> speaks, <hi>Dan. 7. vers. 8. There came up another little
horne: and behold in this horne eyes, like the eyes of a man,</hi> (a show of 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38519:20"/> divine Light, a plain character of the <hi>River
Euphrates,</hi> the <hi>false Prophet) and a mouth speaking great things,</hi>
that is, I <hi>am rich, and need nothing,</hi> This <hi>little horne,</hi> had
a <hi>look more stout then his fellows;</hi> vers. 20. <hi>He makes warre with
the Saints;</hi> vers. 21. <hi>He speaks great words against the most High</hi>
(GOD the Father, and our LORD JESUS, as he is in the most High, the most holy
place of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> above <hi>Flesh,</hi> above
<hi>Types) he wears out the Saints, untill this Iudgement</hi> sits, ver. 25.
This is the <hi>party judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Kingdom sinking</hi> is the <hi>Seat,</hi> or
<hi>Throne,</hi> as it is in Greek, of the <hi>Beast, filled with
Darknesse,</hi> Revel. 16. vers. 10. The <hi>drying up of Euphrates</hi> by the
Beams of a <hi>spirituall</hi> Glory; <hi>vers.</hi> 12. The <hi>Battel</hi> of
the <hi>great Day</hi> of <hi>God Almighty</hi> against <hi>all</hi> the Kings
of the Earth; <hi>v.</hi> 14. The <hi>spuing</hi> of the <hi>false Prophet</hi>
out of the mouth of <hi>Christ; Revel. 3. 16. The Thrones cast down,</hi> Dan.
7. <hi>vers. 9. The Beast slain for the great words, which the Horn spake,
vers. 11. The taking away of his Dominion, consuming, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying</hi> it unto
the <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Kingdom springing</hi> is the <hi>everlosting
dominion</hi> given to the <hi>Son of man</hi> by the <hi>Ancient of dayes,
Dan. 7. vers.</hi> 13, 14. This everlasting Kingdom is given also to the
<hi>Saints,</hi> who must reign together with their <hi>Saviour, vers.</hi>
27,</p>
            <p>Sweetly harmonious with this, is that pleasant melody in the eares
of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> At the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> our
glorified <hi>Iesus</hi> is held forth to be, the <hi>beginning</hi> (the Head,
the Principle) <hi>of the creation of God,</hi> the New, and Eternall Dominion:
<hi>Revel. 3. vers.</hi> 14. At the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> He
promiseth his <hi>Saints,</hi> that they shall sit with <hi>Him</hi> in <hi>His
Throne,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> sits down with <hi>his Father</hi> in <hi>his
Throne.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> gives the Kingdom to the
<hi>Son of man.</hi> The <hi>Son of man</hi> gives it to his <hi>Brethren.</hi>
All <hi>Three</hi> raign each in other, are <hi>Thrones,</hi> and
<hi>Kings,</hi> each to other.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Kings of the East,</hi> for whom way is 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38519:21"/> made by the drying up of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> Revel. 16.
<hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Kings</hi> from the <hi>East</hi> bring into my minde a
place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> seems to relate, as
pointing at the same <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Thing.</hi> It is <hi>chap. 43.
vers. 2, 3. And behold the glory of the God of</hi> Israel <hi>came from the
way of the East and his voice was as the voice of many waters</hi> (the Kings
of the East, which come with him) <hi>and the Earth shined with his glory. And
it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vision which I saw, when I came to destroy the City;
the vision that I saw by the River</hi> Chebar: vers. 4. <hi>The glory of the
Lord came into the house by the way of the gate, whose Prospect is to the East.
Ezekiel</hi> in his <hi>first chapter</hi> saw the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi>
come from the <hi>North</hi> with a dreadful <hi>tempest.</hi> He saw it come
to <hi>destroy the City.</hi> He saw it: remove from the old <hi>temple,</hi>
and <hi>City</hi> of <hi>fleshly</hi> Administrations. Here he sees <hi>it</hi>
come from the <hi>East,</hi> with a most blessed <hi>Serenity</hi> and
<hi>Sunshine,</hi> which cloathes the whole Earth: he sees it enter into the
<hi>New-built Temple,</hi> to take up <hi>Its</hi> rest there for ever.</p>
            <p>Remember, O <hi>Christians,</hi> to distinguish between these
<hi>two commings</hi> of the LORD <hi>Iesus</hi> at the end of dayes: 1. From
the <hi>North:</hi> 2. From the <hi>East.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. When your <hi>Saviour</hi> comes from the <hi>North,
he</hi> comes upon <hi>his chariot,</hi> He comes in the <hi>glory of the
Father,</hi> with all his holy <hi>Angels;</hi> Thus <hi>he</hi> comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your <hi>inward man.</hi> But <hi>he</hi> comes flying upon the wings of a

with a flame of <hi>fire</hi> issuing forth from <hi>him:</hi> Dan. 7. 9. 10.
He comes with <hi>rebukes</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenings;</hi> Rev. 3. 19. He comes
as a <hi>thief</hi> in the <hi>Night,</hi> covering <hi>himself</hi> with a
cloud, and thick <hi>darknesse;</hi> He comes as a <hi>VVarriour</hi> to the
battell of that <hi>great day:</hi> Revel. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> comming from the <hi>North</hi> is that <hi>houre of
temptation</hi> upon the <hi>Whole Earth,</hi> which is threatned in the time
of the <hi>Sixth Church; Rev.</hi> 3. 10. but fals out in the times of the

               <hi>This</hi> comming of your GOD from the <hi>NORTH,</hi> is as

<hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1656. How near is that year 1656 from <hi>Christ?</hi> Of
what <hi>Eclipses,</hi> what dreadfull <hi>signes</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi>
above, in <hi>earth</hi> below, do we hear to come to passe in the years
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding <hi>this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tremble, O ye Inhabitants of the <hi>Earth,</hi> a flood of
<hi>fire</hi> is coming upon all the World. The <hi>windows</hi> of
<hi>heaven</hi> are already open, and begin to rain down streams of
<hi>fire.</hi> The <hi>springs</hi> of the great <hi>deep</hi> are broken up,
and send forth their <hi>flames,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye meek Ones, enter into the <hi>Ark</hi> which your Saviour and
you have been long making ready in your spirits, against this day when the
<hi>flood</hi> should come. What is this <hi>Ark?</hi> Is it not the
<hi>chariot</hi> of the Lord? the <hi>appearance</hi> of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, of
your beloved <hi>Iesus</hi> in <hi>heavenly state,</hi> within you? Go in to
this <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> shall shut you in till the <hi>storme</hi>
be past. Go up to this <hi>chariot,</hi> sit quietly there by the side of your
<hi>Saviour,</hi> till that <hi>cloud</hi> break up, and show you in glory.</p>
            <p>But it is now time to conclude. Is it <hi>so?</hi> Is this then
the <hi>Age?</hi> Is this the <hi>Land,</hi> in which our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi>
ascends from the <hi>NORTH?</hi> Doth he <hi>now</hi> call up the
<hi>clouds,</hi> and <hi>winds,</hi> to minister to <hi>him?</hi> Doth <hi>he
now</hi> from <hi>hence</hi> begin, as a <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to come forth from
his Chamber, as a <hi>Giant,</hi> or <hi>Warriour</hi> refresht with wine, to
run his race, unto the ends of the Earth? Speak, ye <hi>Virgins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who
are not falne asleep; Is your Lord on <hi>his way?</hi> Is this the
<hi>noise?</hi> Are these the <hi>fires, flashes</hi> of his
<hi>chariot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You, who have eyes exercised on <hi>spirituall</hi> sights, who
watch for the <hi>Morning,</hi> tell us; Have you seen your <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved look
forth like the morning,</hi> a sweet light out of a 
<note place="margin">Cant. 6. 9.</note> black darknesse? <hi>Faire,
as the Moon,</hi> in his <hi>naturall <pb n="46" facs="tcp:38519:23"/> Image,</hi> the
<hi>first</hi> Creation? <hi>Pure, as the Sun,</hi> with the essentiall,
substantiall glory of <hi>his spiritual Image? Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as an Army with
Banners?</hi> The <hi>horses,</hi> and <hi>wheels</hi> of his chariot are his
<hi>Army, Angels, Stars, Elements n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>w made,</hi> fighting for him in the <hi>newnesse</hi> of their
courses. <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> in his flaming person above the <hi>heads</hi> of
these, is the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Banner</hi> lifted up.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>so.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> is upon his
<hi>white-horses</hi> of divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. He rides on prosperously with his
Sword girt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his thigh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right Honourable! Princes, Prophets, People,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
now your dyivg <hi>Saviours</hi> charge! Take heed of <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting</hi> on
the comforts, or cares of this Life. <hi>Watch,</hi> and be <hi>sober.</hi> As
<hi>Elijah</hi> girt himself, and run along with <hi>Ahabs</hi> chariot: So
gird up the loyns of your <hi>minde,</hi> run along with the <hi>chariot</hi>
of your <hi>King.</hi> If through <hi>sloth,</hi> or <hi>sleep,</hi> you be
cast behinde, if the <hi>Bride-groom</hi> enter into his chamber, and the door
be shut upon <hi>him;</hi> you will be left without in utter darknesse, where
is weeping, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and gnashing of teeth. But woe to those who resist
the progresse of <hi>his</hi> outgoings! The <hi>wheels</hi> of his
<hi>chariot</hi> shall be brought over these, the <hi>feet</hi> of <hi>his
horses</hi> shall tread them in pieces, and dogs devour that which is left of
them, as it was with <hi>Iesabel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you, which have heard the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> plainly say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you; <hi>When you were under the figtree of outward dispensations, and
expectations, I saw you:</hi> run to <hi>him,</hi> call <hi>him Master;</hi>
follow <hi>him</hi> still, you shall see <hi>greater</hi> things then these;
you shall see the <hi>heavens</hi> opened, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> descending and
ascending upon the <hi>heavenly person of Christ</hi> discovered, as a
<hi>ladder</hi> joyning <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> in which
<hi>ladder</hi> every <hi>Rowel</hi> is a <hi>spiritual,</hi> a <hi>living
glory.</hi>
