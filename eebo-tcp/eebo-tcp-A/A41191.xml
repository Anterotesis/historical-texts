            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO Sir <hi>CHARLES WOLSELEY,</hi> Baronet.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DEdications are so often abused to flattery, commenced upon so low motives, and so unsutably addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that unless they be rescued from these vulgar abuses, they will deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly grow into contempt. And indeed were it not that I am conscious to my self both of the congruousness of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, and that I am influenced by none of those inducements that commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to Inscriptions of this nature, and that there is nothing here of the wonted strain of Epistles Dedicatory, I should have superceded the Dedicating of this at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> you have been so happy in your choice of the Theams that you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Illustrate and Vindicate; and so matchless in the performance of what
<pb facs="tcp:57446:3"/>
you have undertaken, that whoever hath a Reverence for Religion, oweth you not only thanks, but Veneration. Whilst others combat <hi>Atheism</hi> with <hi>Drollery</hi> and <hi>Satyr,</hi> you have encountred it with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>; and whilst they only <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>jeer</hi> the <hi>Atheists,</hi> you have <hi>baffled</hi> and refuted them. By vindicating also the Scriptures to their Divine Author you have justified our belief of them: Whilst you degrade Reason from that Supreme <hi>Judicature</hi> that some would erect it into, you have rightly vested it in whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it as an Instrument of discerning and conduct. As he must either have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to betray Religion or Himself who oweth it to any thing less than a rational choice; So he must have very irreverent apprehensions of the Authority and Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God, who will embrace nothing but what himself can frame adequate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of. Whereas then the <hi>Socinian</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Papist</hi> and lazy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> on the other, rendered it necessary that both the Reasonablness of Scripture-Belief, and yet the mystery of Particular Doctrines should be equally asserted and secured: We ow a Homage to <hi>Sir Charles Wols<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ley</hi> for employing himself about so
<pb facs="tcp:57446:3"/>
Noble a Subject, and without incurring the censure both of injustice and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we cannot but acknowledge his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in it. And truly the testifying my own thankfulness was the main, though I cannot say the only incentive to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress.</p>
            <p>For having, Sir, assumed the liberty to arraign the Writings and some of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Person considerable at least for his confidence, self-esteem, &amp; the contempt which he treats all men with; that he may not think himself ill dealt withal to be fallen upon by so mean a Man, and so illiterate a Divine as my self, I am willing to do him that right as to refer the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage of the Debate between him and me, to a Person as far above either of us in Learning as in Quality. And if he should decline your Award, as I am confident he dare not stand the <hi>Verdict</hi> of so Competent and Impartial a Judge, I have the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of having committed the whole Cause into such hands, as wherein soever either as to Argument or Stile I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, knows how to substitute better in their Room. And I acknowledge this to have been one reason among others for the prefixing your Name to the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb facs="tcp:57446:4"/>
that by recommending the <hi>Subject</hi> to your care, I might thereby call forth a Person of so strong and clear a Judgment, so Masculine and Celebrated an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as well to rescue so excellent a <hi>Theam</hi> from so short a Reason and dull a Pen as mine, as to vindicate it from the declamatory assaults of such whose skil and strength lies next to their Railing in their Rhetorick and Picquancy.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, Sir, that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the concerning your name in this Dedication, namely to tell you, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you have promised <hi>an account of the admirable contrivement of saving Men by Jesus Christ,</hi> we can no longer excuse the delay of it. It would have been welcom and useful before, but it is now become neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. The Opinions brought to the Bar in the following Discourse, are modest and innocent in comparison of some others vented by the same Author, <hi>viz. That small sins God takes no notice of, and that great Sins Repentance expiates them.</hi> Religion as well as your own Promise challenge from you that you would help to check this growing boldness; Nor do I know a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein you may more advantagiously serve both Truth and your own Fame;
<pb facs="tcp:57446:4"/>
The Accession of Light derivable from so great Accomplishments to that, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly reflect a luster, upon your self. Sir, whilst most Books serve only to betray their Authors to an universal contempt, and to expose their pride and folly, which might have been concealed, had not themselves taken a course to divulge it; you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by your Writings not only further endeared your self to your Friends, and raised your estimate among such as have the honour and happiness to know you, but withall you have obliged strangers to pay you a Veneration, and won your self a number of secret Votaries and unknown admirers, among whom I presume to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon my self, and am,</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>HAving in the following Treatise menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the motives that induced me to this Undertaking, I shall not entertain thee here with what thou wilt meet with hereafter. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I may say, that as it was not to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Entreaties of a Bookseller, such mens Importunity weighing little with me, if the Advantage and Interest of others be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; so neither was it upon the solicitation of Friends, who perhaps had they known of it before it had proceeded too far, would have been loth to have trusted so great a Concern in so weak hands. No one is responsible for it but my self; whatever mistakes, failures, &amp;c. are in it, I am onely accountable for them. As for the main of the Discourse I leave it to stand or fall as it shall be found in the judgment of Christians and Scholars. I know I have not been able to wed the <hi>Graces</hi> to the <hi>Muses;</hi> it satisfies me if the Sword have a good Edge, though the Handle of it be not so well gilt. Nor do I despise any thing more than Rhetorick putting an <hi>Ostracism</hi> upon Logick; though otherwise I like the meat the
<pb facs="tcp:57446:5"/>
better for having a pleasant Sauce. I hope I may say that the whole is managed in a Spirit of Meekness and Terms of Modesty. I am none of those who affect to be offensive, or who endeavour to grow remarkable by being saucy. There is nothing more disgusts me in the Writings of others than to find them stuft with Satyr and Scurrility. Men do but disserve their own designs by writing huffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor will any one that is wise judge the worse of a Cause by finding it reviled and slandered. <hi>Clown, Yelper, Despicable-Scribler, Buffoon, Coloss of Brass, Mr. Insolence, Impudent Fop, Whelp, Monky, Crop, Smutty Lubber, Dastard Craven, Mushrome, Coward, Judas, Crocodile, Hunger-starv'd Whelp of a Country Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> (not to mention a thousand more <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets</hi> of this complexion, which occur in a late Book) do ill become the extraction and civility of a Gentleman, the Education of a Scholar, the Morality of a Philosopher, the Religion of a Christian, and the Profession of a Divine to give to any, especially to a Person who for his Birth, Breeding, Natural and acquired Accomplishments, Honourable Employes in his Country, and Untainted Conversation, Rivals at least the bestower of them. Men of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions are scandalized at this way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<pb facs="tcp:57446:6"/>
Nor will any credit accrue to the Cause and Party in whose favour we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Insolence, Malice and Calumny. I do not interest my self in the <hi>Transproser's</hi> Quarrel, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>prover</hi> due correction for his Folly and Impudence. But suppose that (abating the unhandsome terms, which I am confident when his head is cooler the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cannot but condemn) something might be pleaded for his keenness against <hi>A. M.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sacrifice to Revenge rather than Truth, for medling with his <hi>Comfortable Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> yet I cannot imagine upon what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he hopes to justifie his treating <hi>J. O.</hi> with so much Pride, Petulancy, Wrath, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, Revenge, Scurrility, Reviling and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as I think is not to be match'd again; especially being a Person not onely second to none for Learning and Modesty, but who for what appears had given him no offence, unless it were that by a sober Reply to his First Book he had furnished him with an occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying some things, wherein he was not onely mistaken, but had grosly prevaricated; and therefore instead of defaming and maligning his Monitor, he ought to have thank'd him: nor is there a greater injustice in the World, than to make that a Quarrel which is really
<pb facs="tcp:57446:6"/>
an Obligation. It is a new way of securing our selves from Opponents, to over-look the Cause, and spend our Indignation upon the Person of our Adversary, and to fetch our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the <hi>Dung-Cart</hi> and <hi>Oyster-Boats,</hi> instead of the <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when judged conducive to interest? or may we indulge our selves in detraction and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in hopes of promoting our design by it? For I cannot conceive but that the Author of this accusation fully understood him to be innocent whom he impeached, and if it would have served his end could better then I have laid the Saddle upon the right Horse. I know there needs none to vindicate that worthy Person but himself, or rather he needs not do it, carrying a justification in this matter in the hearts of all that know him, who understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves bound to defend the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Neighbor from Slander, will not be wanting, as opportunity serves, of acquitting themselves therein. In the mean time he may satisfie himself in having <hi>Plato</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, who being told of some who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed him, <hi>'Tis no matter,</hi> said he, <hi>I will live so that none shall believe them.</hi>

the Scots from their antipathy to Bishops are become the most Barbarous People of all Europe, so as that they will not have any Traffick with any other Countries for fear of corrupting their Language &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, though that is little better than</hi> wild Irish, <hi>&amp; they little better than</hi> Jack-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>And though they have some dark and general Notions of Christianity still remaining among them, yet are they since their Picque against Bishops, fallen into such Rudeness and Ignorance, that they have scarce any knowledge at all of the particular Articles of their Faith, and Precepts of their Religion.

Only I wonder how other Nations have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the same misfortune, or are all the Foreign Protestant Churches involved in the same

Unhappiness? It were easie to be tart and severe upon this occasion, but I shall leave it to the Wisdome of Authority in vindication of the Honour of Religion, a Nobility famous for whatsoever is truly Great and Honorable, and a Ministry no less Learned than Pious, to chasten this Excess of Insolence.</p>

and consequently, that their conditions with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eference to their everlasting interests are secure; while in the mean time their hearts and minds are strangers to, and void of all those Dispositions, Qualities, Habits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which we are assisted to live soberly to our selves, righteously towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or answerably to the dependance we have on, or the relations we stand in unto God: whence it naturally &amp; by a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity comes to pass, that they are wholly estranged in their lives from that Sobriety, Temperance, Justice, Equity, Devotion, Humility, Gratitude, Meekness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they should be in the exercise of. These men presume themselves into Salvation, and claim happiness on the boldness of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; nor do they apply themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer heaven otherwise than in the alone virtue of their imagination. If they can but arrive at so much impudence as to vote themselves Saints, they think that they are acquitted from all care of Vertue and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. These are the men who set vertue and grace at odds, who frame to themselves a Religion not only empty of, but inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with real goodness: the unhappy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of those whom the Apostle <hi>James</hi> encounters, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. to the end. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57446:9"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> is, That some having obtained of themselves, endeavour to prevail with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to renounce and seclude all infused principles (commonly called grace) with the subjective influences of the Spirit, and to erect in the room thereof acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, natural dispositions, innate abilities, and moral vertues, as the whole of that, in the strength of which we may live acceptably to God, and acquire a fitness and title to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and life. <hi>Moral vertue</hi> (saith a late Author) <hi>is not onely the most material and useful part of all Religion, but the ultimate end of all its other duties: And all true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can consist in nothing else, but either the practice of vertue it self, or the use of those means and instruments that contribute to it.</hi> Eccles. polit. p. 69. <hi>All Religion is either vertue it self, or some of its instruments; and the whole duty of man consists in being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi>: ibid. p. 71. <hi>There is nothing beyond the bounds of moral vertue, but Chimera's and flying Dragons, illusions of fancy &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of Enthusiasm</hi>; Idem def. &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat. p. 338, 339. Hence he challengeth any man <hi>to give him a notion of grace distinct from morality,</hi> affirming, <hi>that if grace be not included in morality, that it is at best but a phantasm and an imaginary thing</hi>; Eccles.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57446:10"/>
polit. p. 71. and again, <hi>that the spirit of God, and the grace of Christ, when used as distinct from moral abilities &amp; performances, signify nothing</hi>; def. &amp; continuat. p. 343. Thus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; grace are not only made co-incident; morality and Religion in its utmost latitude made convertible terms: but in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of these Notions, men are acted to vent all manner of contempt against the Spirit of God, deriding the inward opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, quicknings and influences of the Holy Ghost, as Enthusiastick dreams, canting phrases, &amp; the fumes of Religious madness. <hi>To be born again, and to have a new spiritual life, is a phantastick jargon, unless it only signify to become a new moral man,</hi> (saith the former Author) <hi>def. &amp; continuat. p.</hi> 343, 344. <hi>All the pretended intercourse betwixt Christ &amp; a believing soul, in way of discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, manifestations, spiritual refreshments, withdrawings, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sertions, is nothing but the ebbs and tydes of the humours of the body, and the meer results of a natural and mechanical Enthusiasm; nor otherwise intelligible, than by the laws of mechanism, as the motion of the heart, and the circulation of the blood are:</hi> ibid. p. 339<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 340, 341, 342. Hence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe conversion, <hi>by our being united to Christ, and ingrafted in him, is called a rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57446:10"/>
up and down in ambiguous phrases, and canting in general expressions of Scripture, without any concern for their true sense and meaning</hi>; ibid. p. 343.</p>
            <p>The consideration of the inconsistency of these principles with truth, the affront offered to the Gospel, and dammage done to the souls of men by each of them, hath led me to this undertaking. <hi>On the one hand</hi> to separate grace from vertue, and to set faith and morality at variance, cannot but furnish men Atheistically and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disposed, with occasion of <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that worthy name by which we are called:</hi> it being too much the custom of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced &amp; disingenuous persons to reflect the scandals which arise either from the doctrines or conversations of professors, on that Holy and innocent Religion, which they (though but hypocritically) do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. <hi>On the other hand,</hi> to swallow up the whole of Religion in morality, seems a plain renouncing of the Gospel, and shapen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to befriend men in such a design. For if the <hi>Gospel be nothing but a restitution of the Religion of Nature</hi>; as the aforesaid Author affirms, <hi>def. &amp; continuat. p.</hi> 316. <hi>And if the Christian institution doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any new duties distinct from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57446:11"/>
rules of Morality</hi>; as is alledged, <hi>def. &amp; continuat. p.</hi> 305. I see not, but that whoever would act consistently to these principles, he must needs proceed to a plain renunciation of all the instituted duties of the Gospel, (which is to overturn the whole fabrick of Christianity) &amp; confine himself to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue; that being a plain and full system of the law of nature, and a sufficient transcript of the duties we were obliged to by the rule of Creation. Nor, supposing that <hi>Martin Sidelius</hi> was not mistaken in his hypothesis, <hi>that all Religion consists in morality alone</hi>; (The same opinion with that asserted by a late Author;) can I censure him for what he thereupon proceeded to, namely, the renouncing the Gospel: Nor doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the character fastned upon him; <hi>def. &amp; continuat. p.</hi> 313. <hi>of a foolish and half-witted fellow,</hi> upon the account of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, they being neither <hi>streined nor absurd,</hi> but clear and natural; whatever he demerited upon the score of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>These among other Considerations, having swayed me to this undertaking; I would hope, that an endeavour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the minds of Men, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the conduct of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57446:11"/>
and Consciences in those things may not be unacceptable: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because not onely of some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in setting forth the <hi>due lines, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and bounds of Vertue and Grace</hi>; the describing their <hi>mutual Relations,</hi> and the subordination of the one to the other: But, because there is very little extant upon the subject, at least with respect to the end, and in the manner that it is here managed. Nor indeed was any thing of this nature thought necessary in a Nation where the Gospel is embraced, till the Debates and Discourses of some have of late made it so.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. To avoid all Ambiguity, Darkness and Prevarication, it will be needful ere we make any further proceed, that we fix the meaning and import of <hi>Vertue and Morality; Grace and Religion</hi>; these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terms of the Question to be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed and Decided; nor without a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Notion and Conception of these, can any thing of this Argument be duly understood.</p>

Reason, commanding such things as ought to be done, and forbidding such things as ought not to be done; was the definition that the Stoicks gave of Law.

We meet with it in the controversy of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; in the disputations about converting grace; in the question of humane power to good; in the doctrine concerning the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality and efficacy of the Sacraments; and in this question which we have now under debate; in all which it is liable to ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and so apt to breed confusion, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and prevarication. Concerning the meaning of it in other controversies, we are not concerned at present to enquire; it will be enough for us, if we can clearly settle the <hi>import</hi> of it as it takes up a room in the question before us. The word <hi>Moral</hi> hath as little in footing the Scripture yea less than the former. <gap reason="foreign">

And it must be acknowledged of most of them, that they seem to have traded more in the writings of the philosophers, than in the sacred Scriptures; and to have taken their measures of the notions and apprehensions of things, rather from <hi>Aristotle</hi> than the <hi>Bible.</hi> You may see this laid open at length both as to matter of <hi>fact</hi> and the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous consequences</hi> which have ensued thereupon, by that great and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man Dr. <hi>Owen, De natur. ort. &amp;c. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Theolog. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>digress. &amp; lib.</hi> 6. <hi>a pag.</hi> 509. <hi>ad p.</hi> 521. However it being now universally taken up, and having harboured it self both in the minds and discourses of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57446:21"/>
men; it would be in vain for us to contend against it; we shall sufficiently approve our selves, if we can manifest the just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of it. <hi>Moral</hi> as it relates to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is capable at most but of a threefold signification. <hi>First,</hi> to denote the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our minds and actions to the whole law of God regulating our practical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But this description, whether we take our measure from <hi>vertue</hi> to which it is an <hi>adjunct,</hi> and of which it is <hi>predicated</hi>; or from <hi>law</hi> which first claiming the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of <hi>Moral,</hi> doth afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to certain habits of the mind, and its operations, is much too large. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the meaning of it by <hi>vertue</hi>; Then for as much as in all true affirmative propositions there must be an identity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the subject and the predicate, <hi>Moral</hi> must relate onely to an observation of these things, and a practice of those duties, which vertue refer's to, namely, an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of what <hi>Reason</hi> without any super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added declaration can conduct us in, and natural endowments and self acquirements inable us to the performance of. Nor could the first Authors of this <hi>Term</hi> mean any more by it, being at once strangers to all external <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Subjective grace.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57446:21"/>
Or, if we should choose to decide the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Moral</hi> as it refers to <hi>Vertue,</hi> by taking our measure of its signification from <hi>Law</hi> as that to which the stile of <hi>Moral</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily belongs, and by <hi>analogy</hi> only to habits and operations; we shall still find that the foresaid signification of <hi>Moral</hi> is too wide: for according to this method of proceed, <hi>Moral</hi> as referred to <hi>vertue,</hi> can be of no larger extent than <hi>Moral</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to law is. Seeing then it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ordinary sense and the custome of mankind, to stile every law of practical obedience moral; it is no less irrational to stile the conformity of our minds and actions to those laws by the name of Moral Vertues. A <hi>Second</hi> signification put upon <hi>Moral</hi> as it hath reference to <hi>Vertue</hi> is to intimate thereby the observation of the precepts of the Second table of the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: and this is the common acceptation of it among practical Divines; whereof I judg this to be the reason; either because the Philosophers in their writings vulgarly called <hi>Ethicks</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> do principally treat of the duties which men owe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and one another; which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the subject of the <hi>Second Table:</hi> or because they discourse of those only, with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57446:22"/>
any consistency to reason, and comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>dableness; while in the mean time in what soever we owe immediately to God, the imaginations are vain, and their sentiment dark and ludicrous. But this acceptatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> I take to be as much to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we state the meaning of <hi>Moral</hi> by its <hi>Habitude</hi> to <hi>Vertue,</hi> or to that <hi>Law</hi> which is so denominated; We must admit it a greater latitude of signification, than meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imply <hi>Second-Table</hi> duties. If we judg of its import by its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>Vertue,</hi> we must then allow it the same largeness of sence wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch we allow <hi>that,</hi> namely to declare whatsoever is required of us by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Reason:</hi> and I suppose it will be readily acknowledged that there are some duties which we owe immediately to God, and which respect him alone as their object, that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by principles drawn from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the foundations and grounds of them discovered in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi>; and by consequence <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> ought not to be confined to the observation of the <hi>precepts</hi> of the <hi>Second Table.</hi> Or if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57446:22"/>
we determine the sense of <hi>Moral</hi> by its <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <hi>Relation</hi> to that law which is so called, and with respect to conformity to which, the <hi>Habit's</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of our minds are afterwards denominated <hi>Moral</hi>: it will with the same evidence follow, that the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Morality</hi> consist not alone in obeying the commandments of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table</hi>; forasmuch as the Precepts of the <hi>First</hi> constitute a part of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as well as these of the <hi>Second</hi> do.</p>
            <p>There is a Third sence which <hi>Moral</hi> as it belongs to <hi>vertue</hi> is capable of; namely, to declare those habits and operations of the mind required by the law of creation. And this sence of <hi>Moral</hi> will prove either stricter or larger according as we take the measure of the <hi>term,</hi> from vertue, or from law. If we define the meaning of it by its <hi>habitude</hi> to <hi>vertue,</hi> it will then signify only those duties that we are under the obligation of by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>creation,</hi> which we are able to discover by the light of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; But if we determine the sence of <hi>it</hi> by that <hi>law</hi> which is commonly called <hi>moral,</hi> it will then express all those duties either to God or Man, which we are obliged to by the rule of <hi>creation</hi>; whether there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in man in his lapsed state an ability of

               </gap> in an observance of the precepts of the law of our creation, &amp; that by the alone strength and improvement of our natural abilities, whether the particular duties we are under the sanction of by the foresaid law, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by and in the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> yea or not.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. Besides, these moral vertues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have been discoursing, and whose nature we have fixed and stated; There is frequent mention in Christian writers both ancient and modern, not only of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical ones,</hi> which they make specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and essentially different, both <hi>Quoad Substantiam &amp; Quoad modum</hi> from the former; as may be seen in <hi>Aquin. prim.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 62. <hi>Banes in</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>passim,</hi> &amp;c.

I say moreover, that there are not onely <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Vertues contended for as distinct from the <hi>moral</hi> ones we have been unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but they also mention <hi>moral</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <hi>infused,</hi> different from the other <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ones which are only acquired: so <hi>Aquinas prim. secund. quest</hi> 63. <hi>act.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.

I who know my self unworthy to be mentioned in one day either as to Reading or Learning with that Reverend Person, am able if need were, to produce him a hundred. It is not many Years ago, that the like question was debated with some warmth by persons of great learning among our selves: and though the controversie was not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a specifical <hi>difference,</hi> betwixt the <hi>acquired habits</hi> which are in unregenerate men, and the <hi>infused habits</hi> which are in believers; nor yet whether the <hi>acts</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

from <hi>infused habits</hi> differ <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> from those acts which proceed from <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired habits</hi>; the parties contending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein at full agreement: but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone quarrel was, whether this <hi>Specifick Difference</hi> was to be called a <hi>Specifick Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> difference, or a <hi>Moral</hi> only: yea the debate was not so much about the <hi>Habits</hi> of the one sort, and the <hi>Habits</hi> of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a <hi>Specifick</hi> difference even in <hi>Kind</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as good as on all sides acknowledged; for as much as the roots and principles of the one, were confessed by both parties to be Physically different from the roots and principles of the other; but the contest was chiefly in reference to the <hi>acts</hi> which proceed from <hi>Acquired Habits,</hi> and are found in unregenerate men; whether the <hi>Specifick</hi> difference between them and the acts which proceed from infused habits, be only <hi>Moral</hi> or also <hi>Physical</hi>? Now though this was the whole and the alone ground of quarrel between the contending parties, yet we remember what keen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments appeared in some learned men against a holy and worthy person, for his stating the difference betwixt the <hi>Acts</hi> of the one sort of <hi>Habits,</hi> and the acts of the

given by God at first unto our Natures: Whereof our <hi>Reasons</hi> exercising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the consideration of the Nature of God, our own Nature, the relation we were created in to him, the habitude we stood in to our Fellow-Creatures, and the Divine method and order in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all; was a sufficient <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> conveyance while we abode in the state of Integrity. It is true, since the <hi>fall</hi> it is otherwise, many Dictates of the Law of Nature being grown inevident, obscure, subject to controversie, not easy, if at all, to be defined, without the advantage and assistance of Scripture-light. There are various degrees of evidence in those things which relate and appertain to the Law of Nature: in some the <hi>Moral</hi> congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Act and the Object is manifest &amp; apparent; in other it lye's more remote and out of view: So that now the only sure, universal, perfect <hi>System</hi> of natural Law, is the Decalogue of <hi>Moses</hi>: This is a true draught of what by the Law of Creation we were under the Sanction of; A transcript and written impression of the whole Originall Law; not at all differing in its nature from what was imposed on man in innocency; but distinguished only in the

the manner of its Promulgation; that which was formerly <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>subjective,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now <hi>external</hi> and <hi>objective.</hi> But though we affirm that never any since the <hi>fall</hi> did so act his Reason, as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Universally the Law of Nature, with the bounds and consequences of it: yet we also readily grant that our Reason at first was a sufficient Instrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the knowledg of the whole Law of Nature to us. Seeing then that no man can justly come under obligation by a Law, unless it be sufficiently promulgated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation being an essential qualification of a Law; for Law can have influence upon none that do not know it. <hi>Leges quae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringunt hominum vitas, intelligi ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus debent: Those Laws which have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon mens lives ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all, say Civilians.</hi> We shall in the next place therefore endeavour to lay open the several fountains, in which the whole Law of Nature was at first fully understood.</p>
            <p>Now there were <hi>Five ways</hi> which our <hi>Rational Faculties</hi> exercising themselves in, should before that sin had darkned the mind and disordered the creation, have attained to a full and perfect knowledg of

From which there could not but have resulted a clearer and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct knowledg, than we can now imagine, of that love, Gratitude, Reverence which we owed to him; and these would have been attended with a recognition of our own nothingness, a dependant frame of spirit, and a resignation of our selves and all things to his will.

And the observing the <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations</hi> of the parts of our Composition one to another: That the <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> powers are to be governed by the <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Rational.</hi> From which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57446:51"/>
would have arisen a plenary and steady knowledg of the unsuitableness of earthly things to constitute us happy. That our Blessedness lay not in the pleasing of our senses, and gratification of our Animal part. In a word, that the Soul was to be principally regarded, and that Reason was to be our only conductor: which I suppose was enough to have precluded all intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> incontinence and, the subjecting of our selves to the Animal life &amp;c. <hi>A third way was, an ability of penetrating more fully (than now we can) into the natures of the several creatures, their fabricks, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operations, various instincts, relations both to us and one an other</hi>: in all which as in a glass, much of our duty, had we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the state of integrity, would have become plain and evident to us. If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>fall</hi> and all that darkness and confusion which hath ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; We abide still directed to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the learning many parts of our duty: See <hi>Iob.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11. Should we not have been capable of learning more from them and that more clearly and distinctly, when there was no tincture of sin or shadow of darkness on the mind, nor fallacious
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57446:52"/>
medium in the whole Creation. <hi>A Fourth was, an ability of mind of knowing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which we stood in one to another.</hi> How that we were not self-sufficient, but brought forth under a necessity of mutual assistances: and that we could not subsist without the mutual aids of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. That we arose not like mushromes out of the earth, nor were digged out of parsly-beds, neither came into the World by a fortuitous Original; That we sprung not Originally from diverse <hi>Stocks,</hi> much less were created at first multitude of us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: But that the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was propagated from one single Root. That each of us was intended as a part of the <hi>Rational System,</hi> and made for society and fellowship. From all which we should have been able by easy deductions and short dependencies to have argued out the whole of those duties we are under the Sanction of, either to parents, children, or neigbours. In a word, doing as we would be done by; which epitomiseth the whole duty that one man oweth to another, would have proved the natural issue of the foregoing considerations. The <hi>Fifth and last way was, through observing Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method in the Works of Creation.</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57446:52"/>
As the works of God themselves were to be instructive unto man not only of the Being, Power, Wisdome, and Goodness of God, but of the Moral duties that God expected from us: <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20, 21. So God's <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> in the <hi>Production</hi> and <hi>Disposal</hi> of his Works into their several Relations and Subordinations, was likewise intended to be instructive to mankind, and it was the will of God that we should learn our duty thereby. Thus the Preeminence of the man over the Woman is confirmed by the Apostle from the order of the Creation; <hi>I suffer not,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Woman to usurp over the man, for Adam was first formed then Eve</hi>; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12, 13.

What this was, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, is next to be declared. God then having created man, He not only made him a Rational Creature furnished with a soul of an immaterial and immortal nature, which was his essential perfection, and did perfect him in <hi>genere Physico,</hi> as he was such a particular being in the universe: which may be stiled the Natural Image of God in man: Being in its spiritual immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature a representation of the Divine nature, and is accordingly alluded to under that notion by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. But besides, He impressed a Rectitude on the soul of man, perfecting him in <hi>Genere Morali,</hi> as he stood in Relation to God as his Rector and Governour, and was under
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57446:54"/>
such and such Laws. <hi>Lo this only have I found, that God made man upright, Eccles.</hi> 7.29. <hi>i. e.</hi> endowed with divine Wisdome to understand his duty, <hi>and with perfect abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform the same.</hi> And this is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. Where God saye's <hi>Let us make man in our Image, after our own likeness.</hi> For the likeness of man to God consists chiefly in <hi>purity: Be ye Holy, as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. And <hi>be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect even as your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is perfect: Mat.</hi> 5.48. A moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance can in both these places, only be understood. And that this is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary &amp; proper intendment of that phrase, our being created in the <hi>Image</hi> of God; The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in more than one place, doth confirm: <hi>Put ye on the new man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness, Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>with Col.</hi> 3.10. And this we may call the Moral <hi>Image</hi> of God in man, not only because it consists in Moral perfections, answerable to what we conceive in God under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but especially because it adapts and qualifies us for the observance of the Law of Morality appointed us as the Rule of our living to Him. Now this <hi>Moral Image,</hi> though it was no part of our essence, nor

            <p n="6">§ 6. Though man was created under the Sanction, and in the knowledg of a Law and every way qualified and adapted for the keeping of it, had he not been wanting to himself: <hi>Yet if we consider him precisely as under the Law of Creation without any farther stipulation from God; he was the meer object of Gods Dominion, made at his will and for his pleasure, and annihilable by the same will, to which he owed his subsistence.</hi> I readily grant that Gods Dominion which is nothing else but a right of disposing his Creatures according to his own pleasure in way's becoming Holiness, Justice &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57446:56"/>
did no way Warrant him to damn them without the intervention of sin. For this were to inflict a torment on them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing the Good of existence which he had given them. If God should create a Creature only to make it miserable, in stead of bestowing a benefit on it, He would do it the greatest injury he possibly could. Though bare existence be a term of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet when it is over-ballanced with an extream and infinite misery it becomes an unhappiness, and can be no longer eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. While we are then asserting the Soveraignty of God, we would not affront his Justice and Goodness. Now to reduce an innocent Creature into a worse estate than that out of which it was taken, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but esteem it inconsistent both with the Justice and Goodness, which essentially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the supreme Being. Nor can we once admit into our thoughts that he whose ways are <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> can inflict on any an extream and endless torment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consideration of an antecedent crime: There is nothing more repugnant to the notions of justice and equity than to damn a harmless Creature, meerly out of will and pleasure. The Savage allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Heathen Worship, have been

alway's reckoned a just impeachment of the Deity of those they adored; and shall we admit a worse Barbarity to be an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Dominion of the Holy <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>? God forbid! Nor do I in the second place deny, but that <hi>tranquillity</hi> and <hi>sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of mind would have necessarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Light is not more inseparable from a Sun-beam, than pleasure and peace of Soul is from a state of purity and uprightness.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cting conformably to Reason would have been a sure and momentous one. Whatever calamities God in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty might have inflicted on us, and whatever comforts of life, he could have taken from us, yet anxiety and remorse would never have arrested us. Yea the continual recognition of that nothingness, out of which by the arbitrary <hi>fiat</hi> of our Creator we were taken, would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all our thoughts of reducibleness back into that state again, both satisfactory and delightful. The apprehensions of our disposableness at the will of our Maker, would not have grated upon our innocent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57446:57"/>
mind. In a word, we should have esteemed the very observance of the Law of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a considerable reward. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent soul should have been satisfied from its self. For as the Poet saith.</p>
            <q>Ipsa quidem virtus sibi pulcherrimamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Sil.</q>
            <p>It is likewise confessed that there is a great condecency, and admirable suitableness in it to Divine Wisdome and Goodness; that a perfect, and spotless innocency should be attended with a happy and unafflicted life: But yet all that carries such a proportion is not necessary. For there is an admirable condecency to Divine Sapience and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that the whole race of mankind should not be utterly lost: that God should not loose active glory in way of thanksgiving and praise from a whole <hi>Species</hi> of Rational Creatures: and yet I suppose it will not be affirmed that God was obliged to re-instate fallen man in all the circumstances of that felicity, which by his disobedience to the Law of his Creation he had forfeited. Surely no property of the Divine Nature had been impeachable, had God suffered Mankind to perish under the guilt they had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57446:57"/>
wilfully contracted. All that I contend for then is this, that had not God ratified the Law of Creation into a Covenant, and thereby set bounds to his own Dominion, we could have had no foundation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any thing from him, after the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most &amp; exactest of obedience, save the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of having performed it. There is no property in God which antecedently to his own pleasure, obligeth him to remunerate our obedience; nor precluding a Covenant could we warrantably have expected any such thing from him. <hi>First,</hi> not his <hi>Justice</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For (1) There is strict <hi>Distributive</hi> Justice observed, where God taketh no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way than he freely gave. Every superior Authority, if it hath not abridged it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by some promise or Covenant, hath still liberty to revoke all the free issues of its own power and bounty. Where benefits are freely bestowed, there the Donor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's a right of rescinding his own dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>God having therefore made us of his Meer will, and for his pleasure Rev.</hi> 4.11. He had full power arbitrariously to destroy the Beings he had conferred. The whole interest that we have in our selves, is from the free gift of our maker, and by resuming what he hath given, he may cancel that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57446:58"/>
interest when he pleaseth. Nor is God's donation of being to the Creatures any silent contract (as is alledged by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Deus Justificatus,</hi> p. 266) That He will never destroy them: For we have the experience of <hi>Brute Animals</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who in the vertue of their Beings conferred on them, cannot plead a title to continuance. Perceptive capacities they have as well as we, though not of that kind; and are allowed Gratifications suitable to them; yet this hinders not, but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least fault in them or injury in God, they are at once deprived both of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Animal life, and of Being it self. (2) For <hi>Commutative</hi> Justice, there neither is nor can be any such thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Creatures. For that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth an equality between what is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and what is received; and only there, where there is an <hi>equalitas dati &amp; accepti</hi> can Commutative Justice take place. We can therefore neither plead nor enter a claim upon this foundation, unless we could have brought as much benefit to God as we had received as well in his conferring our beings on us, as in the after-reward. Gods raising us out of nothing by his alone power and goodness, and furnishing us with those
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57446:58"/>
faculties which made us fit for Moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, did sufficiently entitle him to the utmost service we could perform, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laying him under any obligation in point of Justice of remunerating it when we had done. Merit from a Creature to its Creator is a Contradiction not only to Scripture, <hi>Job.</hi> 22.3. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 35.7. but to Reason. I am sure that of the Apostle is enough to render it indubitable; <hi>For if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham were justified by Works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God; Rom.</hi> 4.2. Justification could not be strictly merited, no not by works. The very <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Works</hi> excluded glorying before God: and let me add, that the <hi>Law</hi> of Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not only that, but also glorying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men; which is enough if carefully attended to, to overthrow some of the chiefest <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> notions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> not his Mercy and Goodness; forasmuch as all the <hi>effects</hi> of Goodness, (as Goodness is taken for Beneficence and Bounty, which is the only proper notion of it here) are free and elective. And indeed it is necessary it should be so: Because no kindness can oblige, but what proceed's from one who is vested with Power and Right not to bestow it. Nor do we pay
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57446:59"/>
thanks for what is derived to us by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an Agents Nature, but only for what arriveth with us from the choice of his will. Though the Holy and Rational nature of God determines him as to <hi>Moral</hi> Good, without the least infringement of his liberty; yet the case is not the same in reference to <hi>Physical</hi> good; There being no property in God obliging him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the creatures he can, and to do them all the Good he is able: But the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Omnipotence and exercise of his Beneficence depend as to both on the choice of his will. To drive the opposite notion to its issue, would prove the world to have been if not from eternity, at least many Myriads of ages sooner than it was? and that every Creature is as perfect, as it was possible for Omnipotent power and infinite Fecundity to make it, and that that there are no more Creatures possible than what are already: with a hundred ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities more, which contradict not only Reason but Experience.</p>
            <p>I shall Subjoin but one thing farther in proof of the conclusion I am establishing, but in my Opinion such a one as may stop the mouths of the <hi>Amyraldians</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, who affirm that for the bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

And it is this, namely that Gods <hi>Covenanting</hi> with mankind in the state of integrity to reward them provided that they persevered in their dependance on him, by obedience to the Law of their Creation: This doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly testifie that He was under no antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obligation to it. For the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Covenant and Covenanting</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the thing Covenanted about to be free and in his power to do or forbear that makes the Covenant. Where there is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and natural necessity, a Covenant is not only superfluous but absurd. What-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accrueth to us either from intrinsick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or Essential Goodness, we neither need, nor do derive it from Graunt and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. Now that there was such a Covenant no man that hath read either his Bible, and believes it, or a System of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, though but a <hi>Dutch</hi> one, can deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However see <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>from the sixt verse to the end, and Heb.</hi> 12.24. All essentials to the constitution of a Covenant, occur in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57446:60"/>
that transaction, as might be with ease e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, if we did but suspect that it came into question. Now all this as it declares the wonderful condescension of God, that He should humble himself to set bounds to his own Dominion, and come to terms of agreement with a puff of precarious breath, and a little enliven'd dust. So it enhanceth the guilt of the first transgression, being as well against <hi>Love</hi> as Soveraignty, an act not only of Rebellion but Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. <hi>Seventhly: God having ratified the Law of Creation into a Covenant by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reward to the observance and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: He took special care therein for the preserving and securing his own Glory what-ever should be the Event on Mans Part.</hi> Though he trusteth us with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of our own happiness, yet he would not trust us with the mannage of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In case we should make an invasion on his Honour, by transgressing the Law of our Creation, and violating the terms prescribed us; He did not leave himself to the necessity of retrieving it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for it in his first transaction with mankind. Though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the felicity of the Creature depend necessarily on its obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57446:60"/>
yet the Glory of God doth not. God having then in the Covenant of Works provided for the exaltation of the Glory of his Faithfulness, and Goodness in the rewarding of man, had he persevered in obedience to the Law appointed him; He likewise in the same Covenant, by constituting a penalty proportionable in his Justice to the demerit of sin; took care for the securing of his Glory in the exaltation of his Holiness, Righteousness, Rectorship, &amp;c. in the punishment of man, supposing him to transgress the terms prescribed him. However things should fall out, no prejudice was to ensue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God's Glory. Had he therefore left us to <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> accordingly as we should demean our selves in reference to the tenor of that Transaction; Though misery would have fallen out to be our Lot, yet no d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>triment would have arisen thereby to the honour of Gods Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Government. On the one hand then, as man, supposing his perseverance in integrity, had gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd afforded him of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting good things from God on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Fidelity and Righteousness; his promise making life a debt, though even in that case God did not become properly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57446:61"/>
a debtor to us; but what he was of that kind, was to his own Veracity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which made one say <hi>Reddit debita nihil debens, donat debita nihil pendens.</hi> So on the other hand, being once fallen the whole of our recovery can have had its rise in nothing but in the free and meer mercy of God. For had he left us in our forlorn state, He had lost no more honour by us, than he doth by the Angels who <hi>kept not their first Habitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. <hi>Man falling and thereupon forfeiting all that title to life which he had settled on him by the Covenant we have been discoursing of, abode nevertheless still under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law of Creation.</hi> For that resulting from the Nature of God, and the Nature of man, and the relation that man stood in to God as hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Creator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so long as those continue, the Sanction of that Law must continue. What-ever obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariseth upon us from our Nature must be as perpetual as our Nature is. Now though the Lapse hath deprived us of the Rectitude of our Natures, yet it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing from us that is essential to our constitution as men. Though we be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Beasts and Demons in a <hi>Moral sense,</hi> yet not in a <hi>Physical.</hi> Though we
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57446:61"/>
have lost our Souls <hi>legally</hi> in that they are obnoxious to, &amp; under the wrath of God; yet we are not brought forth deprived of them, nor of any thing essentially belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. Such a loss would render us unfit for Moral Government, nor should we be so any longer men, or that <hi>species</hi> of the Creation, which supposing that we are at all, we necessarily must be. What we have said in proof of a <hi>Natural Law</hi> §. 3. is all applicable to that we have now in hand; so that all farther confirmation of it might have been here superseded. But having met with a late <hi>Book</hi> of one Mr. <hi>George Bull,</hi> stiled <hi>Harmonia Apostolica,</hi> and therein with some principles altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the proposition we have now asserted; it will not be amiss to prosecute it a little farther. Now the doctrines in the foresaid Author, subversive of what we have been affirming are mainly two. <hi>(First) That there is no Law of God now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring perfect obedience, or that any man is bound to live free from sin</hi>; and his reason is, <hi>quod justitiae Divinae repugnet, ut quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ad plane impossibilia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (sub periculo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertim aeternae mortis) teneatur. Because it is repugnant to the Righteousness of God, that any man should be obliged to that which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57446:62"/>
is impossible.</hi> And that a spotless, sinless life is so to every one in the circumstances we now stand. <hi>Dissertat. poste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> cap. 7. p. 105, 106.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>That there is no Law now in being, threatning future death, but the Law of Faith: That the promises and threatnings of the Law of Moses were only Temporal and Earthly,</hi> p. 210. If either of these be true, that which I have affirmed must needs be false. A refutation of these is so far then from being superfluous, that it is a necessary service to the design which I have in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, <hi>If there be no Law now in Being, threatning future death, but the Law of Faith,</hi> then of all men in the world, the condition of the Heathen is the most eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And the enjoyment of the Gospel is so far from being a priviledg, that it is a snare. For, seeing <hi>where no Law is, there is no transgression,</hi> Rom. 4.15. Then, for as much as the Gentiles are not under the obligation of the Law of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows, that what-ever courses they pursue, or what-ever sins they are found in the practice of; yet eternal Death they are not obnoxious to. Instead therefore of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying and bewailing the condition of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57446:62"/>
Gentiles for their want of the Gospel, we ought rather to lament their case that have it, being brought only thereby under a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Damnation, which antecedently they were free from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, If there be no Law threatning Eternal Death, but the Law of Faith,</hi> then is there no such thing as forgiveness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin in the world. The Reason is plain, because all pardon supposeth guilt; nor can any properly be discharged from that to which he is not obnoxious. Now the Gospel denounceth damnation only against final Impenitency and Unbelief; As on the one hand, therefore, these are neither pardoned, nor pardonable; so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, if there be no Law threatning eternal death, besides the Gospel, then is there no other sin that we either need, or are capable of having forgiven; And by consequence there is no such thing as remission of sin in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, If there be no Law threatning eternal Death, but the Law of Faith,</hi> then Christ never dyed to free any from wrath to come. For it is non-sence to say that he hath freed us from the Curse of the Gospel; yea, it is a Repugnancy, unless you will introduce another Gospel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57446:63"/>
against the terms of this; nor will that serve the turn, unless you likewise find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Mediator to out-merit this. If Christ then have at all delivered us from wrath to come, it must be that of the Law; and if so, there must be a Law besides the Gospel, that denounceth future wrath, <hi>vid. Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To say <hi>that there is no Law now in Being, requiring perfect Obedience, and that no man is bound to live wholly free from Sin,</hi> is in plain English to affirm a contradiction. For, There being nothing that is sin, but what is forbid, or what we are under obligation against; (<hi>all sin being a transgression of some Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3, 4.) To say that no man is bound to live free from sin, is to tell us that he is not obliged to that, that he is obliged to. See Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his endeavour to rectifie some prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 4. &amp; 14. I know well enough that some of these Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are things which the foresaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth plainly detest, but they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the issue and birth of his Assertions. For I would not fasten an odious inference upon any mans discourse, if the cohaesion were not necessary and clear. I reckon it an Unmanly, as well as an Unchristian
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57446:63"/>
thing to wring conclusions out of others premises. Nor would I drive the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of any, farther than it is apt to go, and with the greatest Gentleness may be led.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. That we are still under the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law of Creation hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready demonstrated. That which come's next to be declared, is, <hi>How that every Law of nature is of an Unchangeable obligation.</hi> A late Author tell's us, that <hi>there are Rules of Moral Good and Evil, which are altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble according to the accidents, changes and conditions of humane life.

And it is affirmed that <hi>He hath power to make that a particular of the Divine Law, that God hath not made so; ibid. p.</hi> 80. <hi>And from the power of the Magistrate over the consciences of men in Moral vertues (which our Author tell's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For if either the matters of worship be already stated by God; or if God should have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the magistrate by a declaration of his will, as to medling in this matter, and bequeathed that trust into other hands; his <hi>Consequence</hi> falls to the ground. But it is the <hi>Antecedent</hi> that I am to deal with, and it is some comfort to me, that there are men of equal learning with the foresaid Author, who have been of a perswasion widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from his. <hi>Grotius</hi> a person of some account in his day, and who will continue so while Learning is had in reputation, judged otherwise in this matter: <hi>Est au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem jus naturale adeo immutabile ut ne a Deo quidem mutari queat; De jure Belli &amp; Pacis</hi> lib. 1. cap. 1. §. 10 <hi>Natural Right</hi> (or Law) <hi>is so unchangeable that it cannot be altered by God himself.</hi> And that it may appear that he mean's those Rules of Good and Evil, which have reference to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and positive Laws, and in some sence depend upon them, He adds a little after; <hi>fit tamen interdum ut in his actibus de quibus

For as Plutarch say's, there are some <gap reason="foreign">

to my entring into that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or those circumstances, it was not my actual Duty.

It is well, if upon every times changing our condition, or upon every humour of the Magistrates altering the civil penalty of a moral crime, the Law of Nature must change also. Yea,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57446:66"/>
according to the rate that any Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are alterable, I will undertake to prove that they are all so. We readily grant that a man by putting himself into new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or new relations, is thereon oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to performance of many duties which as so circumstantiated he was not bound unto before, but we altogether deny that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Laws of Nature suffer the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; and the Reason is, because they did never bind to such duties, but on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of such Relations and Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In a word, the whole Law of Nature bearing upon the Nature of God, and the Nature of Man, while these are unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it is unchangeable. It is strange that we should envy the <hi>Pope</hi> to dispense with a Natural Law, if the <hi>Magistrate</hi> at pleasure may.</p>

No property of his nature, no word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise bound him to the contrary. The terms of the first Covenant being violated, all was devolved upon the Soveraignty of God again. If an end was not to have been put to obedience, by the immediate
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57446:70"/>
destruction and perishing of the Creature; yet at the least an end was put to God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of any Moral service from the seed of <hi>Adam</hi>; and they lay under an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incapacity of performing any such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as might with respect to the nature and quality of it be accepted with Him. Matters being thus, <hi>God out of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign pleasure, and infinite free Grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a Remedying-Law, treating with us upon New terms, and giving us a New standing in a Covenant-Grace.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he engaged his Veracity, providing we complyed with the overtures now made us, for the pardoning of our sins, the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from Wrath to come, and the stating us at last in the happy enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Now in the vertue of this transaction, there arose <hi>New Relations</hi> betwixt God and us, with <hi>new duties</hi> thereon. So that henceforth the Law of Creation was but one part of the Rule of that obedience we owed to God, the condition of the New Covenant making up the other part of it. Whoever then shall now state the whole of Religion in Moral duties, bids a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the Gospel, either by telling us that there is no Remedial Law at all, or that the terms of it are universally the same
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57446:70"/>
with the terms of the Old Covenant. Of this complexion are several expressions in a <hi>late Author,</hi> viz. <hi>That Religion, for the substance of it, is the same Now, as it was in the state of Innocence. For as then the whole duty of man consisted in the practice of all those Moral Vertues that arose from his Natural Relation to God, so all that is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced upon us since the fall, is but helps and contrivances to supply our Natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and recover our decayed powers, and restore us to a better ability to discharge those duties we stand engaged to by the Law of our Nature, and the design of our Creation. So that the Christian Institution is not for the substance of it any new Religion, but onely a more perfect digest of the eternal Rules of Nature and Right Reason.

Yet coordinate they can not be, their terms being not only different but opposite. It is true each of them in their own kind, sense and way, requires perfect obedience; For no Law can remit what it self exacts: but then it is only perfect obedience to its own demands. And with respect to its own terms the Gospel is as strict as the Law. As the <hi>one</hi> denounceth Eternal death to all

Only the terms of the one are not so severe and strict as the terms of the other; The Remedying Law being purposely introduced for the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our trespasses against the Original Law. The Law threatens death absolutely, repent or not repent: The Gospel threatens that the legal curse shall be executed except we repent. And herein they are not only so distinct and different, but distant and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in their demands the one to the other; that whoever pleads on a personal fulfilling the terms of the one, is not at all capable of pleading on the terms of the other. The Subject of justification by the Original Law must be one perfectly innocent; <hi>The man that doth these things shall live by them, Rom</hi> 10.5. Whereas the Subject of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Remedying Law, must be supposed a sinner and a criminal; <hi>They that be whole need not a Physician, but they that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57446:72"/>

The <hi>Original</hi> Law both as it was first <hi>Subjective</hi> in our natures, and as it is now <hi>Objective</hi> in the Decalogue to our natures, requires perfect obedience: <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength; Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Moses describeth the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is of the Law that the man which doth those things, shall live by them; Rom.</hi> 10.5. And accordingly in case of the least faileur, it denounceth eternal death; <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them; Gal.</hi> 3.10. Nor can sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience give any title to life, by the Law of Creation: all the Right that it states us in to happiness is by the Law of Faith. The obedience which gives a claim to life by the Original Law, must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and perpetual as well as sincere: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then none of the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> even in their best state, <hi>doth good and sinneth not, Eccl.</hi> 7.20. 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.46. <hi>But in many things we offend all; Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>And if we should say that we have no sin we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us</hi>; 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. It Naturally follow's that <hi>by the Deeds

of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified in God's sight, Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>But that as many as are under the works of the Law, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curse, Gal.</hi> 3.10. The Papists do here grosly erre, by affirming that Mankind is still able perfectly to keep the Original Law. But in order to this they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to hold that some <hi>sins are in their own Nature venial,</hi> and that they are not <hi>contra sed praeter legem, against, but besides</hi> the Law; <hi>Bellarmin. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de justif. cap.</hi> 14. The whole of which as it is false, so it is absurd and non-sensical. For if they be against no Law, they are not at all sins, but acts in themselves indifferent and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And if they be violations of any Law of God, i. e. if they be at all sins they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit eternal death; That being the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty annexed by God to the breach of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very command; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Deut</hi> 27.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. Besides did we remain able to fulfil &amp; observe the Law of Creation perfectly, there could be no place nor room for the Law of Grace; For (as the Apostle saith) <hi>if there had been a Law given, which could have given life, verily Righteousness should have been by the Law; Gal.</hi> 3.21. It being then impossible that they should be <hi>Coordinate,</hi> it remains that the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57446:73"/>
one lye in a <hi>subordination</hi> to the other. And seeing that the Gospel in all its super-structions supposeth the Original Law still in Being, though not Universally to the same ends that it first served; and for as much as the Law of Faith is provided and introduced of God, to minister relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of Nature; it likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Original Law is now brought into a <hi>subserviency and subordination to the Remedial-Law.</hi> How and wherein this is, shall be farther laid open.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then; <hi>Our Lord Jesus hath in the Gospel adapted the Decalogue</hi> (which is a compleat transcript of the Natural Law) <hi>to be the alone measure of Moral Rectitude and Obedience.</hi> Though the Gospel strengthen the Duties of Morality by new Motives, and improve them upon New Principles, yet it no where gives us any New Precepts of Moral Goodness. It is true, Christ once and again, particularly in the <hi>fifth</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> vindicates the Moral Law from the corrupt glosses and flesh-pleasing expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who had restrained and perverted it from, and besides the meaning of the Law, and the intent of the Law-giver; But he no where superinduceth any New Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57446:74"/>
that was not designed in the Sanction of it at first. He hath retrived the old Rules of Nature from the evil customs of the World, and rebuk'd the false expositions put upon the Decalogue by those who both then, and for a considerable time before sat in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair. But he hath no where made new additions to them by putting his last hand (as some men take upon them to say) to an imperfect draught. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to affirm that the Decalogue was an imperfect and defective edition of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law, is to assert that which no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with the design of God's Wisdom and Goodness in giving it. For God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment in giving the Law of the <hi>Ten</hi> Commandments, being to relieve us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Darkness of Moral Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which had seized us by the <hi>Fall</hi>; we must suppose it a sufficient draught of the Original Law of Morality, otherwise we must conclude it not proportionable and adequate to the end it was given for, which to assert, is no less than an impeachment of the divine Sapience, Faithfulness and Goodness. Nor doth the bringing up such a report upon the Moral Law, accord with that account which the Scripture eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where gives of it; <hi>The Law of the Lord
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57446:74"/>
is perfect,</hi> Psal. 19.7. Not onely <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> perfect, in respect of its purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but <hi>integrally</hi> in respect of its pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and fulness. As it is in nothing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous which it ought not to have, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it deficient in any thing that it ought to have. <hi>Thy Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad,</hi> Psal. 119.96. This it could not be, if it were not a perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all Moral Duties. Shall I add that the institution of New Moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts seems not at all consonant to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that Christ came upon. The Holy Ghost entirely allots the giving of the Law to <hi>Moses,</hi> telling us that the work, errand, and business of Christ was of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi> Joh. 1.17. Christ's work was to bring into further light the Law of Faith, and to redeem us from the Curse of the Moral Law; not to augment the number of Natural Duties. This may suffice to perstringe among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a late Author, whose words are, that <hi>the Decalogue was never intended for a perfect System of the Moral Law. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is likely, that he and those of his persuasion would take it ill if I should tell them with whose Heifer they here Plow: Therefore I shall irritate no man, onely recommend those who desire farther confirmation in this matter, to such who have debated the Socinian Controversies. Now with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Christs having made the Moral Law of the Family of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the place already assigned it, a threefold <hi>subordination</hi> of that to this, is easie to be manifested. (1.) That it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the alone score of the Law of Grace, that God will accept any service at the hands of Sinners: For though the Law, as to the Obligation of it, remain still in force, and for the substance of it, will do so to all Eternity; yet that God will accept the service of Sinners, is to be wholly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God's transaction with them in the Covenant of Grace by Jesus Christ. (2.) It is in the alone vertue of the Law of Faith, and God's Mercy and Faithfulness therein displayed and declared, that an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ministred to us of performing any part of Moral Obedience, so as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57446:75"/>
with the Lord, and afforded ground of expecting a reward thereupon. This Grace comes not by <hi>Moses</hi>: The Law as such, administers no strength for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what it requires; this comes alone by Jesus Christ, <hi>out of whose fulness, we receive Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16, 17. (3.) Though the Original Law continue both to claym perfect Obedience, and to threaten Death in case of the least faileur, yet because of the introduction of the Law of grace over it, the penalty shall not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, provided we be sincere Christians, &amp; flie to the hope set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Not-withstanding both our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest faileurs in that Obedience which the Law exacts, and its severe denunciation of wrath upon the least sin, yet our condition is not left hopeless, providing we fulfil the terms of the Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Original Law is brought into subserviency to the Law of Grace in this. That though in it self, and abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly considered, it be only shapen to drive us from God, and to fill us with thoughts of fear and flight, and accordingly that was the effect of it upon <hi>Adam</hi> as soon as he had sinned; yet through the introduction of the Remedying-Law, it is become a blessed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57446:76"/>
means in the hand of the Spirit, to conduct us to Christ and God through him. Hence it is stiled our <gap reason="foreign">

It conducts and leads us to Christ for the obtaining of. This is a blessed subserviency, that all that is frightful and perplexing in the Original Law, whether the amazing strictness of its precepts, or the severe dreadfulness of its denunciations, is made contributory and influential to bring us to Christ, and to God by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:57446:76"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Herein also is the Original Law subjected and made subservient to the Law of Grace: That Faith in the Messiah is constituted an ingredient in every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act in order to its acceptance with God; 'tis this which mainly gives every action its Moral specification. Though the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Moral Duties be laid in the Law of Nature; yet the practice of every Duty, with respect to acceptance with God since the fall, is regulated by that great posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law of the New Covenant which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the tendring of all things through the Messiah. Now the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance being an essential ingredient into the determination of the Moral quality of an action, and the New Covenant deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining this as the manner in which every Moral action ought to be performed; it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows, that Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is become an <hi>ingredient</hi> into, and a <hi>part</hi> of every Moral Duty.</p>
            <p n="14">§ 14. Having intimated the introduction of a Remedying-Law, and the subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Original Law thereunto: That which we are next to address to, is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding our <hi>impotency and inability for the performance of the Duties and Conditions of this Law of Grace.</hi> We here suppose, that

the <hi>New Covenant</hi> hath its terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as well as the Old. Every Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, made with us, as with parties Covenanting, doth by vertue of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, require some perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or other of us antecedently to our having an interest in, and benefit by the promises of that stipulation. We take like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for granted, that <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Act. 20.21. are the terms and conditions of the New Covenant. The state and condition of <hi>Weakness, Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Enmity,</hi> that we are in to these great Duties of the Gospel, is what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a little farther to treat.</p>

That sin is pardonable, we can only learn it there, where we are taught how it is actually pardoned. Before we can be sure of the Reconcileableness of God, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missableness of Sin upon Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: We must first be perswaded of one of these three: (1.) Either that God both can &amp; will forgive Sin without any satisfaction: But this according to the <hi>Amyraldians</hi> themselves, contradicts that <hi>idea</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Holiness, and Justice which we have of God. Or (2.) That the Sinner himself can make satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that is repugnant to Natural light as much (if not more) than the former. Or (3.) That God hath found out a way of satisfying himself, and that either by the death of his Son, or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57446:78"/>
by some other means; not the <hi>first,</hi> for as much as there is not one <hi>Iota</hi> of the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, death, satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Christ, in the whole book of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; neither the <hi>second,</hi> because not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the advantages which we, through the enjoyments of the Scripture have beyond the Heathen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of knowing what could have been, and what could not have been, we are yet so far from any clear cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds of believing the possibility of Salvation in any other way, that we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with very momentous arguments to the contrary. Besides, if I should not not be counted Young, Raw, Petulant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would ask the Disciples of <hi>Amyrald,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the works of God do naturally, and by a vertue intrinsecal to them, declare this <hi>Placability</hi> of God, and Pardonableness of Sin on Faith and Repentance; or whether they do it by vertue of a Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If they affirm the <hi>last,</hi> pray how come the Heathens without a Revelation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that <hi>Institution?</hi> Where, and by whom had God told the world so much? If they assert the <hi>first,</hi> which alone carries probability in it: Then (1.) <hi>Adam</hi> from his own, and his Wifes not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly destroyed upon the commission of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57446:79"/>
Sin, had sufficient assurance of the Placa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God, and pardonableness of Sin, previously unto, and abstracting from all promulgation of the Covenant of Grace. (2.) How is it, that seeing there are in the Government of the World as manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of God's severity, as his Lenity, that forgetting all thoughts of the Wrath and Anger of God, they should only possess a perswasion of his Mercy and Kindness. (3.) Suppose that God had preserved the Creation in <hi>Being,</hi> without transacting with Sinners in a Covenant of Grace (which I think implies no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,) pray what then of the Placable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Compassion of God could it have taught us? In a word, all the Notices which the Heathen have, or at any time had of the Reconcileableness of God, they had it by Tradition from the Church, nor do they resolve themselves into any other Original. Shall I add in the last place, that I never understood the consistency of the <hi>Amyraldian</hi> Hypothesis, either with the Wisdom or Goodness of God. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileableness on terms which (according to those we are dealing with) men neither will, nor can come up to, and where there is no provision for their relief, signifies not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57446:79"/>
very much, nor accords with infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which adapts one thing to another. Of all the defenders of Universal objective Grace, they spake most coherently, who affirmed the Heathens to have been saved by Philosophy, as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> were by the Law, or we by the Gospel. <hi>vid.

               <hi>Secondly: such is the disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our intellectual faculties and the great objects of the Gospel, that they can neither fathom nor bear the Majesty of the doctrines of the New Covenant, though they be never so clearly revealed</hi> The Sun doth not more overpower and dazle the eye, than those things of the Gospel from which all our pardon and peace flow's, do overmatch our understandings. <hi>The Natural man</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57446:80"/>
the Testimony, we must not hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the things testified.

And herein we have an instance of the Love, Care, and Wisdome of God that what is most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible in its own Nature, is above all other things revealed in terms most plain and intelligible. The obscurity of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious truths of the New Covenant is not to be reflected on the darkness of the Declaration, but is to be ascribed to the Majesty of the things declared. <hi>Est enim objectum ita sublime, ut a mente nostra per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectè comprehendi nequeat, non etiamsi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reret omni labe: tantae scilicet rei creatura modus capax non est: The things are in themselves so sublime, that were our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings pure and unspotted they could not be grasped or comprehended; Our f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

as well as of those of Humane Authors; The word revealing things as clearly, and being accompanied with more &amp; stronger motives of credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than any other writings are. But through want of a <hi>Vital</hi> alliance to the things they are conversant about, there is a <hi>Threefold</hi> unhappiness such men labour under. (1.) They are Sceptical and fluctuating in the belief of Gospel-truths. Every temptation can fetch them off. In stead of a firm set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledness of mind in the perswasion of them, they are loose and <hi>Aporetical.</hi> Their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents are weak and vanishing. Divine truths having no <hi>cognation</hi> with the subject they are in, they are easily blown away or wither; whatever certainty be in the <hi>object,</hi> there is little in the <hi>Mind.</hi> They want the <hi>full assurance of understanding of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and of the Father, and of Christ. No man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. He cannot say and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it from a full perswasion of heart, till the Holy Ghost have taught it him, See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. And remember the notion we have already given of the design and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those words. (2) Their knowledg of Gospel-mysteries is not affective. They
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57446:81"/>
do not savour the things they assent to. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have quite an other aspect to an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate person, than they have to one that is <hi>renewed in the Spirit of his mind</hi>; and the act of seeing is of a different kind. How tastless are the great truths of the Gospel to unregenerate souls, and how faint are the Rayes of Gospel-Light! The mind being deprav'd by impure and vitious tinctures, it doth not relish the things which it is even perswaded of. <hi>Unless a man</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>be born again, <gap reason="foreign">

And without the Fathers drawing i. e. without an efficacious work of God ingaging the Soul in a most sweet but powerful manner
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57446:83"/>
no one will be ever found in the practice and exercise of those things. There is both that disproportion of faculty, and that wicked aversation from the terms of the Gospel in every one; which only the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit can relieve and conquer. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective grace or the Moral Swasion of the word is not enough, we need also subjective Grace and a new principle. What a dead man is to vital operations, that every one by Nature is to Spiritual acts. The soul is not more necessary to the body, for the functions of Life, Sense, and Reason; than the <hi>Spirit of life in the New Birth</hi> is to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performances. We not only need insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of Spiritual light to awaken our slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring minds, but to elevate and dispose them for the due perception of the things of God; nor do we only need grace to court our perverse wills, but to determine them to the choice of holiness.

            <p>Fifthly; <hi>How this impotency is now to be called, is not of so great consequence as some men make it.</hi> For on the one hand all are agreed, that it consists not in a <hi>Deprivation of any Essential Power or Faculty of our Rational Being:</hi> This <hi>Spanhemius</hi> as well as <hi>Amyrald, Twiss</hi> as well as <hi>Truman</hi> are at an accord in. And it is granted likewise on the other hand, that it is not only <hi>Congenite</hi> with us, and so in that sense <hi>Natural,</hi> wherein we are said to be by Nature the Children of Wrath; but farther, that it implies both á want of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Rectitude,</hi> and a <hi>connate pravity</hi> and <hi>aversation</hi> from God; and that it is only God who can overcome our oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and relieve our weakness; and that secluding his work upon the soul, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor can comply savingly with the terms of the Gospel: so that whether it ought to be stiled a <hi>Moral,</hi> or a <hi>Natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> is for the most part but a strife about words. There is a perfect harmony as to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57446:84"/>
the sense and meaning, the alone contest is about the manner of expressing and phrasing it. Philosophy is only concerned in it, not Divinity. Nor is the question, who speaks most <hi>truly,</hi> but who speaks most <hi>properly.</hi> It is the dispute of <hi>Divines,</hi> not of Divinity. The terms might have been avoided without prejudice to truth; Nor do I know any reason for the use of them, but to confound mens apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I heartily wish that those Learned persons who have made so great a noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Moral and Natural power, would have been so ingenuous as to have told the World that they impeached no man of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but only of solecism, and that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries were as sound in the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about, as themselves, only that they had not the luck of declaring it in so apt words: as this would have contributed more to the peace of the Church, so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by private Christians would have judged their concern but small in these debates. But seeing for Reasons that I think not fit to enquire into, this needful Advertisement hath been neglected, I hope it will not prove an unacceptable service that we have here suggested it; presupposing then that Agreement in the <hi>Main</hi> which hath been
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57446:84"/>
intimated; All that lies upon our hand, is to enquire who express themselves most Philosophically in this matter. And though I must confess that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>apt words are of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to a clear apprehension of things; yet I must withal add, that I am no friend to a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ning of new terms</hi> when old ones will serve the turn. And I am so far from seeing any solid ground, why in the matter and case before us, we should wave the word <hi>Natural</hi> for the word <hi>Moral</hi>; that I think there is a great deal of reason for the contrary. (1.) The most likely way of arriving at a distinctness of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our present inability, is by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what at first was communicated to us, and for what ends; and according to this method of proceed, I would argue thus. That impotency which consists in the want of a principle not only concreated with us, but <hi>Naturally</hi> due to our undefiled Natures in order to our living acceptably to God, may I think not unfitly be called a <hi>Natural Impotency</hi>; and that the impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under consideration, is such, were easie to demonstrate from what our Divines have proved against the Papists, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57446:85"/>
Grace was <hi>Natural</hi> to man at first, not <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural.</hi> (2.) As the strength and malignancy of a Disease is best known by the powerful remedies which are necessary to conquer it; So the quality of our inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will be best understood by considering the Nature of the means which can relieve us against it. That <hi>inability</hi> then, which <hi>Moral</hi> means are not sufficient to relieve us against, is more than a <hi>Moral</hi> inability; Now that <hi>Moral</hi> means are not sufficient to relieve us against the impotency we labour under, might be easily proved by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the arguments for <hi>Inward Efficacious Grace,</hi> against those who admit only a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Suasion; but this I suppose sufficiently done against <hi>Pelagian, Jesuits,</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; and in the matter both of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of efficacious Grace, and the way in which it is wrought we have both <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> and <hi>Truman</hi> harmonizing with us. (3.) Let us measure our thoughts by the report which the Scripture makes of our <hi>inability,</hi> and we shall find abundant cause of judging it a <hi>Natural</hi> Impotency. For the better clearing of this, we may observe that in order to our readier conceiving our ineptness and indisposition to the things of God, the Lord is pleased to represent it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57446:85"/>
such Metaphors and Similitudes as are of a familiar and easie perception, and to wave others which possibly may be more Emphatical: I shall only take notice that the Holy Ghost upon this occasion frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stiles us <hi>Blind.</hi> Now <hi>Blindness</hi> properly is affirmed of the eyes of the body, and thence transferred to the Soul.

            <p n="15">§. 15. <hi>The necessity of Grace for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring us under, and relieving us against this impotency is pleaded by all:</hi> But it is withal too true, that under the most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences of it, there is nothing more meant by some, but our Natural faculties, or at most the <hi>Objective</hi> assistances of the Holy Ghost in the Gospel. That all the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> intend in effect no more, were easie to demonstrate, if that now lay before us. All that we intend on this head at present, we shall reduce to three conclusions.</p>
            <p>First: <hi>The operation of the Holy Ghost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our faculties, is always in agreement with, and in conjunction with the Word.</hi> We allow no man to pretend to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit, who cannot justifie what he pretends to be conducted in, by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57446:86"/>
some Scripture-Text. The inward <hi>energy</hi> of the Holy Ghost, presupposeth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching of the Scripture. There is always a sweet harmony betwixt the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> and <hi>objective</hi> teaching of the same Spirit, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. As up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one hand, <hi>tolle Spiritum a verbo, &amp; remanet mortua litera</hi>; so on the other hand, <hi>tolle Verbum a Spiritu &amp; non amplius remanet Spiritus Dei sed Sathanae potius; Take away the Spirit from the Word, and the Word is but a dead Letter; so take away the Word from the Spirit, and it is not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, but of Sathan rather; Heming. in</hi> Rom. 11.27. And therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire both an assiduous study of the Word, and an examination of all impressions by it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.21. As less will not secure us from unaccountable impulses, so there is no fear of Enthusiastick phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies where this method is attended to.</p>
            <p>Secondly: <hi>There are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When-ever the Holy Ghost by a <hi>vital</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence perswades the soul to disengage it from sin, and attract it to holiness, he doth it in a way that is congruous to our Nature, &amp; the soul divorceth that, and espouseth this upon plenary conviction. <hi>Flecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he will convince the world of Sin and of Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. He will manage it in way of demonstration. Now the <hi>Topicks</hi> of these Arguments are partly the precepts of the Word, which are all holy, just, and good; agreeable to the Dictates of Reason, and the distinguishing taste we retain of Good and Evil. Approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to our understandings, if they be not enslaved to our lusts and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appetites. Courting us to our interest, as well as obliging us to our duty. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mercy of the Legislator, as well as his Soveraignty.

souls, and in their duration to their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity and immortality. So they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us upon the strongest grounds and motives which can engage our hopes and faith; namely, the Promise and Oath of God; the death and merit of Christ, the earnest and pledg of the Spirit. Partly the threatnings of the Word, which as they are dreadful in reference to things they denounce, whether we consider the Nature of them or their continuance; so they are unavoidable unless we repent and believe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>There is an immediate powerful operation upon the Soul it self, by which our Opposition is conquered, our impotency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, our faculties healed, and elevated to concur as vital principles of Faith and New Obedience.</hi> There is a secret <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>a restoring us in Christ as our head to our primitive dependance on God, Eph.</hi> 1.10. Through him we are not only recovered to a state of favour but reduced to a subject posture. The Soul is now brought into a due subordination to God as its Maker, Preserver, and Rector. In stead of adhering to the Creatures and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the gratification of the animal life, God becomes our great end and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him in all things our main study and endeavour. According as the will of God becomes known, it is spontaneously embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and complacentially rested in. The Grace of God not only teacheth, but ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to <hi>deny Ungodliness and Worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily in this present world, Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. Exemplariness in all vertuous conversation is a certain concomitant &amp; effect of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. However immoral men may be antecedently to their being <hi>born</hi> of God,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57446:89"/>
yet afterwards vertue is a chief part of their endeavour and study, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. If any then pretending to Grace do either in their doctrines encourage immorality as the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> of old, and some Germane <hi>Antinomians</hi> of late; or in their practice be void of sobriety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty: Let the persons so teaching and walking bear the imputation of it; but let not Religion in General be reflected on. So far are all the Advocates of Grace as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from Moral Vertue that I know of, from setting them at odds, that they Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously affirm, that where there is not Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there can be no Grace, and that none can be truly Devout, that is not highly Moral. It is true, our renovation being carried on but by degrees, and there being remains of indwelling and unmortified lust in the best, there is not one, but at some time or other is transported less or more to undue objects. But so far as any one is imbued with the spirit of life, and <hi>born of God, he sinneth not, because his seed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. It is a most slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous imputation therefore which a late Author fast'neth upon the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, <hi>that they have brought into fashion a Godliness without Religion, Zeal without

            </p>
            <p n="17">§. 17. An Obedience to the Law of Creation, answerable to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and proper form and tenour of it, we have already demonstrated to be in the lapsed state impossible. For as it is a contradiction to make that not to have been, which hath been, so is it to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a conformity in him who hath sinned, to that Law, which in its primitive Sanction requireth every man to be sinless. Yet this Law being still continued, not only as the Rule that God will judge every man by, who through non-compliance with the terms of the Gospel, is not relieved by the Law of Faith: But also as the Rule of that obedience, which with some attempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions introduced by the Indulgence and Mitigation of the New Covenant, God continues to exact of every one that shall enter into life. It will not be amiss to enquire briefly into the <hi>Nature and degree of that obedience, and to state the ability we enjoy through Christ of performing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then; <hi>Sincere Obedience to the whole Law of Creation is not only still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but it is required under the penalty
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57446:90"/>
of Damnation.</hi> Though the Gospel relieve us from the sentence of the Law on faileur of perfect obedience, yet it ministers no such relief where there is a want of sincere Obedience. An endeavour to walk in all the Moral Commandments of God, with a performance of the superadded Duties which respect the Mediator, is the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required in every one that would escape legal Wrath. And if it were not thus, the most wicked might lay claim to Pardon and Salvation as well as the most Holy. And the Gospel in stead of being an engagement to duty, were an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to sin: <hi>Christ is the Author of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to none but to them who thus obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. And that we may not here deceive our selves, and think that we are <hi>sincere,</hi> when we are not, I will only mention two things, leaving the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to practical discourses. (1.) That to live in the constant allowed neglect of any duty, or prosecution of any sin is inconsistent with sincerity, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 14, 20. (2.) There are some sins which the very falling into, argues the heart never to have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:57446:91"/>
               <hi>Secondly: Improvement in all habits of Grace, and degrees of Holiness, with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after a most exact strictness are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise required of us. Be ye perfect as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> see 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8. 2 Pet. 3.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. And though damnation be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced here in case of faileur, yet hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we miss much comfortable communion with God, are liable to the withdrawments of the sense of his love, and are exposed to what paternal castigations he thinks fit in his Wisdom to inflict, Psal. 89.31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly: There is provision made in the New Covenant for the promotion of our strength and growth, if we be not wanting to our selves.</hi> There is a fulness of Grace in Christ, out of which we have ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of supply, providing we attend unto the means appointed for the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. An unshaken Faith in the power of God, and in the assistance of the Spirit, a watching unto prayer with diligence and constancy, Meditation of the ugliness of every sin and amiableness of Universal Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are exceeding useful hereunto. Here mainly lies a Believers Province, and the attainment is not onely
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57446:91"/>
possible but easie; if sloth, negligence, love of ease, indulgence to the flesh, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficialness in Duty, unbelief of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, do not preclude and bar us. But then we are only to blame our selves, not to slander the provisions of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly: In the vertue of Gods furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with a principle of Grace, the heart is immediatly imbued with a sincere Love to God, and becomes habitually inclined to walk in his Laws.</hi> Obedience is connatural to the New principle. And though through remains of indwelling sin, and the souls hearkning to temptations; we be not so uniform in our Obedience, nor at all times alike disposed to Holy exercises; yet partly from the struglings and workings of the vital seed it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly through the supplies ministred by the Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our exigences, we are so far secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we shall not disannul the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; see 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.42. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. So that now upon the whole <hi>Christs yoke is an easie yoke,</hi> Math. 11.30. <hi>nor are his Commandments grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. I Cannot think that I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed from the subject which I have undertaken, while I have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing <hi>Principles</hi> which have so great an influence as well upon the due Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the right deciding of it. These be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then proposed and confirmed in the former Chapter; We are now not only at leisure, but somewhat better prepared for the prosecuting the assertion at first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>viz. That Morality doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the whole of practical Religion; nor do'th all the Obedience we owe to God, consist in Moral Vertue.</hi> For the clearer stating and determining of this, it must be observed that there are two great <hi>Instruments</hi> of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the <hi>measure Regulating</hi> it, which we call Law, and the <hi>Principle in the strength of which it is to be performed,</hi> which we call Power. That directs and instructs us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; this adapts and qualifies us to the performance of it: By the <hi>first</hi> we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the means of knowing it; and by the <hi>second</hi> with strength to discharge it. Both these were at first concreated with, &amp;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57446:93"/>
subjective in our Natures. There resided in us Originally, not only an ability of mind, of discerning the whole of our Duty which the Law of Creation exacted of us, but a sufficient power to fulfil it. Whether since the <hi>Fall</hi> we abide qualified as to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, is yet farther to be debated. The first we shall Discuss in this Chapter, having designed the following for the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the other.</p>
            <p>We have already demonstrated the Law of Creation, commonly called the Law of Nature, to be the alone Rule and measure of Moral Vertue. This is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a late Author: <hi>The practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> (saith he) <hi>consists in living suitably to the Dictates of Reason and Nature,</hi> Eccl. Polit. p. 68. Now the Law of Nature may be considered either as 'tis <hi>Subjective</hi> in man, or as 'tis <hi>Objective</hi> in the Decalogue. As 'tis <hi>Subjective</hi> in man, 'tis vulgarly stiled Right Reason, The Light of Nature. The Philosophers who were the primitive Authors of the <hi>Term</hi> Vertue, knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rule by which it was to be regulated, but Reason: This they made the alone <gap reason="foreign">

Other testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to this purpose we have elsewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, viz. cap. 1. Now I affirm, <hi>that the Law of Nature is no sufficient Measure of Religion; and consequently that all Religion consists not in the meer practice of Vertue; but that there is something beyond the bounds of Moral Vertue, besides Chimera's and flying Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2 All that Relates to Religion may be reduced either to faith or obedience; to what we are to <hi>believe,</hi> or what we are to <hi>perform.</hi> Faith and practice engross the whole of mans duty. <hi>Credenda &amp; agenda</hi> constitute the System of Religion; nor are the Articles of our <hi>Creed</hi> less necessary than the precepts of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>running after a Bubble of our own blowing,</hi> as a late Author phraseth it, <hi>def. &amp; continuat, p.</hi> 326. To discourse the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation we are under to <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Belief.</hi> For as they constitute one entire part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and are bound upon our souls by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57446:94"/>
the same Authority, and under the same penalty with Moral services: So our assent to them and belief of them is not only a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part of that Homage and Fealty we owe to God, but it is introductive of all the other operations and services we exert to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Every distinct act of obedience, supposeth a distinct act of faith with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to some Article or other. So far as we preclude any Article of faith from our Belief, we so far discharge our selves from the practical obedience that emergeth from it. Our obeying the Soveraign will of God, doth not only suppose his Veracity in every Revelation of his will concerning our Duty, but a distinct knowledg and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary assent to the several Articles from which it ariseth, and on which it attends. The Articles of our faith are not like the Theories of Philosophy which no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence obedience; but every <hi>Dogma</hi> in the <hi>Creed</hi> is subservient to, and authoriseth a practical Homage. So far then as Natural Light fals short of being a sufficient measure of the <hi>Credenda</hi> of Religion, so far doth it also fall short of being a Measure of the <hi>Agenda</hi> of it. Is it probable that it should direct us to the conclusions, when it is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the premisses: or that it should
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57446:94"/>
inform us of the superstructures, when it hath no knowledg of the foundation? Though nothing proposed to our belief be repugnant to Reason; yet I hope we do not so far <hi>Socinianize</hi> as to deny but that there are some things above the reach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it. Some Articles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as they have no foundation at all in Nature by which they can be known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, (such are the Doctrines of the Trinity, The Incarnation of the Son of God, The Resurrection of the dead, the Oeconomy of the Spirit, and the whole me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and means of our Recovery by Jesus Christ:) So being most plainly revealed, they exceed the <hi>Grasp</hi> of our minds as to the full comprehending of them. Though Reason be the great <hi>Instrument</hi> by which we come to discern what is Revealed for our belief; yet 'tis no way's the <hi>Formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of believing them. Though we examine the Truth and certainty of Revelation by it, whether such a Declaration be from God, or not; yet it neither is, nor can be the Standard Regulating the things Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. There are other Doctrines, which though as to our perception of them, they have a foundation in Nature, and there be Natural <hi>Mediums</hi> by which they may be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57446:95"/>
discerned; yet such is the present Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pravity of our minds, that without the assistance of a Revelation, they only puzzle, mislead, or leave us sceptical about them. Of this kind are the Articles rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Production and Fabrick of the World; the Origine of Evil; the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humane Nature; the Ingress of Death <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning which never any without a supernatural Revelation attained either to satisfaction or certainty. Much of that Homage and practical obedience which we pay to God, results from Truths depending on meer Revelations. Yea it were not difficult to demonstrate, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there is hardly one Article of Belief so fully and certainly known by Natural Light, as is requisite to a through incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement and practice of vertue, and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vice. A knowledg of the Entrance of sin, the corruption of Nature, our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiousness to Punishment, together with an account of the means provided of God for the Removing of Guilt, and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to a Reconciliation with himself, are absolutely necessary to be understood, in order to the performance of the Duties of the Gospel. On these <hi>Heads</hi> doth the whole of Instituted Religion and Christian
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57446:95"/>
odedience depend. Now whatever dark and uncertain guesses, men through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and improvement of Natural Light may arrive at, as to some of those, yet no one left to the conduct of meer Reason arose ever to any clear perswasion &amp; full certainty about them.<note place="margin">

Forasmuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Natural Light is every way uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of instructing us in these Truths, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows that it can direct us unto none of the Duties which proceed from them. It is a poor Apologie of a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>that intending a comprehensive scheme of the practical Duties of Religion he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omitted articles of meer belief, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the matter and design of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; Def. &amp; Continuat. p.</hi> 326.

            <p n="3">§. 3. Whatsoever appertains to <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> must be referred either to <hi>Worship,</hi> or <hi>Manners.</hi> To one of these branches do all the practical Duties of Religion belong. That which we advance to then in the next place, is, <hi>That the Light of Reason, or the Law of Nature, as it is subjective in man, is no due measure for the Regulating of Divine Worship.</hi> We do not deny but that Natural Light instructs us, That God is to be Worshipped. That there is such a Homage as Worship due from man to God, we need no other Assurance than what our Reason gives us.

Nor upon any other account do they concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one fable requires another to uphold it; and indeed if we should yield them our being under an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation from Nature, for our approaching God by Sacrifices; We must also graunt either the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> or we must substitute some other by which we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to pay our Natural Homage to God. For no supernatural Law can repeal a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. Revelation builds upon the Law of Nature, but can vacate neither the whole, nor any part of it. What-ever Obligation we are under by the <hi>Law</hi> of our Being, is inseparable from, and of the same continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it. But as there are no Rational arguments to engage our belief of the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57446:103"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> that Sacrifices are appointed by the Law of Nature; so we are not destitute of proofs both from Reason and Scripture for the defence of the Negative. But this is not that which I am concerned in, for should the approaching of God by Sacrifices be resolved into the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it doth not at all disserve us; for, as upon the one hand it doth hence plainly follow that the institution of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Hypothesis is immediatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God; He being as much the Author of the Law of Nature, as he is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law prescribed to the world by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation: So it no ways follows upon the other hand, that because the Law of Nature prescribes some parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that therefore it is the measure of all divine Worship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> opinion is theirs, who deduce the Original of Sacrifices from the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary choice of men: who by this arbitrary invention endeavour to express the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full resentments of their minds, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Gods Love and Bounty to them. <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> the only Pagan Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher who hath designedly handled the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Sacrifices, resolve's the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Rise of them into the will and

same purpose. For in matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture naked testimonies signifie only to tell us what men thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ought to be of no further validity to engage our assent, than as they are grounded on proofs and rational motives. Now when we weigh the grounds of this opinion, we meet not with the least thing that can sway a Rational mind to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it.</p>
            <p>They who make Sacrifices an arbitrary invention of men to testifie their Homage to God, have but two things to alledg in confirmation and proof of it. <hi>(First,) That Divine Worship being a Dictate of Humane Nature, and it being agreeable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mankind to express their sense of this Duty by outward Rites and significations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there could be no symbol more natural and obvious to the minds of men, whereby to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their Homage and Thankfulness to the Author of all their happiness, than by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him with some of the choycest por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own gifts in acknowledgment of that bounty and providence that had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them,</hi> Def. &amp; Contin. p. 421. For Answer, I readily graunt it to be a Dictate of Humane Nature, that God ought to be Worshipped; And I withal acknowledg that it is agreeable to the Reason and Sense
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57446:105"/>
of mankind to express their sense of this duty by outward Rites and Significations; nor have any supposed <hi>Thoughts, Words, and Gestures</hi> to be alone a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of that Homage we owe to God. But two things I deny (1.) that precluding supernatural Revelation, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (since the fall) have had any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient assurance that God would accept any Homage and Service from them at all. The principles on which that supposition is raised, are but two, and both of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear that structure that is built upon them. The one is the consideration of the Benefits which the divine Bounty confers on us; but these being blended and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed with so many calamities, with which our lives are attended, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other ends besides the ascertaining his complacency in us, and our performances, for which God in his Wisdom might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, can give us no assurance, either of the acceptation of our persons or servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The other is the consideration of the Divine Goodness; But the consideration of his Justice being as ponderous to the contrary, this is as inept to beget an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our acceptance with God as the former. Conscience through being guilty,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57446:105"/>
being also suspicious, will hinder us in our expecting any thing from the Divine Goodness, by continually objecting his justice to us. But supposing we were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furnished with <hi>Notices</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine placability, and that he will accept a Homage from us; yet it still remains to be proved, that precluding a supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation we have any rational ground of belief that he will approve our manner of approach to him by Sacrifices. I know no perfection in the Divine Being to which they are Naturally suited; It is true I find a Late Author insinuating that the Religion of Sacrifices <hi>flows from the Nature and the Attributes of God, requiring no other disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very than the Light, and no other determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than the choice of natural Reason, def. and continuat. p.</hi> 427, 428. But I would fain know what property in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, the Religion of Sacrifices flows from. God is not capable of being fed or refreshed by the scent and smoke of them.<note place="margin">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57446:106"/>
to it is indissoluble, nor can we be superceded the performance of it. And by consequence the Worshipping of God by Sacrifices should both have obliged man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the state of innocencie, and doth still indispensably oblige us: Nor can the Christian Institution vacate any Duty that flows from the Nature of God.</p>
            <p>Indeed the mysterious and gracious Counsels of Gods will in reference to our recovery from Wrath by the Sacrifice of his Son, which he designed the bringing into light and the giving the world instruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by this Medium, render our being found in this Method of address to God, while the end proposed in it continued, very rational and justifiable; but abstracting from that, the mind of man can not entertain a more silly and ludicrous thought, than that we should thereby honour God in a due and suitable way. That we should adore and magnifie the Goodness and bounty of God in all the benefits we partake of; and that we should use them soberly and discreetly improving them into motives of cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, humility and advantages of service both in communicating to the wants of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and being the more alacrous in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience our selves, hath the authorisation of

               <hi>The Second thing produced in proof that Sacrifices took their beginning from Humane Agreement, is because there appears not any shadow of command for them,</hi> when they were first practised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to say that the <hi>expression of worship by Sacrifices was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57446:107"/>
and <hi>in terminis</hi> recorded, 'tis enough that it be colligible from the Scripture. I know no Logick that will allow the sequel, That because the command of a thing is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred in so many words, that therefore the thing it self is not of Divine Original. The Reverend Person, who reviewed and animadverted on the <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> told him, that <hi>there was an Institution for the offering and burning Incense only with sacred fire taken from the Altar, and that the Priests were consumed with fire from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for the neglect of it: Yet there is no express command in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where that Institution is</hi> in terminis <hi>Recorded,</hi> p. 272. This our late Author takes no Notice of in his <hi>Def.</hi> &amp; <hi>Contin.</hi> but passeth it in deep silence, as he doth all the most material things in the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I shall only subjoyn one instance more to the same purpose. The Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Christian or First day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, will be allowed I suppose to have a Warrant in the Revelation of the Word, yet there is not in the whole Gospel a Command in express <hi>Terms</hi> for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. There is indeed a precept in the Decalogue for the observance of one day in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57446:107"/>
Seven as a Holy Sabbath to the Lord; and there is an express determination founded on Gods Resting from his Works, for the keeping the last day of the <hi>Hebdomadal</hi> Revolution during the Old Testament Oeconomy, as a day of Sacred Rest. There are also various Arguments taken from the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things in and by Christ; his <hi>Finishing</hi> and <hi>Resting</hi> from all the <hi>Works</hi> of the New <hi>Creation</hi> in and by his Resurrection; his declaring that a Day of Rest accommodated to his <hi>own ceasing</hi> from his Works, remains now for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Together with the <hi>Apostolical</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the First Day of the week as a Sabbath to the Lord; God's blessing his People in their attendance on him from time to time on that Day; <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising it with the Name of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> &amp;c. All which do evince the change of the Day from the <hi>Seventh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>First,</hi> to be of Heavenly Original, and founded in Divine Authority: Yet there is not a Command <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the whole Sacred Code and Register for it. In a matter of so great antiquity as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices when the Lord instructed his Church by Dreams, Visions, mental Impressions, audible voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To affirm that there
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57446:108"/>
was no Divine Command for the Religion of Sacrifices, because the Command is not expresly delivered, is a very unwary and bold assertion. It is enough for us if we can demonstrate that they acted not herein without a Divine Warrant, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assign the manner in which it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; and this we hope to make good to the satisfaction of all sober inquirers, but to satisfie Scepticks and prejudic'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who have no mind to be convinced, is more than any man can undertake.</p>
            <p>The third Opinion then concerning the Original of Sacrifices, is theirs who deduce them from the Institution of God himself. And as this is the common sentiment of Protestant Divines, so 'tis attended with as much evidence as the Nature of a <hi>Thing</hi> at so great a distance doth require. The <hi>First</hi> Argument in confirmation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution of Sacrifices may be fetcht from the <hi>Antediluvian distinction of clean and unclean Animals,</hi> Gen. 7.2. <hi>Of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clean Beast thou shalt take to thee by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Male and his Female; and of Beasts that are not clean by two,</hi>

but that some Animals were allowed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, others not.

the <hi>Species</hi> of Creatures they were to present him.

The <hi>second</hi> Argument for the Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacrifices, may be taken from the consideration of their acceptance with God. And this may be prosecuted (1) with respect to the acceptation that the Offerers promised themselves with the Lord in and by them; or (2) with respect to their being <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>a sweet savour,</hi> or an odour of sweetness unto the Lord. (1.) 'Tis certain that mankind proposed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves acceptance with God in and by them; and without such a perswasion they would never have engaged in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. Now this they could have no indubitable certainty of, without a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural revelation: <hi>For who hath known the mind of the Lord,</hi> Rom. 11.34. Nor was it enough (as a late Author would make us believe, <hi>Eccl. Polit. p.</hi> 100.) to ascertain the Lords being well pleased with them, <hi>because they presented him with a portion of the best and most precious things
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57446:109"/>
they had.</hi> For <hi>First</hi>; This could give them no assurance that the offering these things by destroying them, would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. There being other wayes in which they might be improved to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and that more congruously to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and the Relation of Rational Creatures which we stood in to him. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> by a parity of Reason, they should have offered themselves in the same manner, being as much indebted to God for their own Beings, as for any other fruits of his Bounty. And as I question not but that Humane Sacrifices entred in a great measure at this Door, so I know no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son if there be any solidity in this plea, but that they are justifiable by the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. We cannot but apprehend that, whenever any Religious action is to be performed, the mind will be in suspense whether it ought to be done or not. Let us then suppose the first commencers of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to God by Sacrifice, deliberating what they were to do. The Reasons in this case influencing their minds, behoved either to leave them in suspence about it; and if so, they ought wholly to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born it, it being better to forbear a thing out of fear to offend God, than to put it to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57446:110"/>

Or the Reasons impeaching the thing as bad were the more ponderous; and if so, then granting the thing never so excellent in it self, it were a crime to do it. For to commit what we judge offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to the Deity, tramples as much on the Respect we owe to God, as if the thing it self were in the number of what is most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable to him.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57446:111"/>
insisted only upon this, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not, see <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. &amp; 32.35. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3. All which seem abundantly to witness that worship of humane device or contrivement is of an unpleasing resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God; and by consequence, the Religion of Sacrifices being of a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto the Lord, another original must be assigned it than mens own device and choyce. The <hi>Third</hi> Argument in proof of the <hi>Divine Institution</hi> of Sacrifices, may be fetcht from the consideration of that peace, welfare, inward consolation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in the adoration of God by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sacrifices, all mankkind, especially the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> proposed to themselves. There is in all men a Natural Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin, with an apprehension of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Vengeance due for it. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all their addresses to the Deity, they endeavoured the procuring the pardon of sin, and peace with God, and the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort in their own Consciences. This must be at least the subordinate end of the whole Religion of Sinners; nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do they act rationally with respect to the estate they know themselves in. Now they must promise themselves the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these <hi>things,</hi> either in the vertue
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57446:111"/>
of the Action it self, or else through the application of some promise of God enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling them to such mercies upon a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of such services. If the <hi>Latter,</hi> then Sacrifices must necessarily be of a Heavenly Original. For where the Thing <hi>signified</hi> depends upon the alone Will and Pleasure of God, there the <hi>Symbol</hi> and sign of it depends upon his sole Will and Institution also. Though the sign materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally may have a Being in Nature, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally considered as 'tis the representation of such a gracious design, and of such a voluntary and free benefit; 'tis perfect nonsence to imagine that Natural Light can give any direction about it. But if they expected pardon of sin, and peace with God, and in their own Consciences from the bare Action it self, and in the vertue of the meer offering; They did that (1) which God expresly declares his abhorrence of. The Lord upon all occasions testifies his Detestation of Sacrifices, when Trusted to for Reconciliation and Remission of sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.6. &amp; 50.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.

            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument in justification of our assertion concerning the Rise of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices from the Institution of God, I take from that of the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4 <hi>By Faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain &amp;c. Abel and Cain</hi> may be reckon'd among the First that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57446:112"/>
made their approach to God by Sacrifice: At least the first Notice we have of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by this <hi>Medium</hi> of Worship is in them. And the Reason here a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>igned by the Holy Ghost, why the Lord when he rejected the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain</hi> had regard to that of <hi>Abel,</hi> is, <hi>because Abel offered his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by Faith.</hi> If we can then evince that the Faith here spoken of had respect unto the Testimony, Revealing, Commanding and Promising to accept them in that way of Homage and address; we shall in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fully demonstrate that Sacrifices owe not their rise to Humane choice, but that they began upon the Warrant of a Divine Institution and precept. This we shall therefore attempt to make good by two Topicks. <hi>First,</hi> The Faith attributed to <hi>Abel,</hi> from which he receives the testimony of having offered an acceptable Sacrifice to God; must be of such a Nature and kind to which the Definition of Faith <hi>verse</hi> 1. may agree. The Apostles Description of Faith in the first <hi>vers,</hi> is, that which he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intends for the Regulation of the several Instances of it in the whole ensuing part of the chapter. Let us view then the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith there laid down, and we shall find it to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57446:113"/>
the Apostle expresly affirms it to be. (2.) The Faith ascribed to <hi>Abel</hi> is of the same Nature and kind with the Faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom the Apostle here mentions. Whereas then the Faith of every other Worthy recorded in the Chapter, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly suppose a Divine Revelation as that on which 'tis bottom'd, and by which 'tis warranted; If we will speak coherently, we must likewise acknowledg that <hi>Abels</hi> Faith had the same Authority to rest on. Not onely the tenour of the Apostles whole discourse induceth us to this belief, but we have a plain testimony, <hi>verse</hi> 39. to indubitate it to us, <hi>All these having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good Report through Faith, received not the promise.</hi> The same kind of Faith is predicated of all. And by their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the actual exhibition of the thing promised, which is the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is plainly intimated that they had a Divine Command or Promise to rest on in all these exercises of Faith there celebrated. A <hi>fift</hi> Argument in Confirmation of the Divine Original of Sacrifices might be taken from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that <hi>every Priest ought to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and that no man taketh this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto himself, but he that is called of

God,</hi> Heb. 5.1.4. and consequently that the Patriarchs were authorised of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they had never assumed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Office, which they did by their offering Sacrifices, these <hi>two</hi> being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</hi> But I find I have been already too prolix upon this head, and they who can withstand the force of the fore-going Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not like to be influenced by any thing I am further able to subjoyne.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. We have already shewn that the whole of Obedience which we owe to God, belongs either to Worship or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: We have also declared the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of <hi>Natural Light</hi> for the Regulating of <hi>Worship.</hi> Our next task is to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the defectiveness of it as to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of <hi>Manners.</hi> Manners are either such Duties as in themselves are acceptable and good, or such as derive all their goodness from a Command; with respect to the <hi>first,</hi> revealed Laws are only <hi>declarative</hi> of the goodness of the Duty; The Absolute Bonity of it having an antecedent founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Nature of God, the Nature of man, and the Relation that man stands in to God. But with reference to the <hi>second,</hi> supernatural Law is <hi>constitutive</hi> of the <hi>goodness</hi> of the Duty: There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57446:114"/>
in the thing it self previous to the Command rendring it so: And here though obedience be a Moral Duty, yet the Law prescribing it is not properly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law. For the Morality of Obedience ariseth not from the Nature of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but from the Relation we stand in to God, and the Dependence we have on him; whereas the Morality of Law hath its Reason in the Nature of God, and the congruity or incongruity of things enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forbidden, to it. That there are acts of Obedience distinct from Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which yet are not properly acts of Worship, might be demonstrated by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable instances. Of this kind there are several Duties founded in personal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whereby none were obliged, but onely they to whom they were immediatly given. Such was the Duty of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> leaving his Fathers House, being built on a precept wherein he only was concerned. The like may be said of the Obligation laid on the young man in the Gospel of <hi>selling all that he had,</hi> &amp;c. Of this sort also there are several Duties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from Divine Laws which concerned only a particular Nation, and yet emerged not from Laws properly <hi>Ritual.</hi> Of which
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57446:115"/>
number we may reckon the Obligations proceeding from the <hi>Judicials</hi> given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> at least where the Reason of them was not Natural Equity. By these Laws they came under Obligations that the rest of man-kind were not concerned in. Yea they became bound to some things which setting aside the positive Law of God, could not have been lawfully done; and which at this day no Nation or Person can practice with Innocency, <hi>viz. The Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Widow of a Brother, dead without Issue.</hi> Such Laws Gods Dominion over all men as his Creatures, authoriseth him to make, and that as a proof of his own ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Prerogative, and for tryal of his Creatures obedience. Nor did God ever leave man since he first Created him singly to the Law of Nature for the payment of that Homage he owes him; but even to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency he thought fit to give a positive Law; a Law, which for the matter of it, had no foundation at all in Mans Nature; further than that he was obliged by his Nature to do whatsoever God enjoyned him. Now these Laws having their foundation in Institution, not in Nature: The Reason of them being not so much the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, as his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi>;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57446:115"/>
Natural Light can no ways be suppos'd a due measure of them, nor able to instruct about them. <hi>All that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that resolves into the Will of God, must suppose Revelation in that nothing else can discover its Obligation to man-kind</hi>; saith a late Author, <hi>Def. &amp; continuat.</hi> p. 427. How consistently to himself in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he tells that <hi>all Religion consists in nothing else but the practice of Vertue; and that the practice of Vertue consists in living suitably to the dictates of Reason and Nature</hi>; I leave to himself to declare. That there are positive Laws of God now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that in the vertue of them, we are under Obligation to several Duties: I shall, God willing, evince when I come to shew the insufficiency of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it's Objective in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as to being the measure of the whole Obedience we owe to God.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. That there are Natural Laws as well as positive; and that the latter are but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions to the former, we have else-where demonstrated. Now these Laws being stiled Natural, <hi>non respectu Objecti,</hi> not because of their object, many of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we are under the Sanction of by them referring immediatly to God; but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57446:116"/>
principii &amp; medii per quod cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> because communicated to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cognoscible by Natural Light. If the Light of Nature alone be of signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy in any thing, 'tis here. And indeed the Writings of Heathen Philosophers such as <hi>Aristotle, Plato, Epictetus, Seneca, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Cicero, Hierocles, Plotinus,</hi> &amp;c. The Laws of Pagan Common-wealths, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Republicks of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; the vertuous actions of persons not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Revelation, of all ranks and qualities, such as <hi>Socrates, Aristides, Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, Cato,</hi> and many others not easie to be recounted, shew that men left to the meer conduct of Natural Light can attain a better insight into the Duties of Nature, than of Religion, and know more of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue than of Piety. For, as both <hi>Amyrald</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Wolseley,</hi> besides others, observe, <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote to better purpose in his books <hi>de officiis,</hi> than he did in those <hi>de Naturâ Deorum.</hi> Yea, even the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> the great Refiners of Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, who in stead of obscene and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous usages, introduced civil and modest Rites; discoursed much better of Vertue than Divinity. Their Sentiments for the conduct of conservation being for the most
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57446:116"/>
part Rational and Generous, whereas their Theological Notions are either obscure, uncertain, or romantick. If we be then able to prove that Natural Light, or the Law of Nature as it is subjective in man since the Fall, is no sufficient measure of Moral Duties, or of those Duties we are under the Sanction of by the Law of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, we shall get one step farther in our design; namely, that Natural Light is a very inadaequate measure of Religion.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of this, I might in the <hi>first</hi> place take notice; how the great preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the conduct of Reason prevaricated in all those prime Laws of Nature which Relate to the Unity of the God-head. Though not onely the Being, but the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Nature be witnessed to by every mans Reason, and we need one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise our faculties against <hi>Polytheism</hi> as well as <hi>Atheism</hi>: Yet the Universality of man-kind, setting aside those who had the benefit of a supernatural Revelation, not onely sunk into the belief and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a plurality of Gods; but into the worshipping those for Gods, whom to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg for such is more irrational than to believe that there is none at all. There was scarcely any thing animate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate,

it the more probable opinion. And they who seem to be most positive concerning it, describe the Rewards and Punishments of that future state under such silly and wilde Notions, as could have no great influence upon mens lives.

And indeed though every mans Reason may tell him that there is some future condition abiding us beyond this world; yet such a knowledge as may indubitate us concerning it, and give us such an acquaintance with the Nature and quality of the Rewards and Punishments of it, as may make us contemn the pleasures of life, chuse Vertue when we see it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with the greatest calamities, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void evil when we find prosperity attending it; Reason could never have helpt us to.

            <p>I shall in the <hi>fourth place</hi> endeavour to shew the insufficiency of Natural Light, as to the being the measure of the whole obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we owe to God, according to the Law of Creation. By demonstrating its

The <hi>Cyprians</hi> permitted young women to prostitute their bodies for the raising themselves portions. The <hi>Cretians</hi> made a Law to countenance Sodomie, nor doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> (mentioning it) discommend it. The <hi>Romans</hi> gave husbands liberty to kill their wives upon very frivolous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. And allowed Creditors not only to slay their Debtors, but to Torment them to death when they could not pay them. The <hi>Persians</hi> authorised Fathers to marry their own Daughters, and Mothers their Sons. Both the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> made it lawful for Brothers to match with their Sisters. The Laws of the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Among some of the <hi>Indians</hi> their Princes are not permitted the conjugal embraces of their wifes, till their Priests have deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. <hi>Plato</hi> was for establishing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of women in his Commonwealth. Both <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> could make a trade of their wifes chastity, and let them out for gain and profit. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides several others recommend Revenge not only as just and lawful, but as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> overthrew true patience which consist's in an humble acquiescence in the will of God, by stating it in an unpracticable <hi>Apathie.</hi> For Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lies not in confronting calamities and sinister accidents by a wilful stupidity; but in deeply sensing them, yet bearing them with a due Reverence and submission to the Soveraignty and wisdome of God who sends and order's them. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on which their indifferency as to all forreign contingencies, and seeming bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very under the most importunate evils bore; <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> not within the confines of our power, and that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at them would be unprofitable; are too weak for the structure of true patience to be raised on. For it is not enough that we do not repine, because it will not availe us;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57446:122"/>
but we are to forbear murmuring because it is unlawful. Nor is it sufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie submission, because the things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our power to alter, but we ought to acquiesce in them, because they are the effects of a righteous providence, and carry in them a design of Love and Grace, if we do not defeat them. Humility, one of the most excellent and useful vertues, hath not so much as a Room in all the Ethicks of the Philosophers: yea pride is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst their chiefest vertues. The consideration of the infinite perfections of the first Being, and our dependence on him both as to life and all the benefits of it, should make us contract and shrink into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whensoever we compare our selves with God. Much more should the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of sin and guilt, familiarize us to self-abasement and prostration. But alas! As man in general never more esteem'd himself, than since he was miserable: So they that have least to be proud of, are most conceited. Of all men the Philosophers abounded in self-esteem and boasting, and that not only to a degree of immodesty, but impudence. As if it had not been enough for the Beggarly <hi>Stoick</hi> to vaunt himself the only Rich Man, and that he alone was
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57446:123"/>
noble, he did not only vie perfection with God, but preferr'd himself before him. The <hi>Indian Brachmans</hi> vouched themselves for Gods; Yea the very <hi>Academicks</hi> who professed they knew nothing; and the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> who made it a great part of their business to deride the pride of others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in self-esteem. To this Pride which universally possest them, I judge two things to have contributed exceedingly.

Shall I add in the next place, that the Authority of Princes stood upon very unsafe terms, if the Obedience of Subjects were to be Regulated by the opinions of Philosophers. There is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had we nothing to conduct us in our Obedience and Loyalty, but the sentiments of Philosophers, no Prince could be secure either of his life or dignity. The last <hi>Instance</hi> wherein the Philosophers miserably prevaricated in a Matter of plain Morality, that I shal mention, is, their allowing an <gap reason="foreign">

The first cause is the ultimate end of every Being; of and through whom we are, to him we ought to be and act. Seeing God is our Creator, Proprietor, Governour, and Happiness, all our actions ought to be directed to the glorifying of him. Now
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57446:125"/>
where are any among the Heathen Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, or among those that acted under the conduct of meer Reason, who proposed as the end of their Actions the glory of God. Their opinions about the <hi>Finis ultimus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> with reference to which <hi>Varro</hi> tells us there were 288 Sects of Philosophers, do abundantly evidence their faileur in this particular. Some made Vertue subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent onely to their own praise, applause and glory. What the <hi>Poet</hi> says of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s killing his own Sons, when they intended to overthrow the liberty of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<q>Vicit amor patriae laudumque immensa cupido;</q>
Is the most that can be pleaded as the aim of a great many of them. Others pursued Vertue in order to pleasure, and onely admired it on that account. Now supposing the pleasures they proposed to themselves were not so gross and sensual as is generally conceived, (though I know not how to acquit the School of <hi>Epicurus</hi> in this matter, notwithstanding all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies that are made for them) yet their opinion is sufficiently culpable, in that they confounded the <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of the

Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely the Will of God, but his Nature requires, that what-ever derives from him, either as its <hi>idea</hi> or source, should be ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately resolved and terminated in him as its Center. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is most false that either Habit or Act can be Rationally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, or finally rested in for it self: But ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some benefit to our selves and friends, or the honor and glory of some other must

be proposed and intended by them. For as all Habits are desired in reference to actions and operations, so if in every action we design not an end in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which we so act, we declare our selves brutish and irrational.

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:57446:128"/>I crave also to have it observed, That the Decalogue may be considered either as it is a meer Draught and Delineation of the Law of Creation; or as having annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it a Remedial Law, to which in its most exacting Rigor it was made subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Though the Law of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments for the matter and substance of it be one and the same with the Law of Creation; being in this respect only <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio antiquae Legis,</hi> not <hi>Latio novae</hi>; and still Natural with reference to the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, though positive as to the manner of the promulgation: Yet, as given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> there is a Law of Grace couched in it, which no wise appertain'd to it as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated at first with our Natures. Hence the Lord in the very Preface of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, treats with them as their God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> as their everlasting Benefactor, which in the Vertue of the Covenant of Works, and in Reference to the meer Law of Creation, he neither was, nor could be since the first ingress of sin. In this sense <hi>David</hi> takes the Law in most of his <hi>Encomiums</hi> of it. And in this accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I acknowledge the Law to be the measure of all the main Duties which we owe to God, either in the way of Natural,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57446:128"/>
or Instituted Religion. It is true there are some Duties of peculiar New-Testament institution; but those as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a subordinate Nature to the great demands of the Law of Faith, being chiefly stipulations of our performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it; So both the constituting &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them had been unsuitable to the Old Testament oeconomie. The like may be said concerning those obligations which we are manumitted and set free from, which the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Church were under the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of.</p>
            <p>That which I undertake the Justification of is this, that the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as it is a meer transcript of the Law of nature, or right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is not the measure of the whole of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor, as it is Christian, of the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous parts of it. Nor can the contrary be affirmed without renouncing of the Gospel, which I am afrai'd too many, as being weary of it, are ready to doe. For, <hi>First,</hi> if the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as it is a meer new Edition of the Original Law of nature, be the sole and only Measure of Religion, then the New Covenant is nothing but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Old. Yea, there is no such thing as a New Covenant with respect to the Terms of it, onely it is so called with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57446:129"/>
respect to the manner of its Promulgation. For where the Terms and conditions vary not, neither do the Covenants vary. 'Tis their differing in their Demands, that gives them the Denomination of distinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. To assert a coincidency as to the whole preceptive part betwixt the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, is in effect to bid us disclaim a great part of the Bible. What tendency some expressions of a late Author have this way, I shall refer to the judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>As in the State of Innocence the whole Duty of man consisted in the practice of all those Moral Vertues, that arose from his Natural Relation to God and man; so all that is superinduced upon us since the fall, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but helps and contrivances to supply our Natural defects and restore us to better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to discharge those duties we stand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to by the Law of our Nature, and the design of our Creation. &amp;c. def. &amp; contin. p.</hi> 315, 316. <hi>The supposition of sin does not bring in any New Religion, but only makes new circumstances and names of old things, and requires new helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to improve our Powers, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Endeavours: And thus is the Law of Grace nothing but a Restitution of the Law of Nature; ibid. p.</hi> 324. <hi>Secondly</hi> there are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57446:129"/>
several duties incumbent now upon us, which also constitute the chief part of our Christian Obedience, that the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as 'its a transcript of the Law of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is perfectly a stranger to. For proof of this I shall only insist on <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> towards God, and <hi>Faith</hi> towards Jesus Christ. I suppose it will be granted by most, that Repentance in all the parts and branches of it, <hi>viz.</hi> conviction of sin, Contrition for it, and conversion to God from it, are Duties we are all under the obligation of. I said by <hi>most,</hi> because of some expressions in a late Author which I can hardly reconcile with the account which the Scripture gives us of Repentance, or with that modesty which we ought to exercise in the things of God. <hi>The Fathers &amp; first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Christian Faith, did not fill peoples heads, with scruples about the due degrees of Godly sorrow, and the certain symptoms of a through-Humiliation; def. &amp; contin. p.</hi> 306, 307. And a little after, <hi>They</hi> (says he, meaning the Noncomformists) <hi>examine the truth and reality of mens conversion by their orderly passage through all the stages of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; And unless a man be able to give an account of having observed and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in himself all their imaginary Rules &amp;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57446:130"/>
Methods of Regeneration, (i. e. conviction and contrition</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>they immediately call into question his being a Child of God, and affright him with sad stories of having mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried of Grace and the New-Creature; And he is lost and undone for ever unless he begin all the work of conversion anew, and he must as it were re-enter into the Womb, &amp; again pass through all the scenes &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of conviction; in which state of forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all new converts must continue the</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, <hi>and when</hi> the days are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, <hi>they may then proceed to the next operation of the Spirit, i. e. to get a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, panting, and breathing frame of soul, upon which follows the proper season of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and they may then break loose from the Enclosures of the Spirit of Bondage, and creep out from those dark Retirements, wherein the Law detain'd them, into the light of the Gospel and the liberty of the Spirit of Adoption: p.</hi> 309, 310. However I can justifie the forementioned steps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Repentance both by Scripture and Reason. Now this, the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as 'tis a meer summary of the Law of Nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know's nor allow's; I confess the Law of Creation obliging us to love God with all our Heart, Soul and Strength, and in all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57446:130"/>
things to approve our selves perfect before him, doth by consequence in case of the least faileur oblige us to sorrow. And thus men wholly strangers to the renueing grace of the Covenant may repent: witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others <hi>Judas</hi> as to the act of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christ.</hi> But to encourage us thereunto by any promise of acceptance, without which no man will ever be found in the due practice of it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Or administer help for the performance of it; this it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, promiseth, nor can do or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. For being once violated, it know's no other language but the thundring of wrath against the transgressour. Now one and the same Covenant can not be capable of two such contrary clauses, as denouncing an inevitable curse on whosoever shall not observe the Law in all points, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing mercy to those that repent of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions which the do commit. They like may be said of Faith. This is the great condition of the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. One of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Duties we are now obliged to; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. Now this as 'tis the condition of Gospel-pardon, the Law is utterly unacquainted with; know's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of it. It is true there is a general
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57446:131"/>
Faith terminating on the Existence, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Veracity of God, which comes under the Sanction of the Law of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But Faith, as respecting a Mediator, and Gods treating with us through him, the Law is both ignorant of, and at enmity with, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of Faith,</hi> Rom. 9.32, 33. Israel <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness; wherefore, because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be upon this account, because Faith comes not smoothly enough within the compass of being a Moral Vertue, that a late Author is pleas'd to scoff at Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, not only by stiling it in mockage, <hi>the dear darling Article of the Religion of Sinners,</hi> Def. &amp; Contin. p. 322. but by representing what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every-where ascribes to it in such terms of Drollery, Scorn, and Contempt; that I tremble to transcribe them. <hi>They make</hi> (says he) <hi>a grievous noise of the LORD CHRIST, tell fine Romances of the secret amours betwixt the believing Soul and the LORD CHRIST, and prodigious stories of the miraculous feats of FAITH in the LORD CHRIST; Reproof to the Rehears.

            <p>And if this answer be not thought suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57446:133"/>
I dare undertake to produce as many testimonies out of the Platonists for the acquisition of Vertue as for the infusion of it; which argues that they were wholly at a loss about the attainment of it; And that they alledged a Divine Communication of it, not because of any foundation they had in the light of Nature for such a persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but because they knew not how else to satisfie themselves in their enquiries about the adeption of it. 'Tis true, all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers contend for objective helps, by which we may be excited to exert our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength for the adeption of Vertue; but for any active subjective Principle of it besides connate ability, they were so far from allowing it, that they lookt upon it as rather meriting scorn and laughter. Yea those very objective helps which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, were nothing else but the effects of their faculties, improving Natural Light and the first principles of Reason. Hence <hi>Seneca</hi> having said that <hi>we are more indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Philosophy than to the Gods, for as much as we owe only our lives to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are obliged to Philosophy that we live vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>; he adds, <hi>cujus scientiam</hi> (puta Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophiae) <hi>nulli dederunt, facultatem omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, whereof they have communicated the

Now for as much as this seems a charge of very great consequence, if it be found true, we shall search a little the more into his own writings for the proof of it.

Others may perhaps reckon it for proof enough, that there are divers expressions scattered up and down his writings, which seem calculated for no other end, but to reflect tacit scorn and contempt upon the Spirit of God and his Work on the minds of men; such is that passage, Eccl.

If these expressions, being duely consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do not justifie what I have entred in charge against the said Author, I shall be ready not only to acknowledg my own ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in judging of the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the commonest proposition, but to crave him pardon for having injured him in a matter of so great import, and to such a degree. Surely, if Grace be not a matter of <hi>pure infusion,</hi> as our Author expresly affirms that it is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it can be nothing but an effect of our Essential powers, and of the improvement of our Reasons and Natural abilities. There is no other way besides one of these two, in which it can be obtained. To pretend any special Energy of the Holy Ghost in the production of Grace, distinct from an <hi>infusion</hi> of a new principle determining, elevating, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapting our faculties to concur as vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57446:137"/>
in the performance of those acts, to which they were antecedently inept, is to allow Him at most but a Moral influence, which consists only in Objective Motives, in the begetting of it. 'Tis true, greater external helps do even in this respect fall to the share of those who live under the Gospel, than the Heathen were priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. The inducements to Vertue laid down in the word, vastly exceeding those proposed by Philosophers. But as for any active inward principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, There can be none according to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of our Author besides Natural Power. Again, <hi>If Graces be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise attained, than skill in Languages, the art of Eloquence and Rhetorique are; and if that be the reason why in propriety of speech, those ought not now to be called Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no more than these ought to be stiled Gifts</hi>; as our Author plainly affirms: It necessarily follows, that the only Principle of Grace and of all the obedience that proceeds from it, is nothing else but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power, and connate ability of mind; for as much as no man lays claim to any higher principle for the acquisition of Arts but his Faculties.

nor are any infused principles pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as necessary thereunto. The Blessing of God upon our studies and endeavours, implies no such thing as the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Habits, of Learning and Science to us, but is by all that I know of, otherwise sensed and explained. Though this one passage be enough to lay open the mind of the foresaid Author in this matter; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to discover some mens sentiments is sufficient to refute them; for as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith in a like case, <hi>Ecclesiae victoria est vos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the right perception of things, and by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a fuller evidence and stronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Truths, ibid.</hi> p. 334. Though any learned person will easily discover the drift and intendment of this passage, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so proposed, and containing such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of truth and falshood bended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that 'tis difficult for a common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to discern the leaven and poysonous ferment that is wrapt up in it; I shall take a farther survey of it. There are some men so accustomed to twist and interweave things of a heterogeneal nature one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that it requires considerable skill to make a due separation and disposal of the several ingredients of their compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what they are shapen and designed to subserve. In the <hi>first</hi> place, I know none of all the Assertors of supernatural infused Grace, who pretend the overthrow of the Rules of Reason and Sobriety by Gods working immediatly and effectually upon the Souls of men. We attribute no such violent motion to Gods Spirit upon ours, as overthrow our powers and faculties. By a Communication of a vital principle, the Soul is attempered in its inward frame to the things its moved to. Through the introduction of the New Nature, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

are connaturalized to their duty. The Soul being irradiated with a Divine Light, and having a new strength trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into it, is carried to its object out of choice, and upon conviction. Nor do I know any in the <hi>second</hi> place that preclude the use of promises and threatnings, or who affirm that the Spirit of God in the Regeneration and Renovation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, acts abstractedly from, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently on the Word. No; the dispensation of the Word, is <hi>Gods power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation</hi>; the <hi>vehiculum spiritûs,</hi> the Chariot of the Spirit; the Seal by which he impresseth his Image. An attendence to the Reading and Preaching of it, is what they press every man earnestly to, and that all impulses be examined by it. That which I except against in this <hi>Paragraph</hi> of our <hi>Author,</hi> is this, that all allowed to the Spirit of God in his dealing with the Souls of men, is, that he acts only <hi>Objectively</hi> in ministring Arguments of Conviction to them: For that was the alone end of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that is our Authors intendment by the <hi>Spirits proceeding in an humane way.</hi> Now this supposeth the whole <hi>subjective</hi> power to reside naturally in our selves, and that all the assistances of the Spirit, serve only to excite it, and to awaken us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert

            <p>We readily grant that the Arguments proposed in the Scripture, may in a certain sense be stiled Grace, but what affinity hath this to the inward ingraft principle that we are inquiring after? It were too plain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the Gospel to renounce all inward Grace in express Terms; and yet as some, who seem to extoll grace exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, explain it, no less is intended.

Before we come to inquire, <hi>how far Natural Abilities se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the assistance not only of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of Revelation, may carry men in Practical Obedience.</hi> There are several things of great import, both for the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Divine <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and the convincing us of our <hi>Guilt,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any <hi>Impotency</hi> which we labour naturally under, which I design a little to unfold as well as to propose. <hi>First</hi> then;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithstanding any Congenite Original impotency that men labour under, They might do more in the discharge and performance of the Duties of practical obedience, were it not for contracted Evil Habits and customs.</hi> Custom in any thing is commonly stiled another Nature, and not much amiss, the power and efficacy of it being so great. <gap reason="foreign">

Much of our Impotency to good is derived upon us by a familiarity with sin. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian <hi>change his skin? or the</hi> Leopard <hi>his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do Evil,</hi> Jer. 13.23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:57446:142"/>Secondly, <hi>They that have the Gospel are thereby brought into a considerable capacity of doing more than they that want it can.</hi> Nor do I mean this only extensively, that they are instructed about those duties whereof these are wholly Ignorant. For in that case God will proceed with men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of light that every one hath; and as <hi>Austin</hi> says of those with whom the knowledg of Christ and the Gospel never arrived, <hi>veniam habebunt propter infidelitatem, damnabuntur ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> propter peccata contra naturam</hi>; and a greater than <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>That as many as sinned without Law, shall also perish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. But I understand it with relation to those very Duties which the Heathen had some light concerning, and various helps for the performance of. For with respect to these, We, unto whom the Light of the glorious Gospel is come, have advantages infinitely beyond them who never enjoy'd that vouchsafement. The Declaration of our Duty is more clear as well as full. The Religion of Nature, and precepts of Moral goodness are unfolded with more perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and plenitude in the Scriptures, than in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57446:142"/>
any, or all the writings of the Philosophers. Moral Vertues were never so established by the Light of Reason, as they are by the Laws of the Gospel. Here is no crooked line, no impure mixture, nor Vice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded for vertue. In a word, 'tis only the Bible that gives us a compleat systeme of the Laws of Nature, and therefore, we who live under the dispensation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, have an advantage even of Moral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ministred unto us, that the Pagan world never had. Our Obedience is also endeared to us by nobler promises than the Pagan Philosophers were ever made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se promises are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the motives of credibility. 'Tis likewise enforc'd under severer penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than either <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer</hi> in their Romantick description of <hi>Tartarus</hi> ever dream'd of. Nor is there in all the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> such an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and incentive to practical Obedience, as the incarnation of the Son of God is; nor such a matchless pattern of Universal Vertue, as the life of the ever blessed Jesus sets before us. So that upon the whole, we, who have the light of the Scripture, are more inexcusable in our faileurs and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in our miscarriages, than those who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57446:143"/>
under the conduct of meer Reason were capable of being.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>How great soever the inability derived to, and entayl'd upon us by the Fall be, yet no man ever did what he might have done.</hi> We complain of weakness, but who acts the power he is imbued with? We palliate our disobedience by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Impotency, but where is the man that ever exerted to the utmost the strength he had? We put fallacies upon our Souls by seeming to bewayle our want of strength, when in the mean time we neglect to exercise the Ability we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with. Though we cannot accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably perform obedience, save from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed principle, yet may we not be found in the discharge of the Material part of Duties? Though we cannot act <hi>holily</hi> as Saints, yet we may act <hi>Rationally</hi> as Men. Though we be meerly passive in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the first Grace, yet may we not be found in an exercise of means prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in order to it. We may read the <hi>Bible</hi> as well as a <hi>Romance,</hi> and hear a <hi>Sermon</hi> as well as see a <hi>Play.</hi> Do we serve the <hi>Providence</hi> of God for the obtaining of outward <hi>supplies,</hi> and may we not serve his <hi>promise</hi> for the receiving of <hi>Grace</hi>? Can
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57446:143"/>
we ask <hi>bread</hi> of God, and can we not beg his <hi>Spirit</hi>? It will be then seasonable to plead our weakness, when we have acted up to the utmost of our strength. Where is the man that can acquit himself from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, which he might have prevented, and Commissions which he might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. As for the Heathen Philosophers, some of which are thought to have acted Natural Abilities to the utmost of what (with no better objective helps) they could arrive at; it were no difficult undertaking to demonstate, that as they wonderfully prevaricated in what by a due exercise of their Faculties they might have known, so they no ways answered what they knew and professed. Were <hi>Lucians</hi> testimony of any significancy, the very best of them were stark naught.

impii non gratia, sed paena debetur.</hi> Austin. Epist. 105. <hi>To him that hath shall be given,</hi> Math. 13.12. carries in it a plain other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment than some men of prepossessed judgments would wrest from it. It relates at most to a bestowment of more of the same kind. Were the right and due use of the Talents of Nature, the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure according to which God proceeds in the dispensing of Grace, it would by the Rule of contraries follow that those who either through supiness or compliance with the inescations of the Animal life, fail in a due improvement of them, are to have no lot nor inheritance in any supernatural Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. God promiseth sinners pardon if they believe, but in the Covenant made with us, he neither <hi>absolutely</hi> nor <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> promiseth the Grace of believing to any. His purpose of giving Grace to some, amounts not to a promise claimable by any individual person. And as for the promise of a seed made to Christ, it respects as the condition of it, what He did, not what We do: Nor is it possible to understand who are within the verge of that promise, but by the event. But were there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Obex</hi> to hinder our challenging the communication of Grace, our neglect to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57446:145"/>

of Moral actions doth not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach our Freedom. God is the prime Free Agent of all, and yet his liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in an arbitrary indifferency to the love of Good and Evil; but he is so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Rectitude and Sanctity of his Nature to a delectation in what is Good, that he is not capable of the least propension to an allowance of Evil. <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi> saith <hi>August. quia peccare non potest Deus, ideo liberum arbitrium habere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandus est? Shall we say that God is not a Free Agent, because he cannot sin? de</hi> Civit. Dei <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> God is most Free, because he is most Rational, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acts suitably to his own infinite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. The obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ being highly meritorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved likewise in an eminent manner to be voluntary. (For no man praiseth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an action that is not spontaneous; no more than we do the fire for burning)
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57446:147"/>
and yet his Will was only and ever deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the choyce and pursuit of Good, nor could he fall under the least inclination to Evil without ceasing to be what he was, which was impossible. The same may be said of the <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> who through a confirmed Sanctity, are unchangeably Good, and yet they practice obedience with the highest Freedom, because upon the most rational conviction that they should do so, and that it's not only their duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the Soveraignty of God, who commands it, but because it is most congruous to, and becoming their Natures, and the Relations they stand in to God as intellectual Creatures. The <hi>Daemons</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are by a self-Determination obdurately and irreclaimably wicked, and yet hereby do not cease to be Free Agents. Again, when the <hi>Saints</hi> arrive at consummated pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are actually stated in glory, is it to be imagined that they shall remain in a dubious suspension between Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or in an equal propension to both? No! But though the liberty of our Souls be then dilated to its utmost dimensions, yet we shall from an eternal Principle stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily adhere to God; the perfected Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing influencing the whole man to an
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57446:148"/>
intire subjection to the Divine Will. For, as <hi>Austin</hi> sayes well, <hi>Voluntas Libera tanto erit liberior quanto sanior,</hi> &amp;c. Epist. 89. The <hi>beatified</hi> Soul discovers that repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in sin to the Rational Nature, that it can never be any more reconciled to it, or cast one favourable glance upon it. Once more, If the Essential <hi>idea</hi> of humane Freedom were an <hi>aequilibrious</hi> Disposition of the mind, then by how much holier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man becomes, by so much the less Free he is, and by how much we grow disinslav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from sin, and breath in a freer air of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, by so much should our obedience receive the les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> praise of God. Yea, the more <hi>Habituated</hi> in Evil any are, by so much should they be the less criminal; a decrease in point of culpableness and guilt necessarily ensuing upon every detraction from our Essential Liberty: In a word, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Will is an Essential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul of man, and a necessary adjunct of every Humane action. If we <hi>Will</hi> a thing, we <hi>Will</hi> it freely; <hi>si enim vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus, libere volumus</hi>; as <hi>Austin</hi> saith. To <hi>Will,</hi> and to be <hi>Unwilling</hi> to <hi>Will,</hi> is a plain contradiction; for as <hi>Austin</hi> saith both acutely and solidly, <hi>non vellemus, si nollemus.</hi> We never do any thing, which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57446:148"/>
at the same time we would not do. The manacles by which we are held and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved, are nothing but our Practical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and choyce; <hi>Coactus tua voluntate es, Thou art fettered by thy own Will, Aug.</hi> so that <hi>Seventhly</hi>;</p>

               <hi>These considerations that men chuse to be wicked, love aversation from God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves in the disaffection of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is vindication enough of all the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al procedures of God against sinners, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Connate and Congenite impotency be.</hi> I wave at present the <hi>plea</hi> of Gods with-holding nothing from men that he is bound to give, and that there is nothing kept from us that belongs essentially to the Rational Nature; nor shall I plead, that whatever is now wanting to our perfection <hi>in esse Morali,</hi> is a just punishment of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and comes entayl'd upon us as a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Fruit of our first Fathers Apostacy. Though all these be true, and may be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against any opponent; but that which I insist on is this, That it's our <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> which the Lord threatneth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth, not our <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Impotency.</hi> It is our <hi>Will-not,</hi> nor our <hi>Can not</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth in judgment against us. 'Tis our contempt, not disability that we shall be
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57446:149"/>
arraigned for. We are so infatuated in the love of sin, wedded to the blandishments of the world, and enamoured on the titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Flesh, that neither the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of Reason, the Promises of the Gospel, nor the Threatnings of the Law have any prevailing influence upon us.

its highest improvement it may arrive at, and as a clear fixing of this will be a service of some significancy in it self, so it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly contribute to our better proceed in what is behind, and facilitate the proof of the necessity of a superadded infused principle in order to our acting in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Practical Religion, so as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God. <hi>First</hi> then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is not only a passive capacity in our Faculties of receiving grace, but they are also capable of being elevated actively to concur as vital Principles in the exercise of Faith, Hope, Love,</hi> &amp;c. Brute Animals are in neither sence capable of Grace; They can neither receive such <hi>Qualities</hi> as may dispose them for such operations, nor are they possessed of such Faculties as can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vital Principles of Religious acts. The <hi>potentia obedientialis lata,</hi> of many of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> whether <hi>active</hi> or <hi>passive,</hi> is an irrational figment, and invented only to subserve the Dogm's of Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Sacraments producing Grace <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> But the Soul of Man, without the addition of any new Natural Powers, is both capable of receiving Grace, and of being elevated to concur as an Active vital principle of holy and Spiritual
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57446:150"/>
operations. There is lay'd in our Natures as we are men, a foundation, which through the Communication of a Divine Seed may be improved to the highest and holiest em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. There is a Radical dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us for Grace, nor doth the Divine Image overthrow, but perfect our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual powers. <hi>Posse habere fidem, est na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae hominum,</hi> saith <hi>Austin, de praedest. Sanct. cap.</hi> 5. As Grace was originally due to our Natures, so it is still agreeable to them. But though the Soul by being elevated and perfected by Grace becomes an active Vital Principle of holy operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet in the reception of the first Grace it is purely passive, not cooperating in the least to the restitution of the Divine Image, no more than it did to the production of it in the primitive Creation. Nor doth this hinder, but that we both ought and may act in order to the obtaining of it, by being found in the exercise of those means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by God for the Communication of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly; The abilities of Nature pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently managed, and industriously improved, may carry men to a performance of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of the Duties of the second Table.</hi> This we at once acknowledge and praise in

many of the very Heathen; <hi>Their infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out-doing here the Faith of many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> according to that of <hi>Minucius; non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat fides quod praestitit infidelitas.</hi> Besides the experience of all ages, we have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Apostle in justification of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law,</hi> as the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son informed them what they ought to do in most cases of this kind, so nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed but that they might have done it. As many excellent instructions are to be met with in the writings of the Philosophers to this purpose; so the Heathen World (especially <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>) hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a vast number of persons eminent, if not in most, at least in some one or other instance of Moral Vertue: <hi>Aristodis</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for justice; <hi>Epaminondas</hi> for Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; <hi>Curius</hi> for Temperance; <hi>Thrasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> for Integrity and love for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>Cimon</hi> for beneficence and liberality though of a low fortune; <hi>Timoleon</hi> for Moderation and Humility in a prosperous condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It were easie to expatiate upon this theam, and to create matter and occasion of shame to <hi>Christians,</hi> who suffer themselves to be thus out-done by <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:57446:151"/>
Our Religion comes behind their Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and our pretences of Grace are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shone by their Vertue. Suppose their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and strength proportionable to ours, yet our outward and objective helps so vastly exceeding all the means which they had of exciting and improving Natural Powers, to equal them only in Vertue, is a high dishonour to God, and an enhance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of guilt upon our selves; and to come behind them in any of the branches of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, is openly to affront the provisions of the Gospel, and to cause that worthy Name by which we are called to be basphemed. Nor doth our profession of Christianity, while attended with a neglect of Moral performances, serve to any better purpose but to dishonour <hi>Christ</hi> and dammage our selves. And as we readily acknowledge, that men in the alone strength of Natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may proceed thus far in the practice of Moral Honesty &amp; Righteousness, so I know no man that decryes these performances <hi>as things not only useless, but dangerous if void of Grace.</hi>

No! we ascribe all due praise to them, and press them upon the Consciences of those we have to do with, both from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, the pulchritude and beauty that is in them, and their exceeding use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness not only to others, but even to the Authors of them. Nor do I know any that <hi>make Moral Goodness the greatest let to Conversion, or who say, that Vertue is the greatest prejudice to the entertainment of the Gospel; and that Grace and Vertue are inconsistent,</hi>

               <hi>or that the Morally Righteous man is at a greater distance from Grace than the Prophane.</hi> No! we are so far from affirming, that the acting up to the principles of honesty is of it self an obstruction to the Conversion of any, that we reckon it to contribute exceedingly to the promoting of it; in that it begets a greater serenity and clearness in the mind for the discerning the excellency of the Doctrines and Duties of Religion, which men of Debauched lives are indisposed for. For sensuality &amp; fleshly Lusts do debase the minds of men, darken their Reason, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture their Souls with false colours, fill their Understandings with prejudice, that they have not the free use of their intellectual
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57446:152"/>
faculties, nor are they disposed for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excise of the acts of Reason about objects of Religion. Whereas persons disentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled from the tyranny of Lust and Passion, have not only their animal spirits purer and finer for the exercise of the noblest acts of Reason, but their minds are emancipated from many prepossessions &amp; prejudices that sensual persons are in bondage to.</p>
            <p>Two things indeed the persons reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon do openly affirm and declare; <hi>first,</hi> That if Moral Righteousness be trusted to, and relyed on for the acceptation of our persons with God, and acquisition of a title to life, that in such a case it will not only infallibly hinder submission to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Gospel, but that it will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly overthrow it. <hi>Secondly</hi>; That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men brought to an observation of the Duties of Morality, raise their whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Salvation from thence; and both these they are ready to demonstrate the truth of from Scripture, The first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also evinceable from Reason, and the second from Experience. Thence it is that they advise men not to think it enough that they are blameless before the World, but that they would look after the being reneued in the spirit of their minds towards
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57446:152"/>
God. Thence also they earnestly entreat them not to place their affiance in Moral Righteousness, and withal tell them, that there is more hope of scandalous Sinners than of such; for as much as those will sooner be prevailed with to leave their sins, than these to renounce their own Righteousness, in which they take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to a neglect of the Righteousness of Christ by Faith. This I confidently affirm to be the sum of what is to be met with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this matter either in the Writings or Sermons of sober Non-Conformists; and I challenge the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Polity</hi> to deduce Logically from hence any of those scandalous Propositions which with so magisterial a confidence he affixeth to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly; Men as well destitute of the Word, as of Grace, may by a due attendance to Natural Light, and a careful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of first Notions, proceed likewise far in performing the substantial part of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Duties of the first Table.</hi> Now the Duties of the first Table being such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer immediatly to God, they either arise from the consideration of his Nature, or the consideration of his benefits bestowed upon us. Of the first sort are Veneration,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57446:153"/>
Fear, Humility, Trust, Submission to the Divine dispose upon the account of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of God. Of the second sort, are Prayer, Gratitude, Patience under the loss and withdrawment of temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, no man in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone strength of Natural abilities either will or can perform any of these, or of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with all that dueness of circumstances as to obtain therein acceptation with God, yet with respect to the Material part of the Duties, they may be performed by men in their own strength without any special assistance of the Grace of God. If the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> though they neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted God to be the Author of the World, nor the Governour of it, did yet plead a veneration to be due to Him for the alone excellency of his Nature; Have we not much more cause to believe that those Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who not only acknowledged his excellent perfection, but withal confessed him to be the Maker, Preserver, &amp; Rector of all things, would be thereon induced to adore his Omnipotent Power and Infinite Sapience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If no other Homage were to ensue on the cogitation of the Infinity of the Deity, admiration attended with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility would naturally flow from it.

I do not now say that any of those duties (no more than the former) can be performed as they ought, without the special assistance of Grace, but this I say, that not only men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of Grace, but without the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, have been found in the exercise of many of them, and may be said to have discharged the material part of them; instances with respect, to divers are at hand. <gap reason="foreign">

The Obscurity therefore charged upon the word is both a false and blasphemous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The fault is only in us, not in the word, if it be not understood. We are either Slothfull and do not apply our selues to a diligent use of means for acquaintance with the great and mysterious truths of it. Or we mistake in the means, that we have recourse to; or we impeach the plainness of the word, while in the mean time it is our enmity at the purity of it that lies at the bottom:<note place="margin">

Moreover, men may not only in the meer strength of their Natural Abilities read and Historically understand the Scripture, but by comparing the temper of their own hearts, with what both Reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture instructs them of God and their Duty, and being awakened through the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conviction administred especially in the Word, they may make a judgment of their own state, and perceive the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedness and disaffectedness of their hearts to God and Holiness; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may not only make essays towards the changing the frame of their minds, but finding their own inability to a through ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of it, they may bewaile the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness of their case, make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to God for relief, implore his assistance, and attend upon those instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, appointments and means, in the use of which, God communicates his Grace and Spirit.

            <p>Now that considered, with respect to our meer faculties, and the best natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, we are without that Rectitude of heart, and conformity to the holiness of God implanted in his Law, which we ought to have; we shall, for the further manifestation of what we have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, endeavour to lay open and evince. That over and above our being possessed of intellectual powers, we were also imbued with superadded principles, commonly, and that according to the Scripture, stiled the Divine Image in us; and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of God in the communication of this to us, and the implantation of it upon our Natures, was, that we might be adapted to live to him; and that for the reaching and attaining this great End, such concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated principles were naturally due, hath been in all its several parts and branches demonstrated, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. §. 5. Of the loss of this Image, and what thereupon ensues, we have in part also treated in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, §. 10. Somthing farther remains yet
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57446:160"/>
to be subjoyned; namely, That by the loss of the Divine Images, there is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and <hi>formally</hi> in us an unanswerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the holy Nature of God, a diffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity both to the holiness implanted upon the Law, and that Sanctity that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is in the Law, as in a Copy, a <hi>Transcript</hi> of the Holiness of God. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to both these, there was at first a Rectitude and Holiness implanted in, and imprest upon our Natures. There was a concreated similitude in us to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. 'Tis true, <hi>That</hi> in us was not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally the same with the Holiness that is in God. There cannot be an <hi>Identity</hi> in any thing between God and Creatures. But there was an <hi>Analogie</hi> betwixt the one and the other. Holiness is in God as his Nature and Essence; in us, as an accident adventitious to our beings, yet so, as that Originally it was both due to us, and that we were thereby fitly laid to be like him. <hi>Plato</hi> rightly stiles it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> produce a few arguments in proof of it. (1.) The Scripture which useth not to Baptise things with undue names, expresly sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es it so,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57446:161"/>
               <hi>see Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. (2.) That which renders us unclean, and by consequence loathsome and abominable to God, is in the strictest propriety of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sin, seeing God hates nothing simply but sin, nor any thing but upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Meer disasters render us the Objects of Gods pitty and compassion, not of his Wrath &amp; Hatred. Now that we are impure &amp; hateful in the sight of God, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the want of an inherent Rectitude hath been already declared. (3.) That which is opposite to Righteousness, can be nothing less than sin, these two only being immediate contraries; for punishment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, as such is not in the same <hi>praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with Righteousness, and so cannot in propriety be its <hi>oppositum.</hi> (4.) The want of that which the Law requires, and which is naturally due and suitable to our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must necessarily be sin; for as much as only sin is a transgression of the Law. Now that the Law requireth Habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness or Rectitude of Nature, doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow upon the consideration that the Sanction of it doth not only reach the outward and external Action, but the Heart and Principle. (5.) Every Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Holy, and Undefiled Nature is at the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57446:162"/>
least a subject suitable and disposed for Communion with God here, and Fruition of Him hereafter; but that Naturally we are not so, is written as with a Sun-beam, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. (6.) That which dissolveth the subordination of the Rational Creature to God, and the Regular Harmony of the Soul in its actings, is surely sin, it lying in plain opposition to what we are especially obliged to; Now the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Adams</hi> meer single transgression, precluding the corruption of our Nature could have no influence upon this, no more than the Rebellious act of a Father in the forfeiture of whose Estate the Son is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, can have upon the Son, to the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating him from his loyalty. But that the due subordination of Man to God, and the Harmony of the Soul in its actings is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, every mans experience will inform him; and if he please, he may learn it from the Philosophers, who generally tell us that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Natural to men to sin.</hi> Many more arguments to this purpose lye in view, which to avoid prolix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, I at present wave. And as to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Objection, <hi>That what is a Punishment cannot be a Crime.</hi> (1.) What if a clear solution could not be given to it? Shall

Doth it become us to be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest in our Divinity, than in Human Sciences? (2.) What if I should say that it is only a Crime, and not at all a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I have no less person than <hi>Placeus,</hi> not to name others, preceding me in it. <hi>Adam</hi> sinning, did thereby shake off his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God, prefer a subordinate Good to him, and thereby divest himself of that rectitude of Nature he was vested with; upon a mutation, as to his chief End, there was a change in all his Moral Principles; And thus becoming corrupt himself, it was impossible that any but such as are corrupt should be begotten by him; <hi>That which is of Flesh, is Flesh; nor can any bring a clean thing out of an unclean.</hi> Nor supposing <hi>Adam</hi> to have sinned, could it fall out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise without the substitution of a New <hi>Protoplast</hi>; and subversion of the designed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57446:163"/>
and declared order for the propagation of Man-kind. But (3.) What hinders, but that one and the same thing materially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, may under different formal respects be both a Sin and a Punishment. Was not <hi>Achitophels</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>'s hanging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves both the one and the other? Doth not God frequently threaten upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of some sins, to relinquish men in way of judgment to more; see 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 24, 26, 28. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philosophers will have sin to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a punishment, but the very Poet could say,
<q>
                  <l>Invidiâ Siculi non invenere Tyranni.</l>
                  <l>Majus tormentum. —</l>
               </q>
What absurdity to say, that <hi>Adam</hi> divesting himself of the Divine Image, God thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suspends the immediate Universal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect restoring of it either to him, or his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; and that as the denying to restore it is an act of Righteousness and Justice in God, so the want of it is nevertheless a sin in us. Is there any thing more easie to be proved, than that according to the tenor of the Old Covenant, it was impossible that it should be restored, &amp; yet that by the tenor of that very Covenant, the want of it is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57446:163"/>
chargeable as a crime upon us. It is only in the vertue of the Remedial Covenant made in Christ as the Head of the New Creation, that we are renued to the Image of God again; And yet had there never been such a Transaction, it had been still our Duty to have had it, and our sin to have been without it.</p>
            <p>Having now made appear, that God in the taking the measure of us, and our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath a regard not only to the matter of them, but the Rectitude of the Principles whence they proceed; and having lay'd open the pollution of our Faculties, and their unanswerableness to the holy Nature of God, and the Holiness implanted upon the Law, it is easie to infer an <hi>ataxy,</hi> disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, taint and moral defect in those very duties, which, as to the substance and matter of them we are in the Discharge of. This lies so plain, and doth so naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue upon the premises, that he must be of very mean intellectuals that doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and discover it. Yet that I may not be altogether wanting to the service of a Truth of such import, I shall briefly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate what necessarily ensues hereupon, both with reference to the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>Agenda</hi> of Religion, so far as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57446:164"/>
in the Duties of either of them. <hi>First,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Credenda</hi> of it: Though in the alone strength, and through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Natural Powers we may <hi>Grammatically</hi> understand, and <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> believe the Truths delivered in them: Yet (1.) We understand them not in that spiritual manner as we ought, for as much as nothing can act beyond its own <hi>sphear:</hi> Nor is there a due proportion between spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Objects and Natural Light. This made the <hi>Apostle</hi> say, <hi>That the Natural man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God, because they are Spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Hence notwithstanding the acknowledgment of an <hi>Objective</hi> perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the Scripture, Divines generally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert a <hi>Subjective</hi> darkness in the mind, and besides the Light impressed upon the Word, require an infusion of a principle of Light and sight into the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Without this, sayes <hi>Luther, Ne jota quidem unum videri potest in Scripturis, ea perspicacid quae salutaris est. Not one jot in the Scripture can be understood in a saving way, apud Rivet.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Baronius</hi> in his <hi>Philosophia Theologiae ancillans</hi> tells us, that <hi>Notitia Rerum The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicarum qua praediti sunt impii &amp; non renati, non est Theologia proprie dicta, sed aequivocè dicitur Theologia. Exercit.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 30. (2.) These very Truths which unrenued men are in the Historical belief of, they do not spiritually <hi>savour</hi> them. Believers are endowed with a <hi>Gust</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know nothing of. They are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affected by and with Gospel-Truths, than men of meer Natural Principles ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are or can be; <hi>Quicquid recipitur, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur ad modum recipientis</hi>; The same food hath a different relish with one and the same person according as the Organ of Tast is well or ill affected. How insipid are the most comfortable doctrines of the Word to an Unrenued Soul, they find no relish in them, whilst on the other hand the mind in which there resides a Vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, feels and experiments what he Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically believes, see <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.103. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. (3.) The mind being unrenued in its Habitude, frame, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, remains thereupon not only dark,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57446:165"/>
ignorant, subject to mistakes, error, vain imaginations, but lyable to scepticism, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setledness, and at last a total disbelief of the things of the Spirit of God. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of spiritual sensation and experience being not only beyond the certainty of Reason and Argumentation, but that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch alone gives a clear comprehension of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries, and which only indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Soul concerning them. He that hovereth in the profession of Gospel-Truths, and finds nothing of the <hi>Reality, Power,</hi> and Experience of them in himself, becomes thereby wonderfully disposed, not only to question the Truth of them, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to reject them. Nor is it imaginable how it should be otherwise, when he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienceth nothing of all that he reads, hears, professeth, and hath been by education or force of Rational Arguments in the belief of. Being told that the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ will <hi>mortifie</hi> sin, and that men are <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> by the <hi>Word,</hi> and finding nothing of this in themselves, they are not only under a temptation hereby to disbelieve these particular Truths, but to disclaim the whole Revelation of the Word as a Fable.</p>
            <p>And as these things, through the loss of the Divine Image, and that pollution which
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57446:165"/>
ensues in the Soul thereupon, do naturally accompany us with reference to the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda</hi> of Religion, notwithstanding our being in the <hi>Historical</hi> belief of them; so there are several things deducible from the same premises, with Relation to those <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda</hi> of Religion in the performance of the material duties of which we are found. (1.) Nothing of all that is done, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, hath its rise in, or proceeds from a sincere, effectual, superlative love of God. That this ought to be the principle motive and inducement of our obedience, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose few will deny; and that where the foresaid pollution and disorder of Soul, through the loss of the Divine Image, is, this sincere superlative love to God is not, is of easie demonstration. I know some of the late <hi>Jesuits</hi> in their casuitical Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, affirm it to be enough if we be in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Commandments, though without any affection towards God, or the Resignation of our hearts to him, provided that we do not hate him. But I hope no <hi>Protestant</hi> is yet arrived at this, and indeed I wonder how any, professing himself either a Christian or a Man, can entertain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion so subversive of all Religion, and repugnant as well to Reason as Scripture.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57446:166"/>
I do not say that any man on earth hates God to that degree, as those in Hell do; nor do I assert that there is an explicit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God in every act of an unrenued person; I believe otherwise: But this I affirm, that love to God is not the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal governing Principle of an Unregenerate man, nor is it exalted to that Degree in any action he performes, as to give him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of a lover of God. Now it is the sincerity, prevalency, and perfection of love that among other things gives the <hi>Moral</hi> specification to Obedience. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever resemblance the performances of one destitute of this <hi>Love</hi> may have of holy and Religious obedience, yet all is loathsome to God, as wanting one chief ingredient of its constituent form. Nor is this love in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, in whom the Spirit of Christ dwells not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. Faith in Christ is the only root on which it grows, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Faith is the alone Foundation of a Good Work,</hi> Clem. Alex. Strom. lib. 5. (2.) Through the loss of this Image of God, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which necessarily ensues in the Soul thereupon; There is in all that we perform antecedently to our being renued to this Image again, a prevarication with respect
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57446:166"/>
to our true great and ultimate End. That the end of an action is under the Sanction of the Law, as well as the substance of the Duty, I have shown before <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. §. 6. God being our Author, is our Ultimate End also. It is impossible for God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Creature that is not according to its Nature and Qualifications, to be <hi>to Him,</hi> and <hi>for Him.</hi> The lapse not only involved in it, disobedience to God as our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, but Apostacy from him, both as our Chief Good, and in point of seeking his Glory before our own gratification. Now till the Divine Image be restored, and a rectitude Recovered in our Souls again, we never so far return to God, as to make our selves, and all that we do refer to him as to our End; but there is still either some base, low, or crooked aim in all that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to. Mens <hi>Ends</hi> will not rise higher than their <hi>Principles</hi>: He that acts only <hi>from self,</hi> will only act for self. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an action doth materially adapt and qualifie it to the being to Gods glory, but it is the Principle and <hi>intention</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent that makes it formally to be so. And though I will not affirm that an <hi>explicit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Gods glory is either necessary, or indeed possible, in every individual act;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57446:167"/>
yet I say that there ought to be an habitual tendency in the Soul after it, in every thing we apply to. Though the Traveller do not every step he takes, think of the place whither he is going, yet his aim is still at it, &amp; it often revives upon his thoughts. Now through a prevarication, less or more, that is in the actings of every Unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with reference to his End; the utmost of what he doth, is but Obedience in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal</hi> sence. Their Virtues are but <hi>Virtutum similitudines, the Counterfeits of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>

               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:57446:167"/>§. 7. Having treated the defects which occur in the best actions that Natural men can perform, and declared their Unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness to God thereupon; It remains to be shewn in the next place, that there are also some Duties under the Sanction of which we all are, which even with respect to the matter of them, no man in the meer vertue of Natural Principles can arise to a performance of. And of this kind I shall only mention that great Duty incumbent upon us <hi>of making to our selves new hearts,</hi> with what depends thereupon. That the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our Natures, and the being renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the Image of God, is prescribed to us in way of Duty; The Scripture plainly and fully testifies: And yet, if we consult either the Scripture, or our own experience, we shall understand how totally unable we are for the discharge and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this great Duty. Though the New Creature be only an <hi>additional</hi> to our <hi>Natural Being,</hi> yet as to the <hi>Physical</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it, it lyes as far out of our <hi>sphear,</hi> as the production of the <hi>Soul</hi> doth out of that of an organised body. Was man meerly passive in the reception of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God impressed upon him at first, and is there not greater reason to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57446:168"/>
that he is meerly passive in the new production and reception of it? Hence to testifie our impotency, the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us <hi>to be dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> Eph. 2.1.5. <hi>and that no man can come to Christ unless the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>That we are neither begot again of Blood, nor of the will of the Flesh, nor of the will of Man,</hi> Joh. 1.13. We owe not our Regeneration either to the efficacy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor to the workings of our own wills. Hence the great Work and Duty of circumcising our hearts is expressed by such phrases, which, if they signifie any thing, do import us meerly passive in it. Of this complexion are the expressions of our being <hi>begotten again, Created, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> &amp;c. Did the scattered <hi>Atomes</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> frame themselves into the Machine of the Humane Body at first? Or do those Rudimental Principles conveyed for the formation of the <hi>Faetus</hi> in the Womb, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves into that orderly, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble variety of texture, which fills us at once with amazement and thankfulness? Shall the dispersed particles, and <hi>corpuscles</hi> of dust, rendevouse and reassemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into their former frames, without the Physical interpose of a forraign Agent? If
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57446:168"/>
none of these be either true or possible, no more is it so, that man can convert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Were we disposed qualified, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and suited to the accomplishment of this work, would God take it out of our hand, and rob us of the praise of it? Doth He not again and again proclaym us inept and weak for the effecting of it? Doth he not intitle himself the Author of it? Is not the Holy Spirit purchased by Christ, and promised by the Father to this End? The Scriptures bearing Testimony to this, are innumerable; see among others, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. &amp;c. Now notwithstanding all this, to argue for an Ability in us to perform it, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is prescribed us in way of Duty, is childish and trifling; is it not enough to justifie the prescription of it in way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: (1.) <hi>That such a frame of heart ought to be in us,</hi> and that the want of it, is as much our sin, as our misery. (2.) That being awakened by the consideration of our duty, to a perception of our weakness. <hi>We ought thereupon to sue to God for strength.</hi> And therefore it is, that all precepts to this purpose are attended with answerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Finding that thou canst not change
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57446:169"/>
thy sensual earthly heart, thou art to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his help, who is not only able, but willing to relieve and succour thee.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That God hereby excites us <hi>to do what we can,</hi> and to wait upon him in all those ways and means, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised upon our sincere exercise to make successfull. (4.) That these commands and exhortations of washing and making us clean, of getting a new heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not so much suited to us as <hi>weak</hi> as they are intended to us as <hi>stubborn,</hi> nor so much prescribed to us under the reduplication of our being unable, as of being Rebellious.</p>

Nor is there any thing that the Scripture declares in more Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical terms, the Holy Ghost foreseeing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57446:169"/>
contradiction that would be made hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And by the same acts and methods that men endeavour to avoid the force of Scripture-Testimonies in this matter; there is not any Article of Faith that can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but what ever the Holy Ghost hath delivered for the confirmation of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Doctrines of the Christian Religion may with the like subtilty be perverted to another Intendment. Had God designed the declaring the Doctine of an infused Subjective principle; I challenge any man to shew me how it could have been more clearly and fully expressed than it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The causes both <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Physical,</hi> the way and <hi>manner</hi> of its production and communication; the <hi>intrinsic subjective</hi> change that is thereby made and wrought in the frame, temper, and disposition of the Soul; the <hi>capacity</hi> that we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon brought into of communion with God here, and enjoying him hereafter, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>effects</hi> that proceed thence in our Conversation and course of Living, both towards God and Man, are all held forth in the Scripture in terms most plain, full, and emphatical. Nor are the Prayers and Thanksgivings, with reference to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and assisting Grace, which I suppose

all Christians are found in the performance of, reconciliable with the denyal and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a Principle and so conferred.
