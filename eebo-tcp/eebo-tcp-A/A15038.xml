            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But good Senators, to discontinue a prosperous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with a slouthfull imagination, that the Common weale is sounde, because no in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

The practisers of Chirurgerie very well know, that an olde and deepe festred sore, w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Good Senators, vnto you al, it is wel knowen, that the publique weale hath of long time bin infected, with the most horrible vices, that euer humanitie practised: yea, so foule and vn cleane, as ciuill creatures are forbod to recite them, by the sauadge inclination of that Monster HELIOGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BALVS, yea so lothsome and fylthy were his abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as the worser sort of people, (his fauoured ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes) so detested his detestable and vile lyfe, as they hasted his ouer-long proroged death. Now that the immortall Gods haue inuested vs with the Imperiall Maiestie, small is the wonder, though there appeare a reformation in the good, when the verie Reprobate were glutted with wickednesse. But reuerend Fathers, this sweete alteration is no warrant to the Magistrate, to be slouthfull in his function, least in not suruayinge of the best, the best them-selues be corrupted, as Moaths consume the finest garmentes, where they be seeldome worne, and lesse ouer-lookte: And although in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, this inconuenience is to be feared, in the worser, this mischiefe is to be certenly expected: they wil vpon cuerie temptation returne to their naughtines as a Dog

to his vomit, and therfore these daungerous insyrmities in a Common wealth, must be cured as the skilfull Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth a festred sore. Their causes must bee searched and their nourishing humors purged, and then amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followeth. The cause of this inordinate lust, this excessiue drunkennesse, this outragious prodigalitye, &amp; to be short, this hel of iniquity among the Romanes, is euill education: of long time there hath bin no man ready to instruct them in vertues, nor willing to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their vices, the nourishment of these euils are the Tauerns, Dicing places, and brothell houses, of whiche Rome hath great store, &amp; they greater store of guestes: so that to rid the publique weale of this dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is fyrste and cheefelye to instruct the youth in good maners, and next to abate the number of these su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous howses, or at the least, daylie to ouer-see their dooings.</p>
                     <p>Thus in breefe, I haue declared some of the hydden euilles, harboured in the bowels of Rome, which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your owne eyes must be as ready to fynde them out, as your eares attentiue to heare euils reported: you must bee as well Informers of offenders, as Iudges of offences: for the desire of Iustice is to roote out iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the office of Iustices to inquire after euil lyuers: And without al doubt, in this carefull proceedinge, in your visitations, you shall see sufficient example of sin, to occupie your Iudiciall places with correction. This vigilant care, will eternize your good beginnings with glorie, will establish prosperitye in the weale puplique, will comforte the good, and bridle the wicked: ytnot through the loue of vertue, yet for the chastninge of vice. Thus, you see it concerneth the inrichinge of

His Charyot was sometyme drawen with tame Lions, sometimes with Elephantes, and sometimes with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous faire Women. The Ringes which he drewe off his fingers, hee neuer put on againe. The vessels of golde and siluer, wherein he was serued, was euermore the fees of his seruitors. Suche huge prodigalitie was ioined with his incomparable pride. His gluttonie, &amp; voluptuousnes was so great, as neere the Sea, his whole houshold was fed with most daintie fowles: and beeing farre within lande, they were all serued with all maner of fishes, by Poste brought alyue from the Sea: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he had for a generall seruice, pasti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

He so much esteemed of thinges that were deare and rare, that hearing there was but one Phaenix in the worlde, hee offered twoo thowsand Markes to haue it to hys Dinner.</p>

                     <p>He cruelly put to death many worthie personages, &amp; amongst the people many times let loose Lions, Beares, and other cruell Beastes. In fine, when his monstrous pryde, prodigallitie, and lecherie, had consumed all his own treasure, necessitie, &amp; a naughtie disposition, made him to sell the offices of Iustice. But his owne familiar Seruantes and Souldiers, wearie of his abhominations, slew him: &amp; drawing his horrible Carren with hooks through the Cittie, they tyed him to a stone of greate waight, and threw him into Tyber, to the end so vile a bodie should neuer be buried: Yet, your owne eies are Iudges that I say the truth. His death and funerals was as vile and filthie, as, what I haue saide of his life, was sumptuous and rich.</p>
                     <p>I haue laide the miserie of his death before your eyes, that you should expell the vices of his life forth of your harts. It was the due of his beastlines, and will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of your insolent liuing without amendment.</p>
                     <p>You are yet yong, &amp; by prowesse may recouer more then you haue by prodigalitie wasted: A vertuous end repaireth the dishonors of a vicious life: But shame ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, when lewd men are dead.

that with a good Northren Gelding, will gaine more by a halter, than an honest yeoman will with a teame of good horses. Heare are they, that will not let to deceaue their father, to robbe their brother, and fire their neighbours house for an aduauntage. These frannions will not sticke to spende frankely, although they haue neither landes nor goods by the dead, nor honestie by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But how will this hould out? fire will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume wood without maintenance, and ryot a weake purse without supply. The Gentlemen (for the most) haue landes to make money, and young marchants waies to get credite, but the most of these idle persons haue neither landes nor credite, nor will liue by an honest occupation: forsooth they haue yet handes to filch, heades to deceiue, and friendes to receiue: and by these helpes, shift meetely badly well. The other vpon currant assurance, perhaps get money, for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie markes or twenty poundes in the hundred.

The good Maiestrates must ouerlooke this euill, or else the euill will ouerrule their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie. It is a great miracle (but that God is mercifull) that this Citie is not alwaies gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously afflicted with the plague, when sacred is the authoritie that sayth, <hi>The plague shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the house of the swearer.</hi> I imagaine that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers cure one poyson with an other, who gape so wide to blaspheme God, as they swallowe the Deuil into their bowels, vpon whom no plague but hell fire will fasten. How needefull a thing is it to looke vnto these places where this outrage

The conspiracie of <hi>Madder</hi> and <hi>Barloe,</hi> was hatched in a tabling house, in the white fryers.

Where is a desperate <hi>Athiest</hi> like vnto harebraine <hi>Someruile</hi> so ready to be found, as in a tabeling house? Obstinate Papists that dare not liue in the countrey for feare of the statute, monethly shift their lodgings, and without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition heere dayly receiue their dyet. Launce an olde feastred sore, and you are like to finde corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than of one humour. But admit they proue no baites for such purposes: they are the sinkes of the forereported mischiefes. The vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many, and the honest gaine of no man. The Gentleman excuseth his repaire to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he keepeth no certaine house, and likewise alleadgeth conuersation of equals: but as he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no thrift in the first, so he is often deceiued in the seconde. A tabling house is like vnto a strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, who is readie to receiue euery mans money. And many times men of great worshippe, are bearded, and braued, with inferiours to some of their seruantes. The Gentleman of <hi>Naples</hi> is highly to be commended, for this honorable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, how meane so euer his liuing be, yet he will furnish his owne table: so he both auoydeth the controulement of superiours, and the checke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <note place="margin">The honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposition of the Napo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> of inferiours.

But you will say they starue themselues: but did euer any see a man to die of hunger, where meate was to be sold, if he had gaie clothes to his backe, it seemeth he contenteth nature, which is plentie ynough, we for our glutonie are euerie where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led English bellies. Very few of our gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> die old men by inordinate feading, our memorie, wit, and minde, which is immortall, is daylie dulled, weakened and almost slaine by surfets. Let vs excuse the matter as we please, wee receiue no better remedie by our excuse, than <hi>Mahomet</hi> had for the fawling sicknesse, by coloring his disease, in giuing out that his passion proceeded of the brightnesse of an Angell, which in those fittes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed heauenly matters vnto him. But if men will deceiue them selues by deluding others, they shall finde had I wist a bitter pill to digest. I neede shewe no other examples than the daylie falles of young Gentlemen that trust to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of these intising dicing houses, where ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is shut in the cole seller, and vice and all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning villanies, set in the chiefe places of the hall.
