            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So the Armed men left the Captives and the Spoil, before the Princes and all the Congregation. And the men which were expreſſed by Name, roſe up, and took the Captives, and with the Spoil clothed all that were Naked among them, and arrayed them, and ſhod them, and gave them to Eat and to Drink, and Anointed them, and carried all the Feeble of them upon Aſſes, and brought them to</hi> Jericho, <hi>the City of Palm-Trees, to their Brethren: then they returned to</hi> Samaria. For of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Lord had ſaid, <hi>They are my Servants, whom I brought out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>they ſhall not be ſold as Bondmen; Thou ſhalt not Rule over him with Rigour, but ſhalt fear thy God; both the Bondmen and the Bondmaids which thou ſhalt have, ſhall be of the Heathen that are round about you, of them ſhall ye buy Bondmen and Bondmaids.

                  <p>But <hi>Ye</hi> have ordered to be ſold of <hi>your</hi> Brethren, of <hi>their</hi> Sons and their Daughters, Not among <hi>your</hi> ſelves, but into <hi>other</hi> Plantations; not as <hi>Servants</hi> in <hi>your</hi> Houſes, but as <hi>Slaves</hi> to <hi>others:</hi> And yet <hi>you</hi> cry out, <hi>Are not we the People of the Lord? is not the Lord in the midst of us?—The Ordinances of God; for not coming to the Ordinances of God, and Contemning Authority therein, therefore have we done thus and thus unto you,</hi> ſaid your Governor in anſwer to <hi>them,</hi> as aforeſaid, when <hi>they</hi> deſired him before the <hi>People,</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> the <hi>Real Cauſe</hi> wherefore you

Her Prophets are Light and Treacherous Perſons: her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary, they have done Violence to the Law. I have cut off the Nations: their Towers are Deſolate, I have made their Streets waſte, that none paſſeth by; their Cities are deſtroyed, ſo that there is no man, there is no Habitation. I ſaid, Surely thou wilt fear me; thou wilt receive Inſtruction; ſo their Dwelling ſhould not be cut off, howſoever I puniſhed them: but they roſe early, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted all their doings,</hi> Zeph. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>your</hi> Caſe at <hi>this</hi> day.</p>

                        <p>IN the beginning of the Year, 1655. I was at the Plough <note place="margin">
                              <hi>M.

So at the time appointed <hi>Barbados</hi> was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, unto which I was required of the Lord to Go; and leave my dear and loving Wife, and tender Children: for the Lord ſaid unto me immediately by his Spirit, That He would be as a Husband to my Wiſe, and as a Father to my Children, and they ſhould not want in my abſence, for He would provide for them when I was gone. And I believed that the Lord would perform what He had ſpoken, becauſe I was made willing to give up my ſelf to his Work and Service, to leave All, and follow Him, whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Life is with me, where I reſt in Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit (with my dear Brother) under the ſhadow of His Wings, who hath made us willing to lay down Our Lives for his Own Name ſake, if Unmerciful Men be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

to take them from us; and if they do, We know We ſhall have Peace and Reſt with the Lord for ever in His Holy Habitation, when they ſhall have Torment night and day. So in Obedience to the Living God I made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to paſs to <hi>Barbados</hi> in the Fourth Moneth, 1658. So after ſome time I had been on the ſaid Iſland in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, I heard that <hi>New-England</hi> had made a Law to put the Servants of the Living God to Death, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, after they were ſentenc'd away, which did come near me at that time; and as I conſidered the Thing, and pondered it in my Heart, immediately came the Word of the Lord unto me, ſaying,—<hi>Thou knoweſt not but that Thou mayeſt go thither.</hi>—But I kept this Word in my Heart, and did not declare it to any until the time Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. So after that a Veſſel was made ready for <hi>Rhoad Iſland,</hi> which I paſſed in. So after a little time that I had been there, viſiting the Seed which the Lord hath bleſſed, the Word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying,—<hi>Go to</hi> Boſton <hi>with thy Brother</hi> William Robinſon—And at His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand I was obedient, and gave up my ſelf to do His Will, that ſo His Work and Service may be accompliſhed: For He had ſaid unto me, <hi>that He had a Great Work for me to do,</hi> which is now come to paſſe: And for yeelding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and Obeying the Voice and Command of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living God, which created Heaven and Earth, and the Fountains of Waters, Do I with my dear Brother ſuffer Outward Bonds near unto Death. And this is given forth to be upon Record, that all People may know who hear it, That We came not in our Own Wills, but in the Will of God.</p>

                        <p>AS for the State and Condition of things amongſt us, it is Sad, and like ſo to continue; The Antichriſtian Perſecuting Spirit is very active, and that in the Powers of this World; He that will not Whip and Laſh, Perſecute and Puniſh men that Differ in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, muſt not ſit on the Bench, nor ſuſtain any Office in the Common-wealth. Laſt Election, Mr. <hi>Hatherly</hi> and my ſelf left off the Bench, and my ſelf Diſcharged of my Captainſhip, becauſe I had Entertained ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> at my Houſe (thereby that I might be the better acquainted with their Principles) I thought it better ſo to do, than with the blind VVorld to Cenſure, Condemn, Rail at, and Revile them, when they neither ſaw their Perſons, nor knew any of their Principles: But the <hi>Quakers</hi> and my ſelf cannot cloſe in Divers things; and ſo I ſignified to the Court, I was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> but muſt bear my Teſtimony againſt ſundery things that they held as I had occaſion and opportunity; But withall, I told them That as I was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſo I would be no Perſecutor. This Spirit did work thoſe two years that I was of the Magiſtracy, during which time I was on ſundry occaſions forced to Declare my Diſſent in Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry actings of that Nature, which although done with all Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Expreſſion, together with due reſpect unto the Reſt, yet it wrought great Diſſaffection, and Prejudice in them againſt me; So that if I ſhould ſay ſome of themſelves ſet others on work to frame a Petition againſt me, that ſo they might have a ſeeming Ground from others (though firſt moved and acted by themſelves) to lay me what they could under Reproach) I ſhould do no wrong. The Petition was with Nineteen Hands; It will be too long to make Rehearſal; It wrought ſuch a Diſturbance in our Town, and in our Millitary Company, that when the Act of Court was Read in the Head of the Company, had not I been preſent, and made a Speech to them, I fear there had been ſuch Actings as would have been of a ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The Court was again followed with another Petition of fifty four hands, and the Court return the Petitioners an Anſwer with much plauſibleneſs of ſpeech, carrying with it great ſhew of Reſpect to them, readily acknowledging with the Petitioners my Parts and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48256:65"/>

In <hi>March</hi> laſt a Court of Deputies was called, and ſome Acts touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Quakers</hi> were made, and then they contrived to make this Law ſerviceable to them, and that was by putting out the word <hi>[and]</hi> and putting in the word <hi>[or]</hi> which is a Disjunctive, and makes every <note place="margin">A Notable <hi>Juggle</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtication</hi> of a Law made 7 years before to ſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turn, as if it were not <hi>then</hi> made.</note> Branch to become a Law. So now if any do neglect, or will not come to the Publick Meetings, <hi>Ten ſhillings</hi> for every Defect.

But what may be the Reaſon that they ſhould not by another Law, made and dated by that Court, as well effect what was intended, as by altering a word, and ſo the whole ſence of the Law; and leave this their Act by the date of it charged on another Courts account? Surely the chief Inſtruments in the buſineſs being privy to an Act of Parliament for Liberty ſhould too openly have acted repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to a Law of <hi>England;</hi> but if they can do the thing, and leave it on a Court as making it ſix years before the Act of Parliament, there can be no danger in this. And that they were privy to the Act of Parliument for Liberty to be then in being is evident, That the Deputies might be free to act it. They told us, That now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector ſtood not engaged to the Articles for Liberty, for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had now taken the Power into their Own hands, and had given
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48256:67"/>
the Protector a new Oath, Only in General to maintain the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion; and ſo produced the Oath in a Paper in writing; Whereas the Act of Parliament, and the Oath are both in one Book in Print; So that they who were privy to the One, could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Other.

Some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Rhoad Iſland</hi> came to bring them Goods to trade with them, and that for far Reaſonabler terms than the Profeſſing and Oppreſſing Merchants of the Country; but that will not be ſuffered: So that unleſs the Lord ſtep in to their help and aſſiſtance, in ſome way beyond Man's Conceiving, their Caſe is ſad, and to be pittied; and truly it moves bowels of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in all ſorts, except thoſe in place, who carry with a high hand towards them.

                  <p>Within <hi>Two</hi> dayes after they had <hi>him</hi> forth again, and hung <hi>him</hi> up as before, and the <hi>Jaylor</hi> being <hi>very</hi> drunk, forced ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Negro</hi> to lay many more ſtripes upon <hi>him,</hi> who ſeeing no End of <hi>their</hi> Cruelty, but in <hi>his</hi> Life, which <hi>they</hi> ſought after, and being weary and faint; for it was hard to bear, but the <hi>Lord</hi> was near <hi>him,</hi> who ſuffered them not to take away <hi>his</hi> Life, which they drove at, and which was very near the taking away, <hi>He</hi> enabling <hi>him</hi> to bear, to ſee how far <hi>they</hi> would go; and being near, that it might not be taken away, gave <hi>him</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to deſire ſome time to conſider, and to ſuffer ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> to come at <hi>him;</hi> Which was granted, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman came, and waſhed <hi>his</hi> ſtripes; who ſeeing <hi>him</hi> brought ſo low in Body through thoſe cruel Sufferings, was ſo in the ſence thereof that ſhe thought <hi>he</hi> would not live till the <hi>next</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo ſhe told her Husband; which took ſuch Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon him, that he went to the <hi>Fiſcal,</hi> and proffered him a <hi>fat Ox</hi> to ſuffer <hi>him</hi> to be at his houſe until <hi>he</hi> was well: But the <hi>Fiſcal</hi> would not, unleſs the whole Fine was paid; which many gladly would have done, but <hi>he</hi> could not ſuffer it.

                  </p>
                  <p>This his <hi>freedom</hi> to labour was a <hi>great</hi> Torment to them on the <hi>other</hi> hand, whoſe Aim by their Cruelty, was to get Money; and a <hi>great</hi> Trouble it was to many both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> could not Conſent for the Fine to be paid (for they tendred <hi>his</hi> Sufferings) but rather would work, that he might not be <hi>burthenſom</hi> to any; Nor could <hi>he</hi> eat the <hi>Governors</hi> Bread, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>he</hi> Wrought for it; Notwithſtanding that little beſides was brought to <hi>him,</hi> being not ſuffered ſo to be; and that which <hi>he</hi> Wrought for was ſo courſe, that it troubled <hi>tender</hi> People that <hi>he</hi> ſhould eat it, being ſuch as they gave their Slaves; <hi>he</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather from a Contented Mind (being ſtrong in the Lord, who had made <hi>him</hi> whole) ſo to do, than to put any to charge;

being <hi>unfree</hi> ſo much as to receive of them to whom <hi>he</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred (the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that live there) becauſe <hi>he</hi> ſaw how the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſought to enſnare them; under <hi>whom</hi> they are in great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who went thither from the Plantations in <hi>New-England</hi> to enjoy <hi>their</hi> Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>his</hi> Life grew over <hi>them,</hi> and the Lord was with <hi>him;</hi> And after that <hi>he</hi> had accompliſhed the meaſure of <hi>his</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Seeds ſake there, which the <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffered <hi>them</hi> to inflict upon <hi>him,</hi> to try how far <hi>they</hi> would go, and to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>them</hi> in their End; in a very ſhort time <hi>he</hi> was delivered out of Priſon, contrary to the Expectation of <hi>his</hi> Enemies, without paying <hi>One Penny,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> One for <hi>him.</hi> In <hi>their</hi> wills <hi>be</hi> could not work, and ſuffered for it; in the Will of the <hi>Lord he</hi> wrought, and was delivered for <hi>his</hi> Faithfulneſs to <hi>Him:</hi> The <hi>Governors</hi> Siſter was inſtrumental in <hi>his</hi> Liberty, whom <hi>his</hi> Sufferings took deep upon, and being very ſad, <hi>he</hi> asked the Cauſe, which <hi>ſhe</hi> told <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> ſet <hi>him</hi> free.

                  <p>Much more might be ſaid of the Sufferings of <hi>theſe</hi> People in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantation (who are too much enclining to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty themſelves) through <hi>your</hi> Encouragement: For the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor was <hi>very</hi> moderate before, when <hi>Robert</hi> was with him, and his Siſter was the Means in which the Lord <hi>moved</hi> to work <hi>his</hi> Liberty, as I have ſaid: but this <hi>Willet</hi> it was of <hi>Plimmouth Patent</hi> (who had his hand ſo deep there in the Sufferings of the <hi>Innocent</hi> as aforeſaid) that made him Wrath, and ſo incenſed him, that he grew <hi>very</hi> fierce and into <hi>great</hi> Enmity againſt <hi>them,</hi> and made a Law (through Example of <hi>You) That thoſe who received any of them into their Houſes, ſhould pay</hi> Fifty Pounds Sterling; <hi>one Third part to the Informer, who ſhould be concealed</hi> (the better to Encourage <hi>them</hi> in their Wickedneſs) <hi>And that if any Veſſel ſhould bring any of them into that Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, it ſhould be forfeited with the Goods</hi> (a high <hi>Imbargo)</hi> And ſo ſet he was againſt <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that he ſaid,<hi>—That the Liberty of his Brother</hi> Henry'<hi>s Conſcience was in his

                     <p>I have often conſidered your Conditions, and your Actings
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48256:91"/>
have often come into my remembrance, which hath cauſed me often to Lament, becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts, who do thus ſlight the Almighty, and requite the Moſt High; Oh fooliſh and unwiſe, ye who do not regard the Lord that made you, who hath often ſent to you his Servants, to give you warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mighty day of the Lord of Hoſts, of the terrible day of the Lord God Almighty, which draweth near, it haſtens apace; the Lord hath ſaid it for His Elects ſake, and for His own Names ſake, will the Lord ariſe, and plead with all His Enemies, in this the day of His Eternal Power. Oh ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, who are the Workmanſhip of His hands; will ye reſiſt the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, the Holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the Strong and Mighty God, who is ariſing in his Saints, and coming forth in His Strength, to Scatter His Enemies, and to Deſtroy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all His Hoſts and Chariots in the Red Sea, after the Seed is come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to turn the pride and haughtineſs of men backwards, that riſes to withſtand the Lord? Oh conſider ye Potſherds, who are as unſtable as the Waves of the Sea, and are as the Wind in His hand, which he turneth and cauſeth to blow which way it pleaſeth Him, who will confound and deſtroy you in your Imaginations, that you have imagined againſt Him and His Saints. Oh man! What art thou that ſtandeſt to reſiſt the Lord, the mighty God of <hi>Jacob?</hi> Did ever any of your Fathers, the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of old proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Did not the Lord conſume them with the breath of His noſtrils, and with the Word of His mouth? Who will tear you to pieces, that riſe up in Rebellion againſt Him. Conſider, was it in vain that one ſaid in a certain place, That <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft?</hi> Conſider O ye that inhabit the Earth, whoſe dwelling-place is beneath; Doth not the Lord behold all your Actions, and all your unrighteous Doings? Oh ye Rulers and chief Prieſts, are ye combining together? are ye joyned together? are you in league together, as the Rulers and chief Prieſts were in former ages? Conſider their Ends, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you are doing? Are you ſo blind that you cannot ſee you are <hi>Perſecuting</hi> the Saints of the moſt High? You who are ſeeking the Life of the Righteous, and that nothing but Blood will ſatisfie; <hi>The Lord will give you blood to drink,</hi> you that thirſt for it, you ſhall have enough of it; you who ſpill and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48256:91"/>
drink the <hi>Blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> Are not your Brethren gone before you, in whoſe ſteps ye are treading? and the fruits of the Devil you are bringing forth, <hi>Ye uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniciſed in hearts and ears,</hi> who do thus <hi>reſiſt the Lord of Life:</hi> As your Fathers did, ſo do ye reſiſt the holy Ghoſt and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, which is now appeared in the Saints of the moſt High; who are ſent into your borders in love to your Souls, and in tender mercy and compaſſion to the Captive that is within your gates, and to the Priſoner. Oh why will you ſtrive any longer with the Lord that made you? <hi>Who is coming</hi> in <hi>ten thouſand of his Saints to render vengeance in flames of ſire, upon all the ungodly:</hi> Who hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts:</hi> Who will recompence into your boſoms, the Reward of your doings. Oh People and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants hereof, <hi>Why will ye die in your ſins?</hi> And <hi>whither Chriſt goes, thither you cannot come:</hi> Oh! <hi>Why will ye put the day of the Lord aſar off you?</hi> who hath <hi>waited long to be gracious,</hi> and hath <hi>born with you, as a man doth with his onely Son that ſerveth him;</hi> So hath the Lord <hi>ſpared you:</hi> And do you thus <hi>requite the Lord</hi> for his <hi>loving kindneſs,</hi> to <hi>whip,</hi> to <hi>impriſon,</hi> and <hi>cut off</hi> the <hi>Ears</hi> of his Servants, that are ſent unto you? Is this your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Chriſt? Are theſe your good Examples to others? Come, let us reaſon together; Have you not loſt natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? have you not loſt tenderneſs and compaſſion? <hi>Woe</hi> is me, for thee, Oh thou <hi>New-England,</hi> who haſt made ſuch a noiſe among the Nations: Is thy Religion come to no more than <hi>whipping, impriſoning, burning in the hand,</hi> and <hi>cutting off Ears,</hi> and <hi>baniſhing upon death?</hi> What will be the next Law that thou wilt make, Oh <hi>New-England,</hi> againſt thoſe that thou ſcornfully calleſt <hi>Quakers?</hi> terming them the <hi>Curſed Sect of the Quakers.</hi> If they were a <hi>Curſed Sect,</hi> as thou haſt termed them, it ſeems they ſhould be ſo for thee, and ſo die for thee; For thou haſt made a Law, to put them to Death, if they come the ſecond time within thy borders: But I ſay, the Lord hath bleſſed the People called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> and they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſhall be bleſſed for evermore. Oh ye Rulers and chief Prieſts, will you proceed no further, than putting to Death the Innocent? Is thy Praying, they Preaching, thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sacrifices, and vain Oblations, come to this? and will not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48256:92"/>
thy Sacrifices, and Prayers, and ſolemn Meetings, become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination? is it not the greateſt Abomination that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt? Doſt thou think that this will pacifie the wrath of the Almighty God? who is coming forth againſt thee, and will <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake</hi> thee, and <hi>ſtrip</hi> thee <hi>naked,</hi> and <hi>uncover</hi> thee in that day, and <hi>take</hi> all thy <hi>Ornaments</hi> from thee. Oh conſider! Haſt thou forgot? although thou wouldeſt <hi>cover</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> with <hi>tears,</hi> and <hi>come before Him with ten thouſand of Rams, and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rivers of Oyl, and offer-the Fruit of thy Body, for the ſin of thy Soul; Would it be accepted,</hi> being offered in that nature wherein thou liveſt? Much more when thou art become ſo <hi>Bloody,</hi> and ſo <hi>hard-hearted,</hi> that in ſtead of <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> with <hi>tears,</hi> doſt thou intend to <hi>cover it</hi> with <hi>blood</hi> if thou canſt? <hi>Bluſh and be aſhamed, hide thy ſelf in the duſt for ever, becauſe of the preſence of the Almighty, who is now appeared and is coming to ſet thy ſins in order before thee; who will not blot out thy ſins, nor cover thy Iniquities which are many, unleſs thou ſpeedily repent, and forſake thy unrighteouſneſs; for thy Deſtruction haſtens apace, thou art running headlong to Deſtruction; as the horſe ruſheth into the Battel, ſo doſt thou into <hi>Blood.</hi>
                        </hi> How doſt thou think to expect any thing from the Lord, but a <hi>Sore: Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a <hi>Famine,</hi> and a <hi>Plague,</hi> which is haſtening upon thee, if thou continue ſtill in Rebellion; in <hi>Perſecuting</hi> his Servants. This hath the Lord ſaid, and this will the Almighty perform upon thee in the day of his righteous Judgements, which will overtake all <hi>bloody-minded</hi> men, and blind <hi>Perſecutors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh I am full of the Spirit of the Lord, and of the Power oſ him that made me, who hath ſaid unto me, <hi>Fear not man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, nor the Son of man that muſt die;</hi> For the Lord hath ſaid unto me, <hi>For this end have I called thee, and for this cauſe I have ordained thee, Fear them not, neither be diſmayed at their looks, nor be afraid of their threatning words; I the Lord that created, thee am with thee; Therefore fear not what man ſhall do unto thee, for I have made thee as a Wall of Braſs, whereat the bloody-minded men ſhall ſhoot their Arrows; but ſhall not touch thee as to offend thee;</hi> Therefore the Lord hath ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, <hi>Let not thy heart faint becauſe of what I ſhall ſuffer them to do unto thee; but let thy hands be ſtrong in the Lord thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Iſrael; for thy adverſaries ſhall be confounded,

and the Enemies of the Lord ſhall be deſtroyed in that day.</hi>

                     <p>Oh ye Hypocrits! how can you ſing and keep ſuch a noiſe concerning Religion, when <hi>your hands are full of blood</hi> and your <hi>hearts full of Iniquity?

Month 1659) That <hi>if I came again after I was ſent away,</hi> or <hi>baniſhed,</hi> he ſaid, he <hi>would write a Warrant with his own hand to ſend me to the Gallowes to be hanged.</hi> Are theſe your Fruits, your corrupt ſpeeches, to Threaten the Innocent with your <hi>Gallowes,</hi> to <hi>hang them</hi> thereon? Oh that ever ſuch words ſhould proceed out of a mans mouth! to ſay that he would <hi>write a Warrnat with his own hand, to ſend an Innocent Perſon to the Gallowes to be hanged.</hi> Well, all this we can bear, the Lord hath brought forth his <hi>Suffering Seed,</hi> and through <hi>Suffering</hi> muſt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and his <hi>Saints <hi>overcome</hi>
                        </hi> and get the <hi>Victory,</hi> and <hi>the wicked muſt be deſtroyed,</hi> and ſuch who have <hi>been guilty of <hi>Blood.</hi>
                        </hi> Was ever the like heard before, That men Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to have ſo much of the Knowledge of God, and Profeſſing to Fear God, that <hi>ſuch</hi> ſhould become ſo <hi>Bloody!</hi> and become ſo great <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of a People who are deſpiſed of the World,

but loved of God; and the Preſence of the Lord is with them, whom you <hi>Perſecute,</hi> and you muſt fall before them, for the Lord God is with them and among them that are the Sufferers under you. The Lord God of Heaven and Earth is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch, which cauſeth <hi>the Heathen to Rage, and the People of the Earth to Imagine a Vain Thing:</hi> For the Lord's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Power, in ſome meaſure, was ever among ſuch as Suffered and were <hi>Perſecuted for Conſoience</hi> ſake, and Suffered with them, and in them by the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of <hi>Old,</hi> in former Ages and Generations, as he doth at this day in his Saints and Children, for the overthrow of the Powers of Darkneſſe, and Kingdom of the Devil; who hath had his Seat in the ſons of men for theſe many Ages and Generations; Wherein, and whereby the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath made <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and His <hi>Saints,</hi> for many Generations. But the day doth draw near and haſtens apace, that the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> muſt <hi>get</hi> the <hi>Victory:</hi> And the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>his Followers,</hi> at that day; muſt be <hi>Conſumed,</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyed,</hi> becauſe of the Preſence of the Lord God in his <hi>Saints.</hi>

                     <p>Oh what cruelty is acted now in theſe dayes! That men who Profeſſe God, and make ſuch a noiſe concerning Religion, that ſuch ſhould become ſo <hi>hard-hearted,</hi> to Impriſon a Child of <hi>Eleven</hi> or <hi>Twelve Years</hi> of Age!

Do you think, Oh you Heads and Rulers of this Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> who are become ſo Brutiſh, and ſo Dark in your Underſtandings, and ſo unlike Men in your Actions: You that caſt the Innocent into your Dens, Holes, Priſons, and will not ſuffer their Friends and Acquaintance to come to viſit them, not to miniſter unto them. Surely <hi>bitter</hi> will your <hi>Cup</hi> be, and your <hi>Portion</hi> will be <hi>ſad</hi> to Surely the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and tender-hearted cannot but <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>lament,</hi> to hear of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> that is acted by you. Oh ye Rulers and chief Prieſts, who are the <hi>Beginners</hi> of <hi>Miſchief,</hi> and the <hi>Leaders</hi> of them who are the <hi>chief Actors</hi> of all this <hi>Cruelty!</hi> For well was it ſpoken by the Prophet, <hi>The Leaders of this People, cauſe them to Erre; and they that are led by them, are deſtroyed for lack

of true knowledge.</hi> Well, a little further you ſhall proceed, to fill up the meaſure of your Iniquities; and then ſhall you have your Reward with the reſt of the Uncircumciſed: For, I know it is <hi>Blood</hi> you thirſt after, O ye Rulers and chief Prieſts, is it not our Lives ye thirſt for, come, tell us plainly? Or, have you made this Law of yours, only to ſee if you can make the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> afraid of you? Well, however, being I am allowed of God, I ſhall tell you plainly, that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is now drawing near and coming upon you ſpeedily to try you, whether you will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your <hi>inhumane Law</hi> upon us, who are now ſent among <hi>you</hi> from the Lord for this very end and purpoſe; I ſay, will <hi>you</hi> put us to death for only coming into your Juriſdiction, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as you call it) after we have been once ſent away, or commanded by you to go out of it? Now, we ſay, being the Lord God hath commanded us to the contrary, Is it meet and juſt to obey God, or man, judge ye? to obey your bloody Law, or to obey God's Righteous Law, which He hath writ in our hearts, and placed within us, which judges and condemns your unrighteous Law, that you have made to baniſh the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?</hi> Well, you that call your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you do this <hi>bloody Act,</hi> to ſhew your ſelves ſo unlike men, I muſt tell you plainly, for conſtrained by the Lord God I am to tell you, O ye bloody-minded men, <hi>That if you do put us to death, this Action of yours will proceed from the Devil, who was a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> who ſeeks to deſtroy mens lives, as you do at this day; For as it was then, ſo it is now, <hi>he that is born after the fleſh, perſecuteth him that is born after the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now you that ſay you are Chriſtians, Come, let us reaſon together concerning this inhumane Law that you have made, to put the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to death: Did ever any true Chriſtians make ſuch Laws, as you have made againſt a People, whom you in ſcorn and deriſion call <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince they came among you? Are you not aſhamed that the Nations about you ſhould hear of your Actions? to hear of the cruel Laws that you have made againſt an innocent and harmleſs People; What, was not the Law that you made at firſt ſtrong enough, but you muſt diſanul it, and proceed to a more bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier? Come, tell us plainly (if you be not aſhamed to ſpeak)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48256:94"/>
of whom did you ask Counſel? or, to whom did you ſeek for Inſtruction? I am ſure the Lord (in whoſe hand your breath is) did never give you Counſel to make theſe <hi>bloody Laws,</hi> that you have made againſt the People who are ſcornfully called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Come let us further reaſon together, that you may appear unto all, that have any Moderation in them left, as men; that ſurely you are not the true Chriſtians, nor Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt, for they uſed no ſuch weapons to War withall as you do: So that a great deal of difference there is betwixt your Practiſes and theirs, your Weapons and theirs; For their Weapons were and are Spiritual, and yours are Carnal. The difference is great every way, as great as there is betwixtLight and Darkneſſe. Again, that you may ſee that in every thing you are altogether unlike them; their War was againſt <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneſs in high places.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>wreſtled not with fleſh and blood;</hi> mark, not with the <hi>Creatures,</hi> not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> mens Lives, but made War in Righteouſneſs, with the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Weapons, having on for an helmet, the breſt-plate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they ſubdued the Powers of darkneſs, and ſpiritual wickedneſs that ruled in high places.</hi> Now you that call your ſelves Chriſtians, you <hi>war againſt fleſh and blood,</hi> your <hi>war is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the Creatures; and not againſt <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs;</hi> you ſeek to <hi>deſtroy</hi> that which Chriſt came to <hi>ſave,</hi> and ſeek not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> that which Chriſt came to <hi>deſtroy:</hi> He <hi>was made manifeſt to deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> but you make your ſelves mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt (you intend) to <hi>deſtroy the work of God.</hi> Mark and take notice, you <hi>unbelievers;</hi> The <hi>Creature</hi> is the <hi>workmanſhip of God;</hi> the <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs</hi> is the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> which Chriſt <hi>came to deſtroy,</hi> and was <hi>made manifeſt</hi> for that <hi>end,</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> the <hi>ſin</hi> which is the <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Take notice, ye, <hi>unlike Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>fruits,</hi> and <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Devil, live</hi> and <hi>remain</hi> ſtill among you <hi>undeſtroyed;</hi> who ſeek to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>workmanſhip</hi> of God, when Chriſt came <hi>to ſave mens lives, and not to deſtroy them,</hi> but to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>works of the Devil;</hi> but you ſeek to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> that which Chriſt came to <hi>ſave,</hi> and to <hi>ſave alive</hi> that which Chriſt came to <hi>deſtroy.</hi> So ſee if it doth not appear plainly by your Actions, and by your corrupt fruits, that you are making war againſt Chriſt, and his Saints, whom you ſeek to <hi>deſtroy</hi> from off the face of the Earth; As let your actions

                        <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> as any that <hi>worſhip the Beaſt, who have given their power unto the Dragon, who thirſts after the blood of the Innocent, as the Lion doth after his prey;</hi> ſo <hi>greedy,</hi> and <hi>haſty are you to ſpil the blood</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to <hi>take away</hi> the <hi>Life of the Upright from the face of the Earth.</hi> Well, ye Rulers and Magiſtrates (ſo called) take heed, and take warning, I lay it upon you, while you have time, and a day given unto you to conſider theſe things; So before the thing come to paſſe, and before you do it, weigh the matter. Come, let us farther reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Can you convince us of the tranſgreſſion of any Law of God? and if you cannot, (which we know you cannot) nor have the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the Righteous Law of God to lay to our charge, who are now coming among you in obedience to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, for this very end, to try you, O ye children of men: And if you put us to Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot obey your Commandment, but chooſe rather to obey the Commandment of the Lord; and for ſo doing will you put us to Death? Well, this know, and be it known unto the Sons of Men, and Inhabitants within this Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and elſewhere within your Juriſdiction; That the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt High muſt we obey, and your Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we muſt diſobey, and diſanul it, and make it of no effect, becauſe it is againſt, and contrary to that of God in all mens Conſciences; which is of the nature, and according to the Righteous and Royal Law of God; therfore we muſt obey the Command of the Lord, becauſe it is according to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Royal Law of God, which is according to that of God in every man's Conſcience; which ſaith, <hi>It is more juſt and meet, to obey God than man.</hi> So being that your Law that you have made, is unequal, and contrary to the Law of God, which he hath writ in our hearts, which is equal, juſt and righteous; for your Law, that you have made, againſt the Innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> is unjuſt, and unrighteous, and contrary to that of God in all mens Conſciences, and contrary to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Royal Law of God: Therefore we ſay, we cannot obey ſuch a Law, that doth not agree with the Royal Law of God; but herein ſhall we obey the Lord, chooſing rather to ſuffer, what you ſhall be ſuffered to do unto us, than to fulfil the Commandment and unrighteous Law of unrighteous men,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48256:95"/>
in flying at your Command, when the Lord hath Commanded us to ſtay; Whereby that he may ſhew his Power in us, that his Command, and his Righteous &amp; Royal Law is of more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, virtue and force in us, and with us, than your unrighteous Laws and Commands can be againſt us. So this know, if you put us to death, when we return, that you will bring innocent blood upon you, by ſo doing, which ſhall not depart from your houſes, nor from that ſeed that is guilty thereof. So theſe things we ſpeak, that you may no more be guilty of Innocent blood, for aſſuredly know, that nothing ſhall fail of what the Lord hath ſpoken by us, and through us concerning you, if you go on ſtill in Rebellion and ſtiff-neckedneſs, and refuſe to hearken to the Voice and Counſel of the Lord God: And this know, that you have been warned from the Lord of theſe things before they came to paſſe; For this we know, if we diſobey the Command of the Lord, to fly from you, becauſe you have made a Law to put us to Death, if we diſobey the Lord in this thing, he can cut us off, and take our Lives from us in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fury; Therefore be it known unto you, that the Lord hath made us willing to lay down our Lives among you, if you be ſuffered to take them from us; and in this thing we know we ſhall have <hi>peace,</hi> when you ſhall have <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> night and day: And this ſhall you certainly know one day, that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, whom we ſerve, ſent us among you, if you ſee our faces again, after we have been <hi>Baniſhed</hi> from you; and that which we have ſpoken, you ſhall know to be truth, whether you will <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>forbear.</hi> Well, if you ſay, we are tranſgreſſors of a Law, in not obeying your unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law: It is your own, and not God's Law; For his Law is <hi>holy, juſt, and good;</hi> but yours is altogether <hi>unholy, unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unjuſt, and wicked,</hi> and is to be ſet at nought, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſervants of the Lord: For this Law of yours, which you have made, to put the Righteous to death, hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Spirit of the Lord, which is <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> and <hi>eaſie to be entreated;</hi> which doth judge and condemn you, and your Law. Now if you would know from what ſpirit this wicked and unnatural Law of yours hath proceeded: Well, we ſhall ſpeak plainly, it hath proceeded from the <hi>murdering</hi> ſpirit which raigned and ruled in the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of Old, from
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48256:96"/>
whence all ſuch Lawes did and do proceed.</p>
                     <p>Now ye Rulers, chief Prieſts and Inhabitants of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> this we ſhall ſay unto you in the fear of the Lord and Spirit of the Almighty, and in the Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you nor your Law is not to be regarded herein, and your Law is to be broken, and muſt be broken by the Power of the Lord God, and you muſt be judged and condemned by the ſame Power for making ſuch a Law; For the Lord of Hoſts is coming up againſt you, and your Power muſt be ſubdued and taken from you by the Prince of Peace, even by Him who is come, and coming, to rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron; who is come and coming; whoſe <hi>Right</hi> it is <hi>to Rule,</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all Powers</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> unto Himſelf, and to take the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> into his <hi>Own hand,</hi> unto whom it belongs; who will <hi>daſh you to pieces,</hi> ye Rulers, that rebel againſt his <hi>Righteous Power</hi> and his <hi>Holy Law,</hi> that He is Eſtabliſhing in the Earth, in the hearts of the ſons of men, that obey his Voice, and that hearken unto his Counſel, his Righteous and Holy Law muſt be eſtabliſhed, and his Righteous Government and Kingdom muſt be ſet up; and your Unrighteous and Unholy Kingdom and Government muſt be overturned and deſtroyed by the Power of the Everlaſting God, in this day of his Eternal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; who is come, and coming, to make void all your <hi>ungodly, inhumane</hi> and <hi>bloody Laws,</hi> and to reward you according to your works: The Lord God hath ſpoken it, and by Him it ſhall be accompliſhed upon you: for the Decree of the Moſt High is gone out againſt you, ye unmerciful men, whoſe Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and Unrighteouſneſs doth exceed the Nations about you, for <hi>barbarous Cruelty</hi> and <hi>unmanlike Actions:</hi> Have you not altogether loſt your Senſes, Reaſon and Underſtanding, that you are become ſo bruitiſh and ſo unlike Chriſtians? You are gone ſo far in your <hi>Cruelties</hi> and <hi>unnatural Actions,</hi> that you are a <hi>ſtink</hi> and a <hi>loathſom ſmell</hi> to all People, that have the leaſt meaſure of Uprightneſs and of the honeſt Principle ruling in them, and your barbarous and cruel actions and bloody deeds they abhor, and at your Cruelty that you have acted againſt the People of the Lord (who are by you in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers)</hi> many of the common ſort of People do ſtand amazed and wonder to hear of ſuch Cruelty to be acted by ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48256:96"/>
of men, that have made ſuch a noiſe concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, concerning a Church, concerning Miniſtry and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and Church-Government and Ordinances, Preaching, Praying, Singing, Morning and Evening Sacrifices, Family-Duties (as you call them) that ſuch ſhould become ſo bloody and ſo cruel, it doth aſtoniſh many that are called <hi>Heathens;</hi> that all your Preaching, Praying, Singing, making ſuch a noiſe concerning Religion, that it ſhould come to no more, and to produce no better fruits than <hi>Impriſoning, Whipping, Stocking, Burning in the Hand, Cutting off Ears, Baniſhing upon Death,</hi> as you have baniſhed Six already from their Wives and Children, and from their outward beings; So that you do not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſtroy the <hi>Souls,</hi> but <hi>Bodies</hi> alſo. Come, let us know what have they done; what Law of God have they tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that you ſhould baniſh them upon pain of <hi>Death</hi> from their Families? What, was it becauſe their <hi>Converſations</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were honeſt and upright, and yours are evil? What, was it becauſe their <hi>Practices</hi> condemed yours? What, was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>owned</hi> a People that are by you in ſcorn called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> whom you evilly entreat? and ſuch as owns them you baniſh and deſpitefully uſe them.</p>
                     <p>Surely theſe things will be remembred. Come, let us ask you what Rule or Example have you that you walk by? let us hear what you can ſay for your ſelves: What Orthodox men were they that counſelled you to theſe barbarous actions? what Counſellors were they, that would give counſel to Magiſtrates to do theſe bloudy actions? of whom did you learn it? Come, let us hear your ſtrong Reaſons, for the day is drawing near that you muſt be further tried; for the Almighty God hath put it into the hearts of his Servants to try you, whether you will put us to death for diſobeying your unrighteous Law. We that are free-born <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> we demand our Liberty for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our pure Conſciences in this Country, as well as other <hi>Engliſh-men;</hi> we being free-born <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> we may by the Law of God claim our Liberty before many other People: We who are not tranſgreſſors of the Law of God, neither of any Law or Decree that is according thereunto, what is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we ſhould be baniſhed upon Death out of your Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction more than any other people? What, is it becauſe we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48256:97"/>
are turners of the World <hi>up-ſide down?</hi> What, is it becauſe we are termed <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of a People, that are in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers?</hi> What, is it becauſe the Laws of our God, which we obey, are different from all the unrighteous and bloudy Laws of <hi>New-England?</hi> What, is it becauſe we cannot obey the Commandment of the Rulers of <hi>New-England,</hi> that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to bow to the ſpirit that ruled in <hi>Haman,</hi> which now rules in theſe bloudy Rulers of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>New-England?</hi> Nay, I ſay, the Lord our God hath raiſed and is raiſing the Royal Seed and Spirit that ruled in <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that could not, nor cannot ſtoop nor bow to the ſpirit that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in proud <hi>Haman:</hi> I ſay, ſee and behold if the ſame ſpirit rules not in you, ye Rulers, chief Prieſts and Inhabitants of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and elſewhere; mark, if the ſame ſpirit doth not rule you that ruled in <hi>Haman;</hi> who ſought not only the deſtruction of <hi>Mordecai</hi> alone, but ſought to deſtroy all the Seed of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Are you not of <hi>Haman's</hi> off-ſpring, and ruling in his nature, who was ſo cruel and ſo bloody? who did give a ſum of money for deſtroying the Seed of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Mark, what was it for? Becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> could not bow to him, nor do him reverence. Mark, it was not for the tranſgreſſion of any Law of God: yet he diſobeyed the Commandment of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> who raigned from <hi>Judea</hi> even unto <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> over an hundred and twenty and ſeven Provinces. Or, is your Law and Commandment of more force than his was, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould reverence <hi>Haman?</hi> for ſo had the King commanded. Are you greater than he was? Reade the Third of <hi>Eſther</hi> throughout. And yet did not <hi>Mordecai</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his Commandment, in not bowing to <hi>Haman?</hi> at which <hi>Haman</hi> was full of wrath. Is it not ſo with you? are not you mad and ſull of wrath againſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teſtifie to your faces <hi>that your deeds are evil?</hi> Are not you now full of wrath and envy, becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not obey your unlawful Commands and unrighteous Decrees? Now you that are in <hi>Haman's</hi> nature, &amp; ruled by <hi>Haman's</hi> ſpirit, in Cruelty ſeeking and labouring to deſtroy the Royal Seed and <hi>True Jew</hi> from off the Earth in this Country of <hi>New-England;</hi> as <hi>Haman</hi> did labour to deſtroy the Seed of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> within the Kingdom of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> ſo do ye
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48256:97"/>
ſeek to deſtroy the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that are come, or comes into your Juriſdiction; Is it not becauſe they cannot bow to you? Now, did <hi>Mordecai</hi> in diſobeying the King's Commandment, diſobey the higher Power, yea or nay? <hi>unto which every ſoul is to be ſubject for Conſcience ſake: And ſuch as diſobey this Power, diſobey the Ordinance of God.</hi> Give us in your Anſwer ye Rulers and chief Prieſts, you that ſeek and receive Honour from man; <hi>How can you believe that receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not that Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> Well, is your Commandment and Decree of more force to us, than the King's was (concerning <hi>Haman)</hi> to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> ſeeing they are of one nature? We can obey your Commandment no more than <hi>Mordecai</hi> did bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> though the King had commanded it. Now we ſay, are not you preparing a Gallows to hang us thereon, as <hi>Haman</hi> did for <hi>Mordecai?</hi> But take heed, We warn you in the Name of the Lord God, conſider what you are going to do; In the Name of the Lord we demand that we may have Liberty for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our pure Conſciences within your Juriſdiction, aſwel as other <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſeeing that you cannot lay to our charge the tranſgreſſion of any Law of God, we being men that fear the Lord God of Heaven and Earth; and we come not for any thing of yours, God is our Witneſs, it is not for any thing that you have that we come for; for we do not lack any outward thing: for many of us have both Houſes and Land of our own, and Silver alſo in <hi>Old England,</hi> ſo that we ſeek not any thing that you have (God is our Witneſs, whom we ſerve in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, who hath conſtrained us to leave all, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Him) that it is not the World <hi>(that doth periſh with the handling thereof)</hi> that we ſeek or labour for; but the Good and Eternal Welfare of the ſons of men, for the Seed's ſake which is oppreſſed in <hi>New-England,</hi> and other parts of the World, do we labour, and travel, and ſuffer all manner of hardſhips; for Chriſt's ſake are we become fools, and do ſuffer all manner of Evil to be done unto us, as Chriſt ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Diſciples, <hi>they ſhall do all maaner of Evil to you for my Name ſake;</hi> but thoſe that did it, and thoſe that do it, know neither God nor his Son Jeſus Chriſt, neither have they the Love of God abiding in them: <hi>For ſuch as love not him whom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48256:98"/>
they have ſeen, how can they love God whom they have not ſeen?</hi> and ſuch have not Eternal Life abiding in them, but are of the Devil, as their fruits do make manifeſt, and are the thorns of which men cannot gather Grapes, except it be ſuch Grapes as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> did bring forth, which provoked the Holy One, the Moſt High, to ariſe in his Wrath, and conſume them in his Anger.</p>
                     <p>Come, ye Rulers, let us further ask you a Queſtion: Of whom did you receive, or from whence had you your Rule, to Impriſon any for coming to viſit one another? did you finde any ſuch Example in the Scripture, which you call <hi>Your Rule?</hi> did ever any Magiſtrate do ſuch a thing, to impriſon any of the Priſoners Acquaintance or Friends, for onely coming to viſit them? Had not <hi>Paul's</hi> Friends and Acquaintance liberty to come and viſit, and to miniſter unto him? Now you do not only hinder that which the <hi>Heathen</hi> granted, but exceed ſuch in Cruelty which impriſoned <hi>Paul,</hi> who did let his Friends and Acquaintance come to him, and miniſter to him: Now this you hinder, and will not ſuffer any of our Friends nor Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to come to viſit us, nor to miniſter unto us; much more when your Cruelty is become ſo great, to impriſon ſuch as come many miles to viſit us, as you have done <hi>Mary Dyar,</hi> who came from <hi>Rhoad Iſland</hi> to viſit us, and to miniſter to our Neceſſities, if we ſtood in need: Now you do not only hinder any for coming or miniſtring to us, but ſhut ſuch up in Priſon (to be kept cloſe Priſoners) as remember <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Afflictions, whoſe bowels are opened to ſuch whom you diſpitefully uſe: Is this <hi>your doing as you would be done by?</hi> O ſhameleſs men! Are you without all natural affection? What Rule is it you walk by? You ſay that ſhe affirmed, <hi>That the Light within her is the Rule:</hi> But I ſay, <hi>The Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the World, which condemneth the World for evil deeds and unnatural actions,</hi> this Light which is the <hi>Saints Rule</hi> is the <hi>Worlds Condemnation;</hi> this Light was not your Rule for what you have done; ye took not counſel at this Light which is the <hi>Quakers Rule:</hi> for this Light which ſhines in the heart of man, beholding all his actions, this Light doth condemn all blind Perſecutors and Judges, ſuch to be worſe than they that impriſoned <hi>Paul,</hi> who would ſuffer him to ſpeak for himſelf;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48256:98"/>
which many times you are ſo mad you will not ſuffer the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to ſpeak for themſelves,</hi> but you will call to your Officers, to take them away to Priſon.</p>
                     <p>Again, It is written in the Warrant whereby we were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, <hi>that we ſhall be tryed according to Law.</hi> We deſire no more than to be tried according to <hi>Equity, Truth,</hi> and <hi>true Judgment,</hi> to be tried according to the <hi>Law of God;</hi> but your Law, you unjuſt men, we deny to be tried by it; for you are both our Accuſers and Judges: which is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of God; for <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> judgeth and condemneth all <hi>unſound Judgment, Unrighteouſneſs, Partiality</hi> and <hi>reſpecting of Perſons:</hi> Therefore all you Magiſtrates and Rulers (ſo called) ſtoop to the Witneſs of God, and bow to the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, own the Light of the Son of God; for until you own and be led by the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, which leads into Union with God, you cannot judge aright of the things of God. So take heed how you do; for the Line of true Judgment is ſtretched over you all, with which you are meaſured, weighed and tried in the juſt Ballance of Truth, and according to true Judgment you are found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are found, tried and judged by the Spirit of Truth, to be too light: Therefore be awakened all ye Rulers and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and elſewhere within your Juriſdiction, and give over perſecuting the Saints of the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p>This is a Warning to you all in <hi>New-England</hi> who have had a hand in perſecuting the Saints and Children of the Lord, (who are by you in ſcorn and contempt called <hi>Quakers)</hi> Give over your Cruelty, and ceaſe from oppreſſing the Innocent; for the Lord God hath regard unto their Sufferings, and the Lord God is riſen and ariſing to plead their Cauſe againſt all their Enemies, and all their Adverſaries muſt fall before them; for the Lord is with them, and the ſhout of a mighty Prince is among the Innocent People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and this is the day of their Suffering, and the day of your Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Perſecution upon them within this <hi>New-England:</hi> but the day of their Deliverance draweth near, and the day wherein they ſhall rejoyce in the Lord, the God of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is mighty to ſave and able to deliver them out of

the hands, and out of the mouthes of Devourers, and from the Jaws of the Ungodly and Cruel men; who will take Vengeance at that day upon all bloudy-minded men and blind Perſecutors: And at that day you ſhall find that the Lord will be too hard for you, though you now boaſt in your Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. And thus far I am clear, and have cleared my Conſcience to you at this time: And whether you will hear, or forbear, I am clear of your Bloud; I who am now a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer under you, with my Brother and Companion; whoſe Lives are not dear unto us to lay them down as a Witneſs againſt ſuch a <hi>Bloudy,</hi> and <hi>Unrighteous</hi> and <hi>hypocritical Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> and this We are ready to ſeal with our <hi>Bloud</hi> for the breaking of your <hi>Bloudy Law.</hi>

when the light of the Sun is but a little withdrawn, and paſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud; through which if ye wait patiently for the next appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it will ſhine more glorious and higher than before.

Theſe things and more unutterable, will the ſpirit, (whoſe progreſſe is to and fro in the earth) preſent to your view, and feed the carnal withal: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them all in the Light Eternal, and in their moſt glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, they are all but duſt, which is his own meat, whom you are to reſiſt ſteadfaſtly in the power of the Spirit of Faith, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the World; and remember how the Lord did deliver you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in your former journeys, wherein you perfectly ſaw the naked Arm of Gods ſalvation; and He remaines the ſame in Himſelf, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever; although the enemy, while the cloud was over the Ark, (for that is his time to work)</hi> goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <hi>in the airy part,</hi> ſeeking whom he may devour, <hi>did ſtrongly tempt to prevail, as if you were in the wilderneſs of ſin, to lead you back again, in your hearts, into ſpiritual</hi> Egypt; <hi>for it is within he thus ſubtilly works; and I well knowing it, cannot forbear to exhort you in the clean fear of the Lord God, that you with the eye of your mind, retyred out of all things viſible, there to wait ſtill and quiet, and ceaſing from all ſelf-working, may with meekneſſe receive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Might, Dominion, and perfect Strength, againſt all that ever the enemy did appear in; and in this condition of the free ſaving Grace of God, which is appeared for your Deliverance and Teacher, you may learn to grow from grace to grace, into the knowledge of the wonderful works of God, which your forefathers ſaw, and many things happened them for our Enſamples, and are written for our learning Spiritually, and the ſame way you are to travel, as they did who were baptized into</hi> Moſes, <hi>and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, you will find the ſame ſpiritual meat, from the leaſt to the greateſt of you; and he that gathereth moſt, will have none over; and behold I teſtifie (as the leaſt among many Brethren) that

And as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives way to the Temptation of the Deſtroyer, he will grow cold, and his Zeal towards God, and love to his People will wither, and ſometimes be hardly drawn to their Aſſemblies; And all this while he may walk under covert of an outward profeſſion of Truth, yet grow not at all; for having joyned with that in the motion, although not brought forth into the act that hides from the preſence of the Lord, and keeps from ſweet Nouriſhment of the Vine, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all that abides in it to bring forth fruit; as the heat of the Sun cauſeth the tender herb to ſpring. And whoever comes into this condition, the ſingle Eye diſcerns him, and the Faithful goes about mourning, and ſaying, How have ſuch deſiled the Bed of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who once in a great meaſure had eſcaped the Corruptions that are in the World through luſt; and although I am perſwaded better things of you, yet my Beloved Friends, who are dear unto me, as you abide in that which crucifies you to the World, wherein I dearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to abide, as it ariſeth in you, and put it on as a garment of of Righteouſneſs, wherein from faith to faith you may paſſe on, and ſo preach Righteouſneſs, to the old World, and in it you will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as in an Ark, from the Deſtruction, like a flood, that will aſſuredly come upon the World of Ungodly: And in all your tryals and troubles, look and wait for the Power that once delivered you, and again and again it will deliver you from the power of the Dogg, and work mightily in you; that with willing mind you deny all for its ſake, until the Image of the Beloved be formed in you, and you in Him, where in Love ye will be accepted, and the knowledge of his Myſtery, manifeſted in fleſh, in every meaſure of it, is and will be ſo far above all the Glory, Treaſure, and Pleaſure of the Land of Darkneſs, that it will wholly take the Meditations out of them, as if they were not worth the minding no more than droſſe or duſt; yea,

or whatſoever elſe may attend or can come upon thoſe that follow the Light, as Perſecution, Diſtreſs, Affliction, Famine, Nakedneſs, Perils in the Wilderneſs, in the Sea, in the City, yea, or Death it ſelf; I am perſwaded that Gods Armour of Light, as it is lived in and loved, will preſerve them. And I further teſtifie in the Fear of the Lord God, and witneſs with a Pen of Trembling, That the noiſe of the Whip on my Back, all the Impriſonments and Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon pain of Death, and after returning, the loud threatning ſound of an Halter from their mouths, who,</hi> Jezebel-<hi>like, ſate on the Imperious Throne of Iniquity, did no more affright me, through the ſtrength of the Power of God in me, than if they had threatned to have bound a Spiders Web to my Finger; which makes me ſay with unfeigned lips,</hi> Wait upon the Lord, O my ſoul for ever, who hath made known unto me his loving-kindneſs, when I even thirſted for Him, and kept my feet upon the Rock, whilſt the raging Waves of the Sea went over my back; whilſt for the Truth and Cauſe of God's People I have been freely offered up, and am not at all ſtraightned to be baptized for the dead, whether into Death, or otherwiſe; following his Example, who laid down his Life for his Enemies: <hi>And herein the Record in Heaven knows I lye not, and the Witneſs in Earth is bearing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, that I yet do not (as I have not hitherto) ſeek to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my Cheek from the Smiter, nor to turn aſide my feet from the footſteps of the Flock; as witneſs this Chain and Log at my Leg: but do deſire, ſo far as the Lord draws me, to follow my ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Brethren in Suffering and in Joy: Wherefore my ſpirit waits and worſhips at the feet of</hi> Emmanuel, <hi>unto whom I commit my Cauſe, who may work my bodies deliverance; if not, yet the Freedom, Peace, Joy and Patience, which in the midſt of trouble I have enjoyed, and I believe ſhall continue from Him, ſhall fully ſatisfie me; for which let my ſoul, and all that is within me, praiſe him for ever and ever. And I ſhall continue my Exhortation to you, earneſtly deſiring ye may wait to feel the Love and Life of God flow in your particular Veſſels, and therein watch over and ſerve one another; and let the Strong and Faithful among you dwell in the Power, that he may have a Garment ready to cover the Nakedneſs of the Weak; and if the Tares at any time appear, let Wiſdom and the Spirit of Meekneſs be alwayes uſed to ſeparate the

                     <p>ON the 14th of this inſtant here was one <hi>William Leddra,</hi> which was put to Death.

I went to one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who had been of the Jury that condemned him (as he told me himſelf) and I asked him by what Rule he did it? He anſwered me, <hi>That he was a Rogue, a very Rogue.</hi> But what is this to the Queſtion (I ſaid) where is your Rule? He ſaid <hi>he had abuſed Authority.</hi> Then I goes after the <note n="†" place="margin">William Leddra.</note> man, and asked him, Whether he did not look on it as a breach of a Rule, to ſlight and undervalue Authority? and I ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Feſtus</hi> the title of <hi>Honour,</hi> though he was a Heathen (I do not ſay theſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are Heathens.) I ſaid then when the man was on the Ladder (who looked on me, and called me Friend, and ſaid, <hi>Know, that this day I am willing to offer up my Life for the Witneſs of JESUS)</hi> Then I deſired leave of the Officers to ſpeak: and ſaid, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I am a ſtranger both to your Perſons and Country, and yet a friend to both:</hi> and I cryed aloud, <hi>For the Lord's ſake, take not away the man's Life: but remember</hi>
