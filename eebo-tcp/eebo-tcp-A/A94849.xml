            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Liſle</hi> was Preſident, Mr. <hi>Phelps</hi> Clerk, Serjeant <hi>Glyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Summerſet Fox</hi> was firſt called to the Bar, and an Indictment of
High Treaſon read againſt him, for joyning in a traiterous Deſign to
have murdered his Highneſs the Lord Protector and divers of his Council,
Proclaimed <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> King, ſeized on the preſent Guards and Forces,
involved the Nation in a bloody war, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Summerſet Fox</hi> did ingenuouſly confeſs the Charge againſt him upon the
main, to be true, and that he is guilty.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Gerhard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Vowel</hi> were brought to the Bar,
and an Indictment to the ſame purpoſe as that againſt <hi>Summerſet Fox,</hi> read
againſt them.</p>
            <p>They pleaded not guilty, and denyed every thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vowel</hi> ſaid that he required a Jury of Twelve of his equals, it being a
Law confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and according to the ſixt Article of the
Government by the Lord Protector alſo, that Law being not repealed, and
therefore that he might be tryed by his Peers.</p>
            <p>The Lord Preſident told him, That the Members of the Court were his
Peers, not his Superiors but his Equals, and that they were preſent near
twice twelve as he ſaw; And that they are to proceed by the power of an
Ordinance before them.</p>
            <p>It was alſo told him by Serjeant <hi>Glyn</hi> that he had owned the Juriſdiction
of the Court, in pleading <hi>not guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vowel</hi> ſaid, he was a man ignorant in the Law, and deſired advantage might
not be taken of his weakneſs.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſaid none deſired to take any advantage
<pb facs="tcp:111627:3"/>
of any thing, wiſhed they had not brought themſelves into theſe troubles;
that they were there in the name of the Lord Protector and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of <hi>England</hi> to accuſe the Priſoners at the Bar, and to bring in
their proof, and the priſoners were to defend themſelves as well as they
could, And when both ſides were heard, it was to be left to the Court to
determine, and to judge between them.</p>
            <p>And it was declared that the plot was to this effect.</p>
            <p>That the Plot was to ſeize on the Lord Protector and murder him, and
ſome of the Council and others, and Proclaim and bring in <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi>
Son of the late King, to be King, which bloody deſign was to be effected
thus.</p>
            <p>That the firſt hatching of the Plot was in <hi>England</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> who
was one of the cheife plotters, and others; Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> went over
from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> (whom they called their
King) with the Deſign, and Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> about that time went over
to <hi>France</hi> alſo, who had told Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> that he would do nothing in it
until he had firſt had approbation from <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> was alſo
then in <hi>France</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Addreſs was made to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the Deſign made known to
him; deſiring him to communicate it to (him they called) the King, who
accordingly did, and brought Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> to him, But <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> at
the firſt delivered his Judgement in the thing, that he was at preſent unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
at that time to go on in that deſign for three reaſons.</p>
            <p>1 Becauſe it would be diſhonourable to him in the eſteem of other
Princes, in caſe ſuch a thing ſhould be known, and ſhould not be effected,
to come in in ſuch a way.</p>
            <p>2 Becauſe it did not ſeem to him to be feaſable, but unlikely to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>3 Becauſe it was not at that time ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>But Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> afterwards did much encourage and perſwade, That
the deſign might be carried on, and promiſed all aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi> ſtaied
there a while longer, but ſome weeks after came back alſo; Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi>
declared to his confederates here in <hi>England</hi> what overtures had been with
<hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had engaged to ſend ten thouſand
<hi>Scots, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to come with them to land
in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and other places, and that there would be Forces enough ready
to aſſiſt and joyn with them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> the Miniſter was thought on, to have Letters of Credence
from <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> who ſent a Letter to him, and that which he deſired in
caſe the Plot had taken, was to be made the Maſter of <hi>Suttons</hi> Hoſpitall,
which Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> promiſed him.</p>
            <p>One Maſter <hi>Phillips</hi> alſo, and others were treated with about it, and
Maſter <hi>Gerhard</hi> returning from <hi>France,</hi> the Plot was reſolved to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111627:3"/>
carried on, which was to be effected thus.</p>
            <p>1 They were to ſeize on the Lord Protector, and Murder him, and
to do this work they ſhould take the opportunity of his going to <hi>Hampton
Court,</hi> which he uſed to do every Saterday, with a ſmal number ſlenderly
armed; and thoſe that were to do this were Maſter <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John
Gerhard</hi> with thirty Horſe Mr. <hi>Iohn Gerhard</hi> to bring twen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y five Horſe,
and Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> five, which either of them were to engage; Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi>
was ſomething cautious, not to diſcover who they were he engaged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Oath of ſecreſie was given, but twenty five hee had undertaken
for.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hinſhaws</hi> five were himſelf, Mr. <hi>Tuedore</hi> the Apothecary, Mr. <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
Col. <hi>Aldridge,</hi> and another, and then to ſeize on the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and to go on with their work.</p>
            <p>2 If that failed, To ſeize on all the Guards about <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which
they thought two thouſand five hundred ſufficient to do, and carry on their
work here about <hi>London;</hi> and for that purpoſe Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerhard,</hi>
and others viewed the Mews and the reſt, and was heard to ſay, What a
pitty it was that ſo ſlender Guards ſhould not be ſeized on, and that when
the Souldiers were at Nine-pins in the Mews, it was but ſhooting off a
Piſtol, and preſently to fall on.</p>
            <p>3 The laſt way to have it effected to be thus, That when the Foot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
that are for the Guards about <hi>London</hi> were Muſtering in Tuttle
Fields, as they uſe ſeveral times to do, to come into Tuttle-Fields and
meet them there as of their own party, and when they have laid down
their Arms to ſeize upon them, and have others to be ready at the ſame
time every where to perfect the work. And for this purpoſe, if they acted
this way,</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Finch</hi> with a party of two hundred was to fall into <hi>London,</hi> and do
the work in the City.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>John Gerhard</hi> to fall on <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> to fall on the <hi>Mews,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Daniel</hi> with two hundred to fall on <hi>Iameſes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another to fall into <hi>Southwark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one <hi>Billingsly,</hi> a Butcher at Smithfield barres, with a Party to fall
upon <hi>Iſlington;</hi> and it was preſſed that the opportunity might not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>And that the work might be the more feaſable, they conſidered how
as many of the Souldiery as might be, might be engaged in the buſineſſe.
And the Papiſts (who had a great hand in the deſign) gave information

Maſter <hi>Vowel</hi> was cautious being a ſolid man, for his work was not to

            <p>That Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> told one Mr. <hi>Minors</hi> of the buſineſſe, and how

            <p>Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> went on in his Evidence, and ſaid, That Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi>
being at Mr. <hi>Hudſons</hi> houſe, did there ſpeak about the Plot to fall on the
Lord Protector, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That he had diſpute with Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> (whom the ſaid <hi>Wiſeman</hi> calleth
Brother by ſome relation) That ſuch a time, and ſo, and ſo, would be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
(mentioning ſome particulars.)</p>
            <p>That another day he heard Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> ſay, That he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons being then by; and that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not but it would be ſeaſonable, That there were to be about 30 perſons
to fall on the Lord Protector, that his brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> ſaid he was to bring
five, and Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi> 25 to do the work, and named the five aforeſaid that
his Brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> was to bring, and that his Brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> told him
that Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> was to ſurprize the Lord Protectors perſon.</p>
            <p>And when the Plot was diſcovered, he heard his brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> ſay,
that they that were taken were all of <hi>Gerhards</hi> party and none of his, and
that there was a Libel printed to turn the plot on the Lord Protector as is
before expreſt: and that his Brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> had ſome of
the Papers.</p>
            <p>That on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after it was diſcovered he was at Mr. <hi>Vowels</hi> houſe
at <hi>Iſlington<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and his brother <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> was there, and they went to the Kings

on for all it was diſcovered, many Regiments in ſeveral parts being ready
riſe, enough to carry on the work.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Gerhard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Vowel</hi> the Priſoners at the Bar ſtill denyed
all, and ſaid it was not true that he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Edward Hudſon</hi> a Miniſter that is blind was ſworn, who ſaid
that Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> deſired him to write two or three words to the Scots
King, and that Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> related all the buſineſs to him of the deſign,
and the three Objections by <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and P. <hi>Ruperts</hi> anſwer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and the three waies to effect it, very much agreeing with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
afore-mentioned; (<hi>which need not be here repeated again, becauſe it
was the ſame as before</hi>)</p>
            <p>When he came to particulars touching the Priſoners at the Bar, he

and he did agree he knowes not, What hee heard was from Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi>
That they did meet accidentally, That he did ſuſpect Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> to act, but

he could doe, but whether he did any thing or not, he knows not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> denyed ſome things be confeſſed upon oath before Col. <hi>Goff</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the Peace.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Goff</hi> was ſworn, He teſtified that the Examination (which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the Court) was all written from Mr. <hi>Hudſons</hi> own mouth, and
after it was written, it was read to him, to the end that if there had been
any miſtake it might be altered, and was all by him owned upon his oath,
that it was freely teſtified, and nothing in it extorted from him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hudſon ſaid</hi> that he was preſſed, and that he then ſaid theſe words, Do
not thus afflict an old diſtreſſed man, that hath nothing but afflictions upon him.</p>
            <p>To which Col. Goff anſwered, That at firſt Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> denyed all, and
would confeſs nothing until he heard the whole buſineſs confeſſed by another, and that
all that was preſſed to him was to diſcharge his conſcien<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

that when he heard another to confeſs the Plot ſo fully, he deſired to be heard again,

               </hi> M. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> and the 2 Soldiers,
that Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> ſaid there were many Cavaliers in Town in the Plot,
but would never ſpeak two together, that ſome reliſhed it well, others
doubted. But in ſome, that it was agreed to ſeize on the Lord Protector
and the Guards, go with Drums and Cullour to White-hal, and the reſt
of the particulars for bringing in <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> for all the witneſſes do
much agree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſaid Examination he alſo ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> ſaid that they

which they hoped to get from <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and beleeved that he would
accept of it, he being a friend to the King, as they called him.</p>
            <p>That it was propounded to M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> engaged <hi>Billingſly</hi> the Butcher aforeſaid to be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
man, diſcourſed with him of the number of horſe, and <hi>Billingſly</hi>
ſaid to him that the horſes at graſs might be eaſily ſeized.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> told him and <hi>Vowel,</hi> after <hi>Gerhard</hi> was taken, that none
of his party was taken, and that the plot might go on, that the <hi>French,

anſwered, that they were together, and ſuch and ſuch things were ſpoken, but how
far Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> conſented, he knows not.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Robert Dale</hi> was ſworn, who declared againſt Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> the

what Arms he had, he told him two Piſtols, he ſaid he would buy them
of him, he asked for what uſe, he ſaid that he would tel him hereafter.</p>
            <p>That he came with Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſeverall times to his

            <p>That Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> asked him whether he had any Arms to accommodate

            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Hipwel,</hi> one of the two Souldiers in the Plot being ſworn, ſaid,

            <p>That he was examined how ſtrong the Guards were, and that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

which he related to the ſame purpoſe as thoſe before.</p>
            <p>That he was bid to enquire what Cavaliers were in the Regiment, and
among the Souldiery, and drink with them, and do what he could to

The next morning hearing ſome were taken Priſoners, there was

That he made ſome queries about it, but Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> told him, They

And that the Gentleman told him that if the Deſign went
on, he might have money enough, and ſaid that hee would find
him better imployment. The Gentlemans name, hee ſaid, was
<hi>Hinſhaw,</hi> as hee heard afterward. And that hee told him hee
would not bee long before he came again. Hee ſaid that hee did
beleeve they had deſigned to ſeize on the Lord Protector, and all
the Horſe guards. But for his part hee was, when they ſhould
give him notice of it, only to proclaime the King, that was all
that hee was to do.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Barnes</hi> was ſworn, who ſpake of the Deſigne in generall,
much after the ſame manner as thoſe before.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Minors</hi> was the laſt Witneſſe ſworn, who gave evidence,
that Major <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> told him of the Deſigne neer <hi>Covent Garden,</hi>
and one Mr. <hi>Hariſon, Tuedor,</hi> and others, were mentioned. That he
asked him if hee would joyn in it. That afterward hee met with
<hi>Hinſhaw</hi> in the Pallace yard at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who told him of the
Deſigne, as before. And that Major <hi>John Gerhard</hi> was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb facs="tcp:111627:7"/>
a party, and that the buſineſſe was then in good forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but Major <hi>John Gerhard</hi> thought it could not yet be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>And that when Mr. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> heard that Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> was
taken, hee ſaid that hee might thank himſelf, for had not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
it, the buſineſſe might have been done two days before.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners at the Bar were then asked what they had to ſay
for themſelves?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Gerhard</hi> ſaid he was falſly accuſed, and that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
did not ſpeak truth, and denied that he had any thing to do
in the Plot, or knew of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> did require of the Court to bee allowed pen, Inke and
paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Copy of his Charge, and Councill to adviſe him what
defence to make for himſelf. And pleaded <hi>Magna Charta</hi> again,
as before, and the ſixt Article of the Government of the Lord
Protector.</p>
            <p>Sergeant <hi>Glyn</hi> declared, that an Ordinance being declared Law
untill the Parliament ſhall repeal it, is to give the ſame authority
to it which is to an Act of Parliament, every Act being a Law
no longer. That the Laws of old of Treaſon againſt the King
are of force (were this new Ordinance not in being) For it means
the Supream Governour; though it names only a King, it hath
been made uſe of for Treaſon againſt a Queen, and ſo is to bee
touching a Lord Protector, or any other Supream Governour.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> Councill of the Commonwealth, produced in Court
the Government of the Lord Protector, in which that very Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in the concluſion of it, hath a proviſo to the 30th Article.</p>
            <p>The Atturney Generall <hi>Prideaux</hi> declared, that the Charge ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſo fully proved againſt them, yet they could not but
take notice of the ingenuous confeſſion of <hi>Sommerſet Fox;</hi> but
were ſorry to ſee ſuch obſtinacy in the other two, after ſuch a
barbarous and bloody deſigne; that they ſhould ſhew no ſignes
of Repentance: And therefore in behalf of the Commonwealth
prayed for Juſtice from the Court againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Court adjourned into the Painted Chamber, and Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that they ſhould have pen, Inke and paper, and any friend to
come to them that they ſhould deſire in the preſence of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Tower.</p>
            <p>The Court adjourned untill Tueſday next in the afternoon.</p>
