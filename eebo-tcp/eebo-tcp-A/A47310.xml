            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE first and greatest
Duty in Religion, is
sincere Piety towards
God. And next to that is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Gods Vice-gerent,
which all men have Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough to practise, to
make their Passage easie, and
secure through this world, as
well as to save their Souls in
that which is to come. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
both these Duties
to all mens care, is the business
of this Sermon. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be Plain and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in such necessary Points,
to render it more helpful to
<pb facs="tcp:49976:3"/>
mens Practice And the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Honesty of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
together with the
great need our Age has to be
often admonished and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in these Subjects, was that,
I presume, which mov'd several
Worthy persons who were
pleased with it from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
to desire I would make it
more publick from the Press.
I have yielded to their request
in hope it can do no hurt, and
may do some good. And if
thereby any be more instrcted
or setled in these important
Matters, God will receive some
Glory, this Church and State
some Quiet and Establishment,
their own Souls some Benefit
by it, and then I have my end.</p>

               <bibl>MATTH. 22. 21.</bibl>
               <q>Render therefore unto Cesar, the things
which are Cesar's; and unto God,
the things which are God's.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese Words are our Saviour's
Answer to a Question which
some Male-contents and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Zealots among the Jews
put to him, whether <hi>Tribute was to be paid
to the Roman Emperours,</hi> who were the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
God had set over them at that time.
And they contain the just Bounds of Pious
and Religious Loyalty, teaching us how
to maintain an inviolable Duty both to
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Religion towards God
is the chief concern of all wise and good
men, especially of us who are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of it. And Loyalty and due Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the King, will always be the care
of all that duly fear God, or desire to live
at quiet. Both these are indispensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and in themselves can very well
consist together: But yet in the practice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49976:4"/>
of the World, mens Fears for the one, are
most apt to bear them against the other.
And because we have so fresh an instance
of this in the late Rebellion among our
selves, I think it may be very <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>it at this
season to shew men, how they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their care for God, and that without
Rebelling; and also how they are to shew
their assection to their Soveraign, and that
without deserting, or any ways injuring
true Religion.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Princes profess a Wrong Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
nay, sometimes they set themselves
against the True, and persecute Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
And when at any time this is the
Case, our duty to God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and the King seem
as if they were at odds, and look like ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
and inconsistent things. And
then men oft-times think themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from one of them, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve two Masters of contrary Interests,
so that either in Zeal for Religion, they
cast off all duty to their Prince, and turn
<hi>Bigotted Rebels;</hi> or else in compliance with
their Prince, they throw aside true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and their Duty towards God, and turn
<hi>Irreligious Time-servers.</hi> But the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49976:4"/>
of the Case, our Saviour tells
us, is to do neither of these. When Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
happen to have any mis-perswasions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion, we must still pay them all
civil Subjection and Obedience. But our
Loyalty must not carry us to embrace their
Errours, but at the same time we must keep
true to Religion and Gods Service. <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>In discoursing upon these words, I shall</p>
            <p>1. Shew on what ground these Inquirers
thought themselves exempt, and what was the
cause of this Question.</p>
            <p>2. Vnfold the plain determination our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
here gives of it, and shew what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in religious Loyalty and true Christian
Subjection, <hi>so as that there may be no just
cause of Offence, either to</hi> God, <hi>or to the</hi>
King. Render, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I shall shew on what ground these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
thought themselves exempt, and what
was the cause of this Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that was</hi> because they thought they
ought not to be subject to a Prince of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49976:5"/>
This Sect, who sought satisfaction in this
point, were not against <hi>all</hi> Subjection, as if
they would be lawless, and introduce a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
License, having no controuler but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
They would submit to a Prince of
their <hi>own Nation,</hi> as their Fore-fathers had
done to <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon:</hi> Yea,
they would submit to a Prince of a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nation,</hi> provided he would embrace
their Religion and way of Worship, and
espouse <hi>Judaism.</hi> And thus these very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
did at this time: For <hi>Herod</hi> was a
Forreigner, by Country an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> not
<hi>Jewish</hi> born; but because <hi>Idumaea</hi> when it
was conquered was cast into the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
with <hi>Judaea,</hi> and especially because he
turned Proselyte to <hi>Judaism,</hi> and became
an eminent Professor and great Assertor of
their Law and Religion, they made no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
at all of being subject unto him, the
<hi>Herodians,</hi> i. e. the Court-doctors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of <hi>Herod,</hi> coming along with the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> to ask our Lord this Question, as
we are told <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>But they were against paying subjection
to Heathens, who worshipped other Gods,
and were not of the same Religion with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49976:5"/>
themselves. The Soverain Lord of all is
Almighty God, and Princes are onely Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his whom he has deputed; and they
would not esteem any one a right Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
but that worshipped the same God
as they did, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
says<note n="*" place="margin">Antiqu. l. 18. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Josephus</hi> of them, <hi>i. e. The onely Lord
and Leader they owned was God,</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
that owned him; and so they would
not submit to any <hi>prophane</hi> Dominion
which had renounced him, as the <hi>Romans</hi>
did at that time: So that they cast off the
Yoke, not because they would have none
over them, but because they would not be
subject to a Heathen. The <hi>Founder</hi> of this
Sect, which <hi>Josephus</hi> calls the <hi>Fourth Sect,</hi>
was <hi>Judas Gaulonites,</hi> who rose in <hi>Galilee</hi>
in the <hi>days of the Taxing</hi> under <hi>Cyrenius,</hi>
and is called by <hi>Gamaliel Judas of Galilee,
Acts</hi> 5. 37. He was followed by those <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans</hi>
whom, because of their rejecting
the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, <hi>Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
came upon, and slew as they were a
Sacrificing, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1. His Followers lay
much among the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> those zealous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors
of the Mosaick Law and Jewish
Liberties, <hi>with whom,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Josephus</hi> notes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49976:6"/>
               <hi>they accord in all things.</hi> And they were
<hi>Pharisees who came to Christ,</hi> desiring to be
resolved in this point, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Thus did they fancy they ought not to
be subject to the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> because
they were of <hi>another Religion:</hi> And this
being a main point, and our blessed Lord
being a Doctor of greatest Name and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
among them, they come to him
for a confirmation of it. As for other <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi>
they told him they were Temporizers
and Court-flatterers, men of good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
it may be, but of low Spirits, who
although they had the wit to see this truth,
had yet the corrupt carnal Policy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
and dissemble it, because it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
especially having so fresh an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Severity on the Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of it, as <hi>Pilates</hi> slaughter of the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi>
But as for himself, they believed
him to be not onely skilful, but true and
bold too, and that in his Answers he would
speak the truth of things, not what was
like to please persons. And therefore in
this case they would not apply themselves
to others, from whom they could look for
nothing but Art and Secular Compliances,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49976:6"/>
but to him, from whom they had so just
reason to expect the truth it self. <hi>Master,</hi>
say they, <hi>we know that thou art true, and
teachest the way of God in truth, neither ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
thou for any man, for thou regardest not
the person of men. Tell us therefore what
thinkest thou, Is it lawful to give tribute
unto Cesar, or not?</hi> v. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>This opinion then was the occasion of
this Question. I proceed now</p>
            <p>2. To unfold the plain determination,
which our Saviour gives of it, and to shew
what is implied in Religious Loyalty and
true Christian Subjection, <hi>so as that there
may be no just cause of offence, either to</hi>
God, <hi>or the</hi> King. Render, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this determination consists in these
<hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. That we pay all due respect and just
obedience to our Prince, whatever Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
he be of, so that <hi>the Pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must never make us ill Subjects. Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto Cesar the things which are Cesars.</hi>
But still</p>
            <p>2. That at the same time we reserve
all due service, and subjection to Almighty
God; so that when Princes happen to err
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49976:7"/>
in Religion, <hi>the pretence of Loyalty must
never draw us to embrace their Errours, and
become irreligious. Render unto God the things
which are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He tells us we must pay all due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and just Obedience to our Prince,
whatever Religion he be of; so that <hi>the
pretence of Religion must never make us ill
Subjects. Render unto Cesar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>things of Cesar,</hi> or those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which we are to pay our <hi>Prince,</hi> I shall
comprehend under these <hi>three</hi> Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Inward Love and Reverence.</item>
               <item>2. Respectful Speeches and Expressions.</item>
               <item>3. Obedient and Submissive Practice.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. To a Prince all Subjects are bound
to pay <hi>inward Love and Reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They must bear an inward Love and
Kindness, and stand well affected to their
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Persons.</hi> And the natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this will be, that they wish well
to them, and sincerely desire the ease and
happiness of their Reign: That they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to accomplish their own desires,
and make their Reigns easie by their quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49976:7"/>
and dutiful behaviour towards them:
That they be forward to observe their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and to commend what is good in
them, for that shews affection: That they
be prone to conceal, or extenuate what
would bring them to shame, for that is
true love and tenderness towards any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
That they be candid in construing
what is done or said by them, and turn
all, so far as things will reasonably bear,
to such a sence, as may cherish and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a good opinion of them, and the
like. These are real Fruits of Love, and
proper Trials of our Kindness towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person; and therefore are the true ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and surest signs of our being well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards them.</p>
            <p>They must also pay them an <hi>inward
Reverence,</hi> because of their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence.
Render fear to whom fear, honour
to whom honour,</hi> says St<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of
the dues of Kings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. And this
Reverence we shall be thought to show,
when we do not pragmatically intrude our
selves into their Affairs, but by letting them
alone to their own care, shew, we think
them fit to manage their own business.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49976:8"/>
When we pay a modest deference to their
Councils, which we have neither oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
nor skill to judge of, and which
therefore we cannot Censure, without
great Arrogance and Sauciness. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when we behave our selves in their
Presence after a respectful sort, not with
sleightful and contemptuous Deportment,
but with such becoming care, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
an awe for them dwelling upon our
Spirits.</p>
            <p>2. To a Prince all Subjects are bound
to pay <hi>respectful Speeches and Expressions.</hi>
They must not use blunt Reproofs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
Rudeness, when at any time
they are addressing to themselves. <hi>Is it
fit,</hi> says <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job, to say to a King, thou
art wicked? and to Princes, you are ungodly?</hi>
Job. 34. 18. Nor must they use irreverent &amp;
reproachful Speech when at any time they
discourse of them with others. This implies
<hi>two</hi> things, One is, <hi>that they do not speak evil
of their Persons,</hi> being forward to tax, and
aggravate their Faults: The other is, <hi>that
they do not complain and envy against their
Administrations,</hi> delighting to lay out the
Grievances of State, and misguidance of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49976:8"/>
Affairs. Both these were the sins of the
<hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who brought the greatest scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
upon our Religion in the <hi>first</hi> days.
They were always finding fault, as St. <hi>Jude</hi>
says, with the <hi>publick Managements,</hi> being
<hi>Murmerers and Complainers,</hi> v. 16. and
boldly vilifying and reproaching the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of their Governours: <hi>They despise Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,</hi>
says he, <hi>and speak evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Whereas Michael the Arch-Angel,
when he contended with the Devil himself
about the body of Moses, durst not bring against
him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord
rebuke thee,</hi> treating Authority with decent
Speech, even when it was lodged in the
Prince of Darkness, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Thus must all good Subjects refrain from
speaking evil of the persons of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and inveighing against the
publick Grievances and Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Affairs. And this they are
bound to do, not as if the <hi>Persons</hi> and
<hi>Conduct</hi> of all Rulers were so right, that
no fault could be found in them; for there
will be Personal Faults, and Publick Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
so long as Governours are Men:
But because when there are things blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49976:9"/>
in charity to their Persons, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
regard to their Power, we must not
speak evil of them, and inveigh against them
for them. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Ananias
whited Wall,</hi> it was a true Reproach, for he
had deserved that Name by his hypocritical
and unjust usage. But though the Reflection
was true, yet he confesses it was Criminal,
because <hi>it is written, thou shalt not speak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> Acts. 23.
3, 5.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To their Governours all Subjects are
bound to pay</hi> an obedient and submissive
Practice. <hi>Under this I comprehend</hi> three
<hi>things.</hi> 1. That they pay faithfully all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Tributes. 2. That they obey readily all
their just Laws. And 3. that when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey, they suffer patiently without making
Insurrections.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They must pay faithfully all legal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi>
which are imposed on them by their
Country Laws and Authentick Customs;
and which are as much the Princes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
not to be with-held, or defalcated,
without fraud and dishonesty, as every
private mans Estate and Inheritance is
his. <hi>Render to all their dues, tribute to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49976:9"/>
whom tribute, custom to whom custom is due,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. This the
<hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did with exemplary
fidelity and exactness, being as Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
fearful to with-hold any just Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from their Prince, as from their
Neighbors. They durst not pay, indeed,
what was exacted of them for <hi>Idolatrous
Vses,</hi> because that had been to contribute
towards the Worship and Service of Idols.
But <hi>Caetera Vectigalia Gratias Christianis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
&amp;c.</hi> says <hi>Tertullian,</hi> i. e. <hi>As to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Customs, which are every where frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
concealed or with-held by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
we Christians are so strict in paying
them, that though the Gentiles pay Taxes for
Idolatrous uses, which the Religion of us
Christians will not suffer us to do, yet our
punctualness in discharging all State-taxes
so far exceeds theirs, that we pay as much
into the Checquer for civil Impositions, as
the Heathens do for those, and for Idolatrous
too,</hi> Tert. <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 42.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They must readily obey all their just
Laws. Put them in mind to be subject to
Principalities and Powers,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, and
to obey Magistrates,</hi> Tit. 3. 1. And this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49976:10"/>
Obedience is due, whensoever they command
<hi>Lawful</hi> things, <hi>i. e. things unforbidden by a
higher power,</hi> and <hi>which have no Law of
God against them.</hi> To shew a thing <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
it is unreasonable to ask where there
is a <hi>command</hi> in Scripture, and a Law of
God for it: For such a Law <hi>commanding</hi>
it, would not make it a thing <hi>Lawful</hi>
which <hi>may</hi> be done, but a thing necessary
which <hi>must</hi> be done, and cannot be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
But to the lawfulness of things, it
is enough that God has said nothing of
them, and that there be <hi>no Law of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</hi> This is security enough that
they may be done without sin, or any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to him: For he is never offended,
and we never sin, nor shall ever suffer, but
for breaking some Law, and doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he has forbidden. <hi>Whosoever
committeth sin, trangresses a Law,</hi> saith St.
<hi>John, for sin is the transgression of a Law,
1 Joh.</hi> 3. 4. And there must always be a
<hi>Law,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, that worketh wrath;
for where there is no Law, there is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi>
Rom. 4. 15. So that whensoever
they enjoyn <hi>unforbidden</hi> things, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
<hi>Lawful</hi> ones, which no good Subjects
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49976:10"/>
must dispute and question, but peaceably
and readily perform</p>
            <p>3. <hi>When unlawful things are enjoyned,
which they cannot honestly obey, they must
suffer with Patience, and not seek to stave off
Sufferings by making Insurrections.</hi> Whilst
there is any help in Law to prevent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Sufferings, men may claim their <hi>Legal
Priviledges</hi> in their own defence, as St.
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 22. 25. &amp;c. 16. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> did before the <hi>Heathen Magistrates.</hi>
Or if Laws give no redress, they may have
recourse to <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> or any other
peaceable Arts to still a Princes Rage, and
melt him into Justice. But if all peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
methods fail, and there appear no
hope of protection but in <hi>Force,</hi> the Case
is helpless in Humane means, and must be
left to God to redress it. Rebellion is a
thing, which no necessity can excuse, nor
any pretence can authorize: <hi>They that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul, shall receive to themselves
damnation,</hi> Rom. 13. 2. Which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when the Christians had felt some, and
daily feared and expected greater Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and bound up their hands, when
the Scepter presently after was sway'd by
a man, <hi>Nero</hi> I mean, who invaded ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49976:11"/>
mens Estates to supply his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness,
and embrued his hands in the
Bloud of any he had a Pique against, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to Law or Justice; and
was a profest Enemy of the true God,
and raised the first Persecution against the
Christians, as appears from<note n="*" place="margin">Tacit. Annal 15. &amp; Suet. in Vita Ner.</note> 
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> and
<hi>Suetonius,</hi> two approved Historians of
those times: And these are the fairest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that can ever be urged in this case;
so that if they cannot secure us in flying
to Arms against our Governours, nothing
else can.</p>
            <p>All these are <hi>the things of Cesar:</hi> and
whether Princes are good or bad, they are all
due to them. For the ground of their being
due, is not the <hi>moral Endowments</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
because they are men well qualified;
but their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> because
they are the Vicegerents and Ordinance of
God. This God assigns as the reason of
our Duty; not that a Prince is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
or Successful, Wise, or Holy, but
that he is his Deputy. <hi>I have given the
Kingdom to Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> says he, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Nations must serve him,</hi> Jer. 27. 6,
7, 8. <hi>The Powers are ordained of God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49976:11"/>
therefore he that resisteth shall receive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
Rom. 13. 1, 2. and <hi>he is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of God, wherefore you must needs be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
v. 4, 5. <hi>Inde Potestas Caesari unde
Spiritus, illuc suspicientes Christiani,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>It is because God that gave him Breath has
vested him with Power, that we honour and
obey the Emperour,</hi> says <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Apol. c.
30, 31. So that all this Love and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
this respectful Speech and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Practice are due, as to the Best, so to
the Worst of Princes. They must be paid,
not onely where Kings Rule well, and
are wisely sollicitous for the Publick;
but also where they lie steeped in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and hate Business, and not onely
neglect, but oppress the State. They
are due to Princes of the most opposite
Religions: for this is the very Case de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the Text; the <hi>Jews</hi> denying
Tribute, as was said, to the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi>
because they were Heathens.
Nay, they are due, not onely to Princes
that <hi>profess</hi> a false Religion, but also to
those who <hi>impose</hi> it, and <hi>Persecute</hi> the true
Religion. For so <hi>Nero</hi> did, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
yet at least, soon after St. <hi>Paul,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49976:12"/>
the pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> had required
all Christians to <hi>be Subject,</hi> Rom. 13.
And so also did the other <hi>persecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi>
that succeeded him, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were a noble spectacle of Bleeding,
but persevering and unconquerable Loyalty
to all the world.</p>
            <p>As for this tryal of Persecutions, God
be thanked it is not our case: For our
Laws protect the true Religion, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all that dissent from it. And our
King has graciously assured us, that he will
govern by Laws, yea preserve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Laws themselves, both in
Church and State, as they are now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
            <p>But where that is truly the Case, as it
was with the Christians in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
days, and the <hi>Primitive Persecutions;</hi> and
as it is still with the <hi>Forreign Protestants</hi>
in Popish Countries, but especially in
<hi>France.</hi> Yet will not this Persecution of
the true Religion, exempt Subjects from
any Branch of the foresaid Duties. They
must bear Honour and Reverence, and
speak of them with Respect, as well as
with Truth and Justice, and pay faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49976:12"/>
all Legal Tributes, and obey cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all their just Laws, and live quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, without raising any Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to defend and secure even their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and themselves, under all Princes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>Nero, Dioclesian,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> that not
onely profess, but espouse and forcibly
propagate a false Religion, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the best and most Orthodox and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings. So that <hi>the pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
can never authorize any men to be ill Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Render unto Cesar the things which
are Cesars,</hi> says our Saviour in this very case
to those who inquired <hi>how they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves under Princes of a wrong
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilst we are thus careful to pay
all due Respect, and just Obedience to
our Prince, whatever Religion he be of,
so that <hi>the pretence of Religion never make
us ill Subjects.</hi> We must take care still
further,</p>
            <p>2. To reserve at the same time all due
Service and Subjection to Almighty God;
so that when at any time Princes happen
to err in Religion, the <hi>pretence of Loyalty
must never draw us to embrace their Errours,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49976:13"/>
and become irreligious.</hi> When we do any
thing else in compliance with Soveraign
Princes, yet must we not sin against God
for their sakes: For Princes, how high so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are above us, are yet under him
as his mere <hi>Deputies</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Ministers,</hi> and he
is still the Soveraign Prince; so that our
respect to them must never carry us to his
prejudice, <hi>Render unto God the things which
are Gods,</hi> is the other part of our Saviours
Answer in this case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>things of God</hi> are the <hi>things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
And the Religion, which God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
is not always the same with that
which the Prince doth. In our own case,
God be thanked, they meet. For our
Laws fetch Religion from the Scriptures,
and establish the same that Christ himself
has there established. And our King has
given us his Royal Word, that he will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by Laws, and maintain them, and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
defend and support the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
But in other places among our
neighbour Nations, the Laws of Religion,
and the Laws of the Land, thwart and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
each other. And so they did when
our Religion was first planted, in the days
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49976:13"/>
of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> and so they continued to
do in the succeeding Ages, and may still
happen to do in all times. But when that
is the case, this close adherence to the
Rules of true Religion is still the inviolable
Right of God, and no Powers on Earth
must ever drive us from them.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>things of God,</hi> or those things
which are due to him in Religion, I shall
reduce to these <hi>three</hi> Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A belief of his Revelations.</item>
               <item>2. Worshiping him according to his own
Rules.</item>
               <item>3. The service of a good Life, and an
upright Practice.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The first thing of Religion due to
God, is <hi>a belief of his Revelations.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he declares, we must all give abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
credit to, because all that believe a
God, believe he is infinitely true, and can
never deceive men. Nay, in matters of
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> we must give credit
to him alone, because he onely knows the
terms of his own Mercy, and how he will
bring us all to Heaven. In <hi>these</hi> Points, we
are not to believe an <hi>Apostle</hi> himself, if he
should not speak from him: For they, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49976:14"/>
St.<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> said, had <hi>not dominion over mens
Faith,</hi> to make them believe any thing;
but were onely as <hi>Messengers</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1. &amp; 9. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of Gods Word,</hi> and so could declare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what he had told them. And
much less should we believe either <hi>him</hi> or
an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> if he should not
onely speak to us without Book, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and contradict Gods own Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
<hi>Though an Angel from Heaven preach
any other Gospel than what we have preached
unto you,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let him be accursed,</hi> i. e.
look on him as if he were anathematized,
and come not near him, nor give any heed
to him, more than you would to one that
is thrown out among Heathens and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
excommunicated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. So that
if the Laws of any Country require men
to give their assent to <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>absurd</hi>
Opinions, as they do among <hi>Heathens</hi> and
<hi>Mahometans;</hi> or to believe quite <hi>contrary
to the Scriptures,</hi> as they do in <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> where all men are compelled to
believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and to profess a
Church <hi>Infallible,</hi> which had evidently <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced</hi>
and <hi>taught</hi> a number of <hi>Falshoods:</hi>
they not onely <hi>need not,</hi> but they <hi>ought not</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49976:14"/>
to comply with them. They must trust
God before any Princes on earth when they
happen to contradict him. It is Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
to govern our Faith, and that must
not be given up to any others.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>second</hi> thing in Religion due to
God, is <hi>worshiping him according to his
own Rules.</hi> This is another of Gods Rights.
For his <hi>adorable Excellencies,</hi> and <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over us,</hi> claim our Worship; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
alone can prescribe it. The end of it is
to honour and please him; and what will
do that is best known to himself; so that
his Worship must be of his own prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
and we must never attempt to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in a way forbidden. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any Powers on earth should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us to worship God in a way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what he has required, therein they
are not to be obey'd. Thus the <hi>Heathens</hi>
required the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> to <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to their Gods,</hi> and to <hi>Swear by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Genius.</hi> And thus in <hi>France,</hi> and
in other <hi>Popish Countries,</hi> the poor <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
are required, among other things of
like sort, to <hi>pray to Saints,</hi> and <hi>adore Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and <hi>worship the Host,</hi> and <hi>take up with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49976:15"/>
a maimed Sacrament</hi> receiving the <hi>Bread</hi>
onely without the <hi>Cup,</hi> and <hi>address to God
in a Latine Service which they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi>
and <hi>from whence they can expect
to reap no profit.</hi> All these ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
are directly opposite and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Gods Rules; and therefore were just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and <hi>necessarily</hi> rejected by Gods faithful
Servants. For here, notwithstanding their
Princes Command, they might and ought
to reserve themselves to Almighty God,
this being his Province.</p>
            <p>3. A third thing of Religion due to God,
is <hi>the Service of a good Life, and an upright
Practice.</hi> This is what God indispensibly
requires of men in all Religions, and which
they must be most careful to pay to him
inviolably in all times. So that if any
Powers should require to be served by
<hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Falshood,</hi> by <hi>Rapine</hi> or <hi>Bloodshed,</hi>
if they would have men stop at no bounds,
nor scruple at any wickedness which serves
their ends; their Subjects or Dependants
must not hearken, but here obey God who
is a greater King than they.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>things of Religion;</hi> and
these are reserved to God as his things,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49976:15"/>
which are put without the controul of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
so that we must not comply when at
any time they invade them. Thus the <hi>three
Children</hi> would not worship the <hi>Golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
for all the strictness of the <hi>Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
Dan. 3. 4, 15, 16, 18. and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
would not <hi>omit his daily Prayers to God,</hi>
notwithstanding thereby at his utmost pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
he broke <hi>Darius</hi>'s <hi>Royal Edict,</hi> Dan. 6.
7, <hi>ad</hi> 10. And when Christ had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Apostles<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>to go and preach to all
Nations,</hi> they would not desist when the
<hi>Jews</hi> forbid it, <hi>saying, Whether it be right
in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more
than unto God judge ye,</hi> Acts 4. 17, 18, 19.
and the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> those renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Patterns of Loyalty, though they would
never raise Rebellions against their Princes,
yet stood out in a continual and invincible
breach of their wicked Laws, refusing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
either to <hi>Curse Christ,</hi> or to <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to Idols,</hi> when they were required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by their Heathen Governours. When
any Kings Laws run thus against Gods
Laws, non-compliance and holding out is a
grace, which the more resolved it is, the
better it is. Nay, that <hi>Boldness</hi> and <hi>undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49976:16"/>
Face</hi> in opposition, which in case of
lawful Impositions, is a most <hi>criminal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi>
is in this case a <hi>peculiar Gift of the
Holy Ghost,</hi> which was beg'd by the <hi>Apostles</hi>
when under the Threatnings of the <hi>Jewish
Rulers,</hi> they desired <hi>Grace to speak the word
with boldness,</hi> Acts 4. 29. which, according
to that Prayer, was afterwards most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in <hi>themselves</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors;</hi>
which God still bestow'd when he
call'd men to suffer for him in <hi>after Ages:</hi>
and which I doubt not but he will still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
when he shall please to call any Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to suffer for him, to the end of the
World.</p>
            <p>Thus are the things of Religion Gods
things, wherein all men are still to follow
him, though the Powers of the World being
erroneously mislead, should have the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
both to practise themselves, and to
injoyn their Subjects too to practice other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>The onely Caution I think fit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this case is, <hi>that we do not make those
things Religion which are not so,</hi> as <hi>not Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Communion, not using the Cross in
Baptism, not joyning in a Form of Prayers,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49976:16"/>
and the like. True Religion doth not stick
at these and such like indifferent things:
For God makes Religion, and he has no
where forbid the use of them, but may be
served by them as <hi>truly,</hi> and oft-times more
<hi>becomingly</hi> than without them. So that when
our Governours require onely such things
as these, they intrench not at all upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the Rights of God, but we may
lawfully obey them, and then we must do
it. If they command against him, in that
we are to desert them, because we are to
follow him in Religion. But then we must
take care, that what we call Religion be
not a point of mans Invention, that it be
some Article of the holy Scriptures, and
not of our own Fancy, some thing which
is a Religion of Gods, and not of our own
making.</p>
            <p>Thus must we hold firm to God in things
of Religion; and therefore <hi>as the pretence
of Religion must never lead any to be ill Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
So neither,</hi> when Princes happen to
be mislead in Religion, <hi>must the pretence of
Loyalty ever draw them to err and be ill Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
When Subjects are most Loyal to
their Prince, in paying him all Honour, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49976:17"/>
Obedience, and submissive Carriage, they
must not embrace his Errours, nor conform
to his Opinion and Practice in Religion, if
they happen to be different from what the
Scripture teaches. This is no act of disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to a Prince, to be true to Almighty
God, and both to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> as he
would have us. All Loyalty to the King
must consist with true Religion towards
God, since the King is onely God's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent.
This was the belief of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ,</hi> and of his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and of all
the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Servants of God in all Ages.</hi>
And it will always be the opinion of every
man, whose Conscience is not debauched
with Atheistical Principles, but knows he
has a <hi>God</hi> as well as a <hi>King</hi> to serve.</p>
            <p>Having thus stated what are the <hi>things
of God,</hi> and what the <hi>things of Cesar,</hi> and
shown how the pretended care and zeal
for the one can never exempt us from the
other; I shall now very briefly exhort you
to a careful observance of what has been
delivered, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>Since God and the King then must both
have what belongs to them; and God,
who is most jealous of his own Honour,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49976:17"/>
will not have mens Zeal even for that to
transport them against the just Rights of
<hi>Cesar;</hi> let me exhort all that hear me to
have a watchful eye to both these, and
that what God has put together, they
would not set asunder. Be careful to give
God all the Honour that is due to him,
and to do it with Constancy, Zeal, and
Affection. But when you are most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the Honour of God, be careful to
preserve an inviolable Duty to your Prince
too, who is <hi>Gods Vice-gerent.</hi> Shew your
selves hearty and steady <hi>Protestants,</hi> that
is Gods Cause, wherein you may and
should be zealous; but at the same time
be sure to shew your selves <hi>good Subjects,</hi>
and <hi>good Christians.</hi> Let not your Zeal
for Protestancy bereave you of your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
or Christianity, and make you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
either your Duty to your Governours,
or that Charity which you owe your
Neighbours; even those who are most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
in Religion to your selves. This is
to act by a Primitive Spirit like sincere
Servants of Christ, and true Members of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> to whose Eternal
Honour it may be said, that the Clergy,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49976:18"/>
and true Members of it, beyond what is
ordinary in other Churches, are careful
to shew such a just and well-governed
Zeal for Almighty God, as dare not fly
in the Face of the King, or be unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly
violent against their Brethren for
Gods sake. They are, and by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
should be zealous against Popery.
But at the same time they are zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Rebellion and Disloyalty, one of
the most mischievous things in Popery, and
against all unchristian usage and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
to men of different Perswasions,
which the unbridled Zeal of Papists and
Sectaries too commonly transports them
to.</p>
            <p>And then, as for you my <hi>Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
who are intrusted with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of Religion, let me particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the things of God and Religion
to your care, that you would labour to
make men true to God, that they may be
true to the King for Gods sake. Stir them
up, not onely to like Religion, or to be
<hi>Luke-warm,</hi> which God<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 3. 16.</note> told <hi>the Church
of Laodicea</hi> was <hi>loathsome;</hi> but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
and zealous in it. And that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49976:18"/>
may not be all Heat without Light, nor
their Zeal outrun their Knowledge; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to possess them with right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it, letting them see that Religion
lies in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> in <hi>Believing
all the Articles of the Creed,</hi> and <hi>Keeping
the Commandments and Laws of God.</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them not to place <hi>Religion</hi> in little
things, to embrace Shadows for a Substance,
and to think either to please or displease
God by such frivolous and inconsiderable
things, as are unworthy of any Wise
mans Notice; which needless Scrupulosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mind, will not onely prove a Snare
to themselves, but inevitably render them
troublesome to their Governours, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
detrimental to the Publick Peace. And
when they are thus rightly instructed in
<hi>Religion,</hi> and made true to Almighty
God; be diligent to weed out all Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principles, to make Civil Subjection
as necessary a part of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and
as much a Point of Conscience, as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Gods immediate Service. In a
word, to let them see the Necessity, the
Duty, and the Benefit of being inviolably
Loyal and true to the King too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49976:19"/>
I know the Judgements of great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are preposessed on the wrong side,
and leavened with ill Principles, instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by cunning Seducers into many well-meaning
but unwary Minds, both about
the things of God, and of the King too.
For as for the things of the King, through
an habitual and indulged License, many
are come without regret to question any
thing that is in favour of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
to put remote and Imaginary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
in Bar of present, real, and unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Duties; to Cavil and Dispute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
when they should be shewing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
nay, to avow such Principles as
inevitably unsettle any State, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
the most bare-faced Rebellions, as,
God knows, we have newly felt by sad
Experience; which would have been
much sadder still, had not the Wisdom
and Goodness of God confounded the
Craft, and defeated the mischievousness
of men, in our late happy, speedy, and,
in appearance, intire Deliverance from
them. And then as for Religion, great
numbers of those who are concerned for
it, either place it in trifling Truths, or in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49976:19"/>
grounless and untrue Opinions; and where
they are most mistaken, they are usually
most confident and concerned, and shew
more Zeal for those empty and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nothings where they think wrong,
than for all the grand and importan Truths
of their Religion where they believe
right. These ill Weeds have in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
marr'd the Soyl which I am entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you to cultivate. And what pains it
may have cost others to sow these evil
Seeds, and give them root, I know not:
But now they are in posession, and are
rivited in the Minds of Men, I know it
will cost you much Pains and Patience too,
to pluck them out. But this, my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Brethren, though it will exercise
your care, yet must not discourage it.
Let not us shew less diligence to cure
Mens Minds, than others have done to
corrupt them. Let not the goodness of
our Cause suffer through our remisness,
and want of care in managing it. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Religion and Loyalty are true and
mighty, and will prevail at last. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your care and pains, who are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Advocates for them, and are of all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49976:20"/>
men, as most concerned, so best sitted to
uphold them, they will not be prevalent.
May the Almighty God daily increase your
Zeal, and both direct your Labours, and
prosper them in so good a Work: That
you may not onely be rewarded for the
honesty of your Endeavours, when Jesus
Christ <hi>the Chief Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> of
the Church, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4. &amp; 1 Pet. 2. 25.</note> styles him, shall
come at last; but may at present see the
Fruit, and rejoyce in the Success of them
too. <hi>Amen.</hi>
