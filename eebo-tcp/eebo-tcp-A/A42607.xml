            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>General</hi> CONSIDERATIONS <hi>relating to a Bill for</hi> Regulating the Abuſes of Priſons and pretended Priviledg'd Places; <hi>as far as relates to the Priſons.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UNTIL all Men are enabled to pay their Debts, <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor</hi> will be at Variance; (for generally both think themſelves injur'd and as the preſent Circumſtances of the Nation are, (there being five times more Debts than there is Ready Money to pay, as is very preſumptive from the many attempts to ſet up Paper-Credit) 'Tis humbly ſubmitted, whether a Law of more <hi>Mercy</hi> then is now in being, or a Law of greater <hi>Severity</hi> may be thought more proper.</p>
            <p>It is not unfit to be remembred, that by the <hi>Common Law</hi> Men's Bodies were not liable to be Confin'd for Debt ; and the Statutes which have ſince made 'em ſubject, are not only more ſevere than the antient Common-Laws, but than the Laws in other Countrys, which provide in ſome caſes, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſhall Maintain his Debtor in Conſinement.</p>
            <p>The Priſons of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Fleet</hi> being the immediate Priſons of the Great Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> Perſons Arreſted in all parts of the Kingdom have therefore frequently remov'd their Bodies to thoſe <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Priſons,</hi> where their Cauſes in Law and Equity are finally determinable: And the Statute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. Cap.10. reſerving Liberty to the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> the Marſhal of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> being likewiſe adjudged to be within the Equity of the ſame) to take Security for true Impriſonment; The Courts have thought it an equal Advantage both to <hi>Debtor</hi> and <hi>Creditor,</hi> that the Priſoners, by <hi>Day-Rules,</hi> &amp;c, ſhould have a Qualify'd LIBERTY (in Term-time at leaſt) to ſolicite their Law Affairs, and diſpoſe of their Eſtates and Effects to the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>The Miſchiefs intended to be regulated are <hi>Eſcapes</hi>; Which ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen at the worſt to be any more then the Suſpenſion of the payment of the Debt, the Remedy being already ſufficient againſt the <hi>Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Warden</hi> and their <hi>Superiors</hi>: For</p>
            <p>If either Marſhal of Warden gives greater Liberty then the Law allows, or the Priſoners abuſe that Liberty, they and their Superiors are liable, as the Law now ſtands ; And Debts have been often paid by theſe means, and by the benefit of Securities they have taken, when the Priſoners were wholly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent : of which many and frequent Inſtances might be given. But 'tis highly probable, if this Bill paſs ; thoſe Priſoners that are truſted no farther then by Law they might, will take advantage, and perhaps their Securities too, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for ever out of the reach of the Law ; <hi>which, by the way,</hi> may be of very ill Conſequence to the <hi>Creditors,</hi> as well as to the Marſhal and Warden.</p>
            <p>If all Security-Bonds are taken away, the Marſhal and Warden will be obliged to Conſine all their Priſoners within the Walls: And there being ſo many Thouſand Priſoners already belonging to both Priſons; and in the adjacent Streets, as yet part of the Priſons by Rules of Court, for the more wholſom keeping of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; and not above 160 Chambers in both Priſons to receive them, it will be impoſſible to diſpoſe of them in ſo ſmall a compaſs.</p>
            <p>The Priſons being now too Narrow to contain the Priſoners already Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what large Buildings, and vaſt Guards muſt be requiſite to keep thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Shoals of Men, who in all likelyhood will become Priſoners, when the <hi>Mint, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> are diveſted of their pretended Priviledg?</p>
            <p>Admitting ſuch a Collection, one need only hint the Noiſomneſs, the Diſeaſes, the Miſery of ſo many unfortunate People, ſo cloſely huddled together, wanting the <hi>conveniences</hi> perhaps even the <hi>Neceſſaries of Life</hi> : And what attempts againſt any Government they wou'd ſtick at, rather then endure their perpetual Doom to <hi>Poverty, Confinement, Stench</hi> and <hi>Vermin.</hi>
