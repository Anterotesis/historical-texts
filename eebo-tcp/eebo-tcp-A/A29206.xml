            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93747:6"/>
using of Arms, but the relying upon our Arms, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

As our Saviour saith of Riches, <hi>How hardly shall a rich
Man enter into the Kingdome of Heaven?</hi> that is one
that trusts in his Riches, We may not Deify our Bow,
nor make an Idoll of our Sword. The Sword and the
Bow were anciently the Princes of offensive Weapons,
the Sword at hand, the Bow a farre off, as <hi>Iacob</hi> said
to <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 22.</note> 
               <hi>I will give the one portion above thy Brethren;
which I tooke out of the hand of the</hi> Amorite, <hi>with my
Sword and with my Bow.</hi> Among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> a ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Bow was the <hi>Hieroglyphicke</hi> of W<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rre, and a
Bow broken or unbent did signify a Cessation of Arms:
So we read that the very night that King <hi>Attila</hi> dyed,
<hi>Martianus</hi> the Emperour did see <hi>Attila's</hi> Bow broken,
which did betoken that the Warres were now at an end.
God himselfe is contented sometimes to borrow a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
from the Bow, to expresse his own power, He
hath bent his Bow and made ready his <unclear>Arrowes</unclear>. Who
hath not heard of <hi>Asters</hi> Bow and his Arrow, which
he sent to King <hi>Phillip,</hi> with this inscription, <hi>After
Philippo?</hi> a shrewd Message which cost <hi>Philip</hi> his Eye.
The <hi>Parthian</hi> Bowes were more feared of the <hi>Romane
Legions,</hi> then all <hi>Archimedes Mathematicall</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And ou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> English gray Goose Wing, hath been
as terrible in former times to our Neighbour Nations.</p>
            <p>Next for the Sword. Among the <hi>Scythians</hi> their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Oath was by their Sword,<note place="margin">Am. Mar.</note> as the <hi>Turkish Sultans</hi>
used to sweare by their <hi>Cimiters.</hi> The <hi>Alani</hi> had not
a Church, nor a Chappell, nor so much as a Cottage
but it <unclear>had a</unclear> Sword fastered in the ground, with barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and superstitious Ceremonyes, as their Tutelary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93747:6"/>
God. When God had expelled <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
it is said that he placed a slaming Sword at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
thereof, to keep the way of the Tree of Life.
And our Saviour saith of himselfe, that he came not to
send Peace but a Sword. So then the Bow and the
Sword do signify all kind of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and Military preparations, which serve either
at hand ora farre off, as Powder, shot, Gunnes, (which
are the successors of Bows,) Pikes, yea, even shippes
and Fortes. <hi>For I will not trust in my Bow, it is not my
Sword that shall helpe me.</hi> How, not helpe me? No, not
of themselves: as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> answered the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
when she cryed out <hi>helpe my Lord O King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 26.</note> so may

Salvation, when God doth not only preserve us
from our Enemyes, but also converts their Enmity to
our good; and lastly, makes their opposition to us, to be
a meanes of their own confusion. That's the last step
in my Text, <hi>And puttest them to consusion that hate us,</hi>
First to shame and confusion of Face, this is that in part
which the Scripture calls heaping Coales of Fire upon
an Enemies Head, to make his Cheeks glow with
shame, and to scorch him inwardly with the testimony
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

higher to harted, that is, to habituated malicious Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so as there is no more hope of his Conversion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<hi>periisse puto cui pudor periit,</hi> past shame past

that is utter Ruine and Destruction, <hi>And puts

            <p>Now you have the sense of my Text, I will not shred
it any more into little parcells, Take five Observations
which are as pertinent to the time and occasion, as they
flow naturally from the Text.</p>
            <p>1. That the People of God shall never want Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and such as hate them in this World.</p>
            <p>2. That therefore it is Wisedome to have in
readinesse Bows and Swords, that is, all manner of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
preparations.</p>
            <p>3. That when we have store of warlike Provision, yet
we must not place our confidence in our Arms, not
make them as Idols: <hi>For I will not trust in my Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That our only defence from danger is the name
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93747:8"/>
of the Lord, our onely dependence ought to be upon
our God. <hi>But it is Thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That in lieu of his Protection and our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
God expects <hi>Vitulos labiorum,</hi> the Calves of our
Lippes, (as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> calls them) that is, a
thankfull acknowledgement of his favours. This brings
my Text home to the present occasion, <hi>For I will not
trust in my Bow, it is not my Sword that shall help me.
But it is Thou that savest us from our Enemies, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
them to confusion that hate us.</hi> Of these in Order.</p>
