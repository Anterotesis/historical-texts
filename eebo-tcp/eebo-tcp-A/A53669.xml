         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
but thy Good,
and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the
Truth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as laying aside that Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
alone: I could desirously
<pb facs="tcp:47790:4"/>
have been excused from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of those <hi>Hours</hi> which were
spent in its Composure, so in
the Work it self, I admitted of
no one thought, but how the
things treated of in it, might,
and ought to be mannaged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy spiritual Benefit and
Advantage. Other designs most
men have in writing what is
to be exposed to publick view,
and lawfully may have so; in
this I have nothing but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thy Good. I have neither been
particularly provoked, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Adversaries of the
Truth here pleaded for; nor
have any need from any self
respect, to publish such a small
plain discourse as this; Love
alone to the Truth, and the
<pb facs="tcp:47790:4"/>
welfare of thy soul, have given
Efficacy to their <hi>importunity</hi>
who pressed me to this small ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>The matters here treated of,
are on all hands confessed to be
of the greatest moment; such
as the Eternal welfare of the
souls of men, is immediately
and directly concerned in. This
all those who believe the Sacred
Truths here proposed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
do unanimously profess
and contend for; nor is it denyed
by those by whom they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
There is no need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give thee any especial
Reasons to evince thy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in these things, nor the
greatness of that concernment,
thereby to induce thee unto their
<pb facs="tcp:47790:5"/>
serious consideration. It were
well indeed that these great,
sacred, and mysterious Truths,
might without contention or
controversies about them, be left
unto the Faith of Believers as
proposed in the Scripture, with
that Explanation of them which
in the ordinary Ministry and
Dispensation of the Gospel is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and required.</p>
            <p>Certainly these tremendous
Mysteries, are not by us willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be exposed, or prostituted
to the Cavils of every perverse
<hi>querist,</hi> and disputer; those
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Wisdom, indeed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
darkness and folly, God
hath designed to confound and
destroy in them and by them.
<pb facs="tcp:47790:5"/>
For my part, I can assure thee,
<hi>Reader,</hi> I have no mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and dispute about these
things which I humbly adore
and believe as they are revealed.
It is the Importunity of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
in their Attempts to draw
and seduce the souls of men from
the Truth and Simplicity of the
Gospel in these great Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of it, that alone can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any to debate upon, or <hi>eristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
to handle these awful Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
This renders it our Duty,
and that indispensibly, in as much
as we are required to <hi>contend
earnestly for the Faith once
delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
But yet also when this necessity
is imposed on us, we are by no
means discharged from that
<pb facs="tcp:47790:6"/>
humble Reverence of mind,
wherewith we ought alwayes to
be conversant about them; nor
from that regard unto the way
and manner of their Revelation
in the Scripture, which may
preserve us from all unnecessary
intermixture of litigious or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick
Phrases and Expressions,
in their Assertion and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I know our Adversaries
would upon the matter decry
any thing peculiarly Mysterious
in these things; although they
are frequently, and emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Scriptures affirmed so
to be. But whilest they deny
the Mysteries of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which are such as every
may become the glorious <hi>Being</hi>
and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, they are
<pb facs="tcp:47790:6"/>
forced to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sign such an <hi>aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>
sense unto the Words,
Expressions and Propositions
wherein they are revealed and
declared in the scripture, as
to turn almost the whole Gospel
into an <hi>Allegory,</hi> wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is properly expressed, but
in some kind of Allusion unto
what is so elsewhere; which ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
way of proceeding, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing certain in what is
or may be expressed by Word
or Writing, is covered over
with a pretence of <hi>Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
which utterly refuseth to be
so employed. These things the
Reader will find afterwards
made manifest, so far as the
nature of this brief discourse
will bear. And I shall only
<pb facs="tcp:47790:7"/>
desire these few things of him
that intends its perusal. First,
That he would not look on the
subject here treated of, as the
matter of an ordinary Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in Religion.
<q>
                  <l>—Neque enim hic levia aut

            </p>
            <p>They are things which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and directly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
concern the eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the souls of men; and
their consideration ought alwayes
to be attended with a due sense
of their weight and importance.
Secondly, Let him bring with
<pb facs="tcp:47790:7"/>
him a due Reverence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Infinite, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
nature of God, as that
which is not to be prostituted
to the captious and sophistical
scanning of men of corrupt
minds, but to be humbly adored
according to the Revelation
that he hath made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Thirdly, That he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to submit his Soul and
Conscience, to the plain and
obvious sense of Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and Testimonies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seeking out Evasions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses
for unbelief. These Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
I cannot but judge equal,
and fear not the success, where
they are sincerely complyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47790:8"/>
I have only to add; that in
handling the Doctrine of the
Satisfaction of Christ, I have
proceeded on that Principle,
which as it is fully confirmed
in the Scripture, so it hath
constantly been maintained and
adhered unto by the most of
those, who with Judgement and
Success have managed these
Controversies against the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
And this is that the
Essential Holiness of God, with
his Justice or Righteousness, as
the Supream Governour of all,
did indispensibly require that
sin should not absolutely go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished;
and that it should do
so, stands in a Repugnancy to
those Holy Properties of his
Nature. This I say, hath been
<pb facs="tcp:47790:8"/>
alwayes constantly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by far the greatest number
of them, who have throughly
understood the Controversie in
this matter, and have success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
engaged in it. And as
their Arguments for their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
are plainly unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
so the neglect of abiding
by it, is causelesly to forego
one of the most fundamental
and invincille Principles in our
Cause. He who first laboured
in the defence of the Doctrine
of the Satisfaction of Christ,
after <hi>Socinus</hi> had formed his
imaginations about the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he wrought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to dispute about it, was
<hi>Covetus,</hi> a Learned man, who
laid the foundation of his whole
<pb facs="tcp:47790:9"/>
Disputation in the Justice of
God, necessarily requiring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
the punishment of sin.
And indeed the state of the
Controversie as it is laid down
by <hi>Socinus,</hi> in his Book <hi>De
Jesu Christo servatore,</hi> which
is an Answer to this <hi>Covetus,</hi>
is genuine, and that which
ought not to be receded from,
as having been the direct ground
of all the Controversial Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
on that subject, which
have since been published in
<hi>Europe.</hi> And it is in these
words laid down by <hi>Socinus
himself. Communis &amp; Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxa
(ut asseris) sententia
est, Iesum Christum ideo ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatorem
nostrum esse, quia
divinae Justiciae per quam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores
<pb facs="tcp:47790:9"/>
damnari merebamur,
pro peccatis nostris plene sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfecerit;
quae satisfactio
Per fidem imputatur Nobis
ex dono Dei credentibus.</hi> This
he ascribes to <hi>Covet.</hi> The
Common and Orthodox Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that Jesus Christ is
therefore our Saviour, because
he hath satisfied the Justice of
God, by which we being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
deserved to be condemned,
for all our sins. In opposition
whereunto he thus expresseth his
own opinion. <hi>Ego vero cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seo
&amp; Orthodoxam sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
esse arbitror, Iesum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum
ideo servatorem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum
esse, quia salutis aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
viam nobis annuntiaverit,
confirmaverit, &amp; in sua ipsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<pb facs="tcp:47790:10"/>
persona, cum vitae exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo,
tum ex mortuis resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo,
manifeste ostenderit,
vitamque aeternam nobis ei
fidem habentibus ipse datu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
sit. Divinae autem justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,
per quam peccatores
damnari meremur, pro pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis
nostris neque illum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfecisse,
neque ut satisface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
opus fuisse arbitror.</hi> I
judge and suppose it to be the
Orthodox Opinion, that Jesus
Christ is therefore our Saviour,
because he hath declared unto
us the way of eternal salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and confirmed it in his own
person; manifestly shewing it,
both by the example of his life,
and by rising from the dead;
and in that he will give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb facs="tcp:47790:10"/>
life unto us believing in
him. And I affirm that he
neither made satisfaction to the
Justice of God, whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be damned for our
sins, nor was there any need
that he should so do. This is
the true state of the Question;
and the principal subtilty of
<hi>Crellius,</hi> the great Defender
of this part of the Doctrine of
<hi>Socinus,</hi> in his Book of the
Causes of the Death of Christ,
and the Defence of this Book
<hi>De Iesu Christo servatore,</hi>
consists in speaking almost the
same words with those whom
he doth oppose, but still intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same things with <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
himself: This Opinion as
was said of <hi>Socinus, Covetus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47790:11"/>
opposed and everted on the
Principle before mentioned.</p>
            <p>The same Truth was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also by <hi>Zarnovitius</hi> who first
wrote against <hi>Socinus</hi> his Book;
as also by <hi>Otto Casmannus</hi>
who engaged in the same work;
and by <hi>Abraham Salinarius.</hi>
Vpon the same Foundation do
proceed, <hi>Paraeus, Piscator,
Lubbertus, Lucius, Camero,
Voetius, Amiraldus, Placaeus,
Rivetus, Walaeus, Thysius,
Altingius, Maresius, Esseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Arnoldus, Turretinus,
Baxter,</hi> With many others; The
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> who have managed
these Controversies, as <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novius,
Meisnerus, Calovius,
Stegmannus, Martinius, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi>
with all others of their,
<pb facs="tcp:47790:11"/>
way, have constantly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same great fundamental
Principle of this Doctrine of the
satisfaction of Christ; and it
hath well, and solidly been of
late asserted among our selves
on the same foundation. And
as many of these Authors do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
blame some of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as <hi>Aquinas, Durandus,
Biel, Tataretus,</hi> for granting
a possibility of pardon without
satisfaction, as opening a way
to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Error in this
matter; so also they fear not to
affirm, that the foregoing of
this Principle of Gods <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Justice</hi> indispensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Punishment of sin,
doth not only weaken the cause
of the Truth, but indeed leave it
<pb facs="tcp:47790:12"/>
indefensible. However I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
men ought to be wary how
they censure the <hi>Authors</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
as such who expose the Cause
they undertook to defend, unto
contempt; for greater, more able,
and Learned Defenders, this
Truth hath not as yet found, nor
doth stand in need of.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Disciples of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
having made that
great confession of
him, in distinction
and opposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
him only as a Prophet, <hi>thou
art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi>
Mat. 16. 14, 15, 16. He doth on the
occasion thereof, give out unto them
that <hi>Great Charter</hi> of the Churches
stability and continuance; <hi>Vpon this
Rock I will build my Church, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47790:13"/>
gates of Hell shall not prevail against it,</hi>
v. 18. He is himself the <hi>Rock</hi> upon
which his Church is built; as God is
called the <hi>Rock</hi> of his People, on the
account of his eternal power and
immutability, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4, 18, 31.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 4. And himself the <hi>Spiritual
Rock</hi> which gave out supplies of
Mercy and Assistance to the people in
the Wilderness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
            <p>The Relation of the <hi>Professing
Church</hi> unto this <hi>Rock,</hi> consists in the
faith of this Confession, that he <hi>is
Christ the Son of the living God.</hi> This
our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised
to secure against all attempts; yet
so as plainly to declare, that there
should be great and severe opposition
made thereunto. For whereas the
<hi>Prevalency</hi> of the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> in an
enmity unto this confession is <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
a great and vigorous attempt to
prevail therein is no less certainly
<hi>foretold;</hi> neither hath it otherwise
fallen out. In all Ages from the first
solemn foundation of the Church of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47790:13"/>
the New Testament, it hath one way
or other been fiercely attempted by
the <hi>Gates of Hell.</hi> For some time after
the Resurrection of Christ from the
dead, the principal endeavours of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and Men acting under him, or
acted by him, were pointed against
the very foundation of the Church,
as laid in the expression before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Almost all the Errours and
<hi>Heresies</hi> wherewith for three or four
<hi>Centuries of years</hi> it was perplexed,
were principally against the Person of
Christ himself, and consequently the
Nature and Being of the holy and
blessed Trinity. But being disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his design herein, through
the watchful care of the Lord Christ
over his Promise; in the following
Ages, Satan turned his craft and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
against sundry parts of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure;
and by the assistance
of the <hi>Papacy</hi> cast them into confusion,
nothing as it were remaining firm,
stable, and in order, but only this <hi>one
confession,</hi> which in a particular manner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47790:14"/>
the Lord Christ hath taken upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to secure.</p>
            <p>In these <hi>latter Ages</hi> of the World,
the power and care of Jesus Christ
reviving towards his Church in the
<hi>Reformation</hi> of it, even the ruined
heaps of its building have been again
reduced into some tolerable order and
beauty. The old Enemy of its peace
and welfare falling hereby under a
disappointment, and finding his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
and labour for <hi>many Generations</hi>
in a great part frustrate, he is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again to his old work of attacque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Foundation</hi> it self; as he is
unweary and restless, and can be quiet
neither Conquerour nor conquered;
nor will be so, until he is bound and
cast <hi>into the lake that burneth with fire.</hi>
For no sooner had the Reformation of
Religion firmed it self in some of the
<hi>Europaean Provinces,</hi> but immediately,
in a proportion of distance not unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
unto what fell out from the
first foundation of the Church, sundry
Persons by the instigation of Satan
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47790:14"/>
attempted the disturbance and ruine
of it, by the very same errours and
<hi>Heresies</hi> about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the Person
of Christ, and his Offices, the person
of the Holy Ghost and his Grace,
wherewith its first trouble and ruine
was endeavoured. And hereof we
have of late an instance given among
our selves; and that so notoriously
known, through a mixture of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and impudence in the managers
of it, that a very brief reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it will suffice unto our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>It was alwaies supposed, and
known to some, that there are sundry
Persons in this Nation, who having
been themselves seduced into <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
did make it their business un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
various pretences to draw others
into a compliance with them in the
same way and perswasion. Neither
hath this for sundry years been so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
carryed, but that the design of
it hath variously discovered it self by
<hi>overt acts</hi> of Conferences, disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47790:15"/>
and publishing of Books; which
last way of late hath been sedulously
pursued. Unto these three is now
a <hi>visible Accession</hi> made, by that sort of
People whom Men will call <hi>Quakers,</hi>
from their deportment at the first ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their way, long since deserted
by them; until by some new Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Opinions, they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under a more proper denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
That there is a conjunction
issued between both these sorts of Men,
in an Opposition to the <hi>holy Trinity,</hi>
with the Person and Grace of Christ,
the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> of late published by the
one and the other do sufficiently
evince. For however they may seem
in sundry things as yet to look divers
waies, yet like <hi>Sampson</hi>'s <hi>Foxes,</hi> they
are knit together by the tayle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in these fire-brand Opinions, and
joyntly endeavour to consume the
standing Corn of the Church of God.
And their joynt management of their
business of late, hath been as though
it were their design, to give as great a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47790:15"/>
               <hi>vogue</hi> and report to their <hi>Opinions,</hi> as
by any waies they are able. Hence
besides their attempts to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Opinions under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
in all Assemblies whereunto
they may intrude themselves, as they
know without trouble, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
sedulous in scattering and
<hi>giving away,</hi> yea <hi>imposing gratis,</hi> and
as to some <hi>ingratiis,</hi> their small books
which they publish, upon all sorts of
persons promiscuously, as they have
advantage so to do. By this means
their Opinions being of late become
the talk and discourse of the <hi>common
sort of Christians,</hi> and the Exercise of
many, amongst whom are not a few,
that on sundry accounts, which I shall
not mention, may possibly be exposed
unto disadvantage and prejudice
thereby, it hath been thought meet by
some, that the <hi>Sacred Truths</hi> which
these men oppose, should be plainly
and briefly asserted and confirmed
from the Scripture; that those of the
<hi>meanest sort of Professors,</hi> who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47790:16"/>
Sincere and upright, exercising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to keep a good conscience in
matters of faith and obedience to
God, may have somewhat in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
both to guide them in their
further enquiry into the Truth, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to confirm their Faith in what
they have already received, when at
any time it is shaken or opposed by
the <hi>cunning sleights of men that lye in
wait to deceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this comprizeth the design
of the ensuing discourse. It may
possibly be judged <hi>needless</hi> by some, as
it was in its first proposal by him
by whom it is wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this matter at present is by an
especial providence cast on other
hands, who both have, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as <hi>occasion</hi> shall require, will <hi>well
acquit themselves</hi> in the defence of the
Truths opposed. Not to give any
other account of the Reasons of this
small undertaking, it may suffice,
that <hi>in publico discrimine omnis homo
miles est.</hi> Every mans concernment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47790:16"/>
lying in a <hi>common danger,</hi> it is free
for every one to manage it as he
thinks best, and is able, so it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice to the <hi>whole,</hi> or the
particular concerns of others. If a
City be on <hi>fire,</hi> whose <hi>bucket</hi> that
brings water to quench it ought to
be refused? The attempt to cast fire
into the <hi>City of God,</hi> by the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mentioned, is open and plain,
and a timely stop being to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, the more hands are orderly
employed in its quenching, the more
speedy and secure is the effect like
to be.</p>
            <p>Now, because the Assertors of the
Opinions mentioned do seem to set
out themselves to be <hi>some great Ones,</hi>
above the ordinary rate of men, as
having found out, and being able pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to maintain such things, as never
would have entred into the minds of
others to have thought on, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and also that they seem with
many to be thought worthy of their
consideration because they now are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47790:17"/>
               <hi>new,</hi> and such as they have not
been acquainted withall; I shall in this
<hi>Prefatory</hi> entrance, briefly manifest
that those who have amongst us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
the management of these
Opinions, have brought nothing
<hi>new</hi> unto them, but either a little
<hi>contemptible Sophistry</hi> and caption of
words on the one hand, or <hi>futulous,</hi>
affected, unintelligible expressions
on the other; the Opinions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being no other; but such as
the <hi>Church of God</hi> having been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by, and troubled with from the
beginning, hath prevailed against, and
triumphed over in all generations.
And were it not that <hi>Confidence</hi> is
the only relief which engaged <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi>
adheres unto, and expects
supplies from, I should greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that those amongst us who
have undertaken an inforcement of
these old exploded errours, whose
weakness doth so openly discover
and proclaim it self in all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
should judge themselves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47790:17"/>
competent to give a new spirit of
life to the dead carkass of these <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Heresies,</hi> which the faith of the
Saints in all Ages hath triumphed
over; and which <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
have under the care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Christ, so often baffled out
of the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
converse on the earth, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
greatly from the Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of their forefathers, and ready
to sink into their last and <hi>utmost
Apostacy</hi> from God, seem amongst
many other truths, to have much
lost that of the Doctrine of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Trinity,</hi> and of the Person of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> It was indeed suited in the
dispensation of God, unto the
work that the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> had to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
in the world, that before his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Resurrection, the knowledge
of his Divine Nature as unto his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
person, should be concealed
from the most of men. For this
cause, although he was in the <hi>form of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47790:18"/>
God, and thought it no robbery to be
equal with God,</hi> yet <hi>he made himself of
no reputation,</hi> by taking on him the
form of a servant, and made in the
likeness of men, that being found in
the fashion of a man, he might be
obedient unto death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9.
whereby his Divine Glory was <hi>veiled</hi>
for a season, until he was <hi>declared to
be the Son of God with power, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto the Spirit of Holiness, by the
resurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 4.
And then <hi>was glorified with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which he had with the Father before
the world was,</hi> John 17. 3. And as this
dispensation was needful unto the
accomplishment of the whole work
which as our M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diator he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
so in particular, he who was
in himself the <hi>Lord of Hosts, a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
to them that feared him,</hi> became
hereby, <hi>a stone of stumbling, and a rock
of offence to both the Houses of</hi> Israel, <hi>for
a gin and for a snare to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Jerusalem,</hi> Isa. 8. 13, 14. See
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47790:18"/>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 26. But yet notwithstanding,
as occasions required, suitably unto
his own holy ends and designs, he
forbare not to give plain and open
testimony to his own <hi>Divine Nature</hi>
and eternal pre-existence unto his
Incarnation. And this was it, which
of all other things most provoked the
<hi>carnal Jews</hi> with whom he had to
do. For having, as was said, lost the
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and Person of
the <hi>Messiah</hi> in a great measure, when
ever he asserted his <hi>Deity,</hi> they were
immediately enraged and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to destroy him. So was it
plainly, <hi>John.</hi> 8. 56, 57, 58 59. Saith
he, <hi>Your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to see
my day, and he saw it and was glad;
then said the Jews unto him, thou art
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t yet fifty years old, and hast thou
seen</hi> Abraham? <hi>Jesus said unto them,
verily I say unto you, before</hi> Abraham
<hi>was I am: then took they up stones to
cast at him.</hi> So also, <hi>John</hi> 10. 30, 31,
32, 33. <hi>I and my Father are one: then
the Jews took up stones again to stone
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47790:19"/>
him; Jesus answered them, many good
works have I shewed you from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for which of those works do you
stone me? The Jews answered him say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for a good work we stone thee not,
but for blasphemy, and because that
thou being a Man makest thy self God.</hi>
They understood well enough the
meaning of those words, <hi>I and my
Father are one;</hi> namely, that they
were a plain Assertion of his being
God. This caused their rage. And
this the <hi>Jews</hi> all abide by to this
day; namely, that he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be <hi>God,</hi> and therefore they
slew him. Whereas therefore the
first discovery of a <hi>plurality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Divine Essence</hi> consists in the
Revelation of the Divine Nature and
<hi>personality</hi> of the Son, this being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
persecuted, and blasphemed
by these <hi>Jews,</hi> they may be justly
looked upon and esteemed as the <hi>first
Assertors</hi> of that misbelief, which now
some seek again so earnestly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
The <hi>Jews</hi> persecuted the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47790:19"/>
Lord Christ, because he being a Man,
declared himself also to be God; and
others are ready to revile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them, who believe and teach
what he declared.</p>
            <p>After the Resurrection and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Lord Jesus, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled with tokens, evidences and
effects of his Divine Nature and
Power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. The Church that
began to be gathered in his name,
and according to his Doctrine, being
by his especial institution to be initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
into the express profession of
the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as
being to be <hi>baptized</hi> in the name of
<hi>the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost,</hi> which confession comprizeth
the whole of the truth contended
for, and by the indispensible placing
of it at the first entrance into all
obedience unto him, is made the
doctrinal foundation of the Church, it
continued for a season in the quiet
and undisturbed possession of this
Sacred Treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47790:20"/>
The <hi>first</hi> who gave disquietment
unto the <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> by pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrine of the Trinity was
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi> with his followers; an
account of whose monstrous fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and unintelligible imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with their coincidence with
what some men dream in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daies, shall elsewhere be given.
Nor shall I need here to mention the
<hi>Colluvies</hi> of <hi>Gnosticks, Valentinians,
Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all whose abominations lay
in their <hi>mis-apprehensions</hi> of the being
of God, their unbelief of the <hi>Trinity</hi>
and Person of Christ, as do those of
some others also.</p>
            <p>In especial there was one <hi>Cerinthus,</hi>
who was more active than others in
his opposition to the Doctrine of
the person of Christ, and therein of
the Holy Trinity. To put a stop
unto his Abominations, all Authors
agree that <hi>John</hi> writing his Gospel,
prefixed unto it that plain declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>eternal Deity</hi> of Christ which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47790:20"/>
it is prefaced withall. And the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is well attested by <hi>Irenaeus, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
and others, from <hi>Polycarpus</hi> who
was his Disciple, that this <hi>Cerinthus</hi>
coming into the place where the
Apostle was, he left it, adding as a
reason of his departure, lest the
<hi>building through the just judgement of
God should fall upon them.</hi> And it
was of the Holy, Wise Providence
of God, to suffer some impious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to oppose this <hi>Doctrine</hi> before
the death of that Apostle, that he
might by infallible Inspiration far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reveal, manifest and declare it
to the establishment of the Church
in future Ages. For what can far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be desired to satisfie the minds
of men, who in any sense own the
Lord Jesus Christ, and the Scriptures,
than that this Controversie about
the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Person of Christ</hi> (for
they stand and fall together) should
be so eminently and expresly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
as it were immediately from
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47790:21"/>
But he, with whom we have to
deal in this matter, neither ever did,
nor ever will, nor can acquiesce or
rest in the divine determination of
any thing which he hath stirred up
strife and controversie about. For
as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and the <hi>Ebionites</hi> persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Heresie</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
would have slain our Saviour for
bearing witness to his own Deity,
notwithstanding the evidence of that
testimony, and the right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which the <hi>Jews</hi> had of his
mind therein; so he excited others
to engage and persist in their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the truth, notwithstanding
this <hi>second particular determination</hi> of
it from Heaven, for their confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or confusion. For after the
more weak and confused oppositions
made unto it by <hi>Theodotus Coriarius,
Artemon,</hi> and some others, at length
a stout Champion appears visibly
and expresly engaged against these
fundamentals of our faith. This
was <hi>Paulus Sa nosatenus</hi> Bishop of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47790:21"/>
Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> about the year
272. A man of most intolerable
pride, passion, and folly; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that hath left a name upon <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Records.</hi> This man openly
and avowedly denyed the <hi>Doctrine
of the Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Deity of Christ</hi>
in an especial manner. For although
he endeavoured for a while, to <hi>cloud
his impious sentiments</hi> in ambiguous
expressions, as others also have done,
(<hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 27.) yet being
pressed by the Professors of the
truth, and supposing his party was
somewhat confirmed, he plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his <hi>Heresie,</hi> and was cast out
of the Church wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided.
Some <hi>sixty years</hi> after, <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus
Bishop of Syrmium,</hi> with a
pretence of more sobriety in life
and conversation, undertook the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the same design, with the
same success.</p>
            <p>What ensued afterwards among
the Churches of God in this matter,
is of too large and diffused a nature
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47790:22"/>
to be here reported. These instances
I have fixed on, only to intimate unto
persons whose condition or occasions
afford them not ability or leisure of
themselves, to enquire into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of times past amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the Gospel of Christ, that
these oppositions which are made at
present amongst us unto these funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Truths, and derived immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from the late renewed inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them made by <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi>
and his followers, are nothing but old
baffled attempts of Satan, against the
<hi>Rock of the Church</hi> and the building
thereon, in the confession <hi>of the Son of
the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as all men who have ought of
a due Reverence of God or his truth
remaining with them, cannot but be
wary how they give the least admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to such Opinions as have from
the beginning been witnessed against,
and condemned by Christ himself, his
Apostles and all that followed them in
their faith and waies in all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47790:22"/>
so others whose hearts may
tremble for the danger they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
which these <hi>sacred Truths</hi> may
be in, of being corrupted or defamed,
by the present opposition against
them, may know that it is no other,
but what the Church and faith of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
hath already been exercised
with, and through the power of him
that enables them have constantly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over. And for my part, I
look upon it as a blessed effect of the
holy wise providence of God, that
those who have long harboured these
Abominations of denying the <hi>holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
the <hi>person</hi> and <hi>satisfaction of Christ</hi>
in their minds, but yet have sheltered
themselves from common observation
under the <hi>shades</hi> of dark obscure and
uncouth expressions, with many other
specious pretences, should be given up
to joyn themselves with such Persons,
and to profess a community of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
with them in those opinions,
as have rendred themselves <hi>infamous</hi>
from the first foundation of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47790:23"/>
and wherein they will assuredly
meet with the same success as those
have done, who have gone before them.</p>
            <p>For the other <hi>head</hi> of Opposition
made by these Persons unto the truth
in Reference unto the <hi>satisfaction of
Christ,</hi> and <hi>the imputation of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
thereon unto our Justification,
I have not much to say as to the time
past. In general, the doctrine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they boast, being first brought forth
in a rude mishapen manner by the
<hi>Pelagian Hereticks,</hi> was afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by one <hi>Abailardus a Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Scholar</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> but owes its
principal form and poison unto the
endeavours of <hi>Faustus Socinus,</hi> &amp; those
who have followed him in his subtle
attempt to corrupt the whole doctrine
of the Gospel. Of these M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, are those
amongst us who at this day so busily
dispute and write about the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi> and <hi>his satisfaction,</hi>
the Followers and Disciples. And it
is much more from their <hi>Masters</hi> who
were some of them Men learned, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47790:23"/>
and subtle, than from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they are judged to be of
any great consideration. For I can
truly say, that upon the sedate exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all that I could ever yet hear,
or get a sight of, either spoken or
written by them, that is any amongst
us; I never yet observed an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so great importance managed
with a greater evidence of <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi>
and <hi>inability,</hi> to give any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
countenance unto it. If any of
them shall for the future attempt to
give any <hi>new countenance</hi> or props to
their <hi>tottering errours,</hi> it will doubtless
be attended unto, by some of those
many, who cannot but know that it is
incumbent on them, <hi>to contend earnestly
for the Faith once delivered unto the
Saints.</hi> This present brief endeavour
is only to assist and direct those, who
are less exercised in the waies of
managing controversies in Religion,
that they may have a brief compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the truths opposed, with
the firm foundations whereon they are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47790:24"/>
built, and have in a readiness to shield
their Faith, both against the <hi>fiery darts
of Satan,</hi> and secure their minds
against the cunning sleights of Men
who lye in wait to deceive. And
wherein this discourse seems in any
thing to be too <hi>brief,</hi> or concise, the
<hi>Author</hi> is not to be blamed; who was
confined unto these strait bounds, by
those whose requests injoyned him
this service.</p>

Holy Trinity Explained and
Vindicated.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine of the
<hi>blessed Trinity</hi> may be
considered two wayes.
First, In respect unto
the Revelation and
proposal of it in the
Scripture, to direct us unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
Object, and End of our Faith,
in our worship and obedience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
As it is farther declared and
explained, in terms, expressions, and
propositions, educed from the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Revelation</hi> of it, suited thereunto,
and meet to direct and keep the mind
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47790:25"/>
from undue apprehensions of the
things it believes; and to declare them
unto farther <hi>edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first way, it consists meerly
in the <hi>propositions</hi> wherein the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God is expressed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
And in this regard two things
are required of us. First, To <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
the terms of the propositions, as
they are <hi>Enunciations</hi> of Truth; And
Secondly, To <hi>believe</hi> the things taught,
revealed, and declared in them.</p>
            <p>In the first <hi>Instance,</hi> no more, I say,
is required of us, but that we <hi>assent</hi>
unto the <hi>Assertions</hi> and Testimonies of
God concerning himself, according to
their natural and genuine sence, as he
will be <hi>known,</hi> believed in, feared and
worshipped by us; as he is our Creator,
Lord, and Rewarder; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he himself hath by his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only warranted us so to do,
but also made it <hi>our duty</hi> necessary and
indispensible. Now the sum of this
<hi>Revelation</hi> in this matter is, that <hi>God is
one;</hi> that this one God, <hi>is Father, Son
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47790:25"/>
and Holy Ghost; that the Father is the
Father of the Son; and the Son, the
Son of the Father;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
the Spirit of the Father and the Son;
and that in respect of this their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Relation, they are distinct from
each other.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>substance</hi> of the Doctrine
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> as to the first direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of faith therein. The first
intention of the Scripture in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of God towards us is, as was
said, that we might <hi>fear him,</hi> believe,
worship, obey him, and live unto him,
as God. That we may do this in a
due manner, and worship the <hi>only true
God,</hi> and not adore the false imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own minds, it declares,
as was said, that <hi>this God is one, the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</hi> that the
<hi>Father is this one God, and therefore is to
be believed in,</hi> worshipped, obeyed,
lived unto, and in all things considered
by us as the first cause, soveraign Lord,
and last end of all: that the <hi>Son,</hi> is
the <hi>one true God,</hi> and therefore is to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47790:26"/>
be believed in, worshipped, obeyed,
lived unto, and in all things considered
by us as the first cause, Soveraign
Lord, and last end of all. And so also of
the Holy Ghost. This is the <hi>whole</hi> of
Faiths concernment in this matter, as
it respects the direct Revelation of
God made by himself in the Scripture,
and the first proper general end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Let this be clearly confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and positive <hi>divine Testimonies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the declaration and Revelation
of God concerning himself, and faith is
secured as to all its concerns. For it
hath both its proper <hi>formal object,</hi> and
is sufficiently enabled to be <hi>directive</hi> of
divine Worship and Obedience.</p>
            <p>The Explication of this Doctrine
unto <hi>Edification</hi> suitable unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
mentioned, is of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
And two things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on us to take care of therein.
First that what is affirmed and taught,
do directly tend unto the ends of the
Revelation it self, by informing and
inlightning of the mind in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47790:26"/>
of the mysterie of it, so far as
in this life we are by <hi>Divine Assistance</hi>
capable to comprehend it; that is, that
faith may be increased, strengthned
and confirmed against temptations
and oppositions of Satan, and men of
corrupt minds; and that we may be
distinctly directed unto, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in the Obedience unto, and
Worship of God that are required
of us. Secondly, That nothing be
affirmed or taught herein, that may
beget, or occasion any <hi>undue appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions</hi>
concerning God, or our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto him, with respect unto
the best, highest, securest Revelations,
that we have of him and our duty.
These things being done and secured,
the End of the Declaration of this
Doctrine concerning God is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>In the declaration then of this
Doctrine unto the Edification of the
Church, there is contained a farther
Explanation of the things before as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
as proposed directly, and in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47790:27"/>
themselves as the object of our faith,
namely, <hi>how God is one,</hi> in respect of
his <hi>Nature, Substance, Essence,</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
or Divine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Being. How being
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in these three distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or <hi>Hypost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sies:</hi> and what are
their mutual respects to each other,
by which as their peculiar proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
giving them the manner of their
subsistence, they are distinguished
one from another; with sundry
other things of the like necessary
consequence unto the Revelation
mentioned. And herein as in the
Application of all other Divine
Truths and Mysteries whatever, yea,
of all <hi>moral commanded duties,</hi> use is
to be made of such words and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as it may be are not <hi>literally</hi> and
<hi>formally</hi> contained in the Scripture;
but only are unto our conceptions
and apprehensions <hi>expository</hi> of what
is so contained. And to deny the
<hi>Liberty,</hi> yea, the necessity hereof, is to
deny all <hi>interpretation</hi> of the Scripture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47790:27"/>
all endeavours to express the sense of
the words of it, unto the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of one another; which is in a
word to render the Scripture it self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
useless. For if it be <hi>unlawful</hi>
for me to speak or write what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be the sense of the words of
the Scripture, and the nature of the
thing signified and expressed by them,
it is unlawful for me also to <hi>think</hi>
or conceive in my mind what is the
sense of the words or nature of the
things; which to say, is to make
<hi>brutes</hi> of our selves, and to frustrate
the whole design of God in giving
unto us the great priviledge of his
word.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the <hi>declaration</hi> of the
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> we may <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
nay we must <hi>necessarily,</hi> make use
of other words, phrases and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that what are <hi>Literally</hi> and <hi>Syllabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
contained in the Scriptures, but
teach no other things.</p>
            <p>Moreover whatever is so revealed
in the Scripture, is no less <hi>true</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47790:28"/>
divine as to whatever necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
thereon, than it is, as unto
that which is principally revealed and
directly expressed. For how far so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the lines be drawn and extended,
from truth nothing can follow and
ensue but what is true also; and that
in the same kind of truth, with that
which it is derived and deduced
from. For if the principal Assertion
be a truth of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> so is
also whatever is included therein, and
which may be rightly from thence
collected. Hence it follows, that
when the Scripture revealeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost, to be <hi>one
God,</hi> seeing it necessarily and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
follows thereon that they are one
in <hi>Essence,</hi> wherein alone it is possible
they can be one; and three in their
<hi>distinct Subsistences,</hi> wherein alone it is
possible they can be <hi>three:</hi> This is no
less of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> than the first
principle from whence these things
follow.</p>
            <p>These being the <hi>respects</hi> which the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47790:28"/>
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> falls under,
the necessary method of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, is plain and evident.</p>
            <p>1. The Revelation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is to be
asserted and vindicated, as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be believed for the ends
mentioned. Now this is, as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that there is <hi>one God, that this
God, is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi>
and so, that the Father is God, so is
the Son, so is the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>This being received and admitted
by faith, the <hi>Explication</hi> of it is,
(2.) To be insisted on, and not
taken into consideration untill the
other be admitted. And herein lyes
the preposterous course of those who
<hi>fallaciously</hi> and captiously go about to
oppose this sacred truth. They will
alwayes begin their opposition, not
unto the <hi>Revelation</hi> of it, but unto
the <hi>Explanation</hi> of it which is used
only for farther edification. Their
Disputes and Cavils shall be against
the <hi>Trinity, Essence, Substance, Persons,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47790:29"/>
Personality, Respects, Properties</hi> of the
Divine Persons, with the <hi>modes</hi> of
expressing these things, whilst the
plain <hi>Scriptural Revelation</hi> of the
things themselves from whence they
are but explanatory deductions, is
not spoken to, nor admitted unto
confirmation. By this means have
they entangled many <hi>weak unstable
souls,</hi> who when they have met with
things too high, hard and difficult for
them, (which in Divine Mysteries
they may quickly do) in the <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of this Doctrine, have suffered
themselves to be taken off from a
due consideration of the full and
plain <hi>Revelation</hi> of the thing it self in
Scripture; until their temptations
being made strong, and their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
increased, it was too late for
them to return unto it; as bringing
along with them the <hi>Cavils</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were prepossessed rather
than that Faith and Obedience which
is required. But yet all this while
these Explanations so excepted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47790:29"/>
against, are indeed not of any <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
consideration</hi> in this matter. Let
the direct express Revelations of the
Doctrine be firmed, they will <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of themselves,</hi> nor will be excepted
against by those who believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. Let that be rejected, and
they will <hi>fall of themselves,</hi> and never
be contended for by those who did
make use of them. But of these
things we shall treat again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the way, the only
way that we <hi>rationally</hi> can, and that
which in <hi>duty</hi> we ought to proceed
in, and by, for the asserting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the Doctrine of the <hi>holy
Trinity</hi>
under consideration; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we produce <hi>Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or Testimonies, wherein faith
may safely rest and acquiesce, that
<hi>God is one; that this one God, is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and holy Ghost;</hi> So that the
<hi>Father is God; so also is the Son,</hi> and
the <hi>holy Ghost likewise,</hi> and as such are
to be believed in, obeyed, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47790:30"/>
acknowledged as the first cause,
and last end of all, our Lord and
Reward. If this be not admitted,
if somewhat of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denyed, we need not, we have no
warrant or ground, to proceed any
farther, or at all to discourse about
the Unity of the Divine Essence, or
the distinction of Persons.</p>
            <p>We have not therefore any <hi>original
contest</hi> in this matter with any, but
such as deny either <hi>God to be one,</hi> or the
<hi>Father to be God,</hi> or the <hi>Son to be God,</hi>
or the <hi>Holy Ghost so to be.</hi> If any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
either of these in particular, we
are ready to confirm it by sufficient
Testimonies of Scripture, or clear and
undeniable Divine Revelation. When
this is <hi>evinced</hi> and <hi>vindicated,</hi> we shall,
willingly proceed to manifest that
the explications used of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
unto the Edification of the
Church are according to truth; and
such as necessarily are required by
the nature of the things themselves.
And this gives us the method of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47790:30"/>
the small ensuing Discourse, with the
Reasons of it.</p>
            <p>The first thing which we affirm to
be delivered unto us by divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
as the Object o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Faith
is, that <hi>God is one.</hi> I know that this
may be uncontroulably evidenced by
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of Reason it self, unto as
good and quiet an <hi>Assurance</hi> as the
mind of man is capable of in any
of its apprehensions whatever. But
I speak of it now, as it is confirmed
unto us by <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> How
this Assertion, of <hi>one God,</hi> respects
the Nature, Essence, or Divine Being
of God, shall be declared afterwards.
At present it is enough to represent
the <hi>Testimonies</hi> that he is <hi>one,</hi> only
one. And because we have no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with our Adversaries distinctly
about this matter, I shall only name
some few of them, Deut. 6. 4. <hi>Hear
O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</hi>
A most pregnant Testimony; and
yet notwithstanding, as I shall else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
manifest, the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47790:31"/>
that one divine Essence is here assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Isa. 44. 6, 8. <hi>Thus saith the Lord,
the King of</hi> Israel, <hi>and his Redeemer,
the Lord of Hosts, I am the first, and I
am the last, and besides me there is no
God; Is there a God besides me? Yea
there is no God, I know not any;</hi> In
which also we may manifest that a
plurality of Persons is included and
expressed. And although there be
no more absolute and sacred truth
than this, <hi>that God is one;</hi> yet it may
be evinced, that it is no where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Scripture, but that either
in the words themselves, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of the place, a <hi>plurality of persons</hi>
in that one sence is intimated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is proposed as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, <hi>that the Father is
God.</hi> And herein as is pretended
there is also an agreement, between us,
and those who oppose the Doctrine of
the Trinity. But there is a mistake
in this matter. Their <hi>hypothesis</hi> as
they call it, or indeed presumptuous
errour, casts all the conceptions that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47790:31"/>
are given us concerning God in the
Scripture, into disorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For the Father, as he whom we
worship, is often called so, only with
reference unto his Son; as the <hi>Son</hi> is
so, with reference to the Father. He
is the <hi>only begotten of the Father,</hi> John
1. 14. But now, is this <hi>Son</hi> had no
<hi>praeexistence</hi> in his Divine nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was born of the Virgin, there
was no <hi>God the Father</hi> seventeen
hundred years ago, because there was
no Son. And on this ground did the
<hi>Marcionites</hi> of old, plainly deny the
<hi>Father</hi> whom under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we Worship, to be the God of
the Old Testament, who made the
World and was Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shipped from the
foundation of it. For it seems to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that he whom we worship being
the <hi>Father,</hi> and on this supposition
that the Son had no <hi>praexistence</hi> unto
his incarnation, he was not the <hi>Father</hi>
under the Old Testament, he is some
other from him that was so revealed:
I know the <hi>folly</hi> of that inference; yet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47790:32"/>
how on this opinion of the <hi>sole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi>
of the Son in <hi>time,</hi> Men can
prove the <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>be God,</hi> let others
determine. <hi>He who abideth in the
doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, but whosoever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
and abideth not in the Doctrine
of Christ, he hath not God,</hi> 2 John 9.
Whoever denyes Christ the Son, as
the Son, that is the eternal Son of
God, he loses the Father also, and the
true God; <hi>he hath not God.</hi> For that
God which is not the Father, and
which ever was, and was not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not the <hi>true God.</hi> Hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> even of the first
Writers of the Church, were forced
unto great pains in the confirmation
of this truth, <hi>that the Father of Jesus
Christ</hi> was he who made the World,
gave the Law, spake by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and was the Author of the
Old Testament; and that against
Men who professed themselves
to be Christians. And this bruitish
apprehension of theirs, arose from no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47790:32"/>
other principle but this, that the
Son had only a temporal Existence,
and was not the Eternal Son of
God.</p>
            <p>But that I may not in this brief
discourse digress unto other Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
than what lyes directly before
us, and seeing the Adversaries of the
truth we contend for, do, in words at
least, grant that the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ is the true God, or
the only true God, I shall not further
shew the inconsistency of their <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
with this confession; But take it
for granted, that to us <hi>there is one God
the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. See <hi>John</hi>
17. 3. So that he who is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was not so from Eternity,
whose paternity is not equally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent
unto his Deity, is no God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is asserted and believed
by the Church that <hi>Jesus Christ is
God;</hi> the <hi>Eternal Son of God;</hi> that is,
He is proposed, declared and revealed
unto us in the Scripture, to be God,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47790:33"/>
that is to be served, worshipped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in, obeyed as God, upon the
account of his own <hi>Divine excellencies.</hi>
And whereas we believe and know
that he was <hi>Man,</hi> that he was born,
lived, and dyed as a Man, it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he is <hi>God also;</hi> and that as
God, he did preexist <hi>in the form of
God</hi> before his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> which
was effected by voluntary actings of
his own; which could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a preexistence in another nature.
This is proposed unto us to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Divine Testimony, and by
Divine Revelation. And the sole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
in this matter is, whether this
be proposed in the Scripture as an
Object of Faith, and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
necessary for us to believe.
Let us then nakedly attend unto what
the Scripture asserts in this matter,
and that in the order of the Books of
it in some particular instances which
at present occurr to mind; as these
that follow,</p>
            <p>

I was brought forth when there were
no Fountains abounding with waters,
before the Mountains were setled, before
the Hills was I brought forth; while as
yet he had not made the Earth, nor the
Fields, nor the highest part of the dust

Heavens I was there; when he set a

when he established the clouds above; and

to the Sea his decree that the waters
should not pass his commandment;
when he appointed the foundations of

brought up with him, and I was daily his
delight, rejoycing alwayes before him;
rejoycing in the habitable parts of his
Earth, and my delights were with the
Sons of Men.</p>

            <p>These are <hi>some</hi> of the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>truth</hi> under consideration is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47790:38"/>
revealed and declared; some of the
<hi>Divine Testimonies</hi> whereby it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and established; which I have
not at present enquired after, but
suddenly repeated as they came to
mind. Many <hi>more</hi> of the like nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and importance may be added
unto them; and shall be so as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth require.</p>
            <p>Let now any one who owns the
Scripture to be the Word of God, to
contain an infallible Revelation of
the things proposed in it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and who hath any conscience
exercised towards God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and submitting unto what
he declares and reveals, take a view
of these Testimonies, and consider
whether they do not sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this <hi>Object</hi> of our faith. Shall a
few poor trifling <hi>Sophisms,</hi> whose
terms are scarcely understood, by the
most that amongst us make use of
them, according as they have found
them framed by others, be thought
meet to be set up in opposition unto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47790:38"/>
these <hi>multiplyed Testimonies</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, and to cast the Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by them down from its credit
and reputation in the consciences of
men. For my part, I do not see in any
thing, but that the Testimonies given
to the <hi>Godhead of Christ,</hi> the Eternal
Son of God, are every way as clear
and unquestionable, as those are,
which testifie to the Being of God, or
that there is any God at all. Were
men acquainted with the Scriptures
as they ought to be, and as the most,
considering the means and advantages
they have had, might have been, did
they ponder and believe on what
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or had any tenderness in
their consciences as to that Reverence,
Obedience, and Subjection of soul,
which God requires unto his Word,
it were utterly impossible that their
faith in this matter should ever in
the least be shaken, by a few <hi>lewd
Sophisms,</hi> or <hi>loud clamours</hi> of men desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the truth, and of the Spirit
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47790:39"/>
That we may now improve these
<hi>Testimonies</hi> unto the end under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
as the nature of this brief dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
will bear, I shall first remove
the general Answers which the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
give unto them; and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
farther, how incontrolable
they are, by giving an instance in the
frivolous exceptions of the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to <hi>One</hi> of them in particular.
And we are ready, God assisting, to
maintain, that there is not any one of
them, which doth not give a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground for faith to rest on in this
matter concerning the Deity of Christ;
and that against all the <hi>Socinians</hi> in
the world.</p>
            <p>They say therefore commonly,
that we prove not by these testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
what is by them denyed. For
they acknowledge <hi>Christ to be God,</hi>
and that because he is exalted unto
that Glory and Authority that all
creatures are put into subjection
unto him; and all both men and
Angels are commanded to worship
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47790:39"/>
and adore him. So that he is God
by <hi>Office,</hi> though he be not God by
nature. He is God, but he is not the
<hi>most high God.</hi> And this last expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
they have almost continually in
their mouths. <hi>He is not the most high
God.</hi> And commonly with great
contempt and scorn they are ready
to reproach them who have solidly
confirmed the Doctrine of the Deity
of Christ, as <hi>ignorant of the state of
controversie,</hi> in that they have not
proved him to be the <hi>most high God,</hi>
in subordination unto whom, they
acknowledge <hi>Christ to be God,</hi> and
that he ought to be worshipped with
Divine and Religious worship.</p>
            <p>But there cannot be any thing
more empty and vain than these
pretences. And besides they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
in them, their former <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
with the addition of new ones.
For,</p>
            <p>First, The name of the <hi>most high
God,</hi> is first ascribed unto God in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 18, 19, 22. denoting his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:47790:40"/>
and <hi>Dominion.</hi> Now, as
other Attributes of God, it is not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive</hi>
of the subject, but only <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive</hi>
of it. So are all other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of the nature of God. It
doth not intimate that there are
other Gods, only he is the <hi>most high,</hi>
or one over them all, but only that
the true God, is <hi>most high,</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Soveraign Power, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Authority over all. To say
then, that Christ indeed is God, but
not the <hi>most high God,</hi> is all one as to
say he is God, but not the most <hi>holy
God,</hi> or not the <hi>true God.</hi> And so
they have brought their Christ into
the number of false Gods, whilst they
deny the true Christ who in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, is <hi>over all God blessed for
ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. A phrase of speech,
perfectly expressing this Attribute, of
the <hi>most high God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Answer is suited on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto those testimonies which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the <hi>name of God</hi> with a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ponding
Power and Authority unto
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47790:40"/>
that name. For in reference unto
these alone can it be pleaded with any
pretence of reason, that he is a God
by Office; though that also be done
very Futilously and impertinently.
But most of the <hi>Testimonies</hi> produc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
speak directly unto his <hi>divine Excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and properties, which belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his nature necessarily and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
That he is <hi>Eternal, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Immense, Omniscient,</hi> Infinitely
wise, and that he is, and worketh
and produceth Effects suitable unto
all these properties, and such as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but they can enable him for, is
abundantly proved by the foregoing
Testimonies. Now all these concern
a <hi>divine nature,</hi> a natural Essence, a
<hi>Godhead,</hi> and not such power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as a man may be exalted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Yea, the ascribing any of them
to such a one, implyes the highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
expressible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This God in Authority and
Office, and not by nature, that
should be the Object of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47790:41"/>
is a new abomination. For they
are divine, <hi>essential excellencies</hi> that are
the <hi>formal Reason</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Religious and divine. And to
ascribe it unto any one, that is <hi>not
God by nature,</hi> is Idolatry. By make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore their Christ such a God
as they describe, they bring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the severe commination of the
true God, Jer. 10. 11. <hi>The Gods that
have not made the Heavens and the
Earth, even they shall perish from the
Earth, and from under these Heavens.</hi>
That Christ they worship, they say
is a God; but they deny that he is
<hi>that God that made the Heavens and the
Earth:</hi> and so leave him exposed to
the threatnings of him, who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
it to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>Some other general exceptions
sometimes they make use of, which
the Reader may free himself from the
entanglement of, if he do but heed
these ensuing Rules.</p>
            <p>X. Distinction of persons, (of
which afterwards) it being in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47790:41"/>
substance, doth no way prove
a difference of <hi>Essence</hi> between the
Father and the Son. Where there
fore Christ as the Son, is said to be
<hi>Another</hi> from the Father, or <hi>God,</hi>
spoken personally of the Father, it
argues not in the least that he is not
partaker of the same nature with
him. That in one Essence, there can
be but one person, may be true where
the substance is finite and lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted, but
hath no place in that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
            <p>2. Distinction and Inequality in
respect of <hi>Office</hi> in Christ, doth not in
the least take away his equality and
sameness with the Father, in respect
of <hi>nature</hi> and Essence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8.
A Son, of the same nature with his
Father, and therein <hi>Equal</hi> to him,
may in <hi>Office</hi> be his inferiour, his
subject.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Advancement</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
of Christ as <hi>Mediator</hi> to any
dignity whatever, upon, or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47790:42"/>
and salvation, is not at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the essential Honour, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and Worth which he hath in
himself as God blessed for ever.
Though he humbled himself and was
exalted in <hi>Office,</hi> yet in <hi>Nature</hi> he was
one and the same, he changed not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Scriptures asserting
the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerments
thereof, as his birth, life,
and death, do no more thereby deny
his <hi>Deity,</hi> than by asserting his Deity
with the essential properties thereof,
they deny his humanity.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God working in and by
Christ as he was Mediator, denotes the
Fathers Soveraign Appointment of
the things mentioned to be done, not
his <hi>immediate efficiency</hi> in the doing of
the things themselves.</p>
            <p>These Rules are proposed a little
before their due place in the <hi>Method</hi>
which we pursue. But I thought
meet to interpose them here, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a sufficient ground for the
resolution and answering of all the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47790:42"/>
               <hi>Sophisms</hi> and Objections which the
Adversaries use in this cause.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>cloud of witnesses</hi> before
produced, every one where of is singly
sufficient to evert the <hi>Socinian Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi>
I shall in <hi>one</hi> of them give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
both of the clearness of the
Evidence, and the weakness of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
which are wont to put in
against them as was promised.
And this is, John 1. 1, 2, 3. <hi>In the
Beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God,
the same was in the beginning with
God. All things were made by him,
and without him was not any thing
made that was made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Word,</hi> here, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, on
what account soever he be so called,
either as being the Eternal Word and
wisdom of the Father, or as the great
Revealer of the Will of God unto us,
Jesus Christ the Son of God is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This is on all hands acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and the context will admit of
no haesitation about it. For of this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47790:43"/>
               <hi>Word,</hi> it is said, that <hi>he came into the
World,</hi> v. 10. <hi>was rejected by his own,</hi>
v. 11. <hi>was made flesh and dwelt
amongst us whose glory was the glory of
the only begotten Son of the Father,</hi>
v. 14. <hi>called expresly Jesus Christ,</hi>
v. 17. <hi>the only begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
v. 18. The subject then treated
of is here agreed upon. And it is no
less evident that it is the design of the
Apostle to declare both who, and
what he was of whom he treateth.
Here then, if any where, we may learn
what we are to believe concerning the
person of Christ; which also we may
certainly do, if our minds are not
perverted through prejudice, <hi>whereby
the God of this world doth blind the
minds of them which believe not, lest
the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ
who is the image of God, should shine
unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. Of this Word
then, this Son of God it is affirmed
<hi>that he was in the beginning.</hi> And this
Word if it doth not absolutely and
formally express <hi>Eternity,</hi> yet it doth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47790:43"/>
a <hi>preexistence</hi> unto the whole Creation
which amounts to the same. For
nothing can preexist unto all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
but in the <hi>nature</hi> of God which
is <hi>eternal;</hi> unless we shall suppose a
<hi>creature</hi> before the Creation of any.
But what is meant by this expression,
the Scripture doth elsewhere declare.
Prov. 8. 23. <hi>I was set up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
before the beginning, or ever the
earth was,</hi> John 17. 5. <hi>Glorifie thou
me with thine own self, with the glory
which I had with thee before the world
was.</hi> Both which places as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
this phrase, so also do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
testifie unto the <hi>Eternal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence</hi>
of Christ the Son of God.
And in this case we prevail against
our Adversaries, if we prove any <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence</hi>
of Christ unto his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which as they absolutely deny,
so to grant it, would overthrow their
whole heresie in this matter. And
therefore they know that the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Saviour concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if understood in a proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47790:44"/>
sense, is perfectly destructive
of their pretensions. John 8. 58. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Abraham <hi>was, I am.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no proper sense in
the words but a gross <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quivocation, if
the Existence of Christ before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was born be not asserted in them,
seeing he spake in Answer to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that He was <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
yet fifty years old, and so could not have
seen</hi> Abraham, nor <hi>Abraham</hi> him;
and the Jews that were present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
well enough that he asserted
a <hi>divine preexistence</hi> unto his being
born so long ago, as that hereon, after
their manner, they took up <hi>stones</hi> to
<hi>stone him,</hi> as supposing him to have
blasphemed in asserting his <hi>Deity</hi> as
others now do in the denying of it; yet
<hi>they</hi> seeing how fatal this <hi>prae-existence,</hi>
though not here absolutely asserted to
be <hi>eternal,</hi> would be to their cause,
they contend that the meaning of the
words, is, that <hi>Christ was to be the light
of the world before</hi> Abraham <hi>was made
the Father of many Nations.</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47790:44"/>
so absurd and sottish, as
never any man not infatuated by the
God of this world could once admit
and give countenance unto.</p>
            <p>But <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> as absolutely
used, is the same with From Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it is expounded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 23.
and denoteth an eternal existence,
which is here affirmed of the Word
the Son of God. But let the Word
<hi>beginning,</hi> be restrained unto the <hi>subject
matter</hi> treated of which is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things, and the praeexistence
of Christ in his divine nature unto
the Creation of all things is plainly
revealed and inevitably asserted. And
indeed, not only the Word, but the
discourse of these verses, doth plainly
relate unto, and is expository of the
first verse in the Bible, Gen. 1. 1. <hi>In
the beginning God created Heaven and
Earth.</hi> There it is asserted that in the
beginning God created all things,
here, that the Word was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and made all things. This
then is the least that we have obtained
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47790:45"/>
from this first word of our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
namely, that the Word or
Son of God had a <hi>personal praeexistence
unto the whole Creation.</hi> In what
nature this must be, let these men of
Reason satisfie themselves, who know
that Creator and Creatures, take up
the whole nature of Beings; one of
them he must be; and it may be well
supposed that he was not a Creature
before the Creation of any.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly, Where, or with
whom, was this Word in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
it <hi>was</hi> saith the Holy Ghost,
<hi>with God.</hi> There being no creature
then existing, he could be no where
but with God; that is, the Father as
it is expressed in one of the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
before going, Prov. 8. 22. <hi>The
Lord possest me in the beginning of his
wayes before his works of old;</hi> ver. 30.
<hi>Then was I by him as one brought up
with him, and I was daily his delight,
rejoycing alwayes before him;</hi> that is,
in the <hi>beginning,</hi> this Word or Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God <hi>was with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:47790:45"/>
And this is the same, which our
Lord Jesus asserts concerning himself,
John 3. 13. <hi>And no man,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath
ascended up to Heaven, but he that came
down from Heaven, even the Son of man
which is in Heaven.</hi> And so in other
places. He affirms his being in
Heaven, that is, with God, at the
same time when he was in the earth;
whereby He declares the immensity
of his Nature, and the distinction of
his person; and his <hi>coming down</hi> from
Heaven before he was Incarnate on
the earth, declaring his preexistence;
by both manifesting the meaning of
this Expression, that in the beginning
he was with God. But hereunto
they have invented a notable evasion.
For although they know not well
what to make of the last clause of the
words, that say, <hi>then he was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
when he spake on Earth; <hi>the Son
of man which is in Heaven,</hi> answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the description of Gods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity,
<hi>do not I fill Heaven and Earth
saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 27. But say,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47790:46"/>
that he was there, <hi>by Heavenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
as another man may be; yet
they give a very clear Answer to what
must of necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y be included in his
<hi>descending from Heaven,</hi> namely his
preexistence to his Incarnation. For
they tell us, that before his publick
Ministry, he was in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(which is all they allow unto
him) <hi>taken up into Heaven,</hi> and there
taught the Gospel; as the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor
<hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended he was
taught his Alcoran; If you ask them,
who told them so, they cannot tell;
but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y can tell when it was; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when he was led by the spirit into
the Wilderness for forty days after his
baptism. But yet this instance is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to another her misadventure; in that
one of the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>angelists</hi> plainly affirms
that he was <hi>those forty dayes in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
with the wild beasts,</hi> Mark
17. 13. And so surely not in <hi>Heaven</hi>
in the same nature by his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<hi>with God and his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:47790:46"/>
And let me add this by the way
that the Interpretation of this place,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. to be mentioned after wards;
and those of the two places before
mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 8. 58. chap. 3. 31.
<hi>Faustus Socin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> learned out of his Uncle
<hi>Laelius</hi> papers as he confesseth, and
doth more than intimate that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
he had them as it were by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
and it may be so; they are
indeed so forced, absurd, and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that no man could ever fix upon
them by any reasonable Investigation.
But the Author of this Revelation, if
we may judge of the Parent by the
Child, could be no other but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Error and darkness. I suppose
therefore that notwithstanding these
exceptions, Christians will believe,
<hi>that in the beginning the word was with
God;</hi> that is, that the Son was with
the Father, as is frequently elsewhere
declared.</p>
            <p>But <hi>who</hi> was this <hi>Word?</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>He was God.</hi> He was so <hi>with
God,</hi> that is the Father, as that he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47790:47"/>
himself was <hi>God also.</hi> God, in that
the notion of God, which both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Scripture doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Not a God by Office, one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to that dignity, (which cannot
well be pretended before the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world) but as <hi>Thomas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
him, <hi>our Lord and our God,</hi> John
20. 28. Or as <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it; <hi>over
all God blessed for ever;</hi> or the <hi>most high
God,</hi> which these men love to deny.
Let not the infidelity of men excited
by the craft and malice of Satan s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ek
for blind occasions, and this matter is
determined; if the Word and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of God be able to umpire a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
amongst the Children of men.
Here is the sum of our Creed in this
matter; <hi>In the beginning the Word was
God;</hi> and so continues unto Eternity;
being Alpha and Om<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ga, the first and
the last, the Lord God Almighty.</p>
            <p>And to shew that he was so God in
the beginning, as that he was distinct,
<hi>one,</hi> in some thing from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by whom afterwards he was sent
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47790:47"/>
into the world, he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the
<hi>same was in the beginning with God.</hi>
Father also to evince what he hath
asserted, and revealed for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the Holy Ghost adds, both as a
firm declaration of his <hi>Eternal Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
and also his immediate care of
the world (which how he variously
exercised both in a way of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and grace, he afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares)
<hi>verse</hi> 3. <hi>All things were made
by him.</hi> He was so in the <hi>beginning,</hi>
before all things, as that he <hi>made</hi> them
all. And that it may not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that the <hi>All</hi> that he is said to
<hi>make,</hi> or <hi>create,</hi> was to be limited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any certain sort of things, he adds,
<hi>that without him nothing was made that
was made;</hi> which gives the first As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
an absolute <hi>universality</hi> as to
its subject.</p>
            <p>And this he farther describes, v. 10.
<hi>He was in the world, and the world was
made by him. The world that was
made,</hi> hath an usual distribution in
the Scripture, into the <hi>Heavens and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47790:48"/>
the Earth, and all things contained in
them;</hi> as Acts 4. 24. <hi>Lord thou art
God which hast made Heaven and Earth
and the Sea, and all that in them is;</hi>
that is the world, the making
whereof is expresly assigned unto the
Son, Heb. 1. 10. <hi>Thou Lord in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
hast laid the foundation of the
Earth, and the Heavens are the works
of thine hands.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
to secure our understandings in this
matter, instanceth in the most noble
parts of the creation, and which if
any might seem to be excepted from
being made by him, Col. 1. 16. <hi>For
by him were all things created that are
in Heaven, and that are in Earth visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and invisible, whether they be Thrones,
or Dominions, or Principalities, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
all things were created by him and
for him.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> say indeed,
that he made <hi>Angels</hi> to be <hi>Thrones</hi>
and <hi>Principalities;</hi> that is, he gave
them their <hi>Order,</hi> but not their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
which is expresly contrary to
the words of the Text; so that a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47790:48"/>
man knows not well what to say to
these persons, who at their pleasure
cast off the authority of God in his
word: <hi>By him were all things created,
that are in Heaven, and that are in
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What now can be required to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our faith in this matter? In what
words possible, could a divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Eternal Power and
Godhead of the Son of God, be made
more plain and clear unto the Sons
of men? Or how could the truth of
any thing more evidently be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto their minds? If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not the mind of God, and
Intention of the Holy Ghost in this
matter, we may utterly despair ever
to come to an acquaintance with any
thing that God reveals unto us; or
indeed with any thing else that is
expressed, or is to be expressed by
words. It is directly said that the
Word, that is Christ, as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all, <hi>was with God;</hi> distinct
from him, and <hi>was God,</hi> one with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47790:49"/>
him; that he was so in the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
before the Creation; that he
<hi>made all things,</hi> the world, all things
in Heaven and in Earth; and if he
be not God, who is? The summ is,
All the waies whereby we may know
God, are his Name, his Properties,
and his works. But they are all here
ascribed by the Holy Ghost to the
Son, to the Word; and he therefore
is God, or we know neither who,
nor what God is.</p>
            <p>But say the <hi>Socinians,</hi> these things
are quite otherwise, and the words
have another sense in them than you
imagine. What is it I pray? we bring
none to them, we impose no sense
upon them; we strain not any word
in them, from, besides, or beyond its
native, genuine signification, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
application in the Scripture,
and common use amongst men. What
then is this <hi>latent sense</hi> that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and is discoverable only by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
let us hear them coyning and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this sense of theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:47790:49"/>
First, They say that by <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
is not meant of the <hi>beginning of
all things,</hi> or the creation of them;
but the <hi>beginning of the preaching of
the Gospel.</hi> But why so I pray? Where
ever these words are else used in the
Scripture, they denote the <hi>beginning
of all things,</hi> or Eternity absolutely,
or an Existence preceding their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>In the beginning God created
Heaven and Earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. <hi>I was
set up from everlasting from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ere ever the earth was,</hi> Prov. 8. 23.
<hi>Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid
the foundations of the Earth,</hi> Heb. 1. 10.
And besides, these words are never
used <hi>absolutely</hi> any where for the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Gospel.</hi> There is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made indeed of the <hi>beginning of
the Gospel of Jesus Christ,</hi> Mark 1. 1.
which is referred to the preaching of
<hi>John Baptist.</hi> But in the <hi>beginning</hi>
absolutely, is never so used or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
And they must meet with
men of no small inclination unto
them, who will upon their desire in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47790:50"/>
a matter of so great importance, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the sense of words, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and proper, fixed by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use in the Scripture, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the same kind; for that
which is forced, and strained, and
not once <hi>exemplified</hi> in the whole
book of God. But the words they say
are to be restrained to the <hi>subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
treated of.</hi> Well, what is that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter? the <hi>new creation by the
Preaching of the Gospel.</hi> But this is
plainly false; nor will the words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any such sense; nor the context:
nor is any thing offered to give
evidence unto this corrupt pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, unless it be a farther
perverting of other testimonies, no less
clear than this.</p>
            <p>For what is according to this <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
the meaning of those words,
<hi>in the beginning was the Word?</hi> that
is, <hi>when John Baptist preached,</hi> and
said, <hi>this is the Lamb of God,</hi>
which was signally the beginning
of the Gospel, then <hi>he was.</hi> That
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47790:50"/>
is, <hi>he was when he was,</hi> no doubt
of it. And is not this a notable way
of interpreting of Scripture, which
these great pretenders to a Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in Reason, indeed <hi>Hucksters</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,</hi>
do make use of? But to go on
with them in this supposition; how
was he then with God, <hi>the Word
was with God.</hi> That is, say they,
<hi>he was then known only to God,</hi> before
<hi>John Baptist preached him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
But what shall compell us to
admit of this <hi>uncouth sense</hi> and Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>He was with God,</hi> that is, he
was known to God alone. What is
their singular herein, concerning how
many things may the same be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?
Besides, it is <hi>absolutely false.</hi>
He was known to the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi>
who came to his Mother with the
Message of his <hi>Incarnation, Luke</hi> 1. 35.
He was known to the <hi>two Angels</hi>
which appeared to the <hi>Shepherds</hi> upon
his birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. To all the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Host</hi> assembled to give praise and
glory to God on the Account of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47790:51"/>
Nativity, as those who came to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, and to pay him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
due unto him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10,
13, 14. He was known to <hi>his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the <hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> and to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph;</hi>
and <hi>Zachariah;</hi> and to <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi>
to <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> to <hi>John
Baptist;</hi> and probably to many more
to whom <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> spake of
him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 38. So that the sense
pretended to be wrung out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from these words, against their
proper meaning and intendment, is
indeed <hi>false</hi> and frivolous, and belongs
not at all unto them.</p>
            <p>But let this pass. What shall we
say to the next words, <hi>And the word
was God.</hi> Give us leave without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
from you, but to believe
this expression which comprizeth a
Revelation of God proposed to us on
purpose that we should believe it,
and there will be, as was said, an end
of this difference and debate. Yea,
but say they, these words have <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense</hi> also. Strange I they seem
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47790:51"/>
to be so plain and positive, that it is
impossible any other sense should be
fixed on them, but only this, that
the Word was in the beginning, and
was God, and therefore is so still, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he who is once God can cease so
to be. But the meaning is; that
afterwards, <hi>God exalted him and made
him God, as to Rule, Authority and
Power.</hi> This <hi>making of him God,</hi> is an
expression very offensive to the ears
of all sober Christians, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before exploded. And these
things here, as all other figments,
hang together like a rope of sands.
<hi>In the beginning of the Gospel he was
God, before any knew him but only God.</hi>
That is, after he had preached the
Gospel, and dyed, and rose again, and
was exalted at the right hand of
God, he was made God, and that
not properly, which is absolutely
impossible, but in an improper sense.
How prove they then this perverse
<hi>non-sense</hi> to be the sense of these plain
words. They say it must needs be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47790:52"/>
so. Let them believe them who are
willing to perish with them.</p>
            <p>Thus far then we have their sense;
<hi>In the beginning,</hi> that is, <hi>about sixteen
or seventeen hundred years ago;</hi> the
<hi>Word,</hi> that is, the <hi>Humane nature of
Christ</hi> before it was made flesh, which
it was in its being; was with God;
that is, known to God alone; and in
<hi>the beginning,</hi> that is afterwards, not
in the Beginning, <hi>was made God;</hi>
which is the summ of their Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this place.</p>
            <p>But what shall we say, to what is
affirmed concerning <hi>his making of all
things, so as that without him,</hi> that is,
without his making of it, nothing was
made that was made; especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that these <hi>all things</hi> are expresly
said to be the <hi>world, vers.</hi> 10. And
all things therein contained, even in
<hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> Col. 1. 16. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
man would think that they
should now be taken hold of, and that
there is no way of escape left unto
them. But they have it in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47790:52"/>
By the <hi>all things here</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>all things of the Gospel,</hi> the
preaching of it, the sending of the
Apostles to preach it, and to declare
the Will of God; and by the <hi>world,</hi>
is intended the world to come, or
the new state of things under the
Gospel. This is the substance of
what is pleaded by the greatest
masters amongst them in this matter,
and they are not ashamed thus to
plead.</p>
            <p>And the Reader in this instance
may easily discern what a desperate
cause they are engaged in, and how
bold and desperate they are in the
management of it. For,</p>
            <p>First, The words are a plain Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of the
<hi>Word,</hi> by his <hi>Divine Power</hi> and
works, as the very series of them
declares. He was God, and he made
all things; <hi>for he that made all things
is God,</hi> Heb. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no one word
spoken concerning the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47790:53"/>
Preaching of it, nor any effects of
that Preaching, which the Apostle
expresly insists upon and declares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<hi>verse</hi> 14. and so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>making of all things</hi>
here ascribed unto the Word, was
done in the <hi>beginning.</hi> But that <hi>making
of all things</hi> which they intend, in
erecting the Church by the Preaching
of the VVord, was not done in <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
but afterwards; most of it as
themselves confess, after the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In this gloss what is the
meaning of <hi>all things?</hi> only <hi>some things</hi>
say the <hi>Socinians.</hi> VVhat is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>were made?</hi> that is, <hi>were mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
by him that is the <hi>Apostles</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
preaching the Gospel; and this
in the beginning; <hi>after it was past;</hi> for
so they say expresly that the Principal
things here intended, were effected
by the Apostles afterwards.</p>
            <p>I think since the <hi>beginning,</hi> place it
when you will the beginning of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47790:53"/>
world, or the beginning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
there was never such an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word; of God or man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is said <hi>he made the World,</hi>
and he came into it; namely, the
world which he made and the <hi>World,</hi>
or the Inhabitants of it, knew him
not. But the VVorld they intend
did know him; or the Church knew
him, and acknowledged him to be
the Son of God. For that was the
foundation that it was built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I have instanced directly in this <hi>only
testimony</hi> to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a pledge
of the full confirmation which may
be given unto this great fundamental
truth, by a due improvement of those
other Testimonies, or distinct Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which speak no less expresly to
the same purpose. And of them
there is not any one, but we are ready
to vindicate it, if called thereunto,
from the exceptions of these men;
which how bold and <hi>Sophistical</hi> they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47790:54"/>
are, we may in these now considered,
also learn and know.</p>
            <p>It appeareth then that there is a
full sufficient Revelation made in the
Scripture of the Eternal Deity of the
Son of God; and that he is so, as is
the Father also. More particular
testimonies I shall not at present insist
upon, referring the full discussion and
vindication of these truths, to another
season.</p>
            <p>We are therefore in the next place
to manifest that the same, or the like
testimony, is given unto the Deity of
the Holy Spirit; that is, that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
and declared in the Scripture,
as the Object of our Faith, Worship,
and Obedience on the account, and
for the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ason of those <hi>divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneies</hi>
which are the sole Reason of
our yielding religious worship unto
any, or expecting from any the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that is promised unto us, or to
be brought by them to the end for
which we are. And herein, lyes as was
shewed, the concernment of faith.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47790:54"/>
When that knows what it is to believe
as on Divine Revelation, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
thereby to regulate the soul in
its present obedience and future expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
seeing it is its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nature to work
by love and hope, there it rests. Now
this is done to the utmost satisfaction
in the Revelation that is made of the
divine Existence, divine Excellencies,
and divine Operations of the Spirit as
shall be briefly manifested.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed, we may in
our way observe a great congruency
of success in those who have <hi>denyed
the Deity of the Son,</hi> and those who
have denyed that of the holy Spirit.
For as to the Son, after some men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
once to dis-believe the Revelation
concerning him, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him to <hi>be God and man in
one person,</hi> they could never settle nor
agree, either what, or who he was,
or who was his Father, or why he
was the Son. Some said he was a
<hi>Phantasm</hi> or appearance; and that he
had no real subsistence in this world,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47790:55"/>
and that all that was done by him
was an <hi>appearance,</hi> he himself being
they know not what elsewhere. That
proud beast <hi>Paulus Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>satenus,</hi> whose
<hi>flagitious life,</hi> contended for a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
in wickedness with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
heresies, was one of the first
after the Jews, that positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for <hi>his being a man</hi> and no
more, who was followed by <hi>Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and some others. The <hi>Arians</hi>
perceiving the folly of this opinion,
with the <hi>odium</hi> of it amongst all that
bare the name of Christians, and
that they had as good deny the whole
Scripture as not grant unto him a
<hi>preexistence</hi> in a <hi>divine nature</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to his Incarnation, they framed
a <hi>new Deity</hi> which God should make
before the world, in all things like to
himself, but not the same with him in
<hi>Essence</hi> and substance; but to be so
<hi>like him,</hi> that by the writings of some
of them, ye can scarce know one from
the other; and that this was the Son
of God also who was afterwards In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47790:55"/>
Others in the mean time
had more monstrous imaginations;
some that he was an <hi>Angel,</hi> some that
he was the <hi>Sun,</hi> some that he was the
<hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> some the <hi>light
within men.</hi> Departing from their
proper rest, so have they hovered
about, and so have they continued to
do, until this day.</p>
            <p>In the same manner it is come to
pass with them who have denyed the
<hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> They could
never find where to stand or abide;
but <hi>one</hi> hath cryed up one thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another. At first they observed
that such things were every where
ascribed unto him in the Scripture, as
uncontroulably evidenced him to be
an <hi>intelligent voluntary Agent.</hi> This they
found so plain and evident, that they
could not deny, but that he was a <hi>person</hi>
or an intelligent subsistence. Wherefore
seeing they were resolved not to
assent unto the Revelation of his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God,</hi> they made him a <hi>created spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
chief and above all others. But
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47790:56"/>
still whatever else he were, he was <hi>only
a Creature.</hi> And this course some of
late also have steered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> on the other hand,
observing that such things are <hi>assigned</hi>
and ascribed unto him, as that if they
acknowledge him to be a <hi>person,</hi> or a
<hi>substance,</hi> they must upon necessity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to be God, though they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not at first at all agreed what to
think or say concerning him positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet they all coneurred perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in denying his <hi>personality.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
some of them said he was the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> which others of them have
confuted; some that he was <hi>Christ.</hi>
Neither could they agree whether
there was <hi>one Holy Ghost</hi> or more;
whether the <hi>spirit of God</hi> and the <hi>Good
spirit of God,</hi> and the <hi>holy spirit,</hi> be the
same or no. In general now they
conclude that he is <hi>vis Dei,</hi> or <hi>virtus
Dei,</hi> or <hi>efficacia Dei;</hi> no substance, but
a <hi>quality</hi> that may be considered either
as being in God, and then they say it
<hi>is the spirit of God;</hi> or as sanctifying,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47790:56"/>
and conforming men unto God, and
then they say, it is the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
Whether these things do answer the
Revelation made in the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the Eternal Spirit</hi> of God,
will be immediately manifested. Our
<hi>Quakers,</hi> who have for a long season
hovered up and down like a <hi>swarm
of flies</hi> with a confused noise and
humming, begin now to settle in the
opinions lately by them declared for.
But what their thoughts will fall into
be, concerning the Holy Ghost, when
they shall be contented to speak Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly,
and according to the usage of
other men, or the pattern of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the great rule of speaking or
treating about spiritual things, I know
not; and am uncertain whether they
do so themselves or no. Whether he
may be the <hi>light within them,</hi> or an
infallible <hi>afflatus</hi> is uncertain. In the
mean time, what is revealed unto us
in the Scripture to be believed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Holy Ghost, his Deity, and
personality, may be seen in the ensuing
testimonies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47790:57"/>
The summ of this Revelation is,
that the Holy Spirit is an eternally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
existing substance, the Author of
Divine operations, and the Object of
Divine and Religious Worship; that
is, <hi>over all God Blessed for ever;</hi> as the
ensuing testimonies evince. Gen 1. 2.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47790:58"/>
Which the <hi>Socinians</hi> will not say is
by vertue of an <hi>Exaltation</hi> unto an
Office or Authority, as they say of the
Son; That he is an <hi>intelligent volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Divine Agent;</hi> he knoweth, he
worketh as he will, which things if
in their frequent repetition, they are
not sufficient to evince an <hi>intelligent
Agent,</hi> a personal subsistence, that
hath Being, Life and Will, we must
confess that the Scripture was written
on purpose to lead us into mistakes
and misapprehensions of what we
are under penalty of eternal ruine
rightly to apprehend and believe.
It declareth also, that he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Worker of all sorts of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Operations</hi> requiring Immensity,
Omnipotency, Omnisciency, and all
other Divine Excellencies unto their
working and effecting. Moreover,
it is <hi>revealed,</hi> that he is peculiarly to
<hi>be believed in;</hi> and may peculiarly be
<hi>sinned</hi> against; the great Author of
all Grace in Believers, and order in
the Church. This is the summ of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47790:59"/>
what we believe of what is revealed
in the Scripture concerning the Holy
Ghost.</p>
            <p>As in the consideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<hi>head,</hi> we vindicated <hi>one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>
in particular from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of the adversaries of the
truth, so on this we may briefly summ
up the <hi>evidence</hi> that is given us in
the testimonies before produced, that
the <hi>Reader</hi> may the more easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their intendment, and what
in particular, they bear witnesse
unto.</p>
            <p>The summ is, that the Holy Ghost
is a <hi>divine distinct</hi> person, and neither
meerly the power or vertue of God,
nor any <hi>created Spirit</hi> whatever. This
plainly appears from what is revealed
concerning him. For he who is placed
in the same <hi>series</hi> or order with
other divine persons, without the
least note of difference or distinction
from them, as to an Interest in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality,
who hath the <hi>names</hi> proper
to a divine person only, and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47790:59"/>
and directly called by them,
who also hath <hi>personal properties,</hi> and
is the voluntary Author of personal
divine Operations, and the proper
Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of Divine Worship, he is a
<hi>distinct divine person.</hi> And if these
things be not a sufficient evidence
and demonstration of a <hi>divine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
substance,</hi> I shall, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
despair to understand any thing
that is expressed and declared by
words. But now thus it is with
the Holy Ghost according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
made concerning him in the
Scripture. For,</p>
            <p>First, He is placed in the same rank
and order without any note of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or distinction as to a distinct
interest in the Divine Nature, that is,
as we shall see, personality, with
other Divine persons, Matth. 28. 19.
<hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
1 John 5. 7. There be three that bear
witness in Heaven, the Father, the Son,
and the Spirit, and these three are one,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47790:60"/>
1 Cor. 12. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>No man can say
the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord, but
by the Holy Ghost; now there are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of gifts, but the same Spirit, and
there are differences of administrations,
but the same Lord; and there are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of operations, but it is the same
God which worketh all in all.</hi> Neither
doth a denyal of his divine being
and distinct existence leave any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sense unto these Expressions.
For read the words of the first place
from the mind of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and
see what is it can be gathered from
them. <hi>Baptizing them, in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the
vertue or efficacy of the Father.</hi> Can any
thing be more absonant from Faith
and Reason, than this absurd expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
And yet is it the direct sense, if
it be any, that these men put upon
the words. To joyn a <hi>quality</hi> with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
persons, and that in such
things and cases, as wherein they are
proposed under a personal considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a strange kind of Mysterie. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47790:60"/>
the like may be manifested concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He also hath the <hi>Names</hi>
proper to a divine person only. For
he is expresly called <hi>God, Acts</hi> 5.
He who is termed the <hi>Holy Ghost,
ver.</hi> 3. And the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,
verse</hi> 9. Is called also <hi>God, ver.</hi> 4. Now
this is the name of a divine Person
on one Account or other. The <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
would not allow Christ to be called
<hi>God,</hi> were he not a divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
though not by <hi>nature,</hi> yet by
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffice and authority.</hi> And I suppose,
they will not find out an office for
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> whereunto he might be
exalted on the account whereof he
might become God, seeing this would
acknowledge him to be a <hi>person</hi>
which they deny. So he is called the
<hi>Comforter, John</hi> 16. 7. A <hi>personal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation</hi>
this is also; and because he is
the <hi>Comforter</hi> of all Gods people, it
can be the name of none but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
person. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
it is frequently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:47790:61"/>
               <hi>come, that he shall,</hi> and <hi>will do such and
such things,</hi> all of them declaring him
to be a person.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He hath <hi>personal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
assigned unto him, as a <hi>Will,</hi>
1 Cor. 12. 11. <hi>He divideth to every
man severally as he will;</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
1 Cor. 2. 10. <hi>The Spirit search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things, yea, the deep things of
God.</hi> As also all the actings that are
ascribed unto him are all of them
such, as undeniably affirm personal
properties in their principle and
Agent. For,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He is the <hi>voluntary</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Divine operations. He of
old <hi>cherished the creation,</hi> Gen. 1. 3.
<hi>The Spirit of God moved upon the face
of the waters.</hi> He formed and <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Heavens.</hi> He inspired, acted
and spake, in and by the Prophets,
Acts 28. 25, 26. <hi>Well spake the Holy
Ghost by</hi> Isaiah <hi>the Prophet unto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 21. <hi>The Prophecy came
not in old time by the will of man, but
holy men of God spake as they were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47790:61"/>
moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> He regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth,
enlightneth, sanctifieth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth,
instructeth, leadeth, guideth,
all the Disciples of Christ, as the
Scriptures every where testifie. Now
all these are <hi>personal Operations,</hi> and
cannot with any pretence of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
or consistency with Reason be
constantly and uniformly assigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>vertue.</hi> He is, as the
Father and Son, God with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Omniscience and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
of Life, Understanding and
Will; and by these properties, works,
acts, and produceth effects according
to Wisdom, Choice, and Power.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The same regard is had to
him in Faith, Worship, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as unto the other persons of the
Father and Son. For our being <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>
into his name, is our solemn
engagement to <hi>believe in him,</hi> to yield
obedience to him, and to worship
him, as it puts the same obligation
upon us to the Father and the Son.
So also in reference unto the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47790:62"/>
of the Church. He commands
that the <hi>Ministers of it be separated
unto himself,</hi> Acts 13. 2. <hi>The Holy Ghost
said, separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for
the work whereunto I have called them.</hi>
Ver. 4. <hi>So they being sent forth by the
Holy Ghost departed,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of all the religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Church.</p>
            <p>And on the same account is he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, 4, 9. For
there is the same Reason of Sin and
Obedience. Against whom a man
may sin formally and ultimately, him
he is bound to <hi>obey,</hi> worship, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in. And this can be no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but God himself. For what may
be the sense of this expression: <hi>Thou
hast lyed to the efficacy of God in his
operations;</hi> Or how can we be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
obliged unto obedience to a
<hi>quality.</hi> There must then an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Obligation unto Faith, Trust,
and Religious Obedience be supposed
as the ground of rendring a person
capable of being guilty of sin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47790:62"/>
wards any. For sin is but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailure in
Faith, Obedience or Worship. These
therefore are due unto the Holy
Ghost; or a man could not sin against
him so signally and fatally as some
are said to do, in the foregoing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>I say therefore unto this part of
our Cause, as unto the other, that
unless we will cast off all Reverence
of God, and in a king of <hi>Atheism,</hi>
which as I suppose the prevailing
wickedness of this Age hath not yet
arrived unto, say that the Scriptures
were written on purpose to deceive
us, and to lead us into mistakes about,
and misapprehensions of what it
proposeth unto us, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Holy Ghost to be a
substance, a person, God; yet distinct
from the Father and the Son. For to
tell us, that he will come unto us,
that he will be our Comforter, that he
will teach us, lead us, guide us, that he
spake of old, in and by the Prophets,
that they were <hi>moved</hi> by him, acted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47790:63"/>
by him, that he <hi>searcheth the deep
things of God,</hi> works as he will, that
he appointeth to himself Ministers in
the Church; In a word, to declare
in places innumerable, what he hath
done, what he doth, what he will
do, what he sayes, and speaks, how
he acts, and proceeds, what his <hi>will</hi>
is, and to warn us, that we grieve
him not, sin not against him, with
things innumerable of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and all this while to oblige us
to believe that he is not a person, an
helper, a comforter, a searcher, a
willer, but a quality in some especial
operations of God, or his power and
vertue in them, were to <hi>distract</hi> men,
not to instruct them, and leave them
no certain conclusion but this, that
there is nothing certain in the whole
Book of God. And of no other
tendency are these and the like ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of our Adversaries in this
matter.</p>
            <p>But let us briefly consider what is
objected in general unto the truth we
have confirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47790:63"/>
First, They say, the Holy Spirit is
said to be <hi>given,</hi> to be <hi>sent,</hi> to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed</hi>
on men, and to be promised
unto them; and therefore it cannot
be that he should be God; for how
can any of these things be spoken of
God.</p>
            <p>I answer, As these Expressions do
not prove him to be God, nor did
ever any produce them to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet they undeniably prove <hi>him</hi>
to be a person; or an intellingent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Agent, concerning whom
they are spoken and affirmed. For
how can the power of God, or a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
as they speak, be said to be <hi>sent,</hi> to
be given, to be bestowed on men; so
that these very Expressions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to their imaginations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He who is God equal in
nature and being with the Father,
may be promised, sent, and given,
with respect unto the holy dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and condescension wherein he
hath undertaken the Office of being
our Comforter and Sanctifier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47790:64"/>
Thirdly, The communications,
distributions, impartings, divisions of
the spirit, which they mention, as they
respect the <hi>Object</hi> of them, Or those on
whom they were, or are bestowed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
only works, gifts, operations and
effects of the spirit, the rule whereof is
expressed, 1 Cor. 12. 7. <hi>He workeeth
them in whom he will, and as he will.</hi>
And whether these, and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
taken from Actings and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which are plainly interpreted
and explained in sundry places of
Scripture, and evidently enough in the
particular places where they are used,
are sufficient to impeach the truth of
the Revelation before declared, all
who have a due reverence of God, his
word and truths, will easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and discern.</p>
            <p>These things being declared in the
Scripture concerning the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Revealed, and these three are
one; that is, one God, joyntly to be
worshipped, feared, adored, believed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47790:64"/>
in and obeyed, in order unto eternal
life. For although this doth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and necessarily follow from
what is declared and hath been spoken
concerning the one God, or onenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of the Derty, yet for the confirmation
of our faith, and that we may not by
the distinct consideration of the <hi>three</hi>
be taken off from the <hi>one,</hi> it is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
declared, that these <hi>three are
one,</hi> that one, the one and same God,
But whereas, as was said before, this
can no otherwise be, the testimonies
given thereunto are not so frequently
multiplyed as they are unto those
other heads of this truth, which
through the craft of Satan, and the
pride of men, might be more lyable to
exceptions. But yet they are clear,
full, and distinctly sufficient for faith
to acquiesce in immediately, without
any other expositions, interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or arguments, beyond our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the naked importance
of the words. Such are they, of the
Father the Son, John 10. 30. <hi>I and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47790:65"/>
my Father are one.</hi> Father, Son and
Spirit, Joh. 5. 7. <hi>three that bare witness
in Heaven, Father, Son and Spirit, and
these three are one,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them in the name of the Father,
Son, and Spirit.</hi> For if those into
whose name we are Baptized be not
<hi>one in nature,</hi> we are by our <hi>Baptism</hi>
engaged into the Service and Worship
of more Gods than one. For as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Baptized, or sacredly initiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or in the name of any one doth
<hi>Sacramentally</hi> bind us unto a holy and
Religious obedience unto him, and in
all things to the avowing of him as the
God whose we are, and whom we
serve, as here we are in the Name of
the Father, Son and Spirit, so if they
are not one God, the Blasphemous
consequence before mentioned must
unavoidably be admitted; which
it also doth upon the <hi>Socinian</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who whilest of all others they
seem to contend most for one God, are
indeed direct <hi>polutheists,</hi> by owning
others with Religious respect, due
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47790:65"/>
to God alone, which are not
so.</p>
            <p>Once more! it is revealed also,
that these <hi>three</hi> are <hi>distinct</hi> among
themselves by certain peculiar <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
properties,</hi> if I may yet use these
terms. So that they are distinct, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
divine, intelligent voluntary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of operation or working, and
that in, and by internal acts one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, and in acts that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
respect the Creation and the
several parts of it. Now this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>originally</hi> lyeth in this; that the
<hi>Father begetteth the Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son is
begotten of the Father;</hi> and the <hi>Holy
Spirit proceedeth from both of them.</hi>
The manner of these things, so far as
they may be expressed unto our Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
shall afterwards be spoken to.
At present it sufficeth for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and confirmation of our faith,
that the distinctions named are clearly
<hi>revealed in the Scripture,</hi> and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be its proper object in this
matter. Psalm 2. 7. <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:47790:66"/>
this day have I begotten thee. <hi>Matth.
16. 16.</hi> Thou art Christ, the Son of the
living God. Joh. 1. 14. We saw his
Glory, the glory of the only begotten of
the Father. <hi>Ver. 18.</hi> No man hath seen
God at any time, the only begotten Son
which is in the bosome of the Father he
hath revealed him. <hi>John 5. 26.</hi> For as
the Father hath life in himself, so hath
he given to the Son to have life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>1 Joh. 5. 20.</hi> The Son of God is come,
and hath given us an understanding. <hi>Joh.
14. 26.</hi> But when the Comforter is come,
whom I will send unto you from the Father
even the spirit of truth which proceedeth
from the Father, He shall testifie of me.</p>
            <p>Now as the nature of this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
lies in their mutual Relation one
to another, so it is the foundation of
those <hi>distinct actings</hi> and operations,
whereby the distinction it self is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifested and confirmed. And
these actings as was said, are either
such, as where one of them is the
object of anothers actings, or such as
have the creature for their objects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:47790:66"/>
The first sort are testified unto, <hi>Psalm</hi>
110. 1. <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 20.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. 21, 22. Most of which places have
been before recited. They, which
thus <hi>know</hi> each other, <hi>love</hi> each other,
<hi>delight</hi> in each other, must needs be
distinct; and so are they represented
unto our faith. And for the other sort
of actings the Scripture is full of the
expressions of them; see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24.
<hi>Zachariah</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
            <p>Our conclusion from the whole is;
that there is nothing more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Scripture, than this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
truth is; that there is one God,
Father, Son, and holy Ghost; which
are divine, distinct, intelligent, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
omnipotent principles of operation,
and working, which whosoever thinks
himself obliged to believe the Scripture
must believe; and concerning others,
in this discourse, we are not solicitous.</p>
            <p>This is that which was first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
namely, to manifest what is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47790:67"/>
expresly revealed in the Scripture
concerning God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; so as that we may duly
believe in him, yield Obedience unto
him, enjoy communion with him,
walk in his love and fear, and so come
at length to be blessed with him for
evermore. Nor doth <hi>faith</hi> for its secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
establishment and direction, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
stand in need of any farther
Exposition or Explanation of these
things; or the use of any <hi>terms</hi> not
consecrated to the present service by
the Holy Ghost. But whereas it may
be variously assaulted by the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan, and opposed by the
subtle <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phisms</hi> of men of corrupt
minds; and whereas it is the duty of
the Disciples of Christ to grow in the
knowledge of God, and our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
apprehension of the things they
do believe, so far as they are capable of
them; this Doctrine hath in all ages
of the Church, been explained and
taught, in and by such Expressions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47790:67"/>
Terms, and Propositions, as farther
declare what is necessarily included in
it, or consequent unto it; with an
exclusion of such things, notions,
and apprehensions, as are neither the
one, nor the other. This I shall briefly
manifest, and then vindicate the whole
from some exceptions, and so close
this dissertation.</p>
            <p>That God is <hi>One,</hi> was declared and
proved. Now this <hi>Oneness</hi> can respect
nothing but the <hi>Nature, Being, Substance</hi>
or <hi>Essence</hi> of God. God is one in this
respect. Some of these words indeed are
not used in the Scripture. But whereas
they are of the same importance and
signification, and none of them include
any thing of imperfection, they are
properly used in the declaration of the
<hi>Vnity</hi> of the God-head. There is
mention in the Scripture of the <hi>God-head</hi>
of God, Rom. 1. 20. <hi>His Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
power and Godhead.</hi> And of his
<hi>Nature,</hi> by excluding them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>objects</hi> of our Worship, who are
<hi>not God by nature,</hi> Gal. 4. 8. Now

this <hi>natural Godhead</hi> of God, is, his
<hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> with all the Holy
divine Excellencies which naturally
and necessarily appertain thereunto.
Such are <hi>Eternity,</hi> Immensity, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
Life, <hi>Infinite Holiness,</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the like. This one Nature,
Substance or Essence, being the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Substance, or Essence of God, as
God, is the <hi>Nature, Essence</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of the <hi>Father,</hi> Son, and Spirit,
one and the same absolutely in and
unto each of them. For none can be
God as they are revealed to be, but
by vertue of this divine Nature or.
Being. Herein consists the <hi>Vnity of
the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>

Scripture reveals between Father, Son,
and <hi>Spirit</hi> is that whereby they are

                  </gap>stasis,</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> distinctly
subsisting in the same divine <hi>Essence</hi> or
<hi>Being.</hi> Now a <hi>divine person,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>divine Essence upon the
account of an especial property, subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an especial manner.</hi> As in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47790:68"/>
Person of the Father, there is the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence,</hi> and Being, with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of <hi>begetting the Son,</hi> subsisting in
an especial manner as the Father.
And because this Person hath the
whole <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> all the <hi>Essential
Properties</hi> of that nature are in that
person. The Wisdom, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of God, the Will of God, the
Immensity of God, is in that person;
not as that Person, but as the Person is
God. The like is to be said of the
Persons of the <hi>Son</hi> and of the Holy
Ghost. Hereby each Person having
the Understanding, the Will, and
power of God, becomes a distinct
principle of operation; and yet all
their actings ad <hi>extra</hi> being the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God, they are <hi>undivided,</hi> and
are all the works of one, of the self
same God. And these things do not
only necessarily follow, but are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
included in the Revelation made
concerning God, and his subsistence in
the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>There are indeed very many other
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47790:69"/>
things that <hi>are</hi> taught, and disputed,
about this Doctrine of the <hi>

                  </gap>rinity,</hi> as
the <hi>manner</hi> of the eternal Genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on
of the Son, of the Essence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
of the <hi>procession</hi> of the Holy
Ghost, and the difference of it from
the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son; of the
<hi>mutual in-being</hi> of the <hi>persons,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their unity in the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or Essence; the nature of their
<hi>personal subsistence,</hi> with respect unto
the properties whereby they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
distinguished, all which are <hi>true</hi>
and defensible against all the Sophisms
of the Adversaries of this truth. Yet
because the distinct apprehension of
them, and their accurate expression, is
not necessary unto faith, as it is our
guide and principle in and unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship and obedience, they
need not here be insisted on. Nor
are those brief Explications them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before mentioned, so proposed
as to be placed immediately in the
same rank or order with the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Revelations before infisted on, but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47790:69"/>
only are pressed as proper Expressions
of what is revealed to increase our
light and further our edification.
And although they cannot rationally
be opposed or denyed, nor ever were
by any, but such as deny and oppose
the things themselves as revealed, yet
they that do so deny or oppose them,
are to be required positively in the
first place to deny or disapprove the
<hi>Oneness</hi> of the Deity, or to prove that
the Father, or Son, or Holy Ghost in
particular, are not God, before they
be allowed to speak one word against
the manner of the <hi>Explication</hi> of the
truth concerning them. For either
they grant the <hi>Revelation</hi> declared and
contended for, or they do not: If they
do; let that concession be first laid
down, namely, that the Father, Son,
and Spirit are one God; and then let
it be debated whether they are one in
Substance and three in Persons, or
how else the matter is to be stated.
If they deny it; it is a <hi>plain madness</hi>
to <hi>dispute of the manner of any thing,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:47790:70"/>
and the way of expressing it, whilst
the thing it self is denyed to have a
being: for of that which <hi>is not,</hi> there
is neither manner, property, adjunct,
nor effect. Let then such persons, as
this sort of men are ready to attempt
with their <hi>Sophistry,</hi> and to amuse
with cavils about persons, <hi>substances,
subsistences,</hi> and the like, desire to
know of them what it is that they
would be at. What would they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
what would they disapprove. Is
it that God is one; or that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is God, or the Son, or the Holy
Ghost is so. If they deny, or oppose
either of these, they have Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and instances of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or may have, in a readiness, to
confound the Devil and all his Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
If they will not do so, if they
refuse it, then let them know, that it
is most foolish and unreasonable to
contend about <hi>Expressions</hi> and Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of any thing, or doctrine,
about the manner, respects, or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any thing, untill the <hi>thing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47790:70"/>
it self,</hi> or Doctrine, be plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
or denyed. If this they refuse,
as generally they do and will, which
I speak upon sufficient experience,
and will not be induced to deal
openly, properly and rationally, but
will keep to their <hi>Cavils</hi> and <hi>Sophisms,</hi>
about terms and expressions, all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
debate, or conference with them,
may justly, and ought both consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously
and rationally to be refused,
and rejected. For these sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of God and the Gospel, are not
lightly to be made the subject of mens
contests and disputations.</p>
            <p>But as we dealt before in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
so here I shall give Instances of
the Sophistical exceptions that are
used against the whole of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and that with respect unto
some late collections, and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them: From whence they are
taken up and used by many who seem
not to understand the words, Phrases
and Expressions themselves, which
they make use of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:47790:71"/>
The summ of what they say in
general, is, <hi>How can these things be?
How can three be one, and one be three?
Every person hath its own substance, and
therefore if there be three persons, there
must be three substances; and so three
Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Every person hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
its <hi>own substance,</hi> for the <hi>one
substance</hi> of the Deity, is the substance
of each person, so it is still but one.
But each person hath not its <hi>own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
substance,</hi> because the substance
of them all is the same, as hath been
proved.</p>
            <p>2. They say, <hi>That if each person be
God, then each person is Infinite, and
there being three persons there must be
three Infinites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This follows not in the least;
for each person is <hi>Infinite</hi> as he is
God. <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> divine properties,</hi> such as to
be Infinite is, belong not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on the account of their <hi>persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
but on the account of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is one, for they are all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
properties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47790:71"/>
But they say, <hi>If each person be God,
and that God subsist in three persons,
then in each person there are three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The collusion of this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism</hi>
consists in that expression, <hi>be
God; and that God;</hi> in the first
place, the nature of God is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in the latter a singular person.
Place the words intelligibly and they
are thus; If each person be God,
and the nature of God subsists
in three persons, then in each
person there are three persons; and
then the folly of it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>But they farther infer; <hi>That if we
deny the persons to be Infinite, then an
Infinite Being hath a finite mode of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting,
and so I know not what supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they make hence; that seeing there
are not three Infinites, then the Father,
Son, and Spirit are three finites that make
up an Infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pitiful weakness of this Cavil
is open to all: for <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:47790:72"/>
are properties and adjuncts of <hi>Beings,</hi>
and not of the <hi>manner</hi> of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of any thing. The <hi>nature</hi> of
each person is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and so is each
person, because of that nature. Of
the manner of their subsistence, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
and Infinite cannot be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
or spoken, no farther than
to say, an <hi>Infinite</hi> Being doth so
subsist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you grant,</hi> say they, <hi>that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true God is the Father, and then if
Christ be the only true God, he is the
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We say, the only true God is
<hi>Father,</hi> Son, and Holy Ghost. We
never say, the Scripture never sayes,
that the <hi>Father only is the true
God,</hi> whence it would follow,
that he that is the true God, is the
Father. But we grant the Father
to be the <hi>only trne God:</hi> and so we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is the Son also. And it doth not

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all thence follow, that the Son is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Father. Because in saying the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the true God, we respect
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47790:72"/>
not his <hi>paternity,</hi> or his paternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his Son; but his <hi>Nature, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Being.</hi> And the same we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
concerning the other persons.
And to say, that because each person
is God, one person must be another,
is to crave leave to <hi>disbelieve</hi> what
God hath revealed, without giving
any Reason at all for their so doing.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Sophism</hi> being borrowed
from another, namely <hi>Crellius,</hi> who
insisted much upon it, I shall upon
his account, and not on theirs, who
as far as I can apprehend, understand
little of the intendment of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it more fully out of the way.
It is proposed by him in way of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,
thus, <hi>The only true God is the
Father; Christ is the only true God;
therefore he is the Father.</hi> Now this
Syllogism is ridiculously Sophystical.
For in a <hi>Categorical Syllogism</hi> the Major
Proposition is not to be particular,
nor equipollent to a particular. For
from such a Proposition, when any
thing communicable to more is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47790:73"/>
subject of it, and is restrained unto
one particular, nothing can be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the conclusion. But such is
this Proposition here, the only true
God is the Father. It is a particular
Proposition; wherein the <hi>subject</hi> is
restrained unto a singular, or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
predicate, though in it self com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to more. Now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o made particular, the
terms of the subject or predicate are
supposed rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>procal; namely, that
one God, and the Father, are the
same; which is false: Unless it be first
proved, that the name <hi>God,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to no more, or no other,
than is the other term of Father;
which to suppose, is to begg the
whole Question. For the <hi>only true
God,</hi> hath a larger signification than
the term of Father, or Son. So that
though the <hi>only true God</hi> be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet every one who is true God,
is not the Father: Seeing then that
the name of <hi>God</hi> here, supplyes the
pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of a <hi>species,</hi> though it be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47790:73"/>
absolutely, as it respects the
Divine Nature which is absolutely
singular, and one, and cannot
be multiplyed; yet in respect of
<hi>communication</hi> it is otherwise, it is
communicated unto more, namely,
to the Father, <hi>Son</hi> and Holy Ghost.
And therefore if any thing be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be concluded from hence, the
Proposition must be expressed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what the <hi>subject</hi> requires,
as capable of <hi>communication</hi> or Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
to more than one, as thus;
who ever is the only true God, is
the Father; which <hi>Proposition</hi> these
Persons and their Masters, shall never
be able to prove.</p>
            <p>I have given in particular these
<hi>strictures</hi> thus <hi>briefly,</hi> upon these
empty Sophisms; partly, because
they are well removed already,
and partly because they are meer
<hi>exscriptions</hi> out of an Author not
long since translated into <hi>English,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom an entire answer may ere
long be returned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47790:74"/>
That which at present shall suffice,
is to give a general <hi>answer</hi> unto all
these cavills, with all of the same
kind, which the men of these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
do usually insist upon.</p>
            <p>I. The things, they say, <hi>which we
teach concerning the Trinity, are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Reason;</hi> and thereof <hi>they</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give sundry instances,
wherein the summ of the opposition
which they make unto this truth
doth consist. But first, I ask what
Reason is it that they intend? It is
their own, the carnal reason of men.
By that they will judge of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mysteries. The Scripture tells
us indeed, that the <hi>Spirit of a man
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ich is in him knows the things of a
man.</hi> A mans Spirit, by natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
may judge of natural things.
But the things of God, knoweth <hi>no
man but the spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11.
So that what we know of these
things, we must receive upon the
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lation of the Spirit of God
meerly; if the Apostle may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47790:74"/>
And it is given unto men to
know the Mysteries of the Kingdom
of God. To some, and not to others;
and unless it be so given them they
cannot know them. In particular,
none can know the Father, unless
the Son reveal him. Nor will, or
doth, or can, <hi>flesh and blood reveal</hi> or
understand Jesus Christ to be the Son
of the living God, unless the Father
reveal him, and instruct us in the
truth of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. The way
to come to the acknowledgement
of these things, is that described
by the Apostle, Ephes. 3. 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19. <hi>For this cause I bow my
knees unto the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, of whom the whole family in
Heaven and Earth is named, that he
would grant ye, according to the riches of
his glory, to be strengthned with might by
his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by faith; that
ye being rooted and grounded in love may
be able to comprehend with all Saints,</hi> &amp;c.
As also Col. 2. 2. <hi>That ye might come
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47790:75"/>
unto all riches of the full assurance of
understanding, to the acknowledgement of
the Mysterie of God, and of the Father,
and of Christ. In whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</hi> It is
by faith and prayer, and through the
Revelation of God, that we may
come to the acknowledgement of
these things; and not by the carnal
reasonings of men of corrupt minds.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>What Reason</hi> do they intend? If
Reason absolutely, the Reason of
things; we grant that nothing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
unto it, is to be admitted. But
Reason as it is in this or that man,
particularly in themselves, we know
to be weak, maimed and imperfect;
and that they are, and all other men,
extreamly remote from a just and full
comprehension of the whole Reason
of things. Are <hi>they</hi> in such an estate,
as that their apprehension shall pass
for the measure of the nature of all
things; we know they are far from
it, So that though we will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any thing, that is contrary
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47790:75"/>
to reason, yet the least intimation of
a Truth by Divine Revelation, will
make me embrace it, although it
should be <hi>contrary to the reason of all the
Socinians</hi> in the world. <hi>Reason</hi> in the
<hi>abstract,</hi> or the just measure of the
answering of one thing unto another,
is of great moment: But <hi>Reason,</hi> that is,
what is pretended to be so, or appears
to be so unto this or that man, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in and about things of Divine
Revelation, is of very small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
of none at all where it riseth
up against the express testimonies of
Scripture, and these multiplyed to
their mutual confirmation and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>3. Many things are <hi>above Reason,</hi>
that is, as considered in this or that
subject, as men, which are not at
all <hi>against</hi> it. It is an easie thing to
compel the most curious enquirers of
these dayes to a ready confession
hereof, by multitudes of Instances in
things <hi>finite</hi> and temporary. And
shall any dare to deny but it may be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47790:76"/>
so, in things Heavenly, Divine, and
Spiritual? Nay, there is no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Being of God, or his
properties, but is absolutely above
the comprehension of our reason.
<hi>We cannot by searching find out God, we
cannot find out the Almighty to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The very foundation of all their
Objections and Cavils against this
truth, is destructive of as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principles of reason, as are in the
world. They are all at best reduced
to this; it cannot be thus in things
finite; the same Being cannot in one
respect be <hi>one,</hi> in another <hi>three,</hi> and
the like, and therefore it is so in
things <hi>Infinite.</hi> All these reasonings
are built upon this supposition, that
that which is <hi>finite</hi> can perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that which is <hi>Infinite.</hi> An as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
absurd, foolish and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto it self! Again, it is the highest
reason in things of pure Revelation,
to captivate our understandings to
the Authority of the Revealer, which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47790:76"/>
here is rejected. So that by a
loud specious pretence of Reason,
these men by a little <hi>captious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry</hi>
endeavour not only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their unbelief, but to
evert the greatest principles of <hi>Reason</hi>
it self.</p>
            <p>5. The Objections these men prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
insist upon, are meerly against
the Explanations we use of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
not against the Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of it, which is the principal
object of our faith, which how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
and irrational a course of
proceeding it is, hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>6. It is a Rule among <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sophers;</hi>
that if a man on just grounds and
reasons have embraced any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or perswasion, he is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
it, meerly because he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
every Objection against it. For
if the Objections wherewith we may
be entangled, be not of the same
weight and importance, with the
reason on which we embraced the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47790:77"/>
opinion, it is a madness to forego
it on the Account thereof. And
much more must this hold amongst
the common sort of Christians, in
things spiritual and divine. If they
will let go, and part with their
faith in any truth, because they
are not able to answer distinctly
some Objections that may be made
against it, they may quickly find
themselves disputed into Atheism.</p>
            <p>7. There is so great an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of such an expression,
and resemblance of a Trinity in
Unity, in the very works of the
Creation, as learned men have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
by various instances, that it
is most unreasonable to suppose that
to be contrary to reason, which
many objects of rational considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do more or less present unto
our minds.</p>

of this nature; Let any of the
Adversaries produce any one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>THE next Head of Opposition
made by the men of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
against this sacred truth; is
against the head of all truth, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Lord Jesus Christ. The
<hi>Socinians</hi> indeed would willingly put
a better face, or colour upon their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
about the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> then
it will bear, or indure to lye on it.
For in their <hi>Catechism</hi> unto this
<hi>Question, Is the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
purus Homo, <hi>a meer man?</hi> they
Answer; <hi>by no means.</hi> How then?
<hi>hath he a divine nature also?</hi> which is
their next question: To this they
say, <hi>by no means, for this is contrary to
right reason.</hi> How then will these
pretended <hi>Masters of Reason</hi> reconcile
these things? For to us it seems, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47790:78"/>
if Christ have no <hi>other nature</hi> but that
<hi>of a man,</hi> he is as to his nature, <hi>purus
Homo, a meer man,</hi> and no more.
Why, they answer, that he is not <hi>a
meer man, because he was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;</hi>
Strange! that that should be an
argument to prove him <hi>more than a
man,</hi> which the Scripture and all men
in their right wits grant to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
reason, to prove him to be a
man, and as he was born of her, no
more. Rom. 1. 3. <hi>Concerning his Son
Jesus Christ our Lord which was made
of the seed of</hi> David <hi>according to the
flesh,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Whose are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of whom as concerning the flesh
Christ came.</hi> Gal. 4. 4. <hi>God sent forth
his Son, made of a Woman, made under
the Law.</hi> But say they; <hi>he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with the Spirit, wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
was raised from the dead, had all
power given in Heaven and Earth;</hi> for
<hi>by these degrees,</hi> he became to be God.
But all men see that the inquiry is
about the <hi>nature of Christ;</hi> and this
Answer is about <hi>his state and condition.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:47790:79"/>
Now this changeth not his <hi>nature</hi> on
the one hand, no more than his <hi>being
humbled,</hi> poor and dying, did on the
other. This is the <hi>right reason</hi> we
have to deal withall in these men.
If a man should have enquired of
some of them of old, whether <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi>
were <hi>purus Homo,</hi> a <hi>meer
man?</hi> some of them would have said,
<hi>no, because he was the Holy Ghost;</hi> some
<hi>no, because he was the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
and some <hi>no, because he was an
Angel;</hi> for such foolish opinions have
men fallen into. But how sottish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their conceptions were, their
Answer to that enquiry would have
been regular, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se the Question
and Answer respect the same subject,
in the same respect. But never any
was so stupid, as to answer, he was
not a <hi>meer man,</hi> that is by nature,
<hi>because he was a Priest of the high God,</hi>
which respects his Office, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet such is the pretence of these
men about the Person of Christ
to incrustate and give some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47790:79"/>
unto their soul mis-belief; as
supposing that it would be much to
their disadvantage to own. Christ
only as a <hi>meer man,</hi> though the
most part of their disputes that they
have troubled the Christian World
withall, have had no other design nor
aim but to prove him so to be, and
nothing else. I shall briefly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>the method insisted on,</hi> first lay
down what is the direct Revelation
which is the object of our faith in
this matter; then express the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self in the Scripture testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
wherein it is recorded; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vindicated some one or other of
them from their exceptions, manifest
how the Doctrine hereof is farther
explained, unto the Edification of
them that believe.</p>
            <p>That there is a <hi>Second Person,</hi> the
Son of God, in the holy <hi>Trin-Vnity</hi> of
the God-head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have proved before.
That this Person did of his infinite
Love and Grace take upon him <hi>our
nature, bumane nature,</hi> so as that the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47790:80"/>
divine and humane nature should be
come one <hi>Person,</hi> one Christ, God and
Man in one; so that whatever he
doth in, and about our Salvation, it is
done by that <hi>one Person,</hi> God and Man, is
revealed unto us in the Scripture, as the
Object of our Faith. And this is that
which we believe concerning the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ.</hi> Whatever acts are ascrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
unto him, however immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
in, or by the Humane Nature,
or in and by his Divine Nature, they
are all the acts of that <hi>one Person,</hi> in
whom are both these natures. That
this Christ, God and Man, is because he
is God, and on the account of what he
hath done for us as Man, to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, worshipped, with worship Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and Divine, to be trusted and
obeyed; this also is asserted in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And these things are as it were
the <hi>common notions</hi> of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the common Principles of our
Profession; which the Scriptures also
abundantly testifie unto.</p>
            <p>Isa. 7. 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47790:80"/>
and bare a Son, and shall call his name
Emanuel; that is,</hi> he shall be God with
us, or God in our nature. Not, that <hi>that</hi>
should be his name whereby he should
be <hi>called</hi> in this World; but that this
should be the condition of his Person,
he should <hi>be God with us;</hi> God in our
nature. So are the words expounded,
Mat. 1. 21, 22, 23. <hi>That which is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her is of the Holy Ghost; and she
shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt
call his name Jesus; for he shall save
his People from their sins. Now all this
was done that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet,
saying, Behold, a Virgin shall be with
Child, and shall bring forth a Son, and
they shall call his name</hi> Emanuel, <hi>which
being interpreted, is God with us.</hi> His
name whereby he was to be called,
was <hi>Jesus,</hi> that is a Saviour. And
thereby was accomplished the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Prophet, that he should
be <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which being interpreted,
is <hi>God with us.</hi> Now a Child born
to be <hi>God with us,</hi> is God in that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47790:81"/>
Child taking our nature upon him,
and no otherwise can the words be
understood.</p>

called, or our Saviour.</p>
            <p>John 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made

made all things he had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
Now he affirms that this
<hi>Word</hi> was made <hi>flesh.</hi> How! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into flesh, into a Man, so that
he who was God ceased so to be, and
was turned or changed into flesh, that
is a Man? besides that this is utterly
impossible, it is not affirmed. For the
<hi>Word</hi> continued the <hi>Word</hi> still, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was <hi>made flesh,</hi> or <hi>made of
a Woman,</hi> as it is elsewhere expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or made of the <hi>seed of David,</hi> or
took our flesh or nature to be his

own. Himself continuing God, as
he was, became Man also, which
before he was not. The <hi>Word
was made flesh;</hi> this is that which
we believe and assert in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>See <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. and <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>John</hi>
6. 62. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 28. All which places
assert the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> to have
descended from Heaven in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of Humane nature, and
ascended into Heaven therein being
assumed; and to have <hi>been in Heaven</hi>
as to his Divine nature, when he was
in the Earth in the <hi>flesh</hi> that he had
assumed.</p>
            <p>Acts 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Church of

said to be <hi>God</hi> absolutely; the <hi>Church
of God.</hi> And this <hi>God</hi> is said to have
<hi>blood of his own;</hi> the blood of Jesus
Christ, being the blood of him
that was God, though not the
blood of him as God; For God is a
Spirit. And this undeniably testifies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47790:82"/>
to the unity of his Person as God and
Man.</p>
            <p>Rom. 1. 3, 4. <hi>Concerning his Son

and of whom concerning the flesh,
Christ came, who is over all, God blessed

that we may believe without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
from the clamours of these Men.
Namely, that the same Christ, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the flesh, came of the Fathers,
of <hi>David,</hi> and in himself, is over all
God blessed for ever. This the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
asserts plainly, and why we
should not believe it firmly, let these
Men give a reason when they are
able.</p>
            <p>Gal. 6. 4. <hi>God sent forth his Son

Rom. 8. 3.</p>
            <p>Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Let this mind be in
you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who
being in the form of God, thought it

the same Christ that is spoken of.
And it is here affirmed of him that he
was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> thought it no
robbery to be equal with God; But is
this all; is this Jesus Christ God only?
Doth he subsist only in the form or
nature of God? No, saith the Apostle,
he <hi>took upon him the form of a Servant,</hi>
was made in the likeness of Men,
and was found in fashion as a Man;
that his being truly a Man is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in these words our Adversaries
deny not; and we therefore believe
that the <hi>same Jesus Christ</hi> is God also,
because that is no less plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
            <p>1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>And without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47790:83"/>
great is the mysterie of Godliness,
God was manifest in the flesh, justified in
the Spirit, seen of Angels.</hi> It is a Mysterie
indeed, under which name it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
now and reproached; nor are
we allowed so to call it, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on, as flying to mysteries for
our defence. But we must take leave
to speak in this matter, according to
his directions, without whom we
cannot speak at all. A Mysterie it is,
and that a <hi>great mysterie;</hi> and that
confessedly so, by all that do believe.
And this is, that <hi>God was manifested in
the flesh.</hi> That it is the Lord Christ
who is spoken of, every one of the
ensuing expressions do evince, <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Spirit, seen of Angels, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
World, received up into Glory.</hi> And
this also is the substance of what we
believe in this matter; Namely, That
Christ is God, <hi>manifest in the flesh,</hi>
which we acknowledge, own, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be true, but a great mysterie;
yet no less great and Sacred a truth
notwithstanding.</p>

Heb. 2. 14. <hi>For as much then as
the Children were partakers of flesh
and blood, he also himself likewise took
part of the same.</hi> ver. <hi>16. For verily
he took not on him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but he took on him the seed of
Abraham.</hi> And this plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
his <hi>pre-existence</hi> unto that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of our nature, and the
unity of his Person in it being so
assumed.</p>
            <p>1 John 3. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive we
the Love of God, because he laid down
his life for us.</hi> He who was God laid
down for a season, and parted with
that life, which was his <hi>own</hi> in that
nature of ours which he had assumed.
And that <hi>taking of our nature</hi> is called
his <hi>coming in the flesh,</hi> which who so
denyes, is <hi>not of God, but is the Spirit
of Anti-Christ,</hi> 1 John 4. 3.</p>
            <p>These are some of the places,
wherein the Person of Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
unto our Faith, that we may
believe on the Son of God, and have
Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47790:84"/>
The Method formerly proposed
would require that I should take
off the general Objections of the
<hi>Adversaries</hi> against this Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
as also vindicate some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Testimonies from their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But because a particular op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
unto this Truth, hath not
as yet publickly and directly been
maintained and managed by any that
I know of among our selves, though
the denyal of it be expresly included
in what they do affirm; I shall
leave the further confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
unto some other occasion, if it
be offered, and it be judged neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>And this is that which the <hi>Faith of
Believers</hi> rests in, as that which is
plainly revealed unto them; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>Jesus Christ is God and Man</hi>
in one Person; and that all his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in their behalf are the actings of
him who is God and Man; and that
this Son of God, God and Man,
is to be believed in by them, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47790:84"/>
obeyed that they have Eternal
Life.</p>
            <p>What is farther added unto these
express testimonies, and the full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Truth contained in
them in this matter, in way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
educed from them, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto them, to the edification of
the Church, or information of the
minds of Believers in the right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of this great Mysterie of
God manifested in the flesh, may be
reduced to these heads.</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Person of the Son
of God, did in his assuming <hi>humane
nature</hi> to be his own, not take an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Person</hi> of any one into a near
conjunction with himself, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the personal subsistence of
humane nature in that flesh which
he assumed, he gave it its subsistence
in his own Person, whence it hath
its <hi>individuation</hi> and distinction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from all other persons whatever
This is the Personal Union. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and humane nature in Christ
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47790:85"/>
have but one <hi>personal subsistence;</hi> and
so are but one Christ, one distinct
personal principle of all Operations
of all that he did, or doth, as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.
And this undeniably follows
from what is declared in the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
mentioned. For the <hi>Word</hi>
could not be made <hi>flesh,</hi> nor could he
<hi>take on him the seed of</hi> Abraham, nor
<hi>could the mighty God be a Child born
and given unto us,</hi> nor could <hi>God shed
his blood</hi> for his Church, but that
the two natures so directly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
must be united in one Person;
for otherwise as they are two natures
still, they would be two Persons
also.</p>
            <p>2. Each nature thus united in
Christ, is entire, and preserves unto
it self its own natural properties.
For he is no less <hi>perfect God,</hi> for being
made <hi>Man,</hi> nor no less a <hi>true perfect
Man,</hi> consisting of soul and body
with all their essential parts by that
natures being taken into subsistence
with the Son of God, His Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47790:85"/>
still continues <hi>Immense, Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
Omnipotent,</hi> infinite in <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp;c.</hi> his <hi>bumane nature,</hi> finite, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and before its Glorification,
subject to all infirmities of life and
death, that the same nature in others
absolutely considered, is obnoxious
unto.</p>
            <p>3. In each of these natures, he acts
suitably unto the essential properties
and principles of that nature. As
God, he made all things, upholds all
things, by the word of his Power,
fills Heaven and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As man,
he lived, hungred, suffered, dyed, rose,
ascended into Heaven. Yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Union of both these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the same Person: not only
his own Person is said to do all
these things, but the Person expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the name which he hath on
the account of one nature, is said
to do that which he did only in the
other. So God is said to redeem his
Church with his own blood, and to
lay down his life for us; and the Son
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47790:86"/>
of Man to be in Heaven, when he was
in the Earth. All because of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Person as was declared.
And these things do all of them
directly and undeniably flow from
what is revealed concerning his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as before is declared.</p>

contend not about it. It doth indeed
properly express and connote that
great <hi>Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct of the Death of Christ</hi> which
in the cause before us, we plead for.
But yet because it belongs rather to
the Explanation of the Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, then is used expresly in
the Revelation of it, and because the
right understanding of the Word it
self depends on some <hi>notions of Law,</hi>
that as yet we need not take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
I shall not in this entrance
of our discourse, insist precisely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, but leave it as the <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
of what we shall find expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared in the Scripture. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I say this, as though I did
decline the Word, or the right use
of it, or what is properly signified
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47790:87"/>
by it, but do only cast it into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place answerable unto our <hi>method</hi>
and design in the whole of this brie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
discourse.</p>
            <p>I know some have taken a new
way of expressing and declaring the
Doctrine concerning the <hi>Mediation
of Christ,</hi> with the causes and ends of
his death, which they think more <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>
than that usually insisted on.
But as what I have yet heard of or
seen in that kind, hath been not only
<hi>unscriptural,</hi> but also very <hi>irrational,</hi>
and most remote from that <hi>accuracy</hi>
whereunto they pretend, who make
use of it; so if they shall publish
their conceptions, it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but that they may meet with a
<hi>Scholastical Examination</hi> by some hand
or other.</p>
            <p>Our present work, as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declared, is for the establishment
of the Faith of them, who may be
attempted, if not brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be seduced by the <hi>slights</hi> of
some who lye in wait to deceive, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47790:88"/>
the clamours of others who openly
drive the same design. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scripture plainly and clearly
reveals in this matter, is the subject
of our present enquiry. And either
in so doing, as occasion shall be
offered, we shall obviate, or in the
close of it remove those <hi>Sophisms</hi>
that the Sacred Truth now proposed
to consideration hath been attempted
withal.</p>
            <p>The summ of what the Scripture
reveals about this great truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the <hi>satisfaction of Christ,</hi>
may be reduced unto these ensuing
heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>being made upright,
sinned against God, and all mankind, all
his posterity in him.</hi> Gen. 1. 27. So
<hi>God created man in hit own Image, in
the Image of God created he him, Male
and Female created he them,</hi> Gen. 3. 11.
<hi>And he said, who told thee that thou
wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the
Tree whreof I commandeded thee that
then shouldst not eat?</hi> Eccles. 7. 29.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47790:88"/>
               <hi>Lo, this only have I found, that God
made man upright, but he hath sought
out many inventions.</hi> Rom. 5. 12.
<hi>Wherefore as by one man sin entred into
the world, and death by sin, and so
death passed upon all men, for that all
have sinned.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Therefore by the
offence of one, judgement came upon all
men to condemnation,</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>By one
mans disobedience many were made
sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That by this Sin of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
all men are brought into an
<hi>Estate of Sin, and Apostacy from God,</hi>
and of an enmity unto him, Gen. 6. 5.
<hi>God saw that the wickedness of man was
great in the Earth, and that every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the thoughts of his heart,
was only evil continually,</hi> Psal. 51. 5.
<hi>Behold, I was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>pen in iniquity, and in
sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Rom.
3. 23. <hi>For all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7.
<hi>The carnal mind is enmity against God,
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r it is not subject to the Law of God,
neither indeed can be</hi> Ephes. 4. 18.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47790:89"/>
               <hi>Having the understanding darkned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alienated from the life of God through
the ignorance that is in them, because
of the blindness of their heart,</hi> Chap. 2. 1.
Col. 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That in this state <hi>all men
continue in sin against God,</hi> nor of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
can do otherwise, Rom. 3.
10, 11, 12. <hi>There is none righteous, no
not one, there is none that understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
there is none that seeketh after God;
they are all gone out of the way, they are
together become unprofitable, there is none
that doth good, no not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Justice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of God, as he is the Supream
Governour and Judge of all the
world, require that sin be punished,
Exod. 34. 7. <hi>That will by no means
clear the guilty,</hi> Josh. 24. 19. <hi>He is an
holy God, he is a jealous God, he will
not forgive your transgressions nor your
sins,</hi> Psalm 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>For thou art not
a God that hath pleasure in wickedness,
neither shall evil dwell with thee; the
foolish shall not stand in thy sight; thou
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47790:89"/>
hatest all workers of iniquity, thou shalt
destroy them that speak leasing.</hi> Hab.
1. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
evil, and canst not look upon iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Isa. 33. 14. <hi>Who among us shall dwell
with the devouring fire, who among us
shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</hi>
Rom. 1. 32. <hi>Who knowing the judgement
of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death.</hi> Rom. 3.
5, 6. <hi>Is God unrighteous who taketh
vengeance? I speak as a man, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid!
for then how shall God judge the
world?</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 6. <hi>It is a righteous
thing with God, to recompence tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them that trouble you.</hi> Heb. 12. 29.
<hi>For our God is a consuming fire.</hi> From
Deut. 4. 24.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That God hath also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
his <hi>veracity and faithfulness</hi> in
the Sanction of the Law not to leave
sin unpunished, Gen. 2. 17. <hi>In the day
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye.</hi>
Deut. 27. 26. <hi>Cursed be he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
not all the words of this Law
to do them.</hi> In this state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47790:90"/>
all mankind had they been left
without divine aid and help, must
have perished Eternally.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That God out of his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness,</hi> Grace and Love to
mankind, sent his only Son to save
and deliver them out of this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Matth. 1. 21. <hi>Thou shalt call his
name Jesus, for he shall save his People
from their sins,</hi> John 3. 16, 17. <hi>God so
loved the world, that be gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life: for God sent not his Son into
the world to condemn the world, but that
the world through him might be saved.</hi>
Rom. 5. 8. <hi>God commendeth his love
towards us, in that while we were ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sinners Christ dyed for us,</hi> 1 John 4. 9.
<hi>In this was manifested the love of God
towards us, because God sent his only
begotten Son into the world, that we might
live through him,</hi> v. 10. <hi>Herein is love,
not that we loved God, but that he
loved us, and sent his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Son to be a
propitiation for our sins,</hi> 1. Thes. 1. 10.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47790:90"/>
               <hi>Even Jesus which delivereth us from the
wrath to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, That <hi>this Love was
the same in Father and Son,</hi> acted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
in the manner that shall be
afterwards declared; so vain are the
pretences of men who from the Love
of the Father in this matter, would
argue against the Love of the Son;
or on the contrary.</p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>That</hi> the way in general
whereby the Son of God being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,
was to save lost sinners, was
by a <hi>substitution of himself</hi> according
to the design and appointment of
God in the room of those whom he
was so save, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He hath
made him to be sin for us, who knew
no sin, that we might become the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God in him,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.
<hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
of the Law, being made a curse for
us.</hi> Rom. 5. 7, 8. <hi>For scarcely for a
Righteous Man will one dye, yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
for a good man some will even
dare to dye; but God commendeth his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47790:91"/>
love towards us, in that while we were
yet sinners Christ dyed us.</hi> Rom.
8. 3. <hi>For what the Law could not do
in that it was weak through the flesh,
God sending his own Son in the likeness
of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh; that the Righteousness
of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Who his own self bare our
sins in his own body on the Tree;</hi> Chap.
3. 18. <hi>For Christ also hath once suffered
for us, the Just for the unjust, that he
might bring us unto God.</hi> All these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
undeniably evince a <hi>substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Christ as to suffering in the
stead of them whom he was to save;
which in general is all that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by his <hi>satisfaction;</hi> namely, that
he was made <hi>sin for us,</hi> a <hi>curse for
us, dyed for us,</hi> that is in our stead,
that we might be saved from the
wrath to come. And all these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
as to their true genuine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
shall be vindicated, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:47790:91"/>
Ninthly, This <hi>way</hi> of his saving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is in particular, several wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Scripture. As,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That he offered himself a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to God,</hi> to make attonement for
our sins, and that in his death and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
Isa. 53. 10. <hi>When thou shalt
make his soul an offering for sin.</hi> John
1. 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God who
taketh away the sins of the World,</hi>
Eph. 5. 2. <hi>Christ hath loved us, and
hath given himself for us an offering
and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet
smelling savour,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. <hi>Was a
merciful high Priest in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, to make reconciliation for
the Sins of the People,</hi> Heb. 9. 11, 12,
13, 14. <hi>But Christ being come an high
Priest of good things to come, by a greater
and more perfect Tabernacle not made
with hands, that is to say, not of this
building, neither by the blood of Goats and
Calves, but by his own blood, he entred
in once into the Holy place; having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Eternal Redemption for us; For
if the blood of Bulls, &amp;c. How much
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47790:92"/>
more shall the blood of Christ, who
through the eternal Spirit offered himself
without spot to God, purge your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
from dead works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That he <hi>Redeemed</hi> us by paying
a price, a ransome for our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Mark 10. 45. <hi>The Son of Man
came to give his life a ransome for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>For ye are bought
with a price,</hi> 7. 23. 1 Tim. 2. 6.
<hi>Who gave himself a ransome for all to
be testified in due time.</hi> Tit. 2. 14.
<hi>Who gave himself for us, that he might
Redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> 1 Pet.
1. 18. <hi>For we were not Redeemed with
Silver and Gold and corruptible things.</hi>
19. <hi>But with the pretious blood of Christ,
as of a Lamb without blemish and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That he bare our sins,</hi> or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
due unto them. Isa. 53. 5.
<hi>He was wounded for our transgressions,
he was bruised for our iniquities, the
chastisement of our peace was upon him,
and with his stripes are we healed; All
we like Sheep have gone astray, we
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47790:92"/>
have turned every one to his own way,
and the Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of us all.</hi> 11. <hi>For he shall bear their
iniquities.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Who his own
self bare our sins in his own Body on the
Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That he answered <hi>the Law</hi> and
the penalty of it; Rom. 8. 3. <hi>God sent
forth his Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the
flesh; that the Righteousness of the Law
might be fulfilled in us.</hi> Gal. 3. 13.
<hi>Christ hath Redeemed us from the curse
of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi>
Chap. 4. 4, 5. <hi>God sent forth his Son
made of a woman, made under the Law,
to Redeem them that were under the
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That he <hi>dyed</hi> for sin, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to <hi>expiate</hi> the one, and in the
<hi>stead</hi> of the other. Rom. 4. 25. <hi>He
was delivered for our offences.</hi> Rom.
5. 10. <hi>When we were Enemies, we
were reconciled to God by the death of
his Son.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. <hi>Christ dyed for
our sins according to the Scriptures.</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47790:93"/>
2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>For the Love of Christ
constraineth us, because we thus judge,
that if one dyed for all, then were all
dead,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>6. Hence on the part of God, it is
affirmed that <hi>he spared him not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him up for us all;</hi> Rom. 8. 32.
And caused <hi>all our iniquities to meet
upon him,</hi> Isa. 53. 7.</p>
            <p>7. The Effect hereof was,</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God
was glorified, Rom. 3. 25, 26. <hi>Whom
God hath set forth to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through Faith in his blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Righteousness for the remission
of sins.</hi> (2.) The Law fulfilled and
satisfied, as in the places before quoted.
Rom. 8. 3. Gal. 3. 13, 14. Gal. 4. 5.
(3.) <hi>God reconciled,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.
<hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World
unto himself, not imputing their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
unto them.</hi> Heb. 2. 17. <hi>He made
reconciliation for the sins of the People.</hi>
(4.) <hi>Attonement</hi> was made for sin,
Rom. 5. 11. <hi>By whom we have now
received the Attonement;</hi> and peace
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47790:93"/>
was made with God, Eph. 2. 14. <hi>For he
is our peace, who hath made both one, that
he might reconcile both unto God in one
Body by the Cross, having slain the emnity
thereby. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Made an end of sin,</hi> Dan.
9. 24. To <hi>finish transgression, to make
an end of sins, to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
Righteousness.</hi> The glory of God in
all these things being exalted, himself
well pleased, Righteousness and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Redemption or Salvation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
for Sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. In that
the chastisement of our peace was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and that by his stripes we are
healed, he being punished that we
might go free, himself became a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Salvation unto all that do obey
him.</p>
            <p>I have fixed on these particulars;
to give every <hi>Ordinary Reader</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
how fully and plainly what he
is to believe in this matter is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scripture. And should I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all the Testimonies which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
give witness unto these posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47790:94"/>
it is known how great a part
of the <hi>Bible</hi> must be transcribed. And
these are the things which are indispensibly
required of us to believe,
that we may be able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
our obedience according to the
mind and will of God. In the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation</hi>
of this Doctrine unto fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Edification,</hi> sundry things are
usually insisted on, which necessarily
and infallibly ensue upon the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Scripture before laid down;
and serve to beget in the minds of
Believers a <hi>due apprehension,</hi> and right
understanding of them. As,</p>
            <p>1. That God in this matter is to
be considered as the chief, supream,
absolute <hi>Rector</hi> and Governour of all;
as the <hi>Lord of the Law,</hi> and of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but yet so as an offended Ruler.
Not as an <hi>offended Person,</hi> but as an
<hi>offended Ruler,</hi> who hath right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
punishment upon Transgressors,
and whose Righteousness of Rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that he should so do.</p>
            <p>2. That because he is Righteous
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47790:94"/>
and Holy, as he is the supream Judge
of all the World, it is necessary that
he do right in the punishing of sin,
without which the order of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot be preserved. For sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Creatures <hi>deduction of it self</hi>
from the order of its dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience unto the Creator,
and supream Lord of all, without <hi>a
reduction</hi> of it by punishment, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
would be brought into the whole
Creation.</p>
            <p>3. That whereas the <hi>Law</hi> and the
<hi>Sanction</hi> of it is the moral or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
cause of the punishment of sin,
and it directly obligeth the sinner
himself unto punishment; God as the
supream Ruler, dispenseth, not with
the act of the Law, but the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
object; and substitutes another
<hi>sufferer</hi> in the room of them who are
principally lyable unto the sentence of
it, and are now to be acquitted or
freed; that so the Law may be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
requiring the punishment of
sin, Justice exalted, whereof the Law
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47790:95"/>
is an effect, and yet the sinner
saved.</p>
            <p>4. That the <hi>Person</hi> thus substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
was the <hi>Son of God incarnate,</hi>
who had <hi>power</hi> so to dispose of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with <hi>will</hi> and readiness for it;
and was upon the account of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Person, able to answer the
penalty which all others had incurred
and deserved.</p>
            <p>5. That God upon his <hi>voluntary
susception</hi> of this Office, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
to this work, did <hi>so lay our
sins</hi> in and by the sentence of the
Law upon him, that he made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>full satisfaction</hi> for whatever legally
could be charged on them for whom
he dyed or suffered.</p>
            <p>6. That the special way terms and
conditions whereby and whereon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be interested in this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>action
made by Christ, are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Will of God, and declared
in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>These and the like things are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
insisted on in the Explication
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47790:95"/>
or declaration of this head of our
confession. And there is not any of
them but may be sufficiently confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Divine Testimonies. It may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be farther evinced that there is
nothing asserted in them, but what is
excellently suited unto the common
notions which mankind hath of God
and his Righteousness; and that in
their practice they answer the light of
nature, and common reason exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in sundry Instances among the
Nations of the World.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore take one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from some of the testimonies
before produced in the confirmation
of this Sacred Truth, and proceed to
remove the objections that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
banded against it.</p>
            <p>If the Lord Christ according to the
Will of the Father, and by his own
counsel and choice, was <hi>substituted,</hi> and
did <hi>substitute</hi> himself as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of the Covenant, in the room
and in the stead of sinners that they
might be saved, and therein <hi>bare
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47790:96"/>
their sins,</hi> or the punishment due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their sins, by undergoing the curse
and penalty of the Law, and therein
also according to the Will of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up himself for a propitiatory,
expiatory Sacrifice to make <hi>Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for sin, and Reconciliation for
sinners, that the Justice of God being
appeased, and the Law fulfilled, they
might go free, or be delivered from
the wrath to come; and if therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he paid a real satisfactory price for
their Redemption; then he made
satisfaction to God for sin. For these
are the things that we intend by that
expression, of <hi>satisfaction.</hi> But now
all those things are openly, and fully
witnessed unto in the Testimonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
produced; as may be observed by
suiting some of them unto the several
particulars here asserted.</p>
            <p>As 1. What was done in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was from the will, purpose, and
love of God the Father. <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.
6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28.
<hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:47790:96"/>
2. It was also done by his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
consent, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>3. He was <hi>Substituted,</hi> and did
<hi>Substitute</hi> himself as the Mediator of
the Covenant in the room and stead of
sinners, that they may be saved,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
25, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>4. And he did therein <hi>bear their
sins,</hi> or the punishment due to their
sins. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. And
this,</p>
            <p>5. By undergoing the <hi>Curse</hi> and
penalty of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Or
the punishment of sin required by the
Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>6. Herein, also according to the
will of God, He <hi>offered up himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
propitiatory and expiatory Sacrifice</hi> to
make Attonement for sin, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
for sinners, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13, 14.
Which he did that <hi>the Justice of God
being satisfied,</hi> and the Law fulfilled,
sinners might be freed from the wrath
to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. last.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47790:97"/>
7. And hereby also, He paid <hi>a real
price</hi> of Redemption for sin and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. last.
These are the things which we are to
believe, concerning the satisfaction of
Christ; And our Explication of this
Doctrine, We are ready to defend,
when called thereunto.</p>
            <p>The consideration of the <hi>Objections</hi>
which are raised against this great
fundamental Truth, shall close this
Discourse. And they are of two
sorts. First, <hi>In general,</hi> to the whole
Doctrine, as declared, or some of the
more signal heads, or parts of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Particular Instances, in this
or that supposal, as consequences of
the Doctrine asserted. And in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</p>
            <p>1. They say, <hi>This is contrary to, and
inconsistent with the Love, Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Goodness of God,</hi> which are so
celebrated <hi>in the Scripture as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
properties of his nature,</hi> and Acts
of his Will, <hi>wherein he will be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Especially contrary to the freedom
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47790:97"/>
of Forgiveness, which we are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to expect, and commanded to
believe. And this exception they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to firm by <hi>Testimonies,</hi> that
the Lord is <hi>Good and Gracious,</hi> and
that He doth <hi>freely forgive us our sins</hi>
and trespasses.</p>
            <p>Answer: <hi>First,</hi> I readily grant that
whatever is really contrary to the
Grace, Goodness and Mercy of God,
whatever is Inconsistent with the
free Forgiveness of sin, is not to be
admitted. For these things are fully
<hi>revealed</hi> in the Scripture, and must
have a consistency with whatever else
is therein revealed of God, or his
Will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God is Good
and Gracious, and Merciful, so also
He is Holy, Righteous, True and
Faithful. And these things are no
less revealed concerning him than the
other; and are no less <hi>Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
of his Nature than his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Grace. And as they are <hi>all
Essentially</hi> the same in him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47790:98"/>
only under a different habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or respect as they are exerted by
Acts of his will; so it belongs to his
Infinite Wisdom, that the effects of
them, though divers, and produced
by divers waies, and means, may no
way be contrary one to the other,
but that Mercy may be exercised,
without the prejudice of Justice, or
Holiness; and Justice be preserved
entire, without any obstruction to the
Exercise of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Grace and Love of
God that in this matter the Scripture
reveals to be exercised, in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the forgiveness of sinners, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
principally in two things.
1. In his Holy Eternal <hi>Purpose</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
a relief for lost sinners. He
hath done it, to the praise of the
Glory of his Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. 2. In
the sending his Son in the pursuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for the accomplishment of the
holy purpose of his Will and Grace.
Herein most eminently doth the
Scripture celebrate the Love, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47790:98"/>
and kindness of God; as that
whereby, in Infinite, and for ever to
be adored Wisdom and Grace, he
made way for the <hi>forgiveness of our
sins.</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the
world, as he gave his only begotten
Son,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25. <hi>Whom he hath
set forth to be a propitiation through
saith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 7, 8. <hi>God
commendeth his Love towards us, in
that while we were yet sinners, Christ
dyed for us, Titus</hi> 3. 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8, 9.
Herein consists that ever to be adored
Love, Goodness, Grace, Mercy and
Condescension of God. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that in that act of causing <hi>our
iniquities to meet on Christ,</hi> wherein
he immediately intended the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Justice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.
(<hi>Not sparing him, in delivering him
up to death for us all, Rom.</hi> 8. 32.)
There was a blessed harmony in the
highest Justice, and most excellent
Grace and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcy. This Grace, this
Goodness, this Love of God toward
mankind, towards sinners, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47790:99"/>
in this matter neither know,
nor understand; and so indeed what
lyes in them, remove the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole Gospel, and of all
that faith and obedience, which God
requires at our hands.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Forgiveness, or the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
condonation of sinners, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgiveness of sins, is <hi>free;</hi>
but yet so, as it is every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
unto a respect unto Christ,
unto his death and blood-shedding,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>We have Redemption in his
blood, even the forgiveness of sins,</hi> Chap.
4. 32. <hi>God for Christs sake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
you,</hi> Rom. 3. 25, 26. <hi>God hath
set him forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood, to declare
his righteousness for the forgiveness of
sins.</hi> It is absolutely free in respect
of all immediate transactions between
God and sinners. Free on the part
of God.</p>
            <p>First, In the <hi>Eternal purpose</hi> of it,
when he might justly have suffered
all men to have perished under the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47790:99"/>
guilt of their sins. 2. Free in the
means that he used to effect it unto
his Glory. (1.) In the sending of
his Son; and (2.) In laying the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of our sin upon him.
(3.) In his Covenant with him, that
it should be accepted on our behalf.
(4.) In his tender and proposal of
it by the Gospel unto sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs to be
received without <hi>money or without
price.</hi> (5.) In the <hi>actual condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and pardon of them that do
believe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is free on the part of
the persons that are forgiven. In
that (1.) It is given and granted to
them without any satisfaction made
by them for their former transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
(2.) Without any merit to
purch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se or procure it. (3.) Without
any <hi>poenal</hi> satisfactory suffering here,
or in a purgatory hereafter. (4.) With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Expectation of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence;
or that being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they should then make or give
any satisfaction for what they had
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47790:100"/>
done before. And as any of these
things would, so nothing else can
impeach the <hi>freedom</hi> of pardon and
forgiveness. Whether then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the pardoner or the pardoned,
Pardon is every way <hi>free;</hi> namely,
on the part of God who forgives, and
on the part of sinners that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
If God now hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, provided himself a
Lamb for a Sacrifice; if he hath in
Infinite Wisdom and Grace found out
a way, thus freely to forgive us out
sins, to the praise and glory of his
own Holiness, Righteousness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
against sin, as well as unto the
unspeakable advancement of that
Grace, Goodness and bounty which
he immediately exerciseth in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sin, are these mens eyes evil,
because he is good? Will they not
be contented to be pardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they may have it at the rate of
dispoiling God of his Holiness,
Truth, Righteousness and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
And as this is certainly done
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47790:100"/>
by that way of pardon which these
men propose, no reserve in the least
being made for the glory of God in
those holy properties of his nature
which are immediately injured and
opposed by sin; so that pardon it
self which they pretend so to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
having nothing to influence it
but a meer arbitrary act of Gods
will, is utterly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>based from its own
proper worth and excellency. And
I shall willingly undertake to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that they derogate no less
from Grace and Mercy in pardon,
than they do from the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Holiness of God by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
which they have feigned;
and that in it both of them are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and dispoiled of all their
glory.</p>
            <p>But they yet say, <hi>If God can freely
pardon sin, why doth he not do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
satisfaction; if he cannot, he is
weaker and more imperfect than man,
who can do so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:47790:101"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, God cannot do. many
things that men can do; nor that he
is <hi>more imperfect</hi> than they, but he
cannot do them on the account of
his perfection. He <hi>cannot lye,</hi> he
cannot deny himself, he cannot
change, which men can do, and do
every day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To pardon sin without
satisfaction in him who is absolutely
Holy, Righteous, True and Faithful,
the absolute necessary supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all sinners, the Author of
the Law, and sanction of it, wherein
punishment is threatned and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is to deny himself, and to do
what one <hi>infinitely perfect,</hi> cannot
do,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ask of these men, why
God doth not pardon sins <hi>freely</hi>
without requiring faith, repentance
and obedience in them that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
yea, as the conditions on
which they may be pardoned? For
seeing he is so infinitely good and
gracious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, cannot he pardon men
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47790:101"/>
without prescribing such terms and
conditions unto them, as he knoweth,
that men, and that incomparably the
greatest number of them will never
come up unto; and so must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
perish for ever. Yea, but
they say, this cannot be; neither
doth this impeach the freedom of
pardon. For it is certain that God
doth prescribe these things, and yet
he pardoneth <hi>freely.</hi> And it would
altogether unbecome the holy God to
pardon sinners that continue so to
live and dye in their sins. But do
not these men see that they have
hereby given away their Cause which
they contend for? For if a prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sundry things to the <hi>sinner</hi>
himself, without which he shall not
be pardoned, do not at all impeach,
as they say, the freedom of pardon,
but God may be said <hi>freely to pardon
sin</hi> notwithstanding it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How shall the
receiving of satisfaction by another,
nothing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all being required of the
sinner; have the least appearance of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47790:102"/>
any such thing? If the freedom of
forgiveness consists in such a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
notion as these men imagine, it is
certain that the prescribing of faith
and repentance in and unto sinners
antecedently to their participation
of it, is much more evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto it, than the receiving of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from another who is not
to be pardoned, can to any appear
to be. Secondly, If it be contrary
to the holiness of God to pardon
any, without requiring Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Obedience in them, as
it is indeed; let not these persons be
offended, if we believe him when
he so frequently declares it, that it
was so to remit sin without the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of his Law and satisfaction of
his Justice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They say, <hi>There is no such
thing as Justice in God requiring the
punishment of sin, but that that, which
in him requireth and calleth for the
punishment of sin, is his Anger and
Wrath, which expressions denote free Acts
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47790:102"/>
of his Will, and not any essential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of his nature.</hi> So that God
<hi>may punish sin,</hi> or not punish it at
his pleasure. Therefore there is no
Reason that he should require any
<hi>satisfaction</hi> for sin, seeing he may pass
it by absolutely as he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Is it not strange that the
great <hi>Governour,</hi> the Judge of all the
world, which on the supposition of
the Creation of it, God is naturally
and necessarily, should not also <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
be so righteous, as to do <hi>right,</hi>
in rendring unto every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his works?</p>
            <p>(2.) The <hi>Sanction</hi> and penalty of the
<hi>Law,</hi> which is the Rule of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was as I suppose, an effect of
<hi>Justice,</hi> of Gods natural and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>Justice,</hi> and not of his Anger or
Wrath. Certainly never did any man
make a Law for the Government of
a people in anger. <hi>Draco's Laws</hi>
were not made in wrath, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the best apprehension of
right and Justice that he had, though
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47790:103"/>
said to be written in blood. And
shall we think otherwise of the Law
of God?</p>
            <p>(3.) Anger and Wrath in God
express the effects of Justice; and so
are not meerly <hi>free acts</hi> of his will.
This therefore is a tottering cause,
that is built on the denyal of Gods
Essential Righteousness. But it was
proved before, and it is so else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>(3.) They say that the <hi>Sacrifice of
Christ was Metaphorically only so.</hi> That
he was a <hi>metaphorical</hi> Priest, not one
properly so called. And therefore
that his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> did not consist in his
death and blood-shedding, but in his
<hi>appearing in Heaven</hi> upon his Ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
presenting himself unto God in
the most <hi>Holy Place</hi> not made with
hands as the Mediator of the new
Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When once these men come
to this <hi>Evasion,</hi> they think themselves
safe, and that they may go whither
they will without controll. For
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47790:103"/>
they say it is true, Christ was a
Priest, but only he was a <hi>Metaphorical
one.</hi> He offered Sacrifice, but it was
a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> one. He <hi>redeemed</hi> us,
but with a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Redemption;
and so we are <hi>Justified</hi> thereon, but
with a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Justification; and
so for ought I know they are like
to be saved, with a <hi>Metaphorical Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
This is the substance of their
plea in this matter. Christ was not
<hi>really a Priest,</hi> but did somewhat <hi>like
a Priest.</hi> He offered not Sacrifice <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
but did somewhat that was like
a Sacrifice. He redeemed us not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
but did somewhat that <hi>looked
like Redemption.</hi> And what these
things are, wherein their <hi>Analog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi>
consisteth, what proportion the
things that Christ hath done, bare
to the things that are <hi>really</hi> so, from
whence they receive their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that it is meet it should be
wholly in the power of these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to declare. But,</p>
            <p>(2.) What should hinder the death
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47790:104"/>
of Christ to be a <hi>Sacrifice, a proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
and according to the nature,
end, and use of Sacrifices to have made
Attonement, and Satisfaction for
sin? (1.) It is expresly called so in
the Scripture; wherein he is said to
<hi>offer himself,</hi> to <hi>make his soul an offering,</hi>
to offer himself a Sacrifice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Heb. 9. 14, 25. 26. <hi>Chap.</hi>
7. 27. And he is himself directly said
to be a <hi>Priest</hi> or a Sacrificer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.
And it is no where intimated, much
less expressed that these things are
not spoken <hi>properly</hi> but <hi>Metaphorically</hi>
only. (2.) The Legal Sacrifices of
the Old Law were instituted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to represent and prepare the
way for the bringing in of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mb of God,</hi> so to take
away the sin of the World. And is
it not strange, that true and real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
should be Types and R pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of that which was not so?
On this supposition all those Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are but so many <hi>seductions</hi> from
the right understanding of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47790:104"/>
God and sinners. (3.) No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is wanting to render it a
proper propitiatory Sacrifice, for,
(1.) There was the <hi>person of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi>
and that was Christ himself,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>He offered himself unto
God.</hi> He, that is the Sacrificer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the <hi>person of Christ God and Man;</hi>
and <hi>Himself</hi> as the Sacrifice denotes
his <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> whence God is
said to <hi>purchase his Church with his
own blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28. For he offered
<hi>himself</hi> through the Eternal Spirit;
so that (2.) There was the <hi>Matter</hi> of
the Sacrifice, which was the <hi>Humane
Nature</hi> of Christ soul and body; <hi>His
soul</hi> was made an offering for <hi>Sin,
Isa.</hi> 53. 10 And his body, the <hi>offering
of the body of Jesus Christ,</hi> Hob. 10 11.
<hi>His blood</hi> especially, which is often <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochically</hi>
mentioned for the whole.
(4.) His death had the <hi>nature</hi> of a
Sacrifice: For (1.) Therein were
the sins of men laid upon him, and
not in his entrance into Heaven; <hi>for
he bare our sins in his own body on the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47790:105"/>
tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 23. God made our sins
then to <hi>meet upon him,</hi> Isa. 53. 6.
Which gives the formality unto any
Sacrifices. <hi>Quod in ejus Caput sit,</hi> is
the formal reason of all Propitiatory
Sacrifices, and ever was so, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
declared, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21, 22. And
the phrase of <hi>bearing sin,</hi> of <hi>bearing
iniquity,</hi> is constantly used for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
of the punishment due to
sin. (2.) It had the <hi>End</hi> of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sacrifice; it made expiation of
sin, propitiation and attonement for
sin with reconciliation with God,
and so took away that enmity that
was between God and sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi>
1. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
18, 19. And although God himself
pesigned, appointed, and contrived
in Wisdom this way of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as he did the means for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning
of his own Anger towards the
friends of <hi>Job,</hi> commanding them to
go unto him, and with him offer
Sacrifices for themselves which he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47790:105"/>
would accept, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 28. Yet as He
was the Supream Governour, the
Lord of all, attended with Infinite
Justice, and Holiness, Attonement was
made with him, and satisfaction to
him thereby.</p>
            <p>What hath been spoken, may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to discover the emptiness and
weakness of those exceptions which
in general these men make against the
Truth before laid down from the
Scripture. A brief examination of
some particular instances, wherein
they seek not so much to oppose, as
to reproach the Revelation of this
Mysterie of the Gospel, shall put a
close to this discourse. It is said
then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. That if this be so, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that God is gracious to Forgive, and
yet impossible for him unless the debt be
fully satisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I suppose the confused and
abrupt expression of things here, in
words scarcely affording a tolerable
sense, is rather from weakness than
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47790:106"/>
captiousness; and so I shall let the
manner of the proposal pass.
(2.) What is this should follow,
that God is <hi>gracious</hi> to forgive sinners,
and yet will not, cannot, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his own Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>actually forgive</hi> any, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Satisfaction and Attonement made
for sin? the worst that can be hence
concluded is, that the Scripture is <hi>true</hi>
which affirms both these in many
places. (3.) This sets out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
greatness of the Grace of God
in <hi>forgiveness,</hi> that when sin could not
be forgiven without <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and
the sinner himself could no way make
any such satisfaction, that he provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself a Sacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the sinner might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and pardoned. (4.) Sin is
not properly <hi>a debt,</hi> for then it might
be paid in kind, by sin it self; but is
<hi>called</hi> so, only because it binds over
the sinner to <hi>punishment,</hi> which is the
satisfaction to be made for that which
is properly a Transgression, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47790:106"/>
only <hi>a debt.</hi> It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</p>
            <p>2. Hence it follows that the finite
and impotent creature is more capable
of extending Mercy and Forgiveness,
than the Infinite and Omnipotent
Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God being Essentially Holy
and Righteous, having ingaged his
<hi>faithfulness</hi> in the sanction of the Law,
and being <hi>naturally</hi> and necessarily the
Governour and Ruler of the World,
the Forgiving of sin without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
would be no perfection in
him, but an effect of impotency, and
imperfection; a thing which God
cannot do; as he <hi>cannot lye,</hi> nor <hi>deny
himself.</hi> (2.) The direct contrary
of what is insinuated, is asserted by
this Doctrine; for on the supposition
of the Satisfaction, and Attonement
insisted on, not only doth God <hi>freely
forgive,</hi> but that in such a way of
Righteousness and Goodness as no
Creature is able to conceive or express
the glory and excellency of it. And
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47790:107"/>
to speak of the poor halving pardons
of private Men, upon particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
against themselves, who are
commanded so to do, and have no
right nor authority to require or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
punishment nor is any due upon
the meer account of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
in comparison with the
forgiveness of God, ariseth out of a
<hi>deep ignorance</hi> of the whole matter
under consideration.</p>
            <p>3. It is added by them, that hence
it follows, <hi>that God so loved the World,
he gave his only Son to save it; and
yet that God stood off in high displeasure,
and Christ gave himself as a compleat
satisfaction to offended Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Something these Men
would say, if they knew what or
how; for (1.) <hi>That God so loved the
World,</hi> as to give his only Son to save
it, is the expression of the Scripture,
and the foundation of the Doctrine
whose truth we contend for. That
Christ offered himself to make Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for sinners, and therein made
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47790:107"/>
satisfaction to the Justice of God, is
the Doctrine it self which these Men
oppose, and not any consequent of it.
(3.) That God <hi>stood off in high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,</hi>
is an expression which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Scripture useth, nor those
who declare this Doctrine from
thence, nor is suited unto divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or the manner of divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
That intended seems to be
that the Righteousness and Law of
God required the punishment due to
Sin, to be undergone, and thereby
satisfaction to be made unto God;
which is no consequent of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but the Doctrine it self.</p>
            <p>4. It is yet farther objected, <hi>that if
Christ made satisfaction for sin, then he
did it either as God, or as Man, or as
God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ,</hi> (1.) <hi>As God and Man,</hi> Acts
20. 28. <hi>God redeemed his Church with
his own blood,</hi> 1 John 3. 16. Herein
was manifest <hi>the Love of God, that he
laid down his life for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 14.
(2.) This <hi>dilemma</hi> is proposed as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47790:108"/>
that which proceeds on a supposition
of <hi>our own principles,</hi> that Christ is
God and Man in one Person, which
indeed makes the pretended difficulty
to be vain and a meer effect of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
For all the <hi>Mediatory</hi> acts of
Christ being the acts of his Person,
must of necessity be the acts of him
as God and Man. (3.) There is yet
another mistake in this inquiry; for
<hi>satisfaction</hi> is in it looked on as a <hi>real
act</hi> or operation of one, or the other
nature in Christ; when it is the
<hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>telesma</hi> or Effect of the actings,
the doing and suffering of Christ;
the Dignity of what he did in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto the end for which he did
it. For the two natures are so united
in Christ, as not to have a <hi>third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi>
principle of <hi>Physical</hi> acts and
operations thence arising; but each
nature acts distinctly according to
its own being and properties; yet so,
as what is the immediate act of either
nature, is the act of him who is one
in both, from whence it hath its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47790:108"/>
(4.) The summ is; that in all
the Mediatory actions of Christ we are
to consider, (1.) The <hi>Agent,</hi> and
that is the Person of Christ. (2.) The
<hi>immediate principle</hi> by which, and
from which the Agent worketh; and
that is the natures in the Person.
(3.) The <hi>Actions,</hi> which are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Operations of either nature.
(4.) The <hi>Effect</hi> or work with respect
to God and us; and this relates unto
the Person of the Agent, the Lord
Christ, God and Man. A blending
of the natures into one common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of operation, as the compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mediums unto one end, is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
supposed in this matter.</p>
            <p>But yet again it is pretended that
sundry consequences <hi>irreligious and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational</hi>
do ensue upon a supposition
of the satisfaction pleaded for. What
then are they?</p>
            <p>1. That it is unlawful and impossible
for God All-mighty to be gracious, and
merciful, or to pardon Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:47790:109"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) The miserable confused
misapprehension of things, which the
proposal of this, and the like conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
doth evidence, manifests suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
how unfit the makers of them
are to mannage Controversi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of this
nature. For (1.) It is supposed that
for God <hi>to be Gracious and Merciful,</hi>
or to <hi>pardon Sinners,</hi> are the same;
which is to confound the <hi>Essential
properties</hi> of his nature, with the free
acts of his will. (2.) Lawful, or
unlawful, are terms that can with no
tolerable sense be used concerning any
properties of God, all which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and necessary unto his Being;
as Goodness, Grace, and Mercy in
particular are. (3.) That it is <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for God to pardon Transgressors
according to this Doctrine,</hi> is a fond
Imagination, for it is only a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>manner</hi> how he doth it.
(4.) As God is gracious and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
so also he is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi>
and true; and it became him, or was
every way meet for him, in his way
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47790:109"/>
of exercising Grace and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
sinners, to order all things so,
as that it might be done without the
impeachment of his Holiness, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Truth. It is said
again,</p>
            <p>2. That God was inevitably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to this way of saving Men; the
highest affront to his uncontroulable
Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Were the Authors of these
exceptions put to declare what they
mean by <hi>Gods uncontroulable nature,</hi>
they would hardly disentangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with common sence. Such
Masters of Reason are they indeed,
whatever they would fain pretend to
be. Controulable, or <hi>uncontroulable,</hi>
respect actings and operations, not
Beings or Natures. (2.) That upon
the Principle opposed by these Men,
God was <hi>inevitably compelled to this
way of saving Men,</hi> is a fond and
Childish Imagination. The whole
business of the Salvation of Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto this Doctrine, depends
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47790:110"/>
on a meer free Soveraign act of Gods
will exerting it self in a way of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wisdom, Holiness, and Grace.
(3.) The meaning of this Objection
(if it hath either sence or meaning
in it) is, that God freely purposing to
save lost sinners, did it in a way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his <hi>holy Nature,</hi> and righteous
Law. What other course Infinite
Wisdom could have taken for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of his Justice we know not;
That Justice was to be satisfied, and
that this way it is done, we know and
believe.</p>
            <p>3. They say it hence follows, <hi>that
it is unworthy of God to pardon, but
not to inflict punishment on the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
or require a satisfaction where
there was nothing due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) What is <hi>Worthy</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi>
of God, himself alone knows,
and of men not any but according to
what he is pleased to declare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal.
But certainly, it is unworthy
any Person pretending to the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Ingenuity or use of Reason,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47790:110"/>
to use such frivolous Instances in any
case of importance which have not
the least pretence of Argument in
them but what ariseth from a gross
misapprehension, or misrepresentation
of a Doctrine designed to opposition.
(2.) To pardon sinners, is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Goodness and Grace of
God; to do it by Christ, that which
becometh them, and his Holiness
and Righteousness also. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6, 7. (3.) The Lord
Christ was <hi>Personally Innocent;</hi> but
He <hi>who knew no sin was made sin for
us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. And as the Mediator
and Surety of the Covenant, he was
to answer for the sins of them whom
he undertook to save from the wrath
to come; by giving himself a ransome
for them, and making his soul an
Offering for their sin. (4) That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is due to the Justice of God for
sin, that is, that sin doth not in the
Justice of God deserve punishment, is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good comfortable Doctrine, for
Men that are resolved to continue in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47790:111"/>
their sins whilest they live in this
World. The Scripture tells us, that
Christ <hi>paid</hi> what he took not; that
all our <hi>iniquities</hi> were caused to meet
upon him; that <hi>he bare them in</hi> his
own body on the Tree; that <hi>his soul
was made an offering</hi> for sin, and therei
by made Reconciliation or Atione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the sins of the People; if
these Persons be otherwise minded,
we cannot help it.</p>
            <p>4. It is added; that this <hi>Doctrine
doth not only disadvantage the true
vertue and real intent of Christs life and
death, but intirely deprives G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of that
praise which is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing to his greatest Love
and Goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I suppose that this is the first
time, that this Doctrine fell under this
imputation; nor could it possibly be
lyable unto this charge from any,
who did either understand it, or the
grounds on which it is commonly
opposed. For, there is no end of the
Life or death of Christ, which the
<hi>Socinians</hi> themselves admit of, but it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47790:111"/>
is also allowed, and asserted in the
Doctrine now called in Question.
Do they say, that he <hi>taught the Truth</hi>
or revealed the whole mind and will
of God concerning his Worship and
our obedience? We say the same. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they say, that by his death he <hi>hare
testimony</hi> unto, and confirmed the
truth which he had taught? it is also
owned by us. Do they say that in what
he did, and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fered, he set us an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
that we should labour after
conformity unto? it is what we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and teach. Only we say
that all these things belong principally
to his <hi>Prophetical Office.</hi> But we
moreover affirm and believe, that as <hi>a
Priest,</hi> or in the discharge of his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal
Office,</hi> he did in his death and
sufferings, offer himself a Sacrifice to
God, to make Attonement for our
sins, which they deny; and that <hi>he
dyed for us,</hi> or in <hi>our stead,</hi> that we
might go free; without the faith and
acknowledgement whereof no part
of the Gospel can be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47790:112"/>
All the ends then which they
themselves assign of the <hi>Life</hi> and death
of Christ, are by us granted; and the
principal one, which gives life and
efficacy to the rest, is by them denyed.
Neither (2.) doth it fall under any
possible imagination, that the <hi>praise
due unto God</hi> should be Ecclipsed
hereby. The Love and Kindness of
God towards us, is in the Scripture
fixed principally and fundamentally,
on his <hi>sending of his only begotten Son
to dye for us.</hi> And certainly the
greater the work was that he had to
do, the greater ought our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of his Love and kindness
to be; but it is said,</p>
            <p>5. That it represents the Son more
kind and compassionate than the Father;
whereas if both be the same God, then
either the Father is as loving as the Son,
or the Son as angry as the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) The Scripture referreth
the Love of the Father, unto two
heads. (1.) The <hi>sending of his Son
to dye for us,</hi> John 3. 16. Rom. 5. 8.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47790:112"/>
1 John 4. 8. (2.) <hi>In choosing sinners
unto a participation of the fruits of his
love,</hi> Ephes. 1. 3, 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. The Love
of the Son, is fixed signally on his
<hi>actual giving himself to dye for us,</hi>
Gal. 2. 20. Ephes. 5. 25. Rev. 1. 5.
What ballances these Persons have
got, to weigh these Loves in, and to
conclude which is the <hi>greatest</hi> or most
weighty, I know not.</p>
            <p>2. Although only the actual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his Office be directly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to the Love of Christ, yet his
<hi>cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scention</hi> in taking our nature upon
him expressed by his <hi>mind,</hi> Ephes 6. 7.
and the readiness of his Will, <hi>Psalm</hi>
40. 8. doth eminently comprise Love
in it also.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Love of the Father
in sending of the Son, was an act of
<hi>his will,</hi> which being a natural and
essential property of God, it was so
far the act of the Son also, as he is
partaker of the same nature; though
eminently and in respect of order it
was peculiarly the act of the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47790:113"/>
(4.) The anger of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od against sin, is
an effect of his essential Righteousness
and Holiness which belong to him as
God; which yet hinders not, but
that both Father, and Son, and Spirit
acted Love towards sinners. They say
again,</p>
            <p>6. It robs God of the gift of his Son
for our redemption, which the Scriptures
attribute to the unmerited Love he had
for the World, in affirming the Son
purchased that redemption from the
Father, by the gift of himself to God as
our compleat satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) It were endless to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the improper and absurd expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which are made use of in these
exceptions; as here the <hi>last words</hi>
have no tolerable sence in them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to any principles whatever.
(2.) If the Son's purchasing Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
for us, procuring, obtaining it,
do rob God of the gift of his Son for
our redemption; the Holy Ghost must
answer for it: For having <hi>obtained</hi>
for us, or procured, or purchased
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47790:113"/>
               <hi>eternal redemption,</hi> is the word used
by himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. And to deny
that he hath laid down his Life <hi>a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
for us, and to have <hi>bought us with
a price,</hi> is openly to deny the Gospel.
(2.) In a word, the great gift of God
consisted in <hi>giving his Son to obtain
Redemption</hi> for us. (3.) Herein he
<hi>offered himself unto God,</hi> and gave
himself for us; and if these Persons
are offended herewithal, what are we
that we should withstand God. They
say,</p>
            <p>7. Since Christ could not pay what
was not his own, it follows that in the
payment of his own, the case still remains
equally grievous. Since the debt is not
hereby absolved or forgiven, but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
only; and by consequence we are
no better provided for salvation than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
owing that now to the Son, which
was once owing to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The looseness, and dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the expressions here used,
makes an appearance that there is
something in them, when indeed there
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47790:114"/>
is not. There is an Allusion in them
to a debt and a payment, which is the
most <hi>improper expression</hi> that is used in
this matter, and the interpretation
thereof is to be regulated by other
proper expressions of the same thing.
But to keep to the Allusion, (1.) Christ
<hi>paid his own,</hi> but not for himself, <hi>Dan.</hi>
9. 26. (2.) Paying it for us, the <hi>debt</hi>
is discharged, and our actual discharge
is to be given out according to the
wayes and means, and upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
appointed and constituted by
the Father and Son. (3.) When a debt
is so transferred as that one is accepted
in the room, and obliged to payment
in the stead of another, and that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made and accepted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
all Law and Reason require
that the original Debtor be discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
(4.) What on this account we
owe to the Son, is praise, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and obedience, and not the debt
which he took upon himself, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
for us, when we were <hi>non-solvent,</hi>
by his love. So that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47790:114"/>
is plain enough, and not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
by such cloudy expressions and
incoherent discourse, following the
<hi>Metaphor</hi> of a debt. For if God be
considered as the <hi>Creditor,</hi> we all as
Debtors, and being <hi>insolvent,</hi> Christ
undertook out of his Love to pay the
debt for us, and did so accordingly,
which was accepted with God; it
follows that we are to be discharged,
upon Gods terms, and under a new
obligation unto his Love, who hath
made this satisfaction for us, which we
shall eternally acknowledge. It is said,</p>
            <p>8. It no way renders Men beholding,
or in the least obliged to God, since by
their Doctrine he would not have abated
us, nor did he Christ the least farthing; so
that the acknowledgements, are peculiarly
the Sons, which destroyes the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Scripture Testimony for his good
will towards Men. O the infamous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
this Doctrine draws of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness; is this your retribution,
O injurious Satisfactionists?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is but a bold Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47790:115"/>
of what in other words was
mentioned before over and over.
Wherein the Love of God in this
matter consisted, and what is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on us unto thankfulness and
obedience, hath been before also decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And we are not to be moved
in Fundamental Truths, by <hi>vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations</hi>
of weak and unstable Men.
It is said,</p>
            <p>9. That Gods Justice is satisfied for
sins past, present and to come, whereby
God and Christ have lost both their power
of inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yning Godliness, and prerogative
of punishing disobedience; for what is
once paid, is not revokable; and if pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
should arrest any for their debts,
it argues a breach on God or Christs part;
or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se that it hath not been sufficiently
solved; and the penalty compleat sustained
by another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The intention of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
consequence of our Doctrine
is, that upon a supposition of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made by Christ, there is no solid
foundation remaining for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47790:115"/>
of Faith, Repentance, and
Obedience on the one hand, or of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them who refuse so to obey,
believe, or repent, on the other. The
Reason of this Inference insinuated,
seems to be this; that sin being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for, cannot be called again to an
Account. For the former part of the
pretended consequence, namely that
on this supposition, there is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
left for the prescription of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
I cannot discern any thing in
the least looking towards the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it, in the words of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
laid down. But these things
are quite otherwise; as is manifest
unto them that read and obey the
Gospel. For (1.) Christs satisfaction
for sins, acquits not the creature of
that dependance <hi>on</hi> God, and duty
which he owes <hi>to</hi> God, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>that,</hi> God may Justly,
and doth prescribe unto him, suitable
to his own Nature, Holiness and Will.
The whole of our regard unto God,
doth not lye in an acquitment from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47790:116"/>
sin. It is moreover required of us as
a necessary and indispensible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Relation wherein we
stand unto him, that we live to him
and obey him, whether sin be satisfied
for, or no. The manner and measure
hereof are to be regulated by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
which are suited to his
own Wisdom and our condition. And
they are now referred to the heads
mentioned of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and
<hi>new Obedience.</hi> (2.) The Satisfaction
made for sin, being not made by the
sinner himself, there must of necessity
be a Rule, Order, and law-Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
how the sinner may come to be
interested in it, and made partaker of
it. For the consequent of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of one by the suffering of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not <hi>natural</hi> or necessary, but
must proceed and arise from a Law-Constitution,
Compact, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now the <hi>way</hi> Constituted and
Appointed, is that of Faith, or believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as explained in the Scripture. If
Men believe not, they are no less liable
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47790:116"/>
to the punishment due to their sins,
than if no satisfaction at all were made
for sinners. And whereas it is added,
<hi>forgetting that every one must Appear
before the Judgement seat of Christ, to
receive according to things done in the
body; Yea and every one must give an
Account of himself to God;</hi> closing all
with this, <hi>but many more are the gross
absurdities and Blasphemies that are the
genuine fruits of this so confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
Doctrine of satisfaction.</hi> I say it
is (3.) Certain, that we must all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Judgement seat of
Christ, to receive according to the
things done in the body; and therefore
Wo will be unto them at the great
day, who are not able to plead the
<hi>Attonement</hi> made for their sins by the
blood of Christ, and an Evidence of
their interest therein by their <hi>faith and
obedience,</hi> or the things done and
wrought in them, and by them whilst
they were in the body here in this
World. And this it would better
become these persons to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47790:117"/>
unto the consideration of, than
to exercise themselves unto an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
confidence in reproaching those
with <hi>absurdities</hi> and <hi>blasphemies,</hi> who
believe the Deity and Satisfaction of
Jesus Christ the Son of the living God,
who <hi>dyed for us,</hi> which is the ground
and bottom of all our Expectation of
a <hi>blessed life</hi> and immortality to come.</p>
            <p>The removal of these Objections
against the Truth scattered of late up
and down in the hands of all sorts of
Men, may suffice for our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
If any amongst these Men, who
judge that they have an ability to
mannage the opposition against the
Truth as declared by us, with such
pleas, Arguments, and exceptions, as
may pretend an interest in appearing
Reason, they shall, God assisting, be
attended unto. With men, given
up to a spirit of railing or reviling,
though it be no small honour to be
reproached by them who reject with
scorn the eternal Deity of the Son of
God, and the Satisfactory Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47790:117"/>
he made for the sins of
Men, no Person of Sobriety will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
And I shall further only desire
the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice, that though
these few sheets were written in few
hours, upon the desire, and for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of some private Friends, and
therefore contain meerly an expression
of present thoughts, without the least
design or diversion of mind towards
accuracy or Ornament; yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is so far confident that the Truth,
and nothing else is proposed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in them, that he fears not but
that an opposition to what is here
declared will be removed, and the
Truth reinforced in such a way and
manner as may not be to its disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

            <p>First, For the Term of <hi>satisfaction</hi>

               </gap>,
the thing it self intended is
asserted in it, beyond all <hi>Modest</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
Neither indeed is there
in the Hebrew Language any word
that doth <hi>adequately</hi> answer unto it;

This last word we render <hi>satisfaction,

are of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
and some of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to express the thing
intended, beyond that which hath
obtained in vulgar use. For that
which we intended hereby, is, the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Obedience unto Death, and the
Passion or suffering of our Lord Jesus
Christ, God and Man, whereby, and
wherein he offered himself through the
Eternal Spirit, for a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
that he might fulfill the Law, or
answer all its universal Postulata, and
as our Sponsor, undertaking our Cause,
when we were under the sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
underwent the punishment
due to us from the Justice of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
transferred on him; whereby have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

made a perfect and absolute Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
or Attonement for our sins, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
for us deliverance from death, and
the Curse, and a Right unto life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacting.</hi>
Now this is more properly
expressed by some of the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, than by that of <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi>
which yet nevertheless as
usually explained, is <hi>comprehensive,</hi> and
no way unsuited to the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by it.</p>
            <p>In general, men by this word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
either <hi>reparationem offensae,</hi>
or <hi>solutionem debiti:</hi> either <hi>Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
made for offence given unto any;
or the <hi>payment</hi> of a debt. <hi>Debitum</hi>
is either <hi>oriminale,</hi> or <hi>pecuniarium;</hi>
that is, either, the obnoxiousness of
a man to <hi>punishment</hi> for crimes, or the
guilt of them, in answer to that
justice and Law which he is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
liable and subject unto; or,
unto a <hi>payment</hi> or compensation by,
and of money, or what is valued by
it; which last consideration, neither
in it self, nor in any reasonings from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47790:121"/>
an <hi>Analogie</hi> unto it, can in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have any proper place. Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is the effect of the doing or
suffering, what is required for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
of his charge against faults or
sins, who hath Right, Authority and
Power to require, exact, and inflict
punishment for them. Some of the
Schoolment define it, by <hi>voluntaris
radditio aequivalentis indebiti;</hi> of
which more elsewhere. The true
meaning of to satisfie, or make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
is <hi>tantum facere aut pati,
quantum satis sit juste irato ad vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam.</hi>
This <hi>satisfaction</hi> is impleaded,
as inconsistent with free <hi>Remission of
Sins;</hi> how causlesly we have seen.
It is so far from it, that it is necessary
to make way for it, in case of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
law transgressed, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Order of the Universal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Government of all, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed.
And this God directs unto,
Lev. 4. 31. <hi>The Priest shall make an
Attonement for him, and it shall be
forgiven him.</hi> This <hi>Attonement</hi> was a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47790:121"/>
               <hi>Legal Satisfaction;</hi> and it is by God
himself premised to Remission or
Pardon. And <hi>Paul</hi> prayes <hi>Philemon</hi>
to forgive <hi>Onesimus,</hi> though he took
upon himself to make satisfaction for
all the wrong or dammage that he
had sustained, <hi>Epist. v.</hi> 18, 19. And
when God was displeased with the
friends of <hi>Job</hi> he prescribes a way to
them, or what they shall do, and
what they shall get done for them,
that they might be accepted and
pardoned, Job 42. 7, 8. <hi>The Lord said
unto</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>my wrath is kindled
against thee and against thy two friends,
therefore take unto you now seven Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
and seven Ramms, and go to my
servant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your selves
a burnt offering, and my servant</hi> Job
<hi>shall pray for you, for him I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
lest I deal with you after your
folly.</hi> He plainly enjoyneth an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
that he might Freely
pardon them. And both these,
namely <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> with
their order and consistency, were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47790:122"/>
solemnly represented by the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Scape
Goat.</hi> For after all the sins of the
people were put upon him, or the
punishment of them transferred unto
him in a <hi>Type</hi> and Representation
with <hi>quod in ejus caput-sit,</hi> the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reason of all Sacrifices propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory,
he was sent away with them,
denoting the oblation or <hi>forgiveness of
sin,</hi> after a Translation made of its
punishment, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21, 22. And
whereas it is not expresly said, that
that <hi>Goat</hi> suffered, or was slain, but
was either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Hircus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a Goat sent away, or was sent to a
Rock called <hi>Azazel</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Oleaster,</hi> with
some others think, (which is not
probable, seeing though it might then
be done whilest the people were in
the Wilderness of <hi>Sinai;</hi> yet could
not by reason of its distance, when
the people were setled in <hi>Canaan</hi> be
annually observed;) it was from the
poverty of the Types, whereof no
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47790:122"/>
one could fully represent that Grace
which it had particular respect unto.
What therefore was wanting in that
<hi>Goat,</hi> was supplyed in the other,
which was <hi>slain</hi> as a <hi>sin offering,
v.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it follow, that on
the supposition of the satisfaction
pleaded for, the Freedom, Pardon, or
Acquitment of the person originally
guilty and liable to punishment, must
immediately and <hi>ipso facto,</hi> ensue. It
is not of the nature of every <hi>solution</hi>
or <hi>satisfaction,</hi> that deliverance must
<hi>ipso facto</hi> follow. And the Reason of
it is, because this satisfaction by a
<hi>succedaneous substitution</hi> of one to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
punishment for another, must
be founded in a voluntary compact,
and Agreement, For there is required
unto it, a <hi>Relaxation of the Law,</hi>
though not as unto the punishment
to be inflicted, yet as unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be punished. And it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in personal guilt, than in <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
debts.</hi> In these the <hi>Debt</hi> it self
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47790:123"/>
is solely intended, the person only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
with reference thereunto. In the
other, the person is firstly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
under the Obligation. And
therefore when a <hi>pecuniary debs</hi> is paid,
by whomsoever it be paid, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of the person himself unto
payment ceaseth <hi>ipso facto.</hi> But in
things <hi>criminal,</hi> the guilty person him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
being firstly, immediately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
under the Obligation unto
punishment, when there is introduced
by <hi>compact,</hi> a <hi>vicarious solution</hi> in the
fubstitution of another to suffer,
though he suffer the <hi>same absolutely</hi>
which those should have done for
whom he suffers; yet because of the
<hi>Acceptation</hi> of his person to suffer,
which might have been refused, and
could not be admitted, without some
<hi>Relaxation of the Law,</hi> Deliverance of
the guilty persons cannot ensue <hi>ipso
facto,</hi> but by the intervention of the
Terms fixed on in the Covenant or
Agreement for an admittance of the
substitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:47790:123"/>
It appears from what hath been
spoken, that in this matter of <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
God is not considered as a
<hi>Creditor,</hi> and sin as a debt, and the
Law as an obligation to the payment
of that <hi>Debt,</hi> and the Lord Christ as
paying it; though these <hi>notions</hi> may
have been used by some for the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
of the whole matter; and
that not without countenance from
sundry expressions in the Scripture to
the same purpose; But God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as the infinitely holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<hi>Author</hi> of the Law, and Supream
<hi>Governour of all mankind,</hi> according
to the Tenor and Sanction of it. Man
is considered as a <hi>sinner,</hi> a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of that Law, and thereby obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and liable to the <hi>punishment</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in it, and by it, answerably
unto the <hi>Justice</hi> and Holiness of its
Author. The <hi>Substitution</hi> of Christ
was meerly <hi>Voluntary</hi> on the part of
God, and of himself, undertaking to
be a Sponsor to answer for the sins
of men, by undergoing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47790:124"/>
due unto them. That to this
End there was a <hi>Relaxation of the Law,</hi>
as to the persons that were to suffer,
though not as to what was to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
Without the former, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
mentioned could not have
been admitted. And on supposition
of the latter, the suffering of Christ
could not have had the nature of
punishment properly so called. For
<hi>punishment</hi> relates to the <hi>Justice</hi> and
Righteousness in Government of him
that exacts it, and inflicts it. And
this the Justice of God doth not, but
by the Law. Nor could the <hi>Law</hi> be
any way satisfied, or fulfilled by the
suffering of Christ, if antecedently
thereunto its obligation or power of
obliging unto the penalty constituted
in its Sanction, unto sin, was relaxed,
dissolved, or dispensed withall. Nor
was it agreeable to <hi>Justice,</hi> nor would
the nature of the things themselves
admit of it, that another punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be inflicted on Christ,
than what we had deserved, nor
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47790:124"/>
could our sin be the impulsive cause
of his death: nor could we have
had any benefit thereby. And this
may suffice to be added unto what
was spoken before, as to the nature
of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> so far as the <hi>brevity</hi> of
the discourse whereunto we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
will bear, or the use whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it is designed doth require.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Nature of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
contended for, being declared
and cleared, we may in <hi>one or two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
manifest how evidently it is
revealed, and how fully it may be
confirmed or vindicated. It is then
in the Scripture declared, that Christ
<hi>dyed for us;</hi> that he <hi>dyed for our sins,</hi>
and that <hi>we are thereby delivered.</hi> This
is the foundation of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as such. Without the faith, and
acknowledgement of it, we are not
Christians. Neither is it in these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms, at all denyed by the
<hi>Socinians.</hi> It remains therefore, that
we consider, (1.) How this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
and affirmed in the Scripture:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47790:125"/>
and (2.) What is the true meaning
of the Expressions and Propositions
wherein it is revealed and affirmed;
for in them, as in sundry others, we
affirm, that the satisfaction pleaded
for, is contained.</p>
            <p>1. Christ is said to <hi>dye,</hi> to <hi>give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
to <hi>be delivered,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp;c. for
us, for his sheep, for the life of the world;
for sinners, John</hi> 6. 51. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 15.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi>
2. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. Moreover he is said to
dye <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for sins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. The End whereof
every where expressed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
is, that we might be <hi>freed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi>
and <hi>saved.</hi> These things as was
said, are agreed unto, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leded.</p>
            <p>2. The meaning and importance,
we say of these Expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssions, is; that
Christ dyed in our <hi>Room, Place,</hi> or
<hi>Stead,</hi> undergoing the <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
which we should have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
in the way and manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared. And this is the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:47790:125"/>
we plead for. It remains
therefore, that from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the
<hi>nature</hi> of the things treated of, the
<hi>proper signification</hi> and constant use of
the. Expressions mentioned, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification</hi>
of them in the Customs
and Usages of the Nations of the
World, we do evince and manifest,
that what we have laid down, is the
true and proper sense of the words,
wherein this Revelation of <hi>Christs dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for us</hi> is expressed; so that they
who deny Christ to have <hi>dyed for us</hi>
in this sense, do indeed deny that he
properly dyed for us at all; what
ever benefits they grant, that by his
death we may obtain.</p>
            <p>First, We may consider the Use of
this Expression in the Scripture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indefinitely, or in particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>Only we must take this along with
us, that <hi>dying for sins and Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
being added <hi>unto dying for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
or persons, maketh the <hi>substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of one in the room and stead of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47790:126"/>
another, more evident, than when
the dying of one for another only, is
mentioned. For whereas all <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi>
are regulated by their <hi>subjects,</hi>
and it is ridiculous to say, that one
dyeth in the stead of sins, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can be no other, but the bearing
or answering of the sins of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in whose stead any one dyeth.
And this is in the Scripture declared
to be the sense of that Expression, as
we shall see afterwards. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider some Instances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 11. 50. The words of <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphas
Counsel</hi> are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>It is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for us, that one man should dye for
the people, and that the whole Nation
perish not:</hi> which is expressed again,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>perish for the people. Caiaphas</hi> feared,
that if Christ were spared, the people
would be destroyed by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
The way to free them, he thought
was by the destruction of Christ;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47790:126"/>
him therefore he devoted to death, in
lieu of the People. As <hi>He</hi>
               <q>Vnum pro multis dabitur Caput.</q>
               <hi>One head shall be given for many.</hi> Not
unlike the Speech of <hi>Otho</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in <hi>Xiphilin,</hi> when he slew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to preserve his Army; For when
they would have perswaded him to
renew the war after the defeat of
some of his Forces, and offered to
lay down their lives to secure him;
he replyed, that he would not; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Reason, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>It is far
better, and more just that one should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
or dye for all; than that many should
perish for one;</hi> that is, One in the <hi>stead</hi>
of many, that they may go free; or as
another speaks;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <l>
                     <hi>Let one be given up to dye in the stead
of all.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:47790:127"/>
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
They are the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> unto
<hi>Christ; I will lay down my life for thee;</hi>
To free thee, I will expose my own
head to danger, my life to death;
that thou maist live and I dye. It is
plain that he intended the same thing
with the celebrated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
old, who exposed their own lives,
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) for one another,
such were <hi>Damon and Pythias, Orestes
&amp; Pylades, Nisur &amp; Eurialus.</hi> Whence
is that saying of <hi>Seneca, Succurram
perituro; sed ut ipse n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n peream; nisi si
futurus ero magni hominis, aut magnae
rei merces. I will relieve or succour one
that is ready to perish; yet so as that I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
not my self; unless thereby, I be taken
in lieu of some great man, or great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
For a great man, a man of great
worth and usefulness I could perish,
or dye in his stead, that he might live
and go free.</p>
            <p>We have a great Example also of
the importance of this Expression in
those words of <hi>David</hi> concerning
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47790:127"/>
               <hi>Absolom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>Who will grant me to dye,
I for thee,</hi> or in thy stead; <hi>My Son
Absolom.</hi> It was never doubted, but
that <hi>David</hi> wished that he had dyed
in the stead of his Son; and to have
undergone the death which he did, to
have preserved him alive. As to the
same purpose, though in another
sense, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> used by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:47790:128"/>
doth signifie, when applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
persons, either a <hi>succession,</hi> or a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;</hi>
still the coming of one into
the Place and Room of another:
When one succeeded to another in
Government, it is expressed by that
word, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 7.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 16. In other cases it denotes
a <hi>substitution.</hi> So <hi>Jehu</hi> tells his
Gurad, that if any one of them
let any of <hi>Baals Priests</hi> escape,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 24. his
life should go in the stead of the life
that he had suffered to escape.</p>
            <p>And this answereth unto <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
the <hi>Greek,</hi> which is also used in this
matter; and ever denotes either
<hi>equality, contrariety,</hi> or <hi>substitution.</hi>
The two former senses, can here have
no place; the latter alone hath. So
it is said, that <hi>Archelaus</hi> reigned,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 2.
<hi>In the room or stead of</hi> Herod <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
So <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 38. is <hi>an eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</hi> And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47790:128"/>
this word also is used in expressing the
death of Christ for us. He came,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>To give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for many;</hi> that is, in their <hi>stead</hi>
to dye. So the words are used again,
<hi>Mark</hi> 10. 45. And both these notes
of a <hi>succedaneous substitution</hi> are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And this the
<hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to buy
any thing,</hi> to purchase or procure any
thing, with the price of ones life. So
<hi>Tigranes</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> askt
him what he would give or do for
the liberty of his Wife whom he
had taken prisoner; answered,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>I will purchase her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with my life, or the price of my
soul.</hi> Whereon the <hi>Woman</hi> being
freed, affirmed afterwards, that she
considered none in the company, but
him who said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>that he would
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47790:129"/>
purchase my liberty with his own life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these things are added on the
occasion of the Instances mentioned
in the Scripture, whence it appears,
that this expression of <hi>dying for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
hath no other sense or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but only dying <hi>instead of another,</hi>
undergoing the death that he <hi>should
undergo,</hi> that he might go free. And in
this matter of Christs dying for us,
add that he so dyed for us, as that he
also dyed for our sins, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>bear their punishment,</hi> or to
<hi>expiate their guilt,</hi> (for other sense
the words cannot admit) and he
that pretends to give any other
sense of them than that contended
for, which implyes the whole of
what lyes in the Doctrine of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo;</hi> even
he who was the Author of all <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Oracles of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the common sense of
<hi>mori pro alio,</hi> and <hi>pati pro alio,</hi> or <hi>pro
alio discrimen capitis subire;</hi> a <hi>substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:47790:129"/>
is still denoted by that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which sufficeth us in this whole
cause; for we know both into whose
room he came, and what they were
to suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. Thus <hi>Entellus</hi> killing and
sacrificing an Ox to <hi>Eryx</hi> in the stead
of <hi>Dares</hi> whom he was ready to have
slain, when he was taken from him,
expresseth himself;
<q>
                  <p>Hanc tibi Eryx meliorem animam pro
morte Daretis
Persolvo.</p>
               </q>
He offered the Ox, a better Sacrifice, in the
stead of Dares, <hi>taken from him. So</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Fratrem Pollux alternà morte redemit.</l>
               </q>
And they speak so not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto death, but where ever any

He threatned his Servant to cast him
into Prison to be macerated to death
with labour, and that with this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
that if he ever let him
out he would <hi>grind for him;</hi> that is,
in his stead. Wherefore without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Violence to the common means
of Understanding things amongst
men, another sense cannot be affixed
to these words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nature of the thing</hi> it self will
admit of no other Exposition than
that given unto it; and it hath been
manifoldly exemplified among the
Nations of the world. For suppose
a man guilty of any crime, and on
the account thereof, to be exposed
unto Danger from God or man, in
a way of Justice, Wrath, or Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and when he is ready to be
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47790:130"/>
given up unto suffering according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his demerit, another should ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself to dye for him that he
might be freed, let an appeal be
made to the common Reason and
Understandings of all men, whether
the intention of this his <hi>dying for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
be not, that he substitutes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his stead to undergo what he
should have done, however the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of punishment from one to
another may be brought about and
asserted. For at present we treat not
of the <hi>Right,</hi> but of the <hi>fact,</hi> or the
thing it self. And to deny this to
be the case as to the <hi>sufferings of Christ,</hi>
is as far as I can understand, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the whole Gospel.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as was said, this harh
been variously exemplified among the
Nations of the world; whose actings
in such cases, because they excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shadow out the general notion
of the death of Christ for others,
for sinners; and are appealed unto
directly by the Apostle to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47790:131"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8. I shall in a few
Instances reflect upon.</p>
            <p>Not to insist on the voluntary sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations
of private Persons, one into
the <hi>Room</hi> of another, mutually to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
<hi>dangers and death</hi> for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as before mentioned, I shall only
remember some publick Transactions
in reference unto <hi>communities,</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Cities, or Armies. Nothing is
more celebrated amongst the Ancients
than this; that when they supposed
themselves in Danger, from the Anger
and displeasure of their Gods, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any guilt or crimes among
them, some one person should either
<hi>devote</hi> himself, or be devoted by the
people, to dye for them, and therein
to be made as it were an <hi>expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
For where sin is the cause,
and God is the object respected, the
making of satisfaction by <hi>undergoing
punishment,</hi> and expiating of sin by a
propitiatory Sacrifice, are but various
expressions of the same thing. Now
those whoso <hi>devoted</hi> themselves, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47790:131"/>
was said, <hi>to dye in the stead of others,</hi> or
to <hi>expiate their sins,</hi> and turn away
the Anger of the God they feared by

by Examples, what is the sense

                  </gap>ir Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us, and for our sins, &amp;c.</hi> to deny
that he dyed and suffered in our

we were obnoxious, and the
punishment due to our sins, is; if we
respect in what we say or believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
constant use of those words in the
Scripture, the nature of the thing it
self concerning which they are used,
the uncontrolled use of that Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all sorts of Writers, in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the same thing, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and examples of its meaning
and intention among the Nations of
the World, is to deny that he dyed
for us at all.</p>
            <p>Neither will his <hi>dying for our Good</hi>
or advantage only, in what way or
sense soever, answer or make good, or
true, the Assertion of his <hi>dying for us,</hi>
and our sins. And this is evident in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47790:135"/>
the Death of the Apostles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
they all dyed for our Good; our
advantage and benefit was one end of
their sufferings, in the will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God; And yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, that they dyed <hi>for us, or
our sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if Christ dyed only for our
Good, though in a more effectual
manner than they did, yet this alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the kind of his dying for us;
nor can he thence be said properly,
according to the only due sense of
that expression, so to do.</p>
            <p>I shall in this brief and hasty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
add only one consideration
more about the death of Christ to
confirm the Truth pleaded for. And
that is that he is said in dying for
sinners, <hi>to bear their sins,</hi> Isa. 53. 11.
<hi>He shall bear their iniquities,</hi> v. 12.
<hi>He bare the sins of many;</hi> explained,
v. 5. <hi>He was wounded for our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
he was bruised for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Chastisement of our peace was
upon him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Who his own

            </p>
            <p>This expression is purely <hi>Sacred.</hi>
It occurreth not directly in other <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
though the sense of it in other
words do frequently. They call it
<hi>luere peccata;</hi> that is, <hi>delictorum sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium
ferre;</hi> to bear the punishment
of sins. The meaning therefore of
this phrase of speech, is to be taken
from the Scripture alone, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
from the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> where it
is <hi>originally</hi> used; and from whence it
is tranferred into the <hi>New Testament</hi>
in the same sense, and no other. Let

with respect unto sin, but openly and

               <hi>Our Fathers have

               </gap> is
often used with respect unto sin;
sometimes with reference unto Gods
actings about it, and sometimes with
reference unto mens concerns in it.
In the first way, or when it denotes
an act of God, it signifies to lift
up, to take away, or pardon sin;
and leaves the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> where with

               </gap>ilt of
sin, with respect unto punishment
ensuing as its consequent. For God
pardoning the guilt of sin, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of the punishment doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47790:136"/>
ensue; Guilt containing an
Obligation unto punishment. In the
latter way, as it respects men or
sinners, it constantly denotes the
bearing of the punishment of sin,
and gives that sense unto <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, with
respect unto the guilt of sin as its
cause. And hence ariseth the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of those words of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi>

And as this sense is sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
invincibly established by the

Christ in his death and suffering for

to our sins, what we had deserved,
that we might be delivered, as it
everts the great foundation of the
