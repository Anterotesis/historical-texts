         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Being the laſt year commanded by my occaſions down to the Spaw in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> was deſirous to improve my time in applying my ſelf to experiment, &amp; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: to the one for the diſcovery of the true cauſes of thoſe Famous Medicinal wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Knareſ-borow:</hi> to the other, to be convinced what real effects they wrought upon the drinkers thereof. And this I had leaſure, beyond expectation, to do, being prevented from my intended, and ſpeedier return, by reaſon of the then Northen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions. Now my experience herein I do freely and faithfully preſent to the world a publick account of; as for a more full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of thoſe of mine own profeſſion, (eſpecially ſome worthy D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. in the South, who firſt excited me hereto;) ſo alſo for the better direction, and greater ſucceſs of thoſe that ſhall make uſe of thoſe waters.</p>
            <p>In my obſervation I perceived that theſe waters, although very effectual in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet many times proved the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and that by reaſon, firſt of a want of a
<pb facs="tcp:109520:5"/>
due preparation; ſecondly of intemperance in dyet; thirdly of a prejudice againſt the uſe of all manner of Phyſick in the taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which ſhould promote the full opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and prevent the ſymptomes, which are oftentimes occaſioned by them; fourthly by reaſon of miſtaking the proper water; &amp; laſtly by not obſerving a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuitable to the conſtitutions &amp; maladies. Now for the prevention of whatſoever ſhall occaſion the ineffectual operation of thoſe waters I have publiſhed theſe few lines, which are made up, not of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſcure, dark, and ſuch as the vulgar might not underſtand, but of words plain, and as clear as the glaſſes themſelves wherein the waters are drunk, that every one may ſee what it is he drinks, clearly ſeeing therein the true cauſes, vertues, and uſe of them.</p>
            <p>I do not deſire that any ſhould adhere to my judgement herein any further, than they ſee it conſonant to reaſon; for to that, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the candid cenſure of the learned D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> long experienced in theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to all other, who ſhall rationally, and civilly convince me wherein I have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ſubject it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout fourteen Miles from <hi>York,</hi> Southweſt, is ſituated the ancient Towne of <hi>Knareſborow,</hi> formerly famous for the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Caſtle thereof built upon a Craggy Rocke, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for four famous Medicinall Springs, which in theſe latter years have bene diſcovered near the ſame; the names of which are <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>dropping</hi> or <hi>petrifying Well,</hi> the <hi>ſulphur,</hi> or <hi>ſtinking Well,</hi> the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and <hi>St. Mugnus Well.</hi> In naming onely four, I ſpeak as to the ſpecies, or kinds of them, but Doctor <hi>Deane</hi> in his treatiſe of the ſaid Waters men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions five, which in effect are but three, for he ſpeaks as to the Individuals, and names three ſulphur Wells, which indeed differ not at all, the one from the other, and if at all, yet onely gradually; and withall he rejects <hi>St. Magnus</hi> as an ineffectual ſuperſtitious relique of Popery, which notwithſtanding; becauſe it hath of late regained its reputation (as I ſhall

            </p>
            <p>The Nature of that country, eſpecially South-weſt is very rocky, yet mooriſh, &amp; heathy, conſiſting of an unctuous bituminous earth, which the country People cut at a certaine time of the year, making Turfe, and Peate thereof, which being dryed make good fewell. In that place are found ſeveral ſorts of Earth, Stones, Minerals, and veins of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.

            <p>BEfore I ſpeak any thing of the Nature of Springs, or Fountaines in particular, it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109520:6"/>
will be neceſſary, as conducing to the better underſtanding of them, to premiſe ſomething concerning the original of them in general; and the rather, becauſe there have been great controverſies betwixt the Stoicks and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetickes about the cauſes of them. Now the ſeveral opinions concerning the original of laſting Springs, (which are called <hi>Fontes perennes</hi>) may be reduced to three heads: for either they proceed from rain-water, or they are generated in the bowels of the earth, or elſe they muſt of neceſſity flow from the Sea through ſubterraneal channels. If any ſhall object as ſome have done, and ſay they may come from ſubterraneal lakes, let me demand of them whether thoſe ſakes proceed not from ſome of the three former, and whether they would not in time be exhauſted if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

If that were granted to be true which they ſay, yet it doth not follow that rain is the material cauſe of Springs, although at that time they break forth, which were before dryed up; for their drying up was not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned for want of rain to ſupply them, but by reaſon of the dryneſs of the earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its ſuperficies which attracts to it ſelf, and drinks in for the ſatisfaction of its drought the water of the Springs, which it doth again let go, when it hath drunk plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of the ſhowers from Heaven. Now that the dry earth will drink a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, you may ſee by the drying up of Rivers in a long drougth by the drynes of the earth, although the Fountains, which are the heads of thoſe Rivers, flow plentifully at the ſame time as ſome do, although others ſome be dryed up. And as for thoſe Springs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109520:7"/>
which break forth onely after great rain, they are cauſed from the rain which is drunk up by ſome boggie, ſpongious earth, and is drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from thence, or which is ſunk into ſome caverne, or hollow place, near the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the earth through ſome ſecret paſſage thither, and there being collected in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity imitates a Spring as long as it laſts.</p>
               <p>3. The grateſt part of ſhowers of rain fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon high places run down from thence into plains, and from plains through ſmall channels or trenchs into Rivers, and that rain, which falls upon any place from whence it cannot in ſome ſuch manner be conveyed away remains upon the ſuperficies of the earth, till it be exhaled by the Sun, as we ſee in divers places: beſides it cannot be imagined that rain ſinks ſo far into the earth as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Springs; and that becauſe it is generally obſerved by all that dig in the earth, that rain wetts not the earth above ten feet deep: And the reaſon hereof <hi>Seneca</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> gives in his third Book <hi>Naturalium quaeſtionum</hi> chap. 7. Where he ſaith, that when the earth is ſatiated with ſhowers, it then receives in no more, and this we ſee by dayly experience. Beſides, when wee dig a Well, although it be in a ſoft place, wee dig ſometimes one, two or three hundred feet deep, before wee come at quick Springs, and that the rain ſhould ſink ſo deep, it is no way probable; nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were hallow veins and chinks
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109520:8"/>
in the earth, through which many would have it paſſe to a great depth; for who cannot eaſily conceive that thoſe veins and crannies (which yet are not granted to be in every place where there are Springs) are eaſily ſtopt with duſt, or dirt, which the rain carryes with it when it is fallen on the earth; or ſwelled up, and contracted, as we ſee they are in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time with rain after a long drougth?</p>

And ſome, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>H. ab Heers,</hi> that Springs are generated of the aire ſhut up in the earth and by the coldnes thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol</hi> 1. It is more probable according to reaſon and experience, that by reaſon of the denſity of the earth water ſhould more eaſily be converted into earth, than the earth into water.</p>
               <p>2. It is to be wondred at, that ſeeing that ten parts of air (if not many more) ſerve for the making of one part of water conteina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſame ſpace there ſhould be ſo much ſpace in the earth for the containing of ſo much air as ſerves for the making of ſuch a quantity of water, as ſprings dayly out of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109520:8"/>
the earth: Beſides ſo much air being ſpent, there would of neceſſity follow a <hi>vacuum,</hi> for where ſhould there be ſo many, and great crannies, or holes to let the air into the earth faſt enough? But if there were, yet how is it poſſible that ſo much air can be corrupted in ſuch a moment, the whole Elementary air being of its owne nature moſt ſubtile, and not being ſufficient to make ſuch abundance of water as all the Springs of the earth will amount to? Now although this anſwer be according to the ſence of common <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> and ſufficient for the ſatisfaction of this objection, yet <hi>Helmont</hi> will not admit of any ſuch ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That air and water can at all be mutually tranſmuted into one the other. It is true, ſaith he, that water can eaſily be turned into a vapour, and the ſaid vapour into water again; but this vapour is nothing els materially, and formally but a <hi>congeries</hi> of atomes of water ſublimed, &amp; air will not in cold or heat yeild water any more then it contains in it the vapour, <hi>viz.</hi> of rarefied water. For ſaith he, if thoſe two Elements were ſo mutually convertible, one ſpecies muſt be tranſmuted into another, and the air that is made out of water, may be again reduced into the ſame numerical water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which it was before its rarefaction: but this cannot be unleſs you will grant that which all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>A privatione ad habitum datur regreſſuc:</hi> Laſtly for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his opinion, he brings in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment:

               <head>Arguments confirming the third opinion, and objections made againſt it, anſwered.</head>
               <p>The third opinion is the moſt ancient of all, and was held by <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> himſelfe one of the firſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and not ſo only, but is alſo aſſerted in ſacred writ, <hi>viz.

Where the wiſeſt of men affirmes, <hi>that all the Rivers run into the Sea, and yet the Sea is not full, unto the place from whence the Rivers come, thither they return again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon for the confirmation of this opinion are many, but the chiefeſt are theſe two: Firſt, becauſe there is not any body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the vaſt Ocean, that can afford neer ſuch an abundance of waters as ſpring from the earth. Secondly, becauſe the Sea it ſelfe is not increaſed by that multitude of waters that flow dayly into it, as it muſt of neceſſity be, unleſs they did by occult cavities of the earth return to their Fountaines, as is declared in the fore cited place by the wiſeſt of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109520:9"/>
Neither is <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> imputing the waſting of the Sea to the Sun and winds, of any force to perſwade to the contrary; for although this kind of waſting may be granted in part, yet if it ſhould be according to his judgement, his whole Element of water had bene long ſince conſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Seeing the Sea according to its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is lower than ſprings (for the courſe of water is downward) how then doth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof aſcend ſo high as the heads of ſprings, eſpecially thoſe in high Mountains, and Hills?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſhew after what manner it doth not aſcend, according to the opinion of ſome, for there are divers opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſes of its aſcent.</p>
               <p>1. It is not forced upward by a ſpirit, or breath that is in the water it ſelfe, as <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Valleſius</hi> ſuppoſed. For if it ſhould be granted that there were any ſuch intrinſecal impulſive ſpirit, or breath in waters, as it can not rationally be (for it is not obſerved that the Sea is moved any other way but by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts ſometimes, and the Moon by way of tide) yet that could not (though aſſiſted extrinſecally by ſtrong winds blowing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, and that in an open Sea,) force them to the height of ſprings, much leſſe could it alone in ſubterraneal crooked channels.</p>
               <p>2. Neither doth the weight of the earth force it up, as was the opinion of <hi>Bodinus,</hi> and <hi>Thales:</hi> For the earth, ſeeing it is a ſolid.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109520:10"/>
and firme body, doth not lye upon, and preſſe the water, but contrarily, the water the earth: Neither is the earth held up by the water, but the water by the earth, as you may ſee in all Rivers, Lakes, Pits, and the water of the Sea it ſelfe, when it is in channels of the earth. For if they ſhould not at any time be quite full, as it ſometimes happens, the upper part alone proves empty, which would not be if the waters were preſſed by the earth, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily.</p>
               <p>3. Neither doth the weight of the Sea force it ſelf up as was the opinion of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who ſuppoſed that the greateſt part of the water of the Sea is out of its place, <hi>viz.</hi> above its place in the place of the air, and ſo above the heads of ſprings, towards which it forceth it ſelfe by its natural deſcent, and ſo riſeth up again as high as the level of the water from whence it came; but he proves it not, onely he aſſerts it.</p>
               <p>But Doctor <hi>Jorden</hi> in his <hi>treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Baths</hi> being of the ſame opinion as touching the Seas being higher than the earth (though he holds that the natural place of the waters is above the earth) ſeemes to give ſome plauſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it: For ſaith he, although neer the coaſts it be depreſſed, and lower than the ſhoare, yet there is reaſon for that, becauſe it is terminated by the dry, and ſolid body of the earth, as wee ſee in a cup or bowle of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter filled to the top wee may put in a great bulk of ſilver in pieces, and yet the water will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109520:10"/>
not run over, but be heightened above the brims of the bowl, the like, ſaith he, we may ſee in a drop of water put upon a table, where the edges, or extremities of the water being terminated by the dry ſubſtance of the table are depreſſed, and lower than the midle like a halfe globe: But take away the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by moiſtening the table, and the drop ſinks even to an evennes. And whereas we ſee, ſaith he, that Rivers run downward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sea <hi>per declive,</hi> it doth not prove the Sea to be lower than the Land, but onely neer the ſhoar where it is thus terminated, and in lieu of this it hath ſcope enough aſſigned it to fill up the Globe, and ſo to be as high as the Land, if not higher. Now if I ſhould graunt that the Sea were higher in the midle than the higheſt place of the Land, yet it is very improbable that it ſhould force it ſelfe to the tops of Mountains ſooner than into Rivers which are far lower than the head of Springs, and more open than the narrow channels, and veines of the earth, through which it muſt paſſe to the Springs. And for that ſimilitude of his concerning the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of water by drynes, it will not hold water, nay it rather makes againſt him, than for him, for he ſaith that this termination is taken away by moiſture, Now let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, or of thoſe of his judgment, whether or no many great Rivers terminated in the Sea be not a ſufficient moiſture for the taking away of the termination of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109520:11"/>
water made by the dryneſs of earth, and ſo to make the globous Sea to ſink to an evennes?</p>
               <p>4. And as the water is not elevated by any of the three foregoing wayes of impulſe, or forcing, ſo neither is it by any of theſe two wayes of attraction, <hi>viz.</hi> by the power of the Planets, or by the earths ſucking it in, as a ſponge doth water, from beneath, and ſending it to higher places; For the firſt, there can be no ſuch attractive vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated; and if there were, it would as well, and promiſcouſly extend a like to Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, and low Countreyes where wee ſee few Fountains, as well as to high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Hills, from whence proceed the greateſt Springs. As to the ſecond, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue, if there were any ſuch here, attracts to this end, that the ſubject wherein it is, might conſume, retain, or enjoy what is attracted, and over and above that, none, or at leaſt not ſo much as would ſuffice for the making of Springs.</p>
               <p>5. Neither are there ſuch veins, in the earth through which the water ſhould paſſe, as cloth wine through crooked pipes or cranes which wine-coopers, and Vintners uſe for the drawing of wine out of one veſſel into an other, through which the wine being once ſucked, runs continually till all be run forth: For the veines in the bowels of the earth are not wholly, and throughout full, as of neceſſity they muſt be before water will aſcend through them for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109520:11"/>
preſervation of its continuity and the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a <hi>vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Neither is the water raiſed to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the earth by <hi>Helmonts ſabulum,</hi> or virgin-earth, which he ſaith is a certain ſand continued from the Center of the earth in divers places, even to the ſuperficies of the ſame. and to the tops of ſome Mountains, which ſand hath in it a vitality, and in which as in a vital abode, and natural place, the water, whileſt it remains, is living, and enjoyes common life, and knows neither ſuperiority, or inferiority of place, any otherwiſe than the bloud in the veines which flowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the head, and downward to the feet: But moreover he adds, that when this water is let out of its natural abode, <hi>viz.</hi> the virgin earth, as bloud out of a veine, it then doth like a heavy thing haſten to its Center, or iliad, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sea. Now for the confirming of this vitality in water, he brings in this diſtich of the Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>—————undas</l>

               </lg>
               <p>And he further adds that the ſea hath in it a kind of life, becauſe though the winds ceaſe, yet it hath its ſpontaneous motions, and obſerves its tides according to certain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations that it hath of the courſe of the moon, as if it would riſe to meet her. Now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109520:12"/>
let us obſerve the weight of <hi>Helmonts</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that indeed is little or none as I conceive, for firſt he doth not any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that continuation of his virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earth from the Center to the ſuperficies of the earth, much leſs the vitality thereof: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly for the vitality of water he onely quotes a poeticall fiction: and thirdly for the ſpontaneous flowing of the ſea, it is noe more a demonſtrative reaſon for the vitality thereof, than the loadſtones attracting Iron a reaſon of the vitality of the ſame.</p>
               <p>7 Neither is it raiſ'd upon that account of condenſation, &amp; rarefaction, which the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Docter <hi>Flud,</hi> endeavours to demonſtrate by the experiment of his weather-glaſs. The air, &amp; water, ſaith he, fill up all the cavities of the world, ſo that in what hemiſpheare the air, by reaſon of cold is condenſed, there the waters are rarefied, and ſwell, as may be ſeen in the weather-glaſs, where the water is rarified, and raiſed higheſt, when the air is with cold moſt condenſed; as alſo in the ſwelling of ſprings in froſty-weather. Now although this his experiment of the aforeſaid glaſs doth prettily illuſtrate the buſines of condenſation, and rarefaction in cloſe veſſels, yet it doth not demonſtrate ſufficiently the raiſing of waters from the deep ſubterraneall channells to the ſuperficies of the earth, for it is apparent, as I have ſhewed in the former part of this chapter, that ſome ſprings ſwell more in ſummer than in winter; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109520:12"/>
if ſprings do riſe higher in time of froſt than in hot ſeaſons, it is onely either becauſe ſome ſubterraneall vapours, which could not evaporate by reaſon of the earth being conſtringed with cold, are condenſed into water, and ſo make for the preſent ſome ſmall addition to ſprings, or becauſe the ſubterraneall waters are rarified, and ſwell by that heat which is occaſioned through the aforeſaid binding of the earth, for we ſee by experience that ſprings are hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in froſty weather than in ſummer. And thirdly becauſe the water of that weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs if it were open at the top as the veins of fountains are, would not obſerve the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeaſon ſo, as to riſe or fall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, for that in a cloſe glaſs it ariſeth onely <hi>ad evitandum vacuum;</hi> and now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than nature ſhould ſuffer a <hi>vacuum</hi> by the airs being condenſed, vapours and fumes would proceed out of the earth, nay the next adjacent warm air would come in as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to prevent a <hi>vacuum,</hi> ſooner than wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the bowels of the earth could be rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which would not in an open glaſs be raiſed at all, though the weather were never ſo cold.</p>
               <p>By theſe ſeven negatives it appears how the waters in the earth do not aſcend, I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate how they do aſcend to the heads of Springs.</p>
               <p>It is abſurd to think (being the ſame which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf and his followers graunt)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109520:13"/>
that the waters ſhould not be elevated from the bottom of Caverns, to the heads of Springs after the ſame manner as water is elevated from the Sea to the midle region of the air. Now this elevation is done by the force of heat reſolving the water into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. And if ſo, why then may not the other be done after the ſame manner, <hi>viz:</hi> by heat: Neither is it any matter whether that heat be above, or beneath the waters, if ſo be it forceth them into vapours, and maketh them aſcend as high as is requiſite they ſhould. But it may be ſaid that the middle region of the air is very cold, and it is coldneſs that condenſeth vapours into water: but now the earth, through which theſe vapours paſs, is warm, as is agreed by moſt. To this I anſwer, that it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that there muſt be cold for the conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of vapours into water, it is ſufficient if there be a more remiſs degree of heat, as you may ſee in the head of an alembick, and the cover of a ſeething pot, the interior ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies thereof being full of drops, whileſt they themſelves are warm.</p>
               <p>Now for the making of a vapour of any liquid matter, heat is altogether, and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely neceſſary, according to the opinion of all, and for much vapour there is much heat, and a conſiderable proportion of humour required. But ſeeing abundance of water comes from the Sea into the bowels of the earth, the ſubterraneall heat, which muſt be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109520:13"/>
in like proportion, being the chiefeſt cauſe of the generations of Springs, is next, and diligently to be inquired into. Now that the earth is hot, it is known by daylie experience. And <hi>Lucilius Baldus</hi> ſaith, that the earth being newly digged is hot, &amp; ſmoketh, and that out of deep wells is drawn warm water, and eſpecially in winter ſeaſon by reaſon of the cold binding the earth, and keeping in the heat: but how this heat comes to be in the earth, he ſpeaks like a Stoick, and ſaith it is in it as naturally, as vitall heat is in animals. But this opinion is not ſo probable as that of the Peripateticks, who ſay that the earth is of it ſelf, and naturally cold, becauſe denſe and heavy, but hot accidentally onely.</p>
               <p>Now the great queſtion will be from whence this heat of the earth doth proceed.</p>
               <p>I will firſt ſhew from whence it doth not proceed, and thereby confute the opinion of ſome.</p>
               <p>1. It proceeds not from the Sun, as many imagine, ſuppoſing that all heat in the world comes from thence, and that the earth being beat upon by the ſun-beames, doth thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into it ſelf a certain heating vertue. But this is very improbable, ſeeing that they, that digg in the bowells of the earth, obſerve that the heating power of the Sun, although in moſt hot ſeaſons doth not penetrate the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth above ſix feet deep: do not we ſee how a thin wall, or boughs of trees in an arbour keep off the heat of the ſun, though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109520:14"/>
never ſo great? to ſay nothing of the earths being colder two feet deep in Summer than in Winter.</p>
               <p>2. It proceeds not from an antiperiſtaſis of the cold air in the ſuperficies of the earth, for this hath place no further than the heating power of the rayes came. Beſides the naturall cold of the ſolid, and denſe earth muſt of neceſſity have greater power to repell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, than the adventious of the ſoft, thin, and light air to force downwards the heat of the ſun, which, indeed in all reaſon ſhould, being generated but a little way within the earth of its own accord being very light aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend upward through the paſſage made by the Sun: and this we know that after a long Summers day, it is before the next morning almoſt vaniſhed though never ſo great, much leſs will it be preſerved till, and through the Winter. It muſt then of neceſſity be another kind of heat, &amp; it is ſuch, that towards the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the earth is colder, as being more remote from its original, or beginning, and is in Summer-time by reaſon of the Suns ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the earth, and making vent eaſily, expired, and is therefore leſs perceived, but in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters froſt is reſtrained from exhaling, and is condenſed, as may eaſily be perceived in deep wells</p>
               <p>Now to know from what principle this heat hath its original, or riſe, we muſt examine whence proceeds the heat in hot baths, for there the ſubterraneal heat offers it ſelf more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109520:14"/>
conſpicuous and apparent to our view.</p>
               <p>But concerning the original of the heat of ſubterraneal waters, there is as much doubt, as of the generation of thoſe waters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And therefore I ſhall in the firſt place endeavour to prove how heat doth not come, thereby confuting the opnion of ſome, and in the next place to ſhew which way it may proceed probably.</p>
               <p>1. It is not cauſed by the heat of the Sun, and that partly for the reaſons above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as alſo becauſe then, thoſe waters would be hotter in Summer-time, than in Winter.</p>
               <p>2. It is not from the agitation of winds in the channels of the fountains, for if ſo, then they being vented forth, the heat would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>3. It comes not from ſulphur, <hi>Calx viva,</hi> (as is the opinion of many learned, as <hi>Seneca.</hi> &amp;c.) and that becauſe neither doth ſulphur at all heat unleſs it be actually hot, nor <hi>Calx viva,</hi> unleſs whileſt it is diſſolving in water: to ſay nothing of that vaſt quantity, which would in a little time be reſolved, and the ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change that would be in hot ſprings.</p>
               <p>4. It proceeds not according to <hi>Doctour Jordens</hi> opinion, from the fermentation that is in the generation of metals, and minerals cauſed by the agent ſpirit acting upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient matter, and ſo producing an actuall heat (for <hi>ex motu fit Calor</hi> ſay all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)

which ſerves as an inſtrument to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this work of generation; For if it were ſo, then the heat in bathes would in time ceaſe, for he himſelf ſaith that this ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat continues no longer till the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them be finiſhed, which is done in ſome determinate time, but we ſee that the hot baths continue for ever. Neither doth it ſuffice that he ſaith that generations of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls are not terminated with one producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the mineral ſeed gathereth ſtrength by enlarging it ſelf, and ſo it continually proceeds to ſubdue more matter under its government, ſo as where once a generation is begun it continues many ages, and ſeldom gives over, as we ſee in the Iron mines of <hi>Illua,</hi> the tin mines in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the lead mines at <hi>Mendip,</hi> and the <hi>Peak,</hi> which do not onely ſtretch further in extent of ground, than hath been obſerved heretofore, but alſo are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſame ground, which hath been formerly wrought, I ſay his ſaying thus doth not ſuffice, for though it be ſo as I do not deny but it may, yet notwithſtanding he doth not ſay, that generation of metals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in one place, except any ground be digged firſt; and ſo ſpace and place left for new mattter to come, as is not in our baths, and ſo by conſequence the flowing of hot water would ceaſe in that place, where the ſaid generation is not continued; and if that generation be extended further yet ſo alſo and accordingly is the heat diminiſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109520:15"/>
it break forth continually in new places: but we ſee hot ſprings continue many years together in one place at a conſtant heat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if this opinion were true, then where we ſee metals, and minerals generated, there alſo muſt of neceſſity be hot baths, but we ſee it is not ſo. I ſhall now moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, how that crude metalline matter is before any the ſaid fermentation ſublimed from the central parts of the earth towards the ſuperficies thereof, if not by a ſubterraneall fire?</p>
               <p>All theſe being excluded, it remains now that we conſider of a ſubterraneal fire onely, for it ſeems impoſſible that ſo great, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a heat ſhould be cauſed, or preſerved by any other power whatſoever, than that of fire, and of this opinion was <hi>Empedocles</hi> an ancient Greek Philoſopher, and alſo <hi>Seneca,</hi> but both theſe differ amongſt themſelves as to the manner of the heats proceeding from this fire, and indeed from other Authours that ſeem to be more Anthentick. The one is of opinion that it is ſufficient if the fire be under the place, through which the waters run, and ſo like fire under a ſtill force up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by way of a vapour: the other that the heat proceeds from ſome occult remote burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paſſed through the veins, and fibres of the earth where it meets with the waters, and diſtill them up to the heads of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But <hi>Agricola</hi> excepts againſt theſe two ways as being very impropable; the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109520:16"/>
the earth, where the fire is, could not endure the fire ſo long, being of a calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; cumbuſtible nature: the ſecond, becauſe by this way ſuch a quantity of water could not be ſo heated as to be turned into a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour ſo ſuddenly, by ſo ſmall a degree of heat.</p>
               <p>There can therefore no other reaſon be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for theſe hot ſprings, than the fire which burns in the very cavities, and caverns of them, the cavities themſelves conſiſting of a Bituminous matter. For Bitumen, and theſe things which are made of it being kindled burn in water, by which alſo the ſaid fire is cheriſhed: This you may ſee in <hi>Naphtha,</hi> which is a kind of Bitumen, for if you put but a drop thereof into water, and put fire to it you will ſee it burn, and continue burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long, that you would wonder at it, which could not be unleſs it were fed by the moiſture of the water, which it did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and tranſmutes into its own nature; The like you may ſee in Champhir, and other kind of Bitumen. <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo affirms that theſe are ſome certain burnings in the earth, which ſometimes caſt out Bitumen, and are increaſed by raine. And <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſaith that in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Mutina</hi> is a ſhort plat of ground, out of which comes fire and ſmoke, and the ground is all like duſt, which if you kindle, you cannot quench again with water: ſo that theſe kind of fires are perpetual, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long laſting in waters. And hath it not been obſerved that a fiery Bituminous matter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109520:16"/>
doth ſometimes flow out of hot Springs? <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention that in the City <hi>Somo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſata</hi> of <hi>Comaganes</hi> a certain lake ſent forth burning mud: and <hi>Plato</hi> makes mention of the like concerning a Spring in <hi>Sicilia:</hi> And <hi>Agricola</hi> reports another upon his credit. <hi>Fallopius</hi> alſo ſaith that in many places where the earth is digged deep, there are aſhes, and calcined ſtones, which are the effects of fire, and that in the territories of <hi>Modena, Bolonia, Florence,</hi> and other places, as in <hi>Italy &amp;c,</hi> there are found Springs and ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces caſting out fire. But as to Springs, this happens onely where the bituminous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter is very near the Spring head, and as high, and where the veins are more open.</p>
               <p>Now then the manner of Springs being cauſed by this Bituminous fire is this, <hi>viz:</hi> Seeing art doth for the moſt part imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the thing is even the ſame in a hot Spring, as in a diſtilling veſſell, or a ſeething pot covered with a lid; onely there is this difference, that to the bottom of theſe the fire is put on the out ſide, but here the fire is within the cavern it ſelf through which the water paſſeth, and that either lying in the bottom, or ſticking to the ſides thereof. As therefore in theſe artificial veſſels the water being by the heat of fire reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vapour is forced upwards to the covers or heads thereof, where by reaſon of ſome leſs degree of heat it is condenſed into drops, and returns to its ſelf, and into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109520:17"/>
again: So even after the ſame manner water in the caverns of the earth being heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bituminous fire, with which it is mixed, is by the heat thereof forced into a great quantity of vapours, which aſcending through the cranines, veins, and fibres of the earth being there for the greateſt part turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into water, doth with the reſt of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour yet very hot break forth in fountains <hi>viz:</hi> very hot, and very full of ſpirit, ſo that it ſeems to boyle, if the fountains be near to the caverns, or onely warm, if more remote. And as theſe Springs differ in their heat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nearneſs, or remoteneſs to their fire, ſo alſo in their Bituminous odour? and taſt. For as in diſtilled waters their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma</hi> vaniſheth in length of time, ſo in theſe in length of courſe: So that theſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which are very remote from this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous fire, are neither, hot, nor have any Bituminous odour. And as by this natural diſtillation water is the beſt way procolated from its Sea ſaltneſs; ſo alſo doth it become thereby leſs obnoxious to putrefaction: For we know that diſtilled waters laſt longeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> It may be objected, that if the matter preſerving this fire were Bitumen, then it would follow, that almoſt the whole world ſhould be Bitumen, becauſe ever ſince, and before the memory of man theſe hot baths were, and are like to continue for ever, and therefore there muſt be that element for ever which muſt preſerve that fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:109520:17"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It doth not follow that there muſt at preſent be ſo much Bitumen as will maintain the fire ſo long, for it is perpetually genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as long as there ſhall be ſic city, and humidity in the earth, there will be Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men generated: And do not we ſee that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are generated a new in the ſame places, out of which they have formerly been digg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Witneſs the profit which <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſaith the Duke of Florence hath by it; and the teſtimony of learned <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> who ſaith that there have been metals found in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains where formerly there have been none. If ſo, then much more may ſulphur and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen be generated a new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> If it ſhould be granted that Bitumen is generated a new, yet, if that were the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fire, the fire would change its places, becauſe the Bitumen is conſumed one part after another, and ſo by conſequence the baths would not be ſo equally hot as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the fire being by this means more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the fountains</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The flame is fed two ways, either when the flame follows the matter, as when the fire burns wood, or when the matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the flame, as in a lamp, in which the oyle follows the flame, not the flame the oyle; and ſo it is in the earth, and therefore the fire is always in one place. Neither doth that withſtand it, which we ſee by experience in ſulphur which is burnt part after part, the fire following of it: for you muſt know that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109520:18"/>
in the earth where there is a great heat, the Bitumen and Sulphur are melted, and by this means follow the flame, as I ſaid before of Oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> If Bitumen feed the fire of theſe baths, then the waters thereof would have the odour, taſt, and colour of Bitumen; but it appears that they have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Though all baths are heated by Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet ſome immediatly, as thoſe which do paſs through the place where it burns, &amp; theſe onely have the taſt, and odour of the ſame: and ſome mediately, as thoſe that paſs through places, as rocks, &amp;c. heated by Bitumen, burning under them, as was the opinion of <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> Neither do I by this diſtinction contradict what I ſaid before, concerning the waters being diſtilled up by that fire onely which burned in the caverns, and veins of the earth, through which they paſs: for in this place I ſpeak onely of the waters being heated, this mediate heat not being ſufficient to diſtill them to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> It is very improbable that any ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal fire can burn within the bowels of the earth by reaſon of the want of air, as we ſee in cupping glaſſes, where as ſoon as they are applyed, the fire goeth out; beſides the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapours would recoil and choak the fire, for there are few, or no vents and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is not any ſuch great want of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109520:18"/>
air in the earth, nay there is ſuch a plenty of it there, that many learned Philoſophers were, nay, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf of opinion, that all Springs were generated of ſubterraneal air.</p>
               <p>2. Air is not the aliment of fire, for ſaith the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De vita &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. Flamma non eſt aer accenſus,</hi> flame is not kindled air; nay, but unctuous vapours, which ariſe from the matter that is burnt, ſo that whereas without air fire goeth out, and is extinguiſhed, the reaſon is, becauſe the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous vapours wanting evaporation, do recoil upon the fire, and choak it. Now this Bituminous fire is not, being of a ſulphureous nature, very fuliginous, and beſides what ſmoak or ſumes or vapours there come from it are ſubtile, and penetrating, and either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate through the ſuperficies of the earth inſenſibly, or incorporate themſelves with ſome ſutable ſubject that is in the earth, or els are of themſelves condenſed into ſome unctuous matter adhearing to the ſides of the caverns into which they are elevated. So that according to the fuliginouſneſs of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours more or leſs recoiling, the fire is more or leſs choaked. Nay if we will believe <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> there have been burning Lamps cloſely ſhut up in glaſſes for fiftheen hundred years together in old ſepulchres; Now they burnt without air, &amp; were not extinguiſhed by reaſon the aliment of it was a Naphtha, or Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matter, which was ſo pure that it bred no fuliginous vapours to choake the fire thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:109520:19"/>3. Where this fire is very great, there is a great vent, and exhalation, but where but little, little is the vent, and inſenſible. And in moſt places the fire is not great extenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but intenſively, becauſe it is kept within a narrow compaſs, as in ſmall caverns and veins of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How comes this Bitumen to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It is agreed by all that are of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Bitumen is the matter of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal fire, that hot and dry exhalations in the bowels of the earth being ſhut up, and not finding any place to break forth, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, attenuated, rarified, and ſo inflamed, and being inflamed kindle the Bitumen.</p>
               <p>Now laſtly let no man wonder that there ſhould be ſo great a force of fire conteined in the earth as to be ſufficient for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſo many Springs that flow from thence daylie, ſeeing <hi>Pliny</hi> and many other Philoſophers wonder ſo much on the other ſide, when they conſidered of the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal fire, and brake forth into an exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, it is the greateſt of all miracles that all things are not every day burnt up. And cannot the burnings of the <hi>Aetnean, Viſuvian, Nymphean</hi> mountains convince us a little of this? But for the further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this opinion, let us a little conſider whence the winds proceed, and what they are. And are they not a hot and dry exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Now that this proceeds from, and out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109520:19"/>
of the earth, moſt agree: and that it entered not firſt into the earth is very probable: For how can a hot, dry, light exhalation, whoſe nature, and property is to aſcend, deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth in ſuch a quantity, as to cauſe ſuch great and laſting winds, as many times happen? It muſt therefore be in the earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally, and be ſtirred up by ſome great heat in the ſame. And what ſhall we think of the dry exhalation or ſpirit which is ſhut up in the caverns of the earth in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and endeavouring to break forth through obſtructed paſſages cauſeth great earth-quakes whereby Cities, Towns, and Countries have been overthrown, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe dreadfull noyſes ſometimes in the bowels of the earth? Whence I ſay theſe great exhalations (I ſay great, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that ſome little quantity of them may be cauſed by certain fermentations in the earth) ſhould be raiſed, if not from ſome great heat of fire within the earth, never any one yet could rationally determine.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Caeſius</hi> affirms that at a cerain village called <hi>Tripergulus</hi> about an hundred and twenty years ſince after fiftteen dayes earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake the earth opened, and winds, ſmoak, and very great fires brake forth out of the ſame, alſo pumice-ſtones, and abundance of aſhes, in ſo much as they made a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and about that place were many hot Springs. Alſo in <hi>Apulia</hi> is a hot bath called <hi>Tribulus,</hi> where there is abundance of aſhes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109520:20"/>
and calcined ſtones; and about the lake <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus</hi> and <hi>Avernus</hi> are the ſame.</p>
               <p>But if any ſhould yet doubt that winds proceed from the earth or from the occult fires of the earth, I ſhall make it yet further to appear by propounding to their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſome obſervations concerning the Sea. For it is obſerved that wind doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Sea, after a more apparent, and violent manner, than from the land, and that more certain ſignes of an enſueing wind are taken from the Sea, than from the land. For when a calme Sea makes a murmuring noyſe within it ſelf, it ſignifies that then the exhalations, which is the matter of the wind are riſing out of the earth, and bottom of the Sea; and this the fiſhes perceiving, and being affraid of it, eſpecially Dolphins, play above the water, and the Sea-urchins faſten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to rocks: the Sea a little ſwelling ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the exhalation is endeavouring a vent; then boyling ſheweth that it hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated to the ſuperficies, but as yet in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quantity: but then the eruptious of the exhalations following upon the waters mounted up aloft, make wind, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; ſuch as Marriners have often experience of, when as they perceive that the wind blows from no other place, but ariſeth at themſelves. Now why waves or billows ſhould preceed wind, let any man if he can give any other reaſon.</p>
               <p>Alſo I have been informed by ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109520:20"/>
that a little before a great tempeſt there is ſeen a great quantity of an unctuous ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter floating on the top of the Sea, and that this is an infallible ſigne of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſtorme. The reaſon of this is becauſe wind breaking forth out of the earth, forceth up with it ſelf that Bituminous matter from the place where it ſelf was generated.</p>
               <p>But now why winds ſhould ariſe from the Sea more apparently than from the land, is becauſe there is more plenty of fire in the gulfes of the Sea, for there it hath more ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or fewel, <hi>viz.</hi> Water, which as I ſaid before, is the aliment of that Bituminous fire. And whence are thoſe great mountains of ſtones and minerals, and thoſe Iſlands, which do ſometimes ariſe up anew from the Sea, but from a ſubterraneal fire, which forceth them up from thence (according to the judgement of learned <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced <hi>Erker</hi>) and thoſe chaſmes, and gapings of the Sea?</p>
               <p>Much more might be alleadged for the confirmation of this opinion, as the manner of the generation of minerals, and metals and many ſuch like ſubterraneal operations, which can not rationally be aſcribed to any other cauſe, than fire within the earth; but all the premiſes being ſeriouſly weighed, &amp; impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, I ſuppoſe there are but few but will conclude, that as all Springs proceed from the Sea through ſubterraneal channels and caverns, ſo alſo are diſtilled up to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109520:21"/>
heads of Fountains by a ſubterraneal bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fire. And as for thoſe that are not yet ſatisfied let them conſult with the treatiſe of our late, and learned Countryman <hi>Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lydyat,</hi> entituled <hi>Diſquiſitio phyſiologica de origine fontium,</hi> and there they ſhall find this opinion rationally diſcuſſed, and ſolidly confirmed: but if yet they ſhall be left vnſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, let them produce a more rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any other opinion, that will hold water in all reſpects better than this of mine doth, and I ſhall thanke him and embrace it.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the original of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in general, I ſhall now proceed to treat of the nature of Springs in particular.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the nature, and vertues of ſimple Waters.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I It will be neceſſary for the better conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature, and vertue of mineral waters in particular, to ſpeak ſomething of the nature, and virtues of water in generall, or of ſimple water, which is an element, as ſaith <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> moſt heavy, full of unctuous flegme, and is more worthy in its kind than the earth; it is without volatile, but within fixed; cold and moiſt, attempered by air. It is the Sperm of the world, in which the ſeed of all things is preſerved, and it is the keeper of every thing. It is called by the ancients <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Thales</hi> as ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called one and the ſame water the beginning of all things. <hi>Empedocles</hi> alſo believed that of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were all things made. <hi>Hippon</hi> alſo ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called it the ſoul of things, as if it were the life of them, which made <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſay that water and fire were the principles of life, and eſpecially water, for ſaith he, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny animals may want fire, but none can well live without water. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> affirms that water is the matter of all things. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109520:25"/>
if water were accurately anotamized you ſhould clearly ſee that both vegetables, minerals and animals are generated of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of this I have treated more largely elſs where: I ſhall not now ſtand to repeat, eſpecially ſince my purpoſe here is chiefly to ſpeak of the medicinal virtues of water.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt know that water is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, for either it is ſimple or mineral, which we more uſually call medicinal. Water is called ſimple, not according to its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to our ſenſe, or being compared with that which is mineral, and of this there are five kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> rain, fountain, pit, river, and ſtanding water.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here ſtand to prove whether or no water be nutritive, or be onely a <hi>vehiculum</hi> of aliments, as <hi>Galen</hi> would have it, becauſe in another treatiſe I have cleerly ſhewed how vegetables, animals and minerals are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, and increaſed by water, which hath ſuch ſtrange diſſimilary, or heterogeneal parts as can ſcarce be believed by thoſe who never ſaw the ſpagyrical anatomy thereof, or curiouſly examined the production of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things. I ſhall inſiſt onely upon the medicinal uſe thereof, as being adminiſtred either to prevent or cure the diſtempers of the body.</p>
            <p>Simple water which cooles, and moiſtens, is either taken inwardly, or uſed outwardly.</p>
            <p>It is taken inwardly either warm, or cold.</p>
            <p>The vertues of warme-water taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109520:25"/>
are theſe, which follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It doth by reaſon of its warmth cauſe nauſeouſeneſs, and it is drank in a greater quantity to cauſe vomiting in head-ach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from drunkenneſs, and in any other ilneſs of ſtomack; but with this caution, that they that have very cold, weak and laxated ſtomacks muſt abſtain from this kind of vomit, becauſe warm water doth moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten very much, and ſo by conſequence would laxate tht ſtomack more than it was before. Alſo it is not to be adminiſtred to thoſe that are accuſtomed to drinking of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for them it will not move to vomit, but remain in the body, and weaken the veſſels upon the aforeſaid account of its extream moiſtening.</p>
            <p>2. It allayes ſharp, acid, and gnawing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and cureth ſuch ſymptoms as proceed from thence, as ſaith <hi>Galen;</hi> alſo it repreſſeth the ebullition of choller, and helps the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the throat, and mouth cauſed thereby as ſaith <hi>Aetius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It cures the inflammation of the reins by altering of them, if it be taken before meals.</p>
            <p>Note that if warm water be given to cauſe vomiting, it muſt be adminiſtered to the quantity of a pint or two, or of as much as will be ſufficient thereunto. But if it be uſed for qualification it muſt be taken to the quantity of a cup onely, which may not cauſe nauſeouſnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:109520:26"/>The uſe and vertues of cold water are theſe <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It conduceth to long life in regard it condenſeth the ſpirits ſaith the <hi>Lord Virulam.</hi> And indeed water was the uſual drink of the ancients who lived long.</p>
            <p>2. It repels by reaſon of its coldneſs, and is thefore effectual againſt divers diſtempers; it forceth crudities out of the ſtomack, and as ſaith <hi>Aetius,</hi> promotes the operation of any medicine that is taken, and works not: beſides it ſuppreſſeth the fuming of vapours to the head as ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and <hi>Meſues,</hi> and being drunk at bed-time cauſeth quiet reſt, as ſaith the <hi>Lord Virulam</hi> in his learned treatiſe <hi>de vita, et morte,</hi> by ſuppreſſing the aſcent of vapours to the head.</p>
            <p>3. It allayes extream hot diſtempers. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in any particular part, as in the ſtomack, liver &amp;c. or in the whole body, as in continual, and burning feavers. It is upon this account commended by <hi>Galen</hi> againſt an inward <hi>Eriſipelas.</hi> I know ſome that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, eſpecially rain water, as a great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret againſt ulcers of the reins.</p>
            <p>Note that cold water is prohibited from a cold temper either of the whole, or of principal parts, alſo from old age, becauſe it is very feeble, and from child-hood becauſe it is ſubject to convulſions as ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> and from a thin habit of body extenuated by reaſon of ſcarcity of bloud, which is a great, and the principal ſafeguard againſt cold
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109520:26"/>
things. Winter alſo, and a cold, craſs ſlimy morbifick, or a hot impact matter, as alſo great obſtructions of the veſſels, and cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tumours forbid the uſe of cold water.</p>
            <p>As for the time when cold water is to be drank, note that it is never to be adminiſtred in feavers, unleſs concoction do firſt appear, as ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> for although it be a remedy for a feaver as it is a feaver, yet it is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the humours which cauſe a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as it evacuates them by Urine ſtool, or ſweat. But theſe cannot ſafely be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled before they be concocted. Now we muſt not notwithſtanding expect a perfect and full concoction, but it will ſuffice if it be moderate and in good part performed, for elſe there will be a danger of the feavers turning into a Hectick. Alſo it muſt not be taken on the critical day, for then ſaith <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> we muſt not move the humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not certainly know which way nature will attempt an evacuation. But for a more particular time of the feaver it is to be taken moſt conveniently in the fit, or in the very hour of the ebullition of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, becauſe then the inward parts do burn moſt, and need moſt then to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, beſides coldneſs is then leaſt offenſive; becauſe the greatneſs of the heat is a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard againſt the offenſiveneſs thereof.</p>
            <p>As for the quantity to be drunke, note that if the repelling, or ſuppreſſing vertue thereof be required, it is to be taken to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109520:27"/>
quantity of half a pint, more or leſs as things may be conſidered. But if the altering or allaying vertue, as in a feaver, then it is to be taken in ſuch a quantity as may be drunk at one breath, or as much at the ſick party needs for ſatisfaction, or elſs can well bear. But the greatneſs of the diſtemper, the age, time of the year, cuſtome, and ſtrength is alſo to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>But it will be demanded which is the beſt water, and moſt wholſome; and for anſwer hereunto, I ſay that is the beſt which is void of taſte or odour, is clear, pure, moſt light, is ſoon heated, and ſoon cooled, and in which fleſh is ſooneſt boyled, and in particular as ſaith <hi>Galen</hi> rain water is the beſt, but yet not any, but ſuch which falls in Summer-time when the heaven is in great part ſerene, and eſpecially with thunder, being that which conſiſts of thinner vapours, elevated and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the heat of the Sun and lightning. And next to this is that pit water, which flows from the next fountain, or river eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially through a ſandy earth, becauſe if the ſaid earth partake of no other quality, it is percolated, made more thin, and becomes more depurated than other water. And in defect of theſe two, fountain and river wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be uſed, being indeed very good and wholſome, and indeed are by many account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt: but the worſt of all is ſtanding water as lakes, pooles. Now in caſe there can be got no good water, but onely what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109520:27"/>
is bad, than <hi>Galen</hi> would have that to be boyled, and cooled again, and ſo to be uſed. Thus much of the uſe and vertues of cold, and warm water adminiſtred in wardly.</p>
            <p>It remaines now that I ſpeak two or three words of the external uſe of water both warm and cold, and of the effects thereof. Now water is uſed outwardly ſaith <hi>Julius Caeſar Claudinus</hi> firſt by way of <hi>Balneum,</hi> or bathing the whole body, ſecondly by way of <hi>inſeſsus</hi> or ſitting in water up to the navel thirdly by way of aſperſion or affuſion (i. e.) ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or pouring on, fourthly by way of <hi>ſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidium,</hi> dropping or diſtilling. Fiſtly by way of fomentation, and laſtly by way of lotion or waſhing any part.</p>
            <p>Bathes are either hot, or cold.</p>
            <p>Cold Bathes were by ancient and modern Philoſophers, and Phyſitians ordeined for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uſes. Many uſed them onely by way of exerciſe as for ſwimming in them, which the <hi>Lord Verulam</hi> in his learned treatiſe <hi>de vitâ &amp; morte</hi> reckons up as one of thoſe robuſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, as he calls them, which makes the fleſh hard, and compact, conducing to long life.</p>
            <p>They are uſed alſo for the aſtringing of the body, and condenſing the ſame, alſo as ſaith the a foreſaid <hi>Learned Vicount</hi> for the cloſing of the pores of the body that are too open, whereby the hot air excluded from preying upon the body, beſides they unite the <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> corroborating the ſame by an <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſtaſis</hi> wherby by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence it doth beget
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109520:28"/>

            <p>Note that the uſe of cold baths is not for youths, becauſe they hinder their growth, nor for old men, becauſe that little heat which they have is thereby ſuffocated, nor for cold and thin women which have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bodies, becauſe the cold penetrates too much into their ſolide parts, nor to any that be ſick, unles they be of ſtrong natures (for as cold baths doe wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully corroborate the <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> or naturall heat if it be ſtrong, ſo doe they on the contrary overcome it if it be weak) and the humours appeare to be concocted and fit for evacuation, and no principal part, or bones, nerves, brain ill affected, and the body free from convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Note alſo that when the intenſion is to be formed by cooling onely, and there is no need of moiſtening, then as ſaith the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid authour of the <hi>Hiſtory of life and death,</hi> the body is to be annointed with oyle, with ſpiſſaments or thickeners that the quality
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109520:28"/>
onely of the cooler be received, and not the ſubſtance. Yet we muſt in ſuch caſes have a care that the pores of the body be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtopt too much, for when any extrinſecal cold obſtructs the body too much, it is ſo far from cooling it, that it ſtirs up the heat the more, by ſuppreſſing perſpirations.</p>
            <p>Baths alſo of hot or heated water are of great uſe; but before I declare the uſes and effects thereof, wee muſt conſider that they are of three ſorts, for either they are tepid, (i. e.) Luke-warm, or moderatly hot, or very hot water.</p>
            <p>A Bath that is very hot dryes rather than moiſtens, contracts the skin, condenſeth the pores thereof, ſo that neither any external humidity can be received in, or internal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities expelled forth thereby. So that there is no great uſe thereof, onely it ſerves for the contracting of the skin where it needs contraction, &amp; where the uſe of a cold Bath may not be admitted ſafely for that intenſion.</p>
            <p>A Bath that is moderately hot ſerves for divers uſes, and is very neceſſary in ſeveral caſes.</p>
            <p>It draws from remote internal parts, and cauſeth hot humours to be digeſted into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and openeth the pores, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive humours, and vapours may be evacuated by ſweat, and perſpirations. It moiſteneth a dry body and therefore, is very good in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid and hectick feaver, in the itch, and ſcab, &amp;c. attracts nouriſhment to the extreame
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109520:29"/>
parts, where before by reaſon of ſome defect it came not, allayeth the ſharpnes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the habit of the body, and upon all theſe accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſerves as effectually, if not more, for moſt intenſions, that almoſt any Phyſick is preſcribed for. I ſhall onely add to theſe the great vertues that <hi>Columella</hi> attributes to Baths of hot water; for ſaith he, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct our crudities by the uſe of Baths. And for this end they were much uſed by the ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> who uſed a crude kind of dyet as of hearbs, and raw fruits, which bred crude humours in their bodies, and therefore needed ſome ſuch help to concoct them, and by this meanes they became very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and of delicate bodies. But they muſt be uſed for the concocting of crudities with this caution, <hi>viz.</hi> that there be no feaver pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for then inſteed of concocting of them they will become by being ſtirred, more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, and by being attracted to the habit of the body, as of neceſſity they muſt by the uſe of hot Baths, obſtruct the pores thereof, to the increaſing of the feaver; and in caſe of a feaver, hot Baths muſt be uſed in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof as when concoction appeares, and after purging of the groſſe humours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the firſt veſſels, but in other caſes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commends Bathing as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to purgations.</p>
            <p>A tepid Bath cools as well as heats, and heats as well as cools, and ſerves for the ſame uſes as a hot Bath doth but more remiſly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:109520:29"/>Note that if the patient that is bathing be ſubject to faint, he muſt hold cold water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in his mouth, and drink ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non a draught of cold beer or water.</p>
            <p>I might here preſcribe many rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for bathing, or for the ordering of ones ſelf before, in, and after bathing, but it was not my purpoſe to make a full, and large diſcourſe of this ſubject, onely to touch it by the way, referring thoſe that ſtand in need of bathing to their skilful Phyſitians for their directions,</p>
            <p>To this kind of bathing, <hi>viz.</hi> with hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I might add the manner of bathing by vapour, which is when a veſſel of ſeething water cloſe covered hath proceeding from it a long pipe, which is faſtened into a bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tub, into which the hot vapours come upon the patient there ſitting: but of this I have treated more largely in another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and will not now repeat.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way of uſing water outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called inſeſſion or ſitting in water up to the navel, and this is uſed when the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body cannot bear a bathing of the whole body, and particularly it is made uſe of, if warm, for laxating, &amp; mollifying the hardneſs of the belly, for provoking of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the mitigating of the pains of the ſtone, and chollick, &amp;c, and if cold, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the ſame intenſions for the lower part of the body, as a cold <hi>Balnenm</hi> doth for the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:109520:30"/>The four laſt ways of uſing water out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as aſperſion (i. e.) ſprinkling, or affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Stillicidum</hi> (i. e.) dropping or diſtilling, fomenting, and lotion reſpect parts, with the like operations upon them (although with ſome kind of variety of application) as baths do the whole body. They that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more theſe external uſes of cold and hot water, let them read <hi>Claudinus</hi> his treatiſe <hi>de Ingreſſu ad Infirmos,</hi> and <hi>Galen de tuenda Sanitate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note that that water is beſt for outward uſes which will bear ſope beſt, and make the greateſt ſome therewith.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the vertues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and outward uſe of ſimple water, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot or cold, and that in brief, for I would not dwell upon this ſubject, as not being the chiefeſt that I propounded to my ſelf to diſcourſe of in this treatiſe, taking it in one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way and for order ſake, and the better illuſtrating of that which follows, and is principally to be here treated of.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the ſeveral kinds of mixtures in mineral waters.</head>
            <p>IT is graunted by all that there is ſome kind of mixture in all mineral waters: &amp; indeed there are four kinds of things that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109520:30"/>
mixed with theſe kinds of waters, <hi>viz.</hi> Metals, Minerals, Stones, and Earths; and of ſome of theſe, 1. Sometimes the vapours onely are mixed, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as ariſe from the fermentation, and diſſolution of Metals, and Minerals, and are mixed with the water that paſſeth by them through the veins of the earth. And concerning this, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the vapours of Minerals keep the taſt, and odour of the Minerals from whence they proceed: but of this more fully in the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Spaw.</hi> 2. Sometimes the juice onely of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Whileſt they are in <hi>principiis ſolutis.</hi> And indeed gold can be mixed with waters no otherwiſe, becauſe it cannot be corroded with the acid ſpirits of the earth, as other Metals can, having in it ſelf when concocted, and perfected none of that eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine acid ſalt, which a ſubterraneal aciditie will reſolve and ſet at liberty to corrode the Metal with which it is <hi>per minima</hi> together with the embrionated Sulphur of the ſame conjoyned. 3. Sometimes the ſubſtances, and that after a threefold manner, for ſome are mixed with water ſo very cloſe together, that from the mixture of them there reſults but one forme, neither will they ever or ſcarcely be ſeperated, and ſuch are thoſe that will not vapour away faſter than the water it ſelf is evaporated, neither remaines in the bottom, but is all evaporated with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some are mixed confuſedly, Such as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide or fall to the bottom, if the water be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109520:31"/>
put into any veſſel, that it may ſtand ſtill. And laſtly ſome are mixed in a way betwixt both, as ſalt; for ſalt and the water continue to be in one and the ſame form, but yet the ſalt will ſubſide and remain in the bottom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evaporation of the water.</p>
            <p>Now the cauſe of this variety of mixtion is either the difference of the heat that ſhould unite, or of their abode together, or elſe of the aptneſs of the things, to be mixed, for mixtion.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I ſhall proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late where theſe Springs, and waters are found, which are impregnated with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid four kinds of Ingredients.</p>

            <p>IN the firſt place I ſhall give a deſcription of Vitriol (in which ſhall be declared the cauſes thereof) and explain the terms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, difficult and not obvious to every ones apprehenſion, as being not uſual in common natural Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Vitrial therefore is but an eſurine acid Salt, of the embrionated Sulphur of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Iron, which attracting an acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from air, or water is thereby opened, and reſolved, and then corrodes the parts of the ſaid metals, with which it is connate, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of which compound, conſiſting of Pure Metal? and ſuperfluos Sulphur, and Salt, being thus opened is diſſolved in water paſſing through the veins thereof: And this water thus impregnated is boiled to a Vitrial.</p>
            <p>The difficult terms hereof I thus explain.</p>
            <p>1. By embrionated Sulphur I underſtand
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109520:32"/>
a ſuperfluous ſulphur, which is not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Metals, but connate onely with them for the embrional conſervation of them, and after the perfection of the Metal is caſt off in part by nature, and more fully by the refiners fire. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> explaines it by a familiar example of a Nut. A Nut ſaith he <hi>per ſe</hi> is onely the kernel, which is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by it ſelf, but together with the ſhell, and ſhales, which are ſuperfluous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſerve onely for the embrional conſervation of the Nut, that is., of it whileſt it is in an <hi>Embrio</hi> or imperfect. And here by the way note that as every Mineral, Metal, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable hath its diſtinct <hi>Sulphur Embrionatum,</hi> ſo every <hi>Sulphur Embrionatum</hi> is diſtinct from the true genuine thing generated, with which it is connate, as much as a form, eſſence, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and corporality differ the one from the other, and is but an impurity of its <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> and as it were as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it, the ſecundine thereof.</p>
            <p>2. By eſurine ſalt I underſtand in this place (not the acid ſpirit of air, water, and ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal ſulphurious vapours, not yet coagulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſpecificated, which alſo are ſometimes called an acid or eſurine ſalt, but) a certain acid vapour applicable to all Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and connate with them in their <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis ſolutis,</hi> and <hi>Embrioes,</hi> and eſpecially to thoſe that abound with ſulphur, as Iron, and Copper, and with them congealed into a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line principle, giving conſiſtency to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:109520:33"/>
as ſulphur doth coagulation, and is by Hel-mont for want of another name called the <hi>eſurine ſalt of an embrionated ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi> (But any one may call it what he pleaſe, if ſo be he underſtand it) and is reſolved, and unlooſed by an acid ſpirit conteined in air, and water, which ſpirit is indeed the ſeed of ſalt (for in them <hi>viz</hi> in air and water, are the ſeeds of all things, in the former as being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imagined, as ſaith <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> as in the male, and in the latter, as being afterward by a circulative motion caſt forth into the ſame as into their ſperm (for he makes a ſubtile diſtinction betwixt ſeed, and ſperm) wherein they are conſerved, taking not upon them the nature of any ſpecifical ſalt, untill they meet with ſome corporeal principles that are conſentaneous to them) and is, when it meets with any ſaline corporeal principle in its reſolving of it coagulated together with the ſame into a diſtinct ſpecies of ſalt, <hi>viz:</hi> into this or that according to the nature of the compoſitum; where this ſolution, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation is made.</p>
            <p>I ſhall for the better illuſtration of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of ſalts, briefly ſhew how two of the four ſaid ſalts, <hi>viz.</hi> Nitre and vitrial are made artificially, becauſe this artificial proceſs is performed in imitation of the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them.</p>
            <p>1. The proceſs therefore of making nitre artificially is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Sprinkle diſtilled vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger upon fat earth, as fullers earth, bole,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109520:33"/>
marle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beaten ſmall, and let it ſtand for a few dayes in a cold place, and you will ſee pure nitre produced from thence. Or take any one of the aforeſaid earths, and beat it ſmall, and ſet it in a cold moiſt place for ſome weeks, and you will ſee the ſame effect. Now this latter way ſeems as much natural as arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and indeed it is juſt in imitation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for we ſee that any fat earth, if it be covered from rain, and the Sun, ſo as it ſpendeth not its ſtrength in producing of hearbs and plants, breedeth plenty of nitre.</p>
            <p>Now note that in theſe kinds of fat earths there is at firſt obſerved no nitrous taſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there from thence be extracted any nitre, but after they have continued a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time in the cold air, do by a certain magnetick power of a nitrous principle, or ſaline unctuoſity which is in them, attract an acidity, or rather acid ſpirit, which opens the bodies of thoſe fat earths, and reſolves the ſaid ſaline unctuoſity, and is therewith coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, (for the ſolution of the one, is the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the other) and after this manner is the nativity of nitre.</p>
            <p>2. The proceſs of making artificial Vitrial is manifold, I ſhall ſpeak of onely two, and they are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Caſt Sulphur into melted Copper, and there let it burn till it ceaſe to burn any more, then preſently caſt the melted Copper into rain-water, which will thereby become green. This do ſo often till all the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109520:34"/>
be diſſolved in the water: then evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the water, and you ſhall have a good Vitrial.</p>
            <p>Note that it is an acid ſpirit in the ſulphur, which opens and reſolves the eſurine Salt in the Copper, whereby the Copper it ſelf is corroded, and fit for diſſolution in the water.</p>
            <p>2. Take Copperas ſtone, which is a certain Sulphurious glittering Marcaſite, break to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a good quantity of them, and lay them in air, and rain, upon ſticks over wooden veſſels, and in a certain time the ſtones will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by an acid ſpirit in the air, and water, and waſhed down into the ſaid veſſel with the rain-water, which will thereby become green, and yield upon evaporation a good green Vitrial: and after this manner do we make our Vitrial, or Copperas in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let it not ſeem ſtrange to any one, that there is ſuch an acidity in water, and air; for whence elſe doth Iron, and Copper, being put into water, or ſtanding long in the air, eſpecially in a cold Cellar contract ſuch a ruſt as they do? Is not this ruſt from the aforeſaid acid ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> of the air and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reſolving the eruſine Salt in thoſe metals, and making it thereby more corroſive, and more powerfull to corrode part of the metals themſelves, with which it is mixed <hi>per Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> And will not this ruſt being boiled in rain-water yield a Vitrial?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome will object, and ſay, that this ruſt is cauſed not from the acidity, but onely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109520:34"/>
from the humidity of the air, and water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving thereby the ſaid eſurine Salt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This I will ſolve with a relation of two experiments, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Take the above named Copperas ſtones broken to pieces, weigh them exactly, and lay them in a cold moiſt place, (but ſo that no rain come at them to waſh away the Salt thereof, as it is reſolved by the acidity of the air,) and after ſome moneths they will, by a certain magnetical power, attract a certain ſaline humidity, and fall into a black pouder, which being well dried, and then weighed, will prove far more ponderous than before, which implies that there is an addition of ſomething elſe than a meer quality, <hi>viz.</hi> the humidity of air, and water.</p>
            <p>2. Take a pound of Salt of tartar, make it red hot, and weigh it exactly, then put upon it two pints of rain-water diſtilled, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, then put on more, and evaporate that alſo, and then make the Salt red hot again, and weigh it, and you ſhall find it far heavier than before, which is cauſed by the ſaid Salts attracting to it ſelf that occult acid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſpirit, which was in the water, and fixing of it into its own nature; and not by aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the water it ſelf, which will never be converted into Salt any otherwiſe than as it contains a ſaline acid ſpirit, which is the onely thing coagulable in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some again will object, although they do admit of this acid ſpirit in air, and water,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109520:35"/>
&amp; ſay that in caſe the ſaid acid ſpirit do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode and diſſolve the metals, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there is any ſuch eſurine Salt in thoſe metals, as diſtinct from the pure mercurial, or other Sulphureous part of them, but ſay that it corrodes onely the ſaid mercurial, and Sulphureous part thereof, as we ſee <hi>aqua fortis</hi> doth ſilver, and <hi>mercury,</hi> and <hi>aqua regia</hi> doth gold, and ſo becomes coagulated into a ſaline nature, and conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The ſaid acid ſpirit of the air, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can not corrode, or putrifie the pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline part of metals, for we ſee that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie is not corroded, and reduced into a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line nature thereby, and that gold doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ruſt, and that becauſe it is purified from all the ſaid acid ſaline principle, and is not at all corroded, but by an <hi>aqua regia;</hi> and ſilver contracts but little ruſt, and that according to the ſmall quantity there is in it of the ſaid Salt. And for the ſuperfluous embrionated Sulphur, that neither can be corroded by the ſaid acid ſpirit, any otherwiſe than it contains in it that eſurine Salt, for if we put pure Sulphur extracted from <hi>Sulpbur vivum</hi> into <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> it will not be corroded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, much leſs then by the aciditie of air, and water, nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith, that if woods, and cords be ſmeered over with an unctuous oyl, which he preſcribes to be made out of Sulphur, they will be preſerved from putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ever, though they continue in the air, water, or earth: and the truth is, nothing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109520:35"/>
can open and reſolve Sulphur but oyl, being of a like unctuous nature with' it, as I have oftentimes tried. There muſt therefore be another corporeal Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous, ſuitable, and ſaline nature, that is apt for to be corroded and reſolved, and to coagulate the ſaid ſpirit.</p>
            <p>3. Vitrial is made artificial after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi> Take an ounce of ſpirit of Sulphur, or vitrial, and put it into a gallon of rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, ſtir them well together, then put into this acid water half a pound of the filings of Iron, or Copper, and within a few hours the metal will attract the ſaid acid ſpirit to it ſelf, be diſſolved it ſelf thereby, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate that. This being done decant the water, and calcine the ſaid mixture in a crucible, and being poudered, put it into rain-water ſeething hot, ſtirring them together, and then all that being ſettled to the bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will ſettle, powr off the clear green water, and evaporate it, and you will have a pure Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial.</p>
            <p>Like unto this is the making of Vitrial, by ſprinkling a conſiderable quantity of diſtilled Vinegar upon the pouder of Steel, or Copper, and letting of them ſtand till the mixture grow very hot by fermentation, and be again cooled, and then putting it into rain-water ſeething hot, and proceeding as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going proceſs.</p>
            <p>Almoſt after the ſame manner is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe made, <hi>viz.</hi> by hanging plates of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109520:36"/>
Copper or Braſs over the hot vapours of Vinegar.</p>
            <p>Now theſe three proceſſes of making ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial vitrial being ſeriouſly conſidered, will clearly illuſtrate the nativity of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vitrial, which is as I conceive after this manner, <hi>viz:</hi> by an acid ſubterraneal ſpirit (whereof there is great quantity in ſome mines) corroding the veins of Iron, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Copper, which being thus reſolved, and opened are by the water that paſſeth through them, diſſolved, after which, this liquor is boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Vitrial; and thus is made the Vitrial in <hi>Danſick, Hungarie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Note that any of the ſaid Vitrials, if they be made out of Copper, whether natural, or artificial, being diſtilled in a forceing furnace, yield oyle, and ſpirit, and the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> thereof diſſolved in rain water yields a pure Vitrial, and the <hi>Colcothar</hi> that falls to the bottom of the ſaid water, yields upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers taſt moſt pure Copper like to very gold; as doth Verdigreaſe, the Metalline parts thereof being purified from their feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by means of the foreſaid corroſion and diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The nativity of Vitrial being thus promiſed, it will moſt evidently appear what are the true cauſes of Spaw water, <hi>viz.</hi> Of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline taſt, and odour. It will not now be a thing irrational to grant that all Spaw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters partake either of the corporeal, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parts of Vitrial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:109520:36"/>They that partake of the ſubſtance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial are ſuch, as when they are evaporated, leave behind them a Vitriol at the bottom, and ſuch are the <hi>Sevenir, Paubon,</hi> and <hi>Geronſter</hi> Springs, the two former of which <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaid, he carefully diſtilled, and found nothing in them but the Vitrial of Iron, and like to this was a certain Spring within two miles of <hi>Knareſborow,</hi> the water whereof I diſtilled, and found in the bottom a Vitrial of Iron.</p>
            <p>Moreover, betwixt theſe wells, which are impregnated with a corporeal Vitrial, there is a conſiderable difference; for ſome work upon the bowels moſtly, and by ſtool, if not ſometimes by vomit, and ſuch are they that contain in them much Vitrial, whether of Copper, Iron, or both mixed together, as <hi>Geronſter,</hi> and are more groſs and corpulent, and the operation of theſe is much after the ſame manner as that of ſteel, which for the moſt part doth, the firſt dayes it is taken, cauſe a nauſeouſneſs in the ſtomack, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away by ſtool all the time it is taken, and by reaſon of the harſhnes it hath, is ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to, or paſſeth through the veſſels of the ſecond concoction: But they that contain little of the ſubſtance, but more of the ſpirit as doth <hi>Serenir,</hi> do paſs the ſtomack, Liver, and other veſſels far ſooner, and with leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance than do the other. And they that partake of none of the ſubſtance, but onely of the ſpiritual part, or vertues, ſuch as the Spaw-well at <hi>Knareſborow,</hi> of which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109520:37"/>
in the next Chapter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are far more efficacious in many caſes, eſpecially where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate humours, and confirmed obſtructions betwixt the ſtomack, and Liver, are not the cauſes of the diſtempers, for in ſuch caſes, ſuch a Medicine muſt be adminiſtred, which way more ſtrong irritate theſe veſſels to eject thoſe obſtructing tartareous, and viſcous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or at leaſt diſſolve and attenuate them, thereby making them to yield to more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne purgatives.</p>
            <p>Note alſo that theſe waters may, the more they are impregnated with the ſaid corporeal ſubſtances, the further be carried without loſs of their ſtrength. The water of <hi>Sevenir</hi> is carried many miles, and into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys without loſs of its vertues, but that of <hi>Pauhon</hi> much further, and into further Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; we have it tranſported into <hi>England</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently. Now the water of the Spaw in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> cannot be carried near ſo far; but yet further than moſt believe, as I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now theſe differences, or varieties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnations ariſe either from the difference of the quantity of the acide ſpirit corrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the difference of the fruitfulneſs of the vein of Copper, or rather Iron corroded, or the greater or leſſer continuance of the courſe of the water already impregnated, through veins of the ſaid Metals, whereby it becomes long yet more impregnated, if the courſe be continued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109520:37"/>Note that the veins of the ſaid impure Metals contain in them more eſurine ſalt, and yield more natural ſpirits than they themſelves when melted, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate far more efficatious vertues than they do, I mean in many caſes.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Spaw-well near <hi>Knareſ-borow.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ABout a mile and a half from the ſaid Town, Weſt-ward, in a mooriſh, boggie ground, (within leſs than half a mile from which there is no conſiderable aſcent) ariſeth a Spring of a Vitrioline taſt and odour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling much thoſe ultramarine Spaws. The water of this Fountain ſpringeth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up from the ſandy bottom; and this is no otherwiſe than that water doth, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through pipes in the earth (ſerving for the conveying of water, from a Fountain to a houſe or Town) doth break the pipes if they be obſtructed, or force it ſelf through them, if already broken, upwards through the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the earth, and flows in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Spring. For in this place the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal veins, through which the water paſſeth, are either (if not there terminated) obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or too infirm to contain the water of the ſpring, paſſing forcibly through them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a vent where it can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:109520:38"/>As for the vitrioline, and Ironiſh taſt, and odour of this water, I need (in regard I have in the preceeding Chapter declared more at large the cauſes of all Spaws) ſpeak the leſs in this place. But for more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſatisfaction, the aforeſaid taſt and odour may be imputed, partly to thoſe vapours that proceed from the fermentation, that is in Iron, or Copper mines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>H. ab Heers,</hi> would have it to be, affirming, that vapours retain the taſt and odours of their minerals, and the water with which theſe vapours are mixed become thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, though in a more remiſs degree, with the ſame qualities: partly to the long abiding, or continuing of the water with the Iron, or Copper mine <hi>viz.</hi> in ſome great cavities in the midſt of the veins thereof, whereby it contracts their odour and taſt, as we ſee it doth in Iron, or Copper veſſels, if it ſtand long there, eſpecially if excited by heat, or acuated with any acidity, and as doth white wine ſtanding long with ſcales, or filings of ſteel, or iron: or partly to the water acuated with ſome ſubterraneal ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious acidity, and paſſing ſwiftly through ſome hungry barren vein of Iron, which it corrodes lightly reſolving thereby ſome of the ſpiritual, and ſubtile parts thereof one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which it becomes it ſelf impregnated with. And hence it acquires the nature of a Spaw-well.</p>
            <p>Now for the better underſtanding of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109520:38"/>
nature of this Spaw, I made divers experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, which are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. I diſtilled it, ſuppoſing that if I could draw off the mineral ſpirits by themſelves, I ſhould diſcover a great ſecret, very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for diſeaſed people, but the water, yea, the two firſt ſpoonfuls, which were diſtilled, and the reſt undiſtilled that remained, utterly loſt, both the taſt and odour, which they had before, neither would they become any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tinged with galls than common Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, although the water undiſtilled with the mixture of the pouder of galls, became as red as a well coloured Clarret wine. Now it is hard to conceive the true reaſon of this, eſpecially ſince I diſtilled it in a glaſs ſtill, and luted or cloſed up very carefully the joints thereof, ſo that ſpirit of wine could not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate out thereat. I impute it to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of thoſe ſpirits, which are ſo volatil that they are ſooner ſublimed than the water it ſelf, therefore becoming to be unbodied (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were incorporated with the water) and by conſequence wonderfull ſpiritual, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate even the glaſs it ſelf, or the lute, and I believe that neither glaſs or lute can hold them.</p>
            <p>2. I took two viol glaſſes, and put into them a juſt equal quantity of the Spaw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I put one of them into a skillet of warm water, and juſt took the cold off from it, than I put an equal quantity of the pouder of gals into each of thoſe two viols, and that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109520:39"/>
water which was cold received no deeper tincture than the other as I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>3. I filled two viol glaſſes with this water, and ſtopt one of them very cloſe with wax, and the other I ſtopt not at all, and at two dayes end they yielded a tincture with the pouder of gall, little leſs than that which is newly taken out of the well, but that leſs, which was left unſtopt. How much it will looſe this tincture by carrying far, I do not know; it were worth while to trie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be the better aſſured how much of its ſtrength is waſted, for according to the ſpending of its ſpirits the tincture fades.</p>
            <p>4. A glaſs of this water ſtood ſeven dayes cloſe ſtopt with wax, and than yielded a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with gall, like to ſmall beer.</p>
            <p>5. This water doth not coagulate milk as do the <hi>German</hi> Spaws, and another Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Spring in the ſame moor, which yieldeth a Vitrial of Iron upon evaporation as I ſaid before. Now the reaſon of this is not becauſe it is not acide enough, for it is far more acid than the water of the dropping Well, which coagulates milk, if it be boiled with it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the acidity thereof is not permanent, or fixed enough, but ſo volatile as to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate before the milk boils.</p>
            <p>6. This water kils Worms and Frogs, if they be put therein, and ſuch kinde of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as theſe.</p>
            <p>7. It being evaporated, leaves nothing at all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109520:39"/>
of Vitrial behind, but onely an inſipid pouder of a darkiſh colour, like unto which pouder will that blewiſh cream or skin, which ſwims upon the ſaid water after long ſtanding, be when it is dried. Now note that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid skin ſwimmeth upon all ſuch Mineral waters, and as ſaith <hi>H:</hi> ab <hi>Heers,</hi> being put upon the fire is inflamed, and yields a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous odour. It is alſo called by <hi>Hadrianus Mynſicht, Anima vitrioli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. I weighed this water, I think exactly to a grain, and it weighed neither heavier nor lighter than ſimple ſpring water.</p>
            <p>9. It is obſerved generally, and I tooke eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial notice of it, that it is almoſt an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſigne of an enſuing rain, when glaſſes filled with this water continue not clear, but are covered all over as it were with a miſt, contrary to what is obſerved in glaſſes full of ſimple common water. Now the reaſon of this I conceive is from the Mineral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirits giving, as nitre doth, activity to the coldneſs of the water, whereby the glaſſes themſelves become more cold, and ſo cold as eminently, and apparently to condenſe the humid vapours of the air, with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound before the rain.</p>
            <p>To theſe experiments, and obſervations I ſhall add this obſervation alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Spaw water is ſtrongeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Mineral ſpirits in Winters froſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the earth being the more bound up, and the ſaid ſpirits being thereby kept from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109520:40"/>
perſpiration: and weakeſt in rainy wet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon the water ſinks into the veins of the ſprings, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that lye neareſt to the ſuperficies of the earth, for it cannot ſink above ten feet deep though the rain be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much. Alſo this water is in Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſtronger in the morning than at noon, becauſe the coldneſs of the night doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bind the earth, and the heat of the Sun openeth the ſame, thereby making it the more eaſie for the Mineral ſpirits to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat out thereby.</p>
            <p>To prevent the inconveniencies of rain, it were to be wiſhed that there were a very deep trench (yet not ſo deep as to cut a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of the veins through which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſeth, if any ſhould lye within ſix, eight, or ten feet of the ſuperficies of the earth, as it is poſſible ſome may) made round the well, and bridges, made over ſome places of the ſame, for as by this means the rain would be carried away, ſo alſo the water in the boggie ground adjoyning to it, which may perhaps ſink into the veins of the ſpring, and corrupt the ſame, would be dreyned away, and the well by this means much improved, for the ground about it is ſpongious, and drinks in water apace, the uppermoſt part thereof to to the depth of a foot, conſiſting of that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low earth of which is made pete and turfe, and that beneath it being ſandy, and alſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the vertues of the Spaw-well, to whom, and in what caſes profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or hurtfull.</head>
            <p>I Shall not ſtand here to reckon up all, and the ſeveral vertues of Vitrial, as not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducing to our preſent purpoſe, becauſe the varities of its operations depends upon the variety of the forms, in which it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, or uſed; for the Salt thereof hath one operation, the <hi>Colcothar</hi> another, the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpirit another, and that ſubtile acide pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating ſpirit, (which <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> cals his great ſecret, or <hi>Arcanum</hi> againſt the Epilepſie, and other ſuch ſymptomes, becauſe of its wonderfull penetrativenes leaving no part or places of the body unſearched) another, and with this hath the ſpirit of the Spaw water great affinity, &amp; is therefore ſo much the more excellent, as being ſo much the nearer to it, <hi>Primum ens</hi> as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it. Now note by the way, that although this ſpirit cannot be by it ſelf extracted out of this water, yet it may be extracted out of Vitrial, yet by a very expert artiſt.</p>
            <p>This water according to its firſt qualities cooles and moiſtens actually, heats, and dries potentially. And by theſe four qualities, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109520:41"/>
diſtempers of the body conſiſting in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs either of heat, cold, drineſs, or moiſture, are tempered, every quality altering its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and reducing it into its natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And indeed it is worth taking notice of, that in ſuch caſes a diſtemper will rather be altered by its contrary, than increaſed by its like. As for exemple, if the diſtemper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in heat, the heat will be allayed by the coldneſs of the water, and not be made more intenſe by the heat thereof (although the heat continue longer than the coldneſs, for the water is quickly warmed in the ſtomack, and then the potential heat is reduced into act, and continues) and ſo on the contrary, I mean If the water be taken regularly, and cautiouſly, or otherwiſe ſuch happy ſucceſs may not be expected.</p>
            <p>Now according to other qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, &amp; third it cuts, diſſolves, attenuates, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtergeth viſcous, tartarous humours in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, meſſenterie, hypochondries, reins, blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c: and evacuateth them by Urine, as being indeed very diuretical, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence opens the obſtructions of the ſaid parts, which are the occaſions of moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and diſeaſes. It penetrates alſo through every narrow, occult paſſages of the body, where other medicines cannot come. Moreover it corroborates, aſtringeth, and laxateth, and divers ſuch as theſe, and the former contrary operations hath it upon the body of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:109520:41"/>Now note that although its operations are thus contrary, and the cures effected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, of ſo contrary natures, yet this is no other than what conſiſts with, and conduceth to the preſervation of nature, for if by its aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction any retention is cauſed, yet nothing is reteined, but what ſhould not be evacuated, and if by its laxating, evacuation is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet nothing is evacuated that ſhould be retained. It dries nothing but what it finds too moiſt, and flaccid, and ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and it heats nothing, but what before was too cold, and ſo on the contrary alſo. I ſpeak now as to the generality of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and do not deny but there may acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſomething happen contrary to general obſervations. But as for moſt exceptions that are, or can be made, either they may eaſily be anſwered, or any accidental or caſual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice be eaſily prevented, and the credit of the Spaw maintained. If any ſhall object and ſay by its coldneſs and moiſture it weakens the liver more than by its heat and drineſs it coroborates it, and thereby occaſioneth a dropſie, where before was none, and where it finds it, increaſeth it. To this I anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> if the body be well prepared firſt, and the water paſs freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other ſuch directions and cautions obſerved as ſhould be, and I have praeſcribed in the following chapter, it doth not onely prevent, but cure the dropſie by heating, drying, and corroborating the liver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:109520:42"/>And if any ſhall object that it aſtringeth and bindeth the bodies of ſome, ſo much that there is no ejection of their excrements by ſtool for two or three dayes together, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is true, this may happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and it may be oftentimes by reaſon that thoſe humours which ſhould irritate the bowels to expel and eject their excrements are diverted through the ureters, by which means alſo the bowels become more dry, and dull, but yet this inconveniency may eaſily be remedied, and prevented, by taking every night at bed-time a little Caſſia, or ſome ſuch lenient medicament, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a gliſter, or ſuppoſitorie.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch like obſervations, and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be made againſt mine aforeſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but they may as eaſily be anſwered (<hi>ſalvâ adhuc famâ aquae Spadanae</hi>) as made.</p>
            <p>Now the manifold vertues, and various operations of this Spaw (as effecting cures of a contrary nature) being premiſed, it will I hope, be eaſie to conclude, what diſtempers, ſymptoms and diſeaſes it is effectual againſt.</p>
            <p>It allayes all acid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gnawing, and hot hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and cures all ſuch ſymptomes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence, as agues, conſumptions, quincies, tumours, impoſtumes, ulcers, wounds; it ſtops bleeding, the over flowing of choller, the diſſentery, and ſuch like fluxes.</p>
            <p>It corroborates the brain, nerves &amp;c. and prevents or cures the Apoplexie, Epilepſie, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Virtigo, inveterate head-ach, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109520:42"/>
and all ſuch ſymptoms as proceed from the weakneſs, coldneſs, heat, dryneſs, or moiſture of the ſame.</p>
            <p>It corroborates the ſtomack, and cauſeth good digeſtion, conſumes crudities which are the cauſes of obſtructions, and breed ill bloud and infirm fleſh or an ill habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it maketh the fat lean, and the lean fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhie, cureth, and preventeth the chollick, and worms.</p>
            <p>It ſtrengtheneth and openeth the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, meſſentery, and cureth diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, the Aſthma, the dropſie, melancholly and fearful, paſſions Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal wind, and vapours (offending the head and heart,) which moſt women and many men are afflicted withall. It doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon this account cheer the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cure and prevent the palpitatious, and paſſions thereof, as alſo all faintings.</p>
            <p>It purifieth the bloud, cures the ſcurvy, even in thoſe whoſe teeth are ready to drop out of their heads, by reaſon of the extreamity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, alſo the foul veneral diſeaſe, the leproſie, Jaundiſe, yellow, and black, and for the more perfect effecting of theſe cures, it doth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny open the hemorrhoides.</p>
            <p>It provoketh Urine, and cureth the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and allayes the ſharpnes thereof, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth the ſtone in the bladder, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the ſoft ſuperficial part thereof, and evacuating that mucousſlimy water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which it is involved, and by this means alſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109520:43"/>
it for cutting, for ſometimes this ſtone cannot be felt, by reaſon of that ſlimy mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, which mucuus it ſelf doth alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by its torments counterfeit the ſtone, where it is collected in a great quantity, being of an acid tartarous nature. It forceth out from the kidnies, and bladder abundance of ſand, and ſmall ſtones to a great number, and ſometimes ſuch as are as big and as long, as long pepper. And as it cures all ulcers, and wounds in the body, ſo eſpecially and much ſooner in the reins, and bladder, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing alſo the piſſing of bloud, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea.</p>
            <p>It cures the Gout, Aches, Cramp, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion in what part of the body whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and giveth great eaſe therein ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>It openeth all obſtructions, and ſuppreſſeth all manner of over-flowings in Women, ſtrengtheneth the womb, cureth the mother, maketh the barren fruitfull, and is a great preventative againſt miſcarryings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies moſt infirmities of the womb.</p>
            <p>Note that this water doth not help all parts, cure all theſe infirmities after one, and the ſame manner; for ſome part of the body, it helps <hi>per ſe,</hi> as we call it, and ſome <hi>per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens: per ſe,</hi> it helps thoſe, through which it paſſeth and toucheth, and that either by its craſs ſubſtance, as the Mouth, Jaws, Stomack, Meſſentery, Liver, Reins, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by its Spiritual parts, which do penetrate the whole body. <hi>Per accidens</hi> it helps thoſe which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109520:43"/>
are diſtempered by conſent, or by the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of other parts, and this by removing the obſtructions thereof.</p>
            <p>It is alſo uſed by way of inſeſſion in griefs of the womb, and by way of injection, into that as alſo into the bowels &amp; bladder, where all the qualities act immediatly upon thoſe parts, allay the ſharp, and hot diſtempers, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the pains thereof, healing and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the ſame.</p>
            <p>It may moreover be uſed by way of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and lotion in external wounds, Ulcers, Itch, or Scabs, and being dropt into ſoar eyes wonderfully cooleth, drieth, and cleareth the ſame.</p>
            <p>In a word, if any intenſions in a medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, be to be performed by allaying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, opening, obſtructions, evacuating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuperfluous morbifick humours, and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating all the parts of the body, thoſe are effected in a very good meaſure, if not fully and perfectly by this water. And I my ſelf have ſeen many of the aforenamed diſeaſes cured by the help thereof, and for other cures effected thereby, I have been aſſured by them themſelves who received the benefit, or by others who have been eye witneſſes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Some may demand whether this water may be adminiſtred to Children, Old, Men, and Women great with child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. As to the firſt, although the heat of children be ſoon deſtroyed by cold, yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109520:44"/>
this water may ſafely be given to children of a year old, if the water which they drink exceed not the ſtrength of their ſtomack, or if their ſtomack can bear it. And <hi>H. ab Heers</hi> ſaith, he ſaw a ſucking child drink of the <hi>German</hi> Spaw with good ſucceſs, and ſome children very young have taken of ours, not without benefit.</p>
            <p>2. As to the ſecond, It is true that their heat alſo is very little, and ſoon extinguiſhed by cold, yet if the ſtrength of their ſtomacks be able to carry it off, without a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the appetite, it may ſafely to them alſo but not in ſo large a quantity as to others, be adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>3. And as to third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is true it is diureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and may ſeem dangerous for them to take it, yet it hath been obſerved, that many have taken it ſecurely enough, ſome when they have been very young with child, and others, when near the time of their bringing forth. I ſhall not give too much liberty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I lay too great a reſtraint upon them, Onely I ſay, it is ſafeſt for them to take it in the fourth, fifth, and ſixth moneth, and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> himſelf will admit of purgation, at that time. But if any be very defirous to take it before, or after by reaſon of ſome griefs ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them thereto, let them uſe it cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in leſs quantity, and withall take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing every night to prevent the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies thereof, as Pearl, Corall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pouder of hartſhorn, or the like.</p>

                  </gap> Q.</hi> It may be demanded, whence it is that the excrements upon the taking of this water become black.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This blackneſs is not from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of black melancholy humours as many will have it, for if the ſoundeſt healthieſt body in the world, who can in no wiſe be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to have any aduſt black choller in him his excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts will alſo be tinged black there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Beſides, we do not find that one mans body in twenty, that are diffected, have any ſuch black humours in it, nay, although he were the moſt melancholly man in the World, &amp; therefore to impute it to a mixture of this, is a great errour. Neither do I impute it to Iron onely, as <hi>H. ab Heers,</hi> who, becauſe Iron did the like, would not aſcribe it to any thing elſe. But it ſeems he had not, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his own words, obſerved that Vitrial would do the like, and that either of Iron, or Copper, and that although, Iron being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly, the excrenents are tinged black, it was by the Vitrial which was made in the body by the acid ſpirits thereof, reſolving the eſurine Salt of the Iron, and corroding it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Copperas, he, I do ſuppoſe, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the reaſon he gives to prove, that Vitrial doth not diſcolour the excrements, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe oyl, or ſpirit of Vitrial will not. But herein he argues a <hi>conjunctis ad disjuncta,</hi> and therefore his argument is of no force. For here is but a part of the Vitrial, <hi>viz.</hi> one part abſtracted from the other, and that not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109520:45"/>
without the deſtruction of the ſpecies. Now if the ſpecies could be conſerved it might be done, although it were volatile and more ſpiritual as the Vitrial is in this Spaw; for the truth is the ſame ſpecies may be fixed, and yet become volatile, and more ſpiritual, and yet all this while the ſpecies be conſerved.</p>
            <p>Note here by the way, upon what account it is that Iron, or Steel opens obſtructions; and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> There being a great affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity betwixt the eſurine Salt in Iron, and all acid unſpecificated ſpirits, the acid ſpirits in the body which are the cauſe of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and coagulation, and by conſequence of obſtructions, do preſently forſake thoſe parts, and humours where they are ſeated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to the Iron, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſſolve, and ſo be united to the aforeſaid Salt that is in it, (to which union they have a natural propenſity) and ſo being therewith united, are with the ſame ejected, together with the obſtructive humours, which at the ſame time are ejected, <hi>viz.</hi> when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſtrongly irritated to expel the Iron, as being very offenſive to her.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of ſome general directions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, in the time of, and after the taking of the Waters.</head>
            <p>THere are ſeldom any diſtempers, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes that occaſion people to go to the Spaw, that are without peccant, excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, obſtructing humours, which muſt of neceſſity be removed before the drinking of the waters attempted: and that either becauſe thoſe crude, groſs humours in the greater veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels will be by the force of the waters carried down into the narrower paſſages, and there cauſe greater obſtructions, and by conſequence Feavers, Dropſies, Gripings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the free paſſage of the waters, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of many unthought of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and ſymptomes; as alſo becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being thereby disburdened of the load of groſſer humours, will be the better able with the aſſiſtance of the waters to overcome, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and evacuate the thinner, and thoſe that are left behind, and the ſooner recover its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vigour, and ſanitude.</p>
            <p>Now for the Medicines to be adminiſtred, they muſt be elected ſuitable to the humour offending, and proportioned to the ſtrength
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109520:46"/>
and conſtitution of the patient. I do in moſt caſes very much approve of vomits, becauſe they do effectually cleanſe the ſtomack, and the <hi>primas vias,</hi> and inſtead of them, where they cannot be ſafely, and conveniently uſed, <hi>biera picra</hi> comes next in place for abſterging, and cleanſing the ſtomack, bowels, meſſentery, and making free paſſage for the water to paſs to the Liver. And after either of theſe, ſome proper lenitive for the opening the paſſages through the Liver, Ureters, Kidnies and into the Bladder.</p>
            <p>Phlebotomy alſo, or letting of bloud is in many caſes to be conſidered of, <hi>viz.</hi> if the veins and other adjacent veſſels be oppreſſed with bloud, or any peccant humours, for thereby they will be made more fit for the waters to paſs through them, and the virtues thereof into them.</p>
            <p>Alſo in caſe of very obſtinate obſtructions, I adviſe that a chalybiate courſe of Phyſick be run through for a certain time, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the waters may with the leſs reſiſtance act their parts, and ſooner, eaſier, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly effect the intended cures.</p>
            <p>Now after ſuch preparation is made, and the patient come to the Spaw, let him alſo then take ſome eaſie vomit, as of Oxymel, or wine of Squils, or the like, or ſome <hi>hiera pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra,</hi> the firſt day after he is come thither, and the next morning after that ſome Lenitive, as Lenitive Electuary, Caſſia, Manna, Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, infuſion of Sene, Rhabarb, ſyrop of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109520:46"/>
Roſes, or the like, according to the humour that is to be evacuated, and then let him cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and confidently begin to drink theſe waters with a reſolvedneſs to obſerve all ſuch rational directions, as he ſhall find in this, and the next enſuing Chapters preſcribed. But for poor people, or they that loath all that bears the name of Phyſick, drink three or four mornings of the Sulphur-well, for that will in a good meaſure effect the ſame.</p>
            <p>When any one is reſolved for the Spaw, let him then firſt apply himſelf to ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Phyſitian, who ſhall be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his conſtitution, diſtemper, and the nature, and uſe of the waters themſelves, that accordingly, as cauſe ſhall require, the more ſuccesfull preparatives may be adminiſtred, and the more effectual directions given. This I adviſe the rather, becauſe there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Phyſitians in the Nation, who never ſaw, taſted, ſcarce read of the waters, or converſed with thoſe that know them, yet ſend their patients, ſuch as they account incurable, and deſperate, thither, giving them ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the drinking the waters as the very Spaw-women themſelves laugh at.</p>
            <p>A due preparation being premiſed, let him that drinks the waters begin with four, or five, or ſix half pint glaſſes, more or leſs as his ſtomack can well bear, and ſo by degrees proceed to two or three glaſſes more every day until he come to the height, and his full doſe, which will be when he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109520:47"/>
can take no more, without a manifeſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and nauſeouſneſs. Some will drink twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome thirty of theſe glaſſes in a morning, and ſome can not take half ſo many.</p>
            <p>In the morning before the water be drunk, let firſt all excrements be evacuated, either by nature, or art, as by glyſters, ſuppoſitories, or ſome pills, or lenitive taken the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at bed-time; for the retaining of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements hinders the concoction of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (if I may call it a concoction) and by conſequence their paſſage through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereby are cauſed preſſures, fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tenſions, gripings, and ſometimes cold ſweat.</p>
            <p>Betwixt every two, or three, or four, or five glaſſes, let ſome exerciſe be uſed, of which more largely in the Chapter of exerciſe. And for the better paſſing of the waters, comforting the ſtomack, and preventing of nauſeouſneſs, let ſome good cordial, ſtomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpices, ſeeds, and roots, be taken betwixt while, as Annisſeed, Caryoway and Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confects, Citron, or Lymon pilled can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, or dried, Pepper loſſenges, Cardamums, but above all I prefer Elecampany root can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, or for want thereof Angelica root, or ſeeds, for they, eſpecially Elecampany, as the Lord <hi>Virulam</hi> ſaith, breed a robuſt heat, and I am ſure promote the paſſage of the water moſt eminently, and comfort all the veſſels through which the water paſſeth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all make the water more effectual for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109520:47"/>
of obſtructions, and corroborating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm parts.</p>
            <p>I approve not of taking the waters too faſt, or alloting too ſhort a time for the drinking of the full doſe, or proportion. I conceive that for the generality it will be moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for to take at firſt a quarter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and then exerciſe half an hour, and then another quarter, and exerciſe till the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins to be evacuated, and then a third quarter, with exerciſe half an hour more, and then the laſt part with exerciſe, till it be all paſſed out of the body. But if any cannot bear the drinking of a fourth part at a time, then let them take the eighth part, with a quarter of an hours exerciſe betwixt every while. To drink the waters too faſt cauſeth for the moſt part nauſeouſnes, oppreſſeth the natural heat, and compreſſeth the paſſages and veſſels, that the water cannot paſs ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through them as otherwiſe it would do, and alſo cauſeth divers ſymptoms, as tenſions, gripings, cold ſweats, dejection of appetite, and the like. If a great quantity of water be caſt upon a fire at once it extinguiſheth it, but if by degrees, it maketh it burn the more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and intends the flame thereof. <hi>Ryetius</hi> is therefore in my judgement very erroneous, as to this point, who would have the whole proportion be taken in half an hours time.</p>
            <p>The time for the continuing the taking of the waters muſt be proportioned according to the greatneſs of the diſeaſe, and profit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109520:48"/>
received by it. In caſe any one after a due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and upon a carefull obſervation of ſuch directions as are required, ſhall not be able to bear the waters, and drink them without a manifeſt and eminent oppreſſion, and nauſeouſneſs after ſeveral aſſayes, let him ceaſe preſently from the taking of them: but if upon the taking of them, he can take them without any ſuch inconveniency as ſhould cauſe him to deſiſt, &amp; yet perceive no benefit thereby; let him not preſently give over the uſe of them, as deſpairing of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit, but continue the uſe of them a moneth, or two, or longer, if the diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. In <hi>Germany</hi> they drink of the Spaw, not onely a quarter of a year together, but ſometimes half a year, and ſometimes a whole year if it be requiſite, and at laſt they receive the benefit thereof, by being cured of moſt deſperate diſeaſes, which otherwiſe were in the vulgar account incureable. It is a great errour amongſt us <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to allot but two or three weeks time, or a moneth at the moſt, for the taking of the Spaw, let the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe be what it will, and hence it is, that many miſs of thoſe happy cures, which by a longer continuance might have been effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this to the prolonging of their own miſery, and defamation of the Spaw it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I do admit of the uſe of purging Phyſick, to be taken every eight, or tenth day, for the evacuating of crudities, which for the moſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109520:48"/>
part are bred in that time, &amp; alſo ſome groſſer humour looſened by the water, or thoſe which become craſs, or thick by the waters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, carrying away the thinner part firſt; for theſe remaining in the body, would elſe be carried down into the ſmaller veſſels, and cauſe obſtructions, and thereby many other great inconveniences and ſymptomes, retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, if not utterly preventing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cure. Now the Medicaments I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of moſt in theſe caſes, are <hi>Hiera picra ſimplex Galeni,</hi> Rhabarb with Cryſtal of Tartar, and ſuch like, to be taken one, or two dayes together, as there ſhall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſome Lenitive, as Caſſia, or Lenitive electuary, or the like to be taken the next day after that, for the moiſtning of the bowels, and the better preparing the paſſages betwixt the ſtomack, and bladder, againſt the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the uſe of the waters, which I adviſe may begin the next morning after. And in ſome caſes Phyſick may be taken every day, nay, mixt with the waters themſelves, as in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I know it is a common, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd opinion, that Phyſick is very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to thoſe that take it, whileſt they are in a courſe of drinking the waters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is moſt irrationally decried. Now the chief ground of this errour, as far as I ever could underſtand is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Some certain years ſince, ſome famous Doctors attending upon perſons of great quality, their patients,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109520:49"/>
to the Spaw, did preſcribe them the uſe of ſome Phyſick, with the waters, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ill. This might be true, but what then? Might not thoſe Phyſitians, though otherwiſe knowing enough, be ignorant of the right uſe of the waters themſelves, and of the preparations requiſit for the taking of them with ſucceſs? Or might not they be willing to bring the Spaw out of credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might happily cure their patients too ſoon, and thereby be prejudicial to them? Or might not their patients be unwilling to drink the water regulary; or diſorder themſelves in reſpect of diet, exerciſe and the like? Now whether either of theſe, or all theſe might be the cauſe of the aforeſaid unſuccesfulnes, I cannot determine, onely this I know, that the uſe of Phyſick is not onely not unſafe, but very neceſſary in the uſe of the waters, nay, and in many caſes to be mixed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves, as in the next Chapter I ſhall more particularly give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>Three or four dayes before giving over the waters, they muſt be abated by degrees, as at the beginning increaſed by degrees.</p>
            <p>After the ending of the waters, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even before you return from thence, ſome ſuch purging Phyſick will be neceſſary as may evacuate all the water that ſhall remain ſecretly in the body, as oftentimes it doth, and withall comfort and ſtrengthen the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and Liver, and moiſten the bowels if
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109520:49"/>
there be any feaver, of too great aſtriction of body afterwards. Alſo a very ſpare diet will be very neceſſary for a moneth after, for by this means nature will become maſter of the bodily infirmities, all crudities being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and prevented.</p>

            <p>THey that have a very good digeſtion may in the afternoon about five, or ſix hours after dinner, take half the quantity which they did in the morning, but with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they eat a very light ſupper after it; and as for thoſe that have a very bad conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, let them altogether forbear it in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, or at moſt drink but a glaſs for the diluting, and better diſtributing of the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, if already perfected.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall drink of the water for the curing of an ague, let them ſo obſerve the time for the taking of it, that it may be all paſſed through them before the coming of the fit, becauſe otherwiſe nature will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109520:50"/>
in her motions, <hi>viz.</hi> evacuating the water by Urine, and the morbifick humour by ſweat. And as for thoſe that have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual feaver, let them forbear it altogether, unleſs the humours be concocted and fit for evacution, either by ſweat or Urine, as I have more at large declared in the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning the taking of cold water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in caſe of a feaver.</p>
            <p>My adviſe is that they that have very weak and cold ſtomacks, ſhould take the water a little warm'd firſt (i. e.) the cold being juſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. The truth is, the coldneſs of the waters doth very little good at all, unleſs it be to allay a very great heat, and drought. So great a quantity thereof as is uſually taken cold, muſt of neceſſity diminiſh the natural heat in cold conſtitutions. A glaſs of cold water caſt upon a fire, though but ſmall, may make it burn the more ſtrongly, but if ten, or twenty be caſt upon it, they, if they do not quite extinguiſh it, yet will ſo far check it, that it will a long time labour under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive contrariety thereof. And actual heat is far more ſuitable to nature, &amp; if ſo be the vertue of the water is not dimiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, (as it is not, as I have demonſtrated by the ſecond experiment in the foregoing Chapter) far more effectual, the potential heat thereof being ſooner reduced into act without any checking, or oppreſſing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat. The ſtomack being a nervous part, and of exquiſite ſenſe, muſt needs be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109520:50"/>
with that, which is actually cold. This made the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> drink moſt of their water, and wine hot, as we find in <hi>Salmuths</hi> collections. The <hi>Lord Virulam</hi> wonders that <hi>calidum bibere</hi> is ſo much grown out of uſe. If to drink an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary quantity of drink cold, were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Ancients, with what face ſhall I commend the taking of gallons of cold water every morning for certain weeks together? I do therefore ſeriouſly adviſe thoſe that have cold and effeminate ſtomacks to take off the cold from the water before they drink it.</p>
            <p>If upon the taking of the water, it paſs not through the body freely, but is retained, it is to be conſidered in what place of the body it is at a ſtand, that accordingly ſome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated means may be adminiſtred for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of it. For if it be retained in the belly, or hypochondries (which will appear by its rumbling, wind, tenſion, oppreſſure) a glyſter will evacuate it; if in the ſtomack, which appears by a diſpoſition to vomit, <hi>hiera picra,</hi> or <hi>Rhabarb</hi> will be convenient for the opening, and cleanſing thereof and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king free paſſage for it from thence. If it be retained in the habit of the body and veins, which appears by oppreſſure, and a chilneſs over the body, without the aforeſaid rumbling, tenſion, wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I approve of <hi>hiera picra,</hi> with <hi>Jollap, Mechoacan,</hi> or the like hydragogal medicaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:109520:51"/>They, that when they have taken the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, cannot evacuate them for want of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, as being to feeble to ſtir much, or walk, and not having the conveniencies of horſes, may either drink all their proportion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the bed, or take ſome part at the Well, and then go to bed, and there take the reſidue. I have oftentimes obſerved that the water would freely paſs through many, when they were in bed, but would not otherwiſe, and the reaſon of it was as I conceived, becauſe the paſſages of their body were contracted by going into the air, but more open by the warm'th of the bed.</p>
            <p>Now for the rendering the water more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, it will be neceſſary, as is the courſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> to make uſe of ſome ſpecificks with the drinking of it. <hi>H. ab Heers,</hi> allowes of the decoction of Sanicle, Pimpernel, Scabions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be drunk in caſe of ſpitting of bloud, inward Impoſtumes Ulcers, Wounds, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the breaſt, and Lungs, the benefit whereof he experienced by many years pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. And why may not we do the like in ſeveral caſes, as to allow of a ſpoonfull, or two, of the juyce of Saxifrage, or the like to be taken in the firſt glaſs, in caſe of the ſtone, or gravel, or to take Turpentine pills, or a bole with Turpentine and Caſſia the night before and in caſe of very great obſtructions, dropſie, and cold moiſt ſtomacks, or the like, to mix ſome Sugar of ſteel, or ſteel wine with the firſt glaſs? But note that in ſuch caſes,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109520:51"/>
they are to be taken half an hour, or a whole hour, before the taking of any more of the water.</p>
            <p>For the better paſſing of the waters, let the firſt glaſs be mixed with Sugar, Syrrup of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, or <hi>de quinque Radicibus,</hi> or Nitre, or Spirit of Salt, or Vitrial, Salt of Tartar, or a glaſs of white wine, in the midſt of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or mixed with three, or four of the firſt glaſſes, or two or three glaſſes of the Sulphur Well in the midſt of the Spaw-water, or a good draught of the decoction of Fennel, or Parſley-roots, be taken half an hour before the water. Note that ſome of the aforeſaid things are penetrative and ſo force their way, and ſome are ſweet, and therefore are ſooner attracted to, and by the Liver, and ſo the more ſpeedily evacuated.</p>
            <p>In caſe of the neceſſity of any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid mixtures, it will be convenient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſome experienced Phyſitian be firſt conſulted withall. And if you meet with none at the Spaw, that you can confide in, <hi>York,</hi> and other places are not far, where you ſhall find ſuch Gentlemen that are able to adviſe you, as concerning this, ſo alſo in any other caſe, and eſpecially if any unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident ſhould fall out whileſt you are drinking the waters.</p>
            <p>In caſe in the taking of the waters, ſumes, and vapours fly to the head as oftentimes they do, even to inebriation, let none be diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereat, for either they are the ſpirits of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109520:52"/>
the water themſelves alone, which will do the head much good, or elſe there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wind from the ſtomack; for when that is filled with water, the wind that was in it muſt of neceſſitie be forced up to the head, but there it continues but a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>And as there is no neceſſity of preventing it, ſo neither can it be well prevented: but yet for ſome ſatisfaction, let Nutmeg, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander ſeed, being beaten together into a groſs pouder, be taken after every fourth part of the water; for the gratefull vapour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will alſo be carried up to the head, with the force of the other vapours from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and withall ſomewhat corroborat, and cloſe the mouth of the ſtomack.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It may be demanded whether or no the rednes, and hot pimples of the face may be cured by the inward uſe of this water, and it is the more queſtioned, becauſe it dries, and heats the Liver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> It is true, that for the moſt part the rednes of the face is increaſed by the uſe of this water, but yet notwithſtanding, it may in a great meaſure be cured with the help thereof, with the obſerving of certain rules, and cautious which do much conduce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The patient that is thus affected (his body being well prepared by medicaments, &amp; phlebotomie,) muſt in the firſt place drink of this water, ten or twelve mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for by this time it will in ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109520:52"/>
meaſure remove thoſe obſtructions of the meſſentery, &amp; Liver which are the chiefeſt cauſe of the aforeſaid diſtemper, then let him be purged with ſome cooling lenitive, and then becauſe the continual uſe of the water ſhould not, as doth ſteel, heat the bloud too much, or rather by its ſtrengthning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, drive outwardly the heated cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours of the body too faſt, I adviſe that he do for ſeven, or eight dayes together drink clarified whey, made with cooling, moiſt, and diuretical herbs and medicaments, as Borage, Lettuce, Seangreen, Endive, Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, Parſly, and Fennel-roots, Nitre, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marines, Liquoriſh, and ſuch like, and withall have a vein breathed, if nothing contradict it, and then return again to the uſe of the water for another fortnight, and after that again to cooling purges and the cooling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified whey, as before, for a moneths time. Note that withall, that ſome topical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be applied to the place affected, as oyl of the yelks of Eggs, oyl of Tartar, juice of Lemmon and Salt, <hi>unguentum alhum,</hi> but above all <hi>flores ſulphuris</hi> diſſolved in oyl, or the like. By ſuch kind of means with the uſe of the Spaw-water, I would undertake to cure almoſt any red <hi>pimpled face whatſoever.</hi>

            <p>EXerciſe is, whileſt the water is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, very neceſſary, as being good to laxate the paſſages of the body, to excite the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, for the better digeſtion of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (if as I ſaid before, we may properly call it a digeſtion) for by this means, ſaith <hi>Archigenes,</hi> as alſo <hi>Aetius,</hi> the internal veſſels being heated will more ſtrongly attract, and expell. Some kind of exerciſe is, if ſtrength permit, to be continued from the firſt glaſs to the evacuation of the whole proportion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Now for exerciſe in particular, riding on a trotting horſe, or in a Coach are the beſt, becauſe thereby the muſcles of the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen</hi> being preſſed, do intend the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty of the Ureters and bladder. And where thoſe cannot conveniently be had, and uſed, I commend walking, bowling, pitching of the bar, and leaping, and the like, all which muſt be uſed ſo moderatly, as not to provoke ſweat, for by ſweat the water will be drawn into the habit of the body, to the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dropſy and ſuch like ſymptomes. They that are not able to walk, nor have the accommodation for riding, muſt take the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109520:53"/>
waters in their bed, for the warmeth of the bed doth as I ſaid before, ſerve very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exerciſe, and anſwers to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof.</p>
            <p>Sleep is very hurtfull, becauſe in ſleep all exceptions, or evacuations of excrement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly except ſweat, which is thereby promoted, and for the aforeſaid reaſons to be prevented, are ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>Sitting on the ground is hurtfull, and alſo ſtanding in the Sun, and walking late in the evening.</p>

            <p>IN froſty weather the water is ſtrongeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mineral ſpirits thereof are by the binding of the earth ſuppreſſed and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from evaporating through the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof (as they do at other times) by which means the water becomes the more ſtrongly impregnated therewith.

               <hi>Sol.</hi> This aphoriſme having been theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years groſly miſtaken, hath been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the deaths of thouſands.

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:109520:54"/>In extream wet weather the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes far weaker than before, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the rain, although it doth not uſually ſink above ten feet deep yet may into ſome of the veins of the ſaid ſpring, which lye towards the ſuperficies of the earth.

            <p>THe greateſt reaſon why many receive but little benefit, and ſome none by the Spaw, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of their intemperancy in reſpect of dyet. This water for the moſt part begetteth a very great appetite, by reaſon whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forget themſelves at Table, putting in more than nature can diſpoſe of, and hence are crudities, the nurſery of all diſeaſes; And it is true what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, affirming, that no man ſhall be vexed with ſicknes that is not oppreſſed with crudities. And whence cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> but from fulnes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming alſo, that to eat without fulnes is the rule of health? He alſo ſaith, that what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes ſo ever are cured by evacuation, are cauſed by repletion: and do not we ſee that all diſeaſes are cured by evacuation, <hi>viz.</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, purging, bleeding, ſweat, and urine? When the Chylus is ill concocted, or rather corrupted (for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> corruption, not concoction) it paſſeth crude through the whole body, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond concoction doth not amend the firſt, nor the third the ſecond, ſo that hence of neceſſity great obſtructions, the occaſion of tenſions, gripings, all manner of hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109520:55"/>
diſtempers, ſtone, gravel, diſtemper of the head, heart, liver, ſtomack, bowels, limbs, and indeed of all parts. There is an <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, that he that will eat much, muſt eat little, that is, by eating little he ſhall live long and ſo eat much. A ſober dyet, as it prevents, ſo alſo cures many infirmities, and diſtempers by diminiſhing crudities already bred, and reducing all the humours of the body to the government of nature.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch dyet be uſed, as may not hinder the effects of the Spaw, being of a good laudable nouriſhment, of eaſie digeſtion, and may freely paſs through the veſſels, ſerving for the diſtribution thereof. Let not the meat be dreſſed, or ſauced deliciouſly, ſo as to prolong appetite, beyond the ſatisfaction of natural hunger, and thirſt, thereby cauſing a greater quantity to be taken in, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would, or nature requires, or can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. For the moſt part meat offends more by its quantity than quality.</p>
            <p>In more particular manner I forbid all fleſh that is very ſalt, and fat, Bacon, Pork, Neatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet, Tripes, tame Ducks, Geeſe, gizards of Poultry, all ſalt Fiſh, Eels, and all things that come from milk (except Butter, Whey, Milk, Pottage, Cheeſ-curds) alſo Leeks, Onions, Parſnips, Cabbage, Muskmillions, Cucumbers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helmont</hi> forbids nothing, onely exceſs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Nature hates curioſities.</p>
            <p>I could reckon up divers other things that I ſhould forbid, but becauſe they are never
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109520:56"/>
uſed at the Spaw, it will be needles to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them.</p>
            <p>I diſapprove not of Beef, if it hath been ſalted but a week, eſpecially for thoſe that love it.</p>
            <p>I allow for thoſe whoſe bloud, and Livers are hot, Pears, Apples, Plums, Cherries, Raſp-berries, ripe Gooſe-berries and raw Sallets, but with this caution, that they be eaten a little before ſupper, and alſo ſparingly, and one glaſs of white wine drank after them, for they do temper the bloud, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the curing of the diſtemper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>I forbid much variety of meats, becauſe of the unequalneſs of their concoction, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature is (although the pallate be not) beſt ſatisfied with ſimplicity of dyet. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently doth <hi>Macrobius</hi> diſcuſs this point.</p>
            <p>As for drinks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I commend beer, or ale, that is neither too ſmall, or too new. They, whoſe ſtomacks are very cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may drink Beer, or Ale as ſtrong as can be made, and alſo a glaſs, or two of Sack with a roſt put into it, which they may eat; and theſe do much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and help concoction.</p>
            <p>I approve of the drinking of pure, thin, well refined white and Rheniſh wine, but not at meals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs in a very little quantity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are very diuretical, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, carrying down with them to the Liver, and through the narrow veſſels, the crude juyce of the meat, before it be concocted,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109520:56"/>
thereby endangering obſtructions; but let them be drunk a little before ſupper.</p>
            <p>The time of eating muſt be conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the paſſing of the water through the body, for when the Urine begins to change its colour, paſſing from white to a higher colour, then is it a ſign that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is paſſed through, and then ſomething may be eaten and not before, unleſs when good part of the water, although not all, hath paſſed through freely, and then ceaſed for an hour, or two, and then alſo it is time to eat ſomething, for it may be that nature hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of the reſidue that is left behind, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for ſome other uſes, as to moiſten ſome dry parts of the body, or the like.</p>
            <p>They that are firſt ready to eat, may ſtay their ſtomacks as we call it, with a meſs of broth, which commonly is there made very good, and then have ſo much good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and civility to wait for their dinners till all the good company of the houſe be ready for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Let the ſupper be larger, than the dinner, becauſe in the evening the ſtomack is leſs laxated, and languid, than at noon, and can therefore concoct a greater quantity of meat. Yet the ſupper muſt not be very large, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater than what the ſtomack can be well able perfectly to concoct before the next morning. Let it be ready at ſix at leaſt, if not ſeven hours after dinner.</p>
            <p>I adviſe that all, whether it be at dinner, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109520:57"/>
ſupper, that they lerve with an appetite, &amp; eat not half ſo much as the Spaw drinkers uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, indulging their pallates, and gratifying their ſtomacks according to the meaſure of their appetites, which many times is rather adventious, or preternatural, then natural.</p>
            <p>I utterly diſapprove of mixing of the Spaw water, with either Wine, or Beer, but yet I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the drinking of a glaſs of it ſelf at bed time, for the corroborating and cloſing of the mouth of the ſtomack, and ſuppreſſing of vapours, which would otherwiſe diſturb the brain from quiet ſleep.</p>

            <p>THis is called the Sulphur-well; by reaſon of its Sulphurious odour, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, it hath two other qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaltneſs, and bitterneſs.

Now, becauſe the Salt, which this water yields upon evaporation, is of the ſame nature with, &amp; cannot be diſtinguiſhed either in odour, or taſt (the ſtanch being loſt in the evaporation) from common black Sea-ſalt, I ſhall firſt declare what is the cauſe of the ſaltneſs of the Sea, which is no other than
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109520:57"/>
that of this water. And firſt I ſhall ſhew what is not the cauſe of it, thereby confuting the opinion of many ancient Philoſophers, and their followers.</p>
            <p>1. The ſaleneſs of the Sea, is not cauſed by the Suns exhaling the ſweeter parts out of it, as was the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for this ſuppoſeth that there was the ſame ſaltneſs in the Sea before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but was not, but upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count manifeſted, but this can not be, for then, why are not other waters, as Rivers, Ponds, Lakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made ſaltiſh alſo by the Suns exhaling their ſweeter vapours.</p>

The Sun doth not boil into the Sea, by the vehemency of its heat, that ſaline taſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pliny</hi> being almoſt of the aforeſaid opinion, for then, why doth not the Sun work the ſame effect, upon a Pond, or Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of water, on which it may work more vigorouſly, by heating more vehemently, <hi>viz.</hi> (becauſe it is leſs reſiſted, by reaſon of the ſmall quantity of water in them) than on the Ocean?</p>
            <p>3. This ſaltnes is not cauſed (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have it,) by rain, mixt with hot, dry, and terrene exhalations; for the rain it ſelf would alſo then be ſaltiſh, which indeed is moſt ſweet, and if it were ſaltiſh, then why are not Pits, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are many times filled with Rain-water, ſaltiſh alſo?</p>
            <p>Now the weakneſs of theſe opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> (the chiefeſt that have uſually been embraced) being detected, I ſhall ſhew from whence
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109520:58"/>
very probably this ſaltneſs of the Sea may proceed. We muſt therefore in the firſt place conſider that the Sea is not ſimply ſaltiſh, but ſaltiſh and bitter together, that is, it hath a taſt made up of bitterneſs, and ſaltneſs: for which cauſe, as ſaith, our learned Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lydyat,</hi> in his <hi>diſquiſitio Phyſiologica de origine fontiam,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>de ſalſedine maris,</hi> the Latines gave theſe two names to it, <hi>viz. Mare, quaſi amarum, &amp; Salum, quaſi ſalſum.</hi> And this <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf conſents to, giving the reaſon of thoſe two taſts in general, and of them in the Sea in particular, where he ſaith, that all kinds of taſts ariſe from a kind of terreneſs more, or leſs aduſt; but bitterneſs from a terreneſs, very much elaborated by a fiery heat in the burning bowels of the earth; and ſaltneſs, where that heat is ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If ſo, then let us conſider whether there be not abundance of terrene aduſtneſs in the bowels of the earth, and gulfs of the Sea where a bituminous fire is alwayes burning, being fed by water (as I declared more at large in the 2. Chap. <hi>viz. Of the original of Springs in general</hi>) and that whether we may not probably conclude, and eſpecially becauſe bitumen is bitter, and very full of Salt, that the burning of the bitumen together with the terreneſs therewith mixed in the gulfs of the Sea be not the cauſe of the ſaltneſs thereof. Moreover, that bitumen hath a great power to communicate to, and beget a bitter, and ſaltiſh taſt in water, is confirmed, by that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109520:58"/>
which Geographers write concerning the Lake of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> which is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. bituminous. For ſay they, the Lake is ſo bitter, and ſaltiſh, that no fiſhes can live therein, and it is called in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writ the ſalt ſea <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſay of it, that if a man be caſt into it bound hand and foot, he cannot be drown'd; and the reaſon of this is the ſaltneſs thereof, for we ſee that waters bear the greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, by how much the ſalter they are, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the difference betwixt the Sea, and freſh Rivers, and our boiling of brine till an Egg ſwim thereon, and will not ſink.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, it will be eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from whence the ſaltneſs, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sulphur-well proceeds. And as for the ſtinking odour thereof, that I ſuppoſe is cauſed from the vapours of the burning bitumen, and aduſt terreneſs mixt therewith, which lye not far from the very head of the Well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If there be the ſame reaſon for the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Spring as there is of the Sea, then why is there not the ſame reaſon for the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious odour of the Sea as of this, and why doth not the Sea receive, and retain the ſame odour as this doth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I do not deny, but the ſame odour may be communicated to the Sea, as to this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with the ſaltneſs thereof; but becauſe the ſaltneſs thereof was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it by degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> from ſome certain
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109520:59"/>
gulfs of the Sea, ſo alſo this odour; for it cannot be rationally conceived, that the whole Sea received all its Salt into it ſelf at one time after a natural way, and therefore being ſuch a great body muſt become ſaltiſh by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little even inſenſibly. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Sulphurious odour alſo is imparted to it inſenſibly, and although the ſaltneſs may continue by reaſon that the Salt it ſelf is of a fixed ſubſtance, yet the odour being of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile volatile nature, is exhaled by the Sun, and ſo loſt. But now the caſe is far otherwiſe in the water of this Sulphur-well, for this is at once fully impregnated with the ſaid ſaltneſs and Sulphurious odour, and immediatly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away through narrow channels<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and veins of the earth, without any vaniſhing of the odour (by means of the Sun, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) which it contracted from the bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> What is the reaſon that ſeeing this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath paſſed lately through the bituminous burnings, as it appears by its freſh odour of the ſame, ſhould be cold, and not hot, as hot Baths are?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It was the opinion of <hi>Fallopius,</hi> that ſuch kind of waters proceed from a remote fire, but paſſing through narrow paſſages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their full odour, and taſt, (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vaniſhed by the way any otherwiſe, than ſmoak through a Chimney, or pipe) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the length of its paſſage, it may looſe its heat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:109520:59"/>2. Though the fire be near to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth, where this water breaketh forth, yet it is very probable that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof may proceed from a mixture of a cold ſpring before the breaking forth thereof. Neither let it ſeem ſtrange to any, that cold ſprings and hot may be ſo near together in the bowels of the earth: for juſt above the head of this Sulphur-well there ariſe two cold Springs, which meet and run down within a few feet of the head of the ſame. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Jones</hi> in his treatiſe of Buck-ſtones Bath in <hi>Derbiſhire</hi> ſaith, that the cold Springs and hot Springs are ſo near<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man may put one finger in the cold, and another in the hot.</p>
            <p>Having in ſome meaſure declared unto you the cauſe of this Sulphur-well <hi>viz.</hi> of its ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, bitterneſs, and ſulphurious odour, I ſhall in the next place give an account of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and obſervations which I made, and they are theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If Silver be put into this water, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tinged firſt yellow, and then black, but Gold is not all diſcoloured thereby.</p>
            <p>2. If this water be a little boiled, it looſeth its tinging property, and alſo ſtinking odour.</p>
            <p>3. It coagulates milk, if it be boiled therewith.</p>
            <p>4. The diſtilled water thereof looſeth its odour and doth not coagulate milk.</p>
            <p>5. If the water be boiled, it will ſtill coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate milk, though it looſeth its odour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:109520:60"/>6. Seven gallons yield by evaporation a pound of Salt, which though at firſt black, I have made as white as ſnow.</p>
            <p>7. This Salt coagulates milk alſo.</p>
            <p>8. This water kills worms, and ſuch kind of creatures preſently, if they be put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>9. I filled two Vial glaſſes with this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in wet weather, and ſtopt the one, but the other I left open. The water in that which was ſtopt, within an hour, or two, became white, and thick, and within two, or three dayes depoſited a white ſediment, and the ſides of that glaſs were furred, the water in the other glaſs altered not.</p>
            <p>10. I filled two Vial glaſſes in fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereof the one I ſtopt, but the other left open, the water in neither of them turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed colour any whit conſiderably, onely a kind of a thin whitiſh matter, after two, or three dayes fell to the bottom, the water continuing very clear. The water of that glaſs which was ſtopt, retained its odour moſt.</p>
            <p>11. A pint of this water weighs two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, i. e. fourty grains more than a pint of common Spring-water.</p>
            <p>Note that the reaſon of its tinging white metals is not from any bodily Sulphur, or bitumen mixt with it, (for the ſubſtance of them will not mix with water, but ſwim on it, as in the Spring at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Avernia,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in divers other
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109520:60"/>
places) but from the vapours, or the ſubtile atomes &amp; <hi>efluvia's</hi> thereof, which are mixed with the water, and in boiling are evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of its coagulating property is from ſome occult acidity in the Salt thereof, which to ſenſe is not perceptible, onely by effect.</p>
            <p>Out of the Salt is drawn a very good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of excellent vertue, as I ſhall declare in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, it will be worth taking notice, that about 240 yards above the head of this Sulphur-well is a bog, of about twenty yards diameter, in which I digged a mineral kind of ſubſtance, like the finders of Iron, but almoſt rotten, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded with ſome acid ſpirits, of which that bog is full, as alſo other places. This mineral ſubſtance being caſt into the fire burns blew, and ſmels like Sulphur; It is in taſt like Vitrial, and out of it Vitrial may be drawn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, in time it will be almoſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Vitrial. For I waſhed it, and ſet it in a Cellar for two, or three dayes, and it was covered over with a white ſweeetiſh Vitrial; which I diſſolved in water, and ſet the ſaid ſubſtance in a Cellar again, and it contracted the like, &amp; I did as before ſtill rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating this work till it was almoſt all turned to Vitrial. In the ſaid bog I found three or four ſorts of waters, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sulphur, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline, and of each two ſorts. This was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109520:61"/>
done the laſt day of my abode there, and therefore I had not time to make any further ſearch, onely ſome of that mineral ſubſtance I took with me, with which I tried the aforeſaid experiments. If any Gentleman would be pleaſed to expend ſome coſts in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up this bog, and erecting ſome new Wels there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would prove an acceptable benefactor to his Countrey, and it may be ſome new kind of water might be diſcovered hereby having yet more vertues than any of the former.</p>
            <p>Note that the ſtink of this Sulphur-well is perceived afar off, eſpecially in moiſt and cold weather.</p>

            <p>THe uſe of this water is either inward, or outward.</p>
            <p>It being taken inwardly incideth, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtergeth, attenuates and reſolves viſcous thick humours, and irritates every veſſel of the body to expel whatſoever humours are offenſive in them. It openeth, and removes thoſe ſtrong and obſtinate obſtructions, whether in men, or women, that would not yield to any other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109520:61"/>
Medicine whatſoever. It doth oftentimes evacuate by ſtool great lumps of viſcous ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my matter, which was certainly, whileſt it was in the body, the cauſe of ſome great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, oppreſſure, gripings, tenſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which could hardly any other way be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>It heateth, and quickneth the ſtomack, bowels, liver, ſpleen, bloud, veins, nerves, and indeed the wholy body, in ſo much that it conſumes crudities, rectifieth all cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in all parts of the body, cauſeth a good digeſtion, cures the Dropſie, Spleen, Scurvy, Green ſickneſs, Gout, Cramp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epilepſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, Vertigo, Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>evil, and all ſuch Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as proceed either from crudities, cold, viſcous, ſlimy, or corrupt humours, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct &amp; diſtemper the ſtomack, Bowels, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, Liver, Veins, Brain, and Nerves, and theſe though of long continuance. It killeth worms infallibly.</p>
            <p>Note that this water muſt be begun by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and the full proportion be taken not at once, but at ſeveral times, exerciſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the taking of the Spaw.</p>
            <p>The full doſe, or quantity to be taken muſt be proportioned according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ſtrength of the party &amp; his bearing of it, as alſo the humour offending, the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy of the diſtemper, and the aptneſs of the body to be wrought upon. In cold, dull bodies more may be taken than otherwiſe may. In general, let the proportion to be taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109520:62"/>
ſuch, as may cauſe four, ſix, or ſeven ſtools, without auy manifeſt inconveniency of the fewneſs, or multiplicity thereof.</p>
            <p>Note that in many bodies this water works very quickly, and indeed too ſoon, and in ſuch a caſe my adviſe is, that two, or three glaſſes of the Spaw-water be firſt drunk, for that will ſomewhat impede the ſudden ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thereof, &amp; cauſe it to continue longer in the body, for the better performing of its operation therein before it paſs through it.</p>
            <p>Note alſo that after the full proportion is taken, and in a good meaſure paſſed through the body, four, or ſix glaſſes of the Spaw-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be drunk for the prevention of the excoriation of the bowels and fundament, eſpecially in hot cholerick bodies.</p>
            <p>They that cannot drink this water by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ſtinking odour, and yet ſtand in great need of the effects thereof, may boil it a little while, till it hath loſt its odour, and then drink of it, for although ſome vertue vaniſheth with the odour thereof, yet the greateſt and moſt effectual vertues which are in the Salt, and aforeſaid ſubtile acidity thereof do yet continue as I have often tried, or if they pleaſe, put ſome Salt thereof into the Spaw-water, and ſo drink it, for indeed as I ſaid before, the chiefeſt vertue lies in the Salt.</p>
            <p>The Salt alſo thereof being rightly made, &amp; put into any common Spring-water, doth in good meaſure perform the ſame effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:109520:62"/>The ſpirit of this ſalt is of excellent vertue, if a drop, or two thereof be put into every glaſs of the Spaw-water, for it makes it far more penetrative, and indeed far more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutal againſt all diſtempers, and diſeaſes, as the Dropſie, Gravel, Stone, and ſuppreſſion of Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I adviſe, that they that have any inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or excoriation in their bowels, abſtain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from the taking of this water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will inflame them more; alſo they that have Ulcers, and inflammations in their kidnies, and bladder, and are troubled with a ſharpneſs of Urine.</p>
            <p>Such directions for exerciſe, and diet, as I have preſcribed for the Spaw drinkers, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe alſo to Sulphur-water-drinkers for the general; onely this liberty I grant them, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe may exerciſe leſs, and feed a little more liberally than Spaw-drinkers.</p>
            <p>This water uſed outwardly diſſolves hard tumours, cures old Ulcers, the Scab, the Itch, the Scurff, Leproſie, and all ſuch break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out whatſoever, if the parts ill affected be waſhed, and bathed therewith, for it dries, conſumes all corrupt humours in the habit of the body, and prevents all putrefaction of humours in the ſame.</p>
            <p>It being uſed by way of a warm Bath for the whole body, is of the ſame efficacy, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, that his <hi>liquamen ſalis,</hi> i. e. brine is of, and that is to conſume all humid diſtempers, whether hot, or cold, as the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109520:63"/>
Gout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hard tumours, ſwellings of the legs Leproſy, and the like, alſo it makes the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lean, and reduceth them into a natural dry, firm, healthy habit of body, but it muſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly be done with the obſerving of ſuch rules and directions, as I preſcribed for bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in warm water, as in Chapter the 4.</p>
            <p>I wiſh there were more conveniencies, as fit veſſels for bathing, at this Well, than are, for I believe that after a time, Baths with this water would grow more in uſe, and become as famous as thoſe hot Baths in <hi>Sommerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> for many uſes.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Salt rubbed into any parts ſwelled, or pained onely, cures them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>And as the waters themſelves are outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed for cleanſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and healing, ſo alſo there is a kind of ſlimy bituminous mud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sulphur-well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which will burn like Sulphur, and is of great efficacy for mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, digeſting, and reſolving hard tumours, and for corroborating weak infirm parts, and allaying of pains, and aches in the limbs, of what nature ſo ever, being outwardly applied.</p>
            <p>As I am ſilent in particularizing cures, yet one ſtrange cure I cannot but mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> A certain youth came the laſt year to theſe waters from the more remore Northern parts, having on each finger a horn, covering the top thereof, and alſo a horny ſubſtance on his wreſts, and face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which with the inward, and outward uſe of this Sulphur-water did

               <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Dropping, or Petrifying-well.</head>
            <p>OVer againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Knareſborow,</hi> the River <hi>Nide</hi> running betwixt, ariſeth a certain Spring, in the manner of other Springs in a high ground, which running a little way in an entire ſtream, is at the brow of a deſcent by a dam of ragged ſtones, divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral trickling branches, whereof ſome drop, and ſome ſtream down, partly over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through a jetting Rock, and this Spring is of a petrifying nature, for of it was the Rock, from which it diſtils, wholly made, and is by it daily increaſed, notwithſtanding the cutting off great pieces from it. This water alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſtones where it fals, and likewiſe where it runs, but not all the way it runs, but near the place onely where it fell, the reaſon of which I ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
            <p>If any ſtick, or piece of woodlye in it ſome weeks, it will be can died over with a ſtony whitiſh cruſt, the inward part of the wood continuing of the ſame nature as before. But any ſoft ſpongie ſubſtance, as moſs, leaves of trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the which the water can enter,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109520:64"/>
will thereby in time become ſeemingly to be of a perfect ſtony nature, and hardneſs.</p>
            <p>Now the cauſe of this petrifying property is, as Philoſophers call it, <hi>ſuccus lapideſcens,</hi> i. e. a ſtony matter which is in its <hi>principiis ſolutis,</hi> for indeed the <hi>principia ſoluta</hi> of all things, whether animals, vegetables, metals, or minerals are in a liquid form, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted by degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a natural heat ſeparating from them all accidental humidities, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into their proper ſpecies.</p>
            <p>When the water, with which this <hi>ſuccus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pideſcens</hi> is mixed, is in part waſted by the Sun and air, it doth then depoſite it, as being too heavy for it any longer to bear it. And when that is depoſited, or fallen down, it doth by a continued addition, and concretion in time amount to a conſiderable ſtony maſs.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cauſes of this water, I made theſe three experiments.</p>
            <p>1. I evaporated away the water, and in the bottom was left a ſtony pouder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very like to the pouder of the ſtones of the Rock.</p>
            <p>2. A pint of it weighs ten grains heavier than a pint of common Spring water.</p>
            <p>3. It coagulates milk if it be boiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the reaſon of this is, becauſe for the <hi>principiis ſolutis</hi> of all minerals, nature hath provided ſome Sulphurious acidity for the better fermentation, and digeſting them into perfection. The chief vertues of this water are to allay acid, gnawing, and hot cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109520:64"/>
and to ſtop all fluxes proceeding from thence; It is alſo good againſt burſtneſs, piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of bloud, all overflowings in women, and ſtrengthens the back.</p>
            <p>They that take this water, except in caſe of looſeneſs, muſt every other day take a glyſter, or ſome lenitive as Caſſia, Manna, &amp;c. every other night, in caſe it binds too much.</p>
            <p>This water in many caſes is better than the ſyrup of Coral, and the pouder of the Rock, or rather the pouder that remains upon eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration maybe uſed for Coral; for the truth is, (as is the opinion of many Philoſophers) that Coral is a certain vegetable, fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with a <hi>ſuccus lapideſcens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proportion of the water to be taken is from half a pint to half a gallon, according to the age, conſtitution, diſtemper, and place of the diſtemper.</p>
            <p>The quantity of the pouder is from ten grains to a dram, according to the aforeſaid conſiderations.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Mugnus</hi> Well.</head>
            <p>WHether <hi>Magnus,</hi> or <hi>Mugnus</hi> be the true, and Original name of this Well I could never yet be aſcertained; It is uſually called by the latter. Now whether this Well was Sainted from its real vertues, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109520:65"/>
onely ſuppoſed vertues attributed to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe firſt Sainted, I will not ſtand now to diſpute, but I rather believe the former. Dr. <hi>Dean,</hi> will not have any greater vertues attributed to it, than to common Springs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it onely a bare name, and title. It ſeems the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. was no Catholick, or if he were S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Mugnus,</hi> muſt not be his Interceſſour.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why he will aſcribe no other than common vertues to this water, is becauſe, as he ſaith, it hath no mineral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and faculties, I ſuppoſe he means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible. But to this, anſwer might eaſily be made, <hi>viz.</hi> that waters oftentimes are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with mineral vertues, and ſpirits to, although inſenſibly. Who would have thought that the dropping-well would have yielded a ſtony pouder upon evaporation, and coagulate milk? Beſides if upon experiment nothing could be found perceptible to ſenſe in waters, muſt we alwayes judge of things by ſenſe, and not ſometimes by effects?</p>
            <p>In many mineral waters the ſubſtance of minerales, and metals is mixed, in other ſome the groſs, perceptible vapours onely, and in other ſome, the ſubtile inſenſible ſpirits, or rather atomes, and effluvia's. In this well the laſt onely, and they are the effluvia's of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lead, or Tin mines (as is the opinion of ſome Philoſophers, concerning ſuch kind of Springs) which being mixed with the water, do not onely give activity to its coldneſs (as do cold atomes of the Northen wind to rain
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109520:65"/>
congealing it into ſnow, which will with much handling, heat the hands, and make them even to burn) but alſo a kind of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting nature to it, ſo that when the water hath a little entered into the pores of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it cauſeth a kind of light fermentation amongſt the humours, and by conſequence ſtirs up a heat in the habit of the body, and withall draws out the natural heat into the ſame. And this is apparent, for if any one enter into this water to Bathe, or waſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and abide there but a quarter of an hour, or little more, he will as ſoon as he comes forth, preſently become very hot (his body being all over red) and ſo continue a long time, although he walk in the cold air; nay, although he put not on his clothes.</p>
            <p>Nay, many times tender women, who dare ſcarce waſh their hands in cold water, will adventure to go into it, although it be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than ordinary water, with their linnen about them, and when they become forth, go to the next houſes, and lye in their wet linnen all night, and towards morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſweat, and by this means are cured of many old aches, in what part of the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, and of ſwellings, and hard tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and agues, and indeed many outward diſtempers and ſymptomes cauſed either by cold, or hot humours, the latter being cured by an actual coldneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> if it be a bare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of heat only, for which alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be ſufficient; the former by the heat of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109520:66"/>
the body, being drawn outward &amp; increaſed, whereby humours offending are digeſted, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, &amp; diſcuſſed, or evaporated by ſweat. Alſo ſuch diſtempers as are cauſed by too much chilneſs, and tenderneſs, are hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. And upon this account it is, that they that are very tender in their heads, and wear many caps, and ſubject to take cold upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight occaſion, are cured of this tenderneſs by waſhing their heads, two or three times in a day in cold water: for hereby the open pores, which let in the cold, &amp; through which the natural heat did too much tranſpire, are cloſed, and ſtopt.</p>
            <p>Before any attempt the uſe of this cold Bath, let them firſt conſult with ſome able Phyſitian; and if they pleaſe, obſerve ſuch directions for the ordering of themſelves, as I have given in the fourth Chapter, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bathing in cold water.</p>
            <p>This Well is ſquare, with a high wall about it, and a howſe adjoyning to it, where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make themſelves ready for bathing, going immediatly out of it into the Bath.</p>
            <p>This Spring riſeth high about <hi>May,</hi> and fals low about <hi>September<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any ſhall not approve of my <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> concerning the nature of this Well, let them tell me of one that is more rational, and I ſhall not be aſhamed to learn that, which I am convinced I did not know, or elſe let them embrace mine. The reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing me to declare this of mine is, becauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109520:66"/>
I know it is the unanimous conſent of moſt ſound Philoſophers, that waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through Tin, Lead, and Silver mines, or minerals of a cold nature, may contract ſome imperceptible medicinal vertues from them, (and therefore <hi>H. ab Heers.</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> ſay, that many Medicinal Springs are called <hi>fontes acidi,</hi> from their effects, not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible acid mineral taſt) and alſo becauſe I know that this Countrey yields almoſt all manner of metals and minerals, which an expert Artiſt, aſſiſted with a good purſe, would eaſily diſcover. I believe that many other Springs of this nature might in that Countrey, and other ſuch mineral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries be found out upon examination, and triall.</p>
            <p>Now for the concluſion of all, let not any one judge me to be a Catholick by this my approbation of this Sainted Well, for I am none, and as none my ſelf, ſo neither do I hate thoſe that are, or thoſe of any other heterodox judgement whatſoever. Their living according to their own light, and within the bounds of civility, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground, for me to exerciſe good will, and love to them.</p>
            <p>And as I do not out of any ſuperſtitious account attribute any medicinal vertues to this Sainted Well, ſo neither do I do it out of any affectedneſs to contradict D. <hi>Deane's</hi> judgement.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of my vindication of it, is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109520:67"/>
grounded upon ſome notable cures, which I'have ſeen effected thereby. And the Doctor himſelf acknowledgeth, that it hath, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been very much frequented by all ſorts of infirm people: if ſo, then certainly not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now if it were but their faith in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtrong imagination, (as ſome may ſay) that cured them, yet let them uſe this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any lawfull means elſe that may exalt their imagination, if that may promote their cures.</p>
