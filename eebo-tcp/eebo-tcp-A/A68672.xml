            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:16627:3"/>And becauſe his Lectures, that haue beene before publiſhed by vs, vpon the <hi>COLOSSIANS</hi> and <hi>THESSALONIANS,</hi> as alſo the first eleuen <hi>SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS</hi> heere contained, haue beene receiued with good liking and applauſe of manie: and newe, finding that there are not copies extant, eſpeciallie of theſe eleuen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to ſatisfie the deſire of ſuch as ſeeke them, wee haue thought good to cauſe imprint them ouer againe: as alſo to adjoyne ſeuen other Sermons, preached by him vpon diuerſe Textes, and receiued by his Schollers from his mouth: which indeede wee must confeſſe, required the refining hand of the Author, that they might haue ſhined in their owne beautie: Alwayes, our care haue beene in theſe, as in all the rest before publiſhed, out of ſome copies offered vnto vs, as neare as wee coulde, to giue out to the publike viewe of the Church, both the matter, ſtile, and phraſe of the godlie Author.</p>
            <p>Nowe, for manie reaſons wee are mooued to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende theſe his Sermons, (and our labours therein) to your patronage, that with them your memorie, with the posteritie, might long endure.</p>
            <p>First, in reſpect of the entire loue and affection yee carried to Master ROLLOK from the first houre that yee were acquainted with him, euen vnto his death: for no man euer loued him, conuerſed with him, reſpected him, &amp;c, more than your ſelfe: and manie a time haue you reſorted vnto him in his health, and offered him ſuch curteſie and kindneſſe, that hee acknowledged himſelfe to bee obliged to none ſo much as to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16627:4"/>And finallie, yee not onelie viſited him in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but allured him to come to your houſe, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde of paines and expenſes, yee entertained him, and ſuch as viſited him, moſte liberallie and chearefullie, till the time that the LORD called him to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Yea, yee counted it a ſingular bleſſing of the LORD, that Hee honoured you with ſuh a gueſt.</p>
            <p>Next, Maſter ROLLOK in his Teſtament ordained, that all his Bookes, which after ſhoulde bee imprinted, ſhoulde bee dedicated vnto you: that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer got commoditie thereof, next after GOD, might giue the honour and thankes vnto you.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, through your care, endeuour, and expenſes onelie theſe whole Sermons were gathered in from them that wrote them, through your procurement onelie they were reuiſed, corrected, and made fit for the Printing: by your meanes onelie nowe they ſee the light, which without you had beene buried in darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtlie, if it were free for vs to make choyſe of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, wee woulde make choyſe of none but you, to testifie our thankefulneſſe for your great vndeſerued kindneſſe ſhewed vnto vs particularlie, yea, and to all theſe whome the LORD hath ſet in His ſeruice.</p>
            <p>So that in all reſpectes reaſon requireth, that all theſe Sermons ſhoulde bee publiſhed vnder your patronage and protection: For whereas your name was not prefixed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt eleuen, when they were firſt imprinted: (ſeeing by your endeuour, charges, and expenſes onelie they were firſt ſet foorth) nowe this occaſion beeing preſented, wee

might juſtlie haue beene blamed, if that ouer-ſight by vs had not beene amended.</p>
            <p>Finallie, <hi>Syr,</hi> honour the LORD, and Hee will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, delight in His wayes, and Hee will giue you your hearts deſire, weary not to doe good vnto the Saincts, and He will recompenſe you, &amp; at laſt, will crowne all your good deedes with glorie.</p>
            <p>The LORD make you to goe on from grace to grace, and in all thinges direct you by His Spirite, that yee may bee long happie in this life, and for euer happie in the life to come, Amen. <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 22. of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> Anno Dom. 1616.</p>

The thing preſent, the power of God, the life of Ieſus, this held him vp in ſuch ſort (ſaith hee) that when he was dying vnder affliction in the bodie, yet the

            <p>Will yee looke to the nature of the afflictions, Firſt, they are light, that is one propertie: then they laſt but for a moment, that is another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: the weight of them is light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the time of their during is but a moment: <hi>but the glorie</hi> (marke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word of the Apoſtle) <hi>the glorie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>paſſeth</hi>

Then looke to the time, the afflictions were but for a moment. And if thou ſhouldeſt liue a thouſand yeeres, and bee afflicted as manie yeeres (for all thy dayes, and thy beſt dayes, if thou ſhouldeſt liue neuer ſo well, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then let your eye be euer vpon eternitie of joy, or eternity of pain, eternity either of torment or of reſt. Affliction is but for a moment, this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that paſſeth in excellencie is eternall in time. Loe, how great things are ſpoken in few words! A glorie paſsing in weight &amp; eternitie. And when he hath tould you all that he can, he hath not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the thouſand part of the greatneſſe of that glorie: neuer man thought of it as it is, nor it could neuer enter into the heart of man that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glorie that is prepared for them that loue God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.

            <p>Now I come to the text: I ſhall let you ſee the diſpoſition of the Apoſtle, and what he eſteemeth of this life preſent, whereof we account ſo much, and whereupon our hearts &amp; mindes are ſo ſet to keepe it: All our terrour is for the parting of the ſoule from the body: looke to <hi>Paul</hi> what he doth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16627:7"/>
and behold his diſpoſition, either in life or death: Brethren, wee haue the more neede to take heede to theſe things, becauſe wee ſhall all be put to the proofe, happie is hee that can bee prepared! The Apoſtle hauing ſpoken this, that his eye was ſet on that heauenlie glorie; it might haue beene ſaide, thou ſetteſt thine eye vpon a life aboue: but take heed <hi>Paul,</hi> thou ſhalt die in the meane time, is not life and death two contraries? thou muſt die, and that bodie of thine muſt bee diſſolued: lookeſt thou euer to riſe agine? thinkeſt thou anie other thing but to be diſappointed of life? lookeſt thou that that bodie of thine, beeing diſſolued in duſt, ſhall riſe againe to glorie? This is a ſore tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſundrie thinketh after this maner. The Apoſtle anſwereth, <hi>We know that if our earthlie houſe of this tabernacle be diſſolued, we haue a building giuen of God, an houſe not made with handes, but eternall in the heauens.</hi> Learne a leſſon here: Ye ſee while a man is looking to heauen, he will not be without temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no not <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, nor none other man nor woman, that haue their conuerſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: And the ſpecial temptation of him who wold faine haue life, is death, and the dreadfull ſight of death, and death is euer in his eye: Hee was neuer borne but death will tempt him, death wil be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to fleſh and blood, and when hee is looking vp to that light and glorie in heauen, it will come in betwixt his eye and the ſight of heauen, as it were a terrible blacke cloude, and ſometime will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16627:8"/>
ſunder him and that ſight of Heauen. As when a man is looking vp to the Sunne, a cloude will come, euen ſuddenlie, and take the ſight of the Sunne from him: Euen ſo, when a man is looking vp to the Sunne of righteouſnes, CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, that cloude of death will come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and catch the ſight of CHRIST from him. This is our eſtate here, &amp; there is none acquainted with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie things, but hee will find this in experience, as PAVL did. But what is the remedie? In the firſt word of the Text that we haue read he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieth, <hi>Wee knowe,</hi> and wee are aſſured, for the worde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a full aſſurance, and faith, and a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. Then the remedie againſt this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death is onelie Faith, a full perſwaſion, and light in the minde of the knowledge of the glorie of GOD in the face of CHRIST, with a gryping and apprehenſion thereof: this is the onelie remedie. The man that lyeth in ignorance, and hath not this knowledge, hee is oppreſſed by death. So euer ſeeke, and ſeeke earneſtlie for light, CHRIST is light: and let your pleaſure bee in light, for death is darkeneſſe, and ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h from the face of IESVS. But to bee more ſpeciall, what light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt this bee? what aſſurance muſt this be? Thou muſt knowe and bee aſſured, not that thou wilt bee free from death: naye, beguile not thy ſelfe, die thou muſt, and therefore reſolue thy ſelfe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16627:8"/>
to die: ſo it muſt not be ſuch an aſſurance as to be perſwaded that thou ſhalt not die, opponing thy ſelf to death, ſaying, I wil not die, &amp; I ſhal not die. Then what aſſurance &amp; knowledge muſt this be? Euer this, that after I am dead I ſhall riſe againe to life. It is true, O death, thou ſhalt ceaſe vpon my bodie, and thou ſhalt not leaue it till it bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into duſt, but when thou haſt gotten this body diſſolued, I ſhall recouer a new glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. There is the meeting of this temptation, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelfe of life after death. Seeke this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and labour to pierce, with the eye of Faith thorow the clouds of temptation, to ſee that life in Chriſt, which is hid vp aboue thoſe cloudes. Seeke that eye of Faith, to pierce in through thoſe cloudes, to ſhew thee that life and the Sunne of righteouſnes, Chriſt Ieſus. Nowe, the wordes would be weighed particularly: and firſt, marke a deſcription of this death, and of the temptations that woulde ſeparate thee from that life eternall. The words are theſe, <hi>If our earthly houſe of this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle be diſſolued.</hi> Then what is death? a diſſolution and looſing of a thing that was joyned together, a diſſoluing and ſcattering of the partes of it: it is not an vtter deſtruction of it, the thing that it diſſolueth, it deſtroyeth not vtterlie: It lyeth not in the handes of death to deſtroye the thing it diſſolueth, it may well looſe it and caſt it aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but it cannot deſtroye it. Then death is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and not a deſtruction: a diſſoluing,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16627:9"/>
whereof? not of the ſoule, it lieth not in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of death to looſe thy ſoule or ſunder the parts thereof, thou haſt that aduantage: Death will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and looſe thine houſe the lodging that thou dwelleſt in, that is, this bodie which clotheth thy ſoule: Thou art termed by thy ſoule, and the ſoule properlie maketh a man to be a man, it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe part of man, and the bodie is called the lodging of the ſoule, and the ſoule dwelleth in it as in an houſe: So death is the diſſolution of the bodie, of the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which it looſeth into powder: yea, it wil looſe all the members and parts of the houſe. O! but marke, when it commeth to powder and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, it lieth not in the handes of death to deſtroy the powder and aſhes of the bodie, but that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and aſhes in deſpite of death will be gathered and ſet together in a more glorious forme of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die than euer it was before. Yet looke howe the Apoſtle deſcribeth this houſe: Firſt from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſecondlie from the forme thereof: As for the matter, he calleth it <hi>our earthlie houſe.</hi> This bodie is but claye, euen a lumpe of that claye and earth whereupon thou goeſt, eſteeme of it as thou wilt: yee ſee the matter of this bodie is vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: as for the forme thereof, it is an houſe, not an houſe that hath a foundation, or builded on a ground-ſtone, but a tabernacle and flitting tent: it is ſet down here to day, tomorrow taken vp, and ſet downe in another place: thy body is a pauilion, that men tranſport hither and thither as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16627:9"/>
they pleaſe. Then thou ſeeſt that thy bodie is a thing litle worth, whether thou looke to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof it is made (of the earth) or to the form thereof, an vnſtable tent or pauilion. Now marke this well, brethren, who ſpeaketh this? it is <hi>Paul:</hi> how ſpeaketh he it? by faith: ſpeaketh the bodie this? no: what then? the ſoule that dwelleth in the bodie, as in a lodging ſpeaketh it. The ſoule is ſpeaking of the bodie, the faithfull ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> is ſpeaking of his fraile bodie. Then learne how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith counteth of death: Learne alſo how little the faithfull ſoule counteth of the body, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen then when it is dwelling in the bodie, it will light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the lodging thereof: it will call it a lumpe of claye, a tabernacle, a tent, a fraile houſe: it will count no more thereof, than a glorious king will count of a cottage, he hauing manie faire pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces. We'l, brethren, it is faith that doth this, it is not the ſoule alone that can count ſo lightlie of death, or of the fraile body: if thou haſt onely the ſoule in the bodie, and want this faith, the ſoule will thinke the bodie ſweet to dwell in: It is faith, and the faithfull ſoule that doeth the turne: and there is not a better argument than this, to ſee if thy ſoule bee faithfull or not. Looke what eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou haſt of thy bodie and carcaſſe, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thou makeſt thereof, I ſaye to thee, if thou haſt thy chiefe pleaſure in eſteeming of thy body, decking and feeding it, following thine appetite, wallowing in the luſt thereof, if thou liueſt in ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16627:10"/>
eſtimation of thy body, I ſay, thou haſt a faithleſſe ſoule remaining within thy bodie. Woe to that faithleſſe man, that hath none other pleaſure, not can gripe nor ſeek to none other thing but to the pleaſing of that fleſhly body, without regarde of the precious ſoule: alas! in pleaſuring thy bodie, thou loſeſt thy ſoule, thou makeſt thy bodie thy Heauen, and thou teſtifieſt plainly that thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that light and ſenſe of that Heauenly bodie, which ſhall be after this life. Thus farre for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the death of the body, which is the houſe of the ſoule, learning vs to eſteeme of the ſoule and body, as they are indeed, and that not with a fleſhly ſenſe, but with the Spirituall eyes of Faith.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee come to the life that is contrarie to death. There is two partes of man, his ſoule and bodie: this glorie, of the which wee ſpeake, is not the glorie of the ſoule onely, but the glorie of the bodie likewiſe, a glorie belonging both to ſoule and bodie. <hi>Wee</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>ſhall get a building,</hi> not a ſillie houſe, as this earthly body was, but a faire building. Hee calleth the body, which wee haue preſently, an houſe: but the body which we ſhall get, hee termeth it a building: Thou gotteſt this bodie from nature, that other is aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: nature cannot giue thee that other bodie, GOD ſhall giue thee it aboue nature, and againſt nature. What building is this? It is an houſe, not builded with the hands of men, it is builded with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16627:10"/>
GODS owne hand: the LORD immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with his owne hand builded vp this building. The former houſe of this body was vnſtable, and had no abiding, for this body paſſeth away: but this ſecond building is an houſe that ſhall neuer fall nor ſlit, but ſhall be eternall: When thou ſhalt get this building, thou ſhalt not need to be afraid for the diſſolution thereof, it ſhall neuer be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Where ſhall this building be builded? men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard much ſituation in building: this houſe in the which we dwel here, it is builded in the earth, and it is a tabernacle pitched ſomtimes in this place, &amp; ſomtimes in that place, but the ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this building ſhall bee in the Heauen: for I aſſure thee, when a man is once glorified, &amp; entereth into that glorie, hee ſhall no more returne to the earth. The earth cannot beare a glorified perſon. Chriſt beeing glorified, coulde not abide in the earth, but He went to that glorious manſion in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. Thou ſhalt no ſooner bee glorified, but thou ſhalt mount vp to Heauen as CHRIST did. Well then, there is the glorie, and there is no worde heere, but it aggregeth that paſſing glorie. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie worde l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tteth vs ſee the greatneſſe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and yet it is not all tolde. Nay, <hi>Paul</hi> cannot tell thee all the glorie that ſhall bee in the glorified bodie, he hath giuen but a little inckling of it. It is but a building whereof hee telleth thee: Yet marke, Who is this that ſpeaketh this? It is <hi>Paul.</hi> How ſpeaketh he it? by faith. Is it his mouth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16627:11"/>
that ſpeaketh it? no: it is the ſoule that lodgeth in the bodie, that falleth out in the extolling of that building that it ſhall dwell in. As a ſillie man, in a cottage, appointed to glorye ſhoulde ſaye, I am nowe ſitting in a ſillie houſe, but I ſhall once ſit in a glorious Palace. So marke, Faith will cauſe the ſoule mount vp aboue the bodie, and whilſt the ſoule is in the bodie, Faith and Hope will lift it vp, and put it (in a maner) into Heauen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſame <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the third Chapt. to the <hi>Phillip.</hi> &amp; the 30 verſ. By Faith and Hope hee had his conuerſation in Heauen, while hee was yet dwelling on the earth. Get therefore Faith and Hope, that entereth thee into the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that glorie, and before the ſoule bee ſeuered from the bodie, they will (in a maner) put thee in poſſeſſion thereof. It is the too-looke to heauen that maketh the ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> to rejoyce in this glorie. The cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager that hath not a too-looke to a better houſe, is a foole to deſpiſe his cottage, but hee that hath a too-looke to a better, who can blame him to deſpiſe this cottage? I will tell thee my counſell, before thou diſlodge out of this bodie, for as fraile as it is, be aſſured of a better, goe not out of the houſe doore, except thou knowe that thou ſhalt enter into a glorious houſe. I aſſure thee if thou bee not prouided for a better houſe, and haue not Faith and Hope of a better than that which thou lodgeſt in, thou ſhalt enter in a worſe, thou ſhalt get that bodie againe which was euill
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16627:11"/>
before, but then it ſhall bee a thouſande times worſe: for the ſoule ſhall bee ſhot into that bodie againe, and then thou ſhalt be ſhot both ſoule and bodie into that foule dungeon of Hell. So, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, looke for a glorious building, &amp; thou that eſteemeſt not of this bodie, bee carefull for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A vaine prodigall man will caſt his ſoule out of this bodie, and in the meane time will not bee prouided for a better lodging thereto. Hee is not eſteemed a man in theſe dayes, that wil not hazard and caſt out his life for an euill cauſe and quarell. Truſteſt thou that that ſoule of thine ſhall get any better lodging hereafter, and thou not prouided thereof by Faith and Hope here? nay, nay. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man that dieth in a good cauſe! And what better cauſe can be than Chriſtes cauſe, who is the God of life? Aſſure thee, thou that wilt die for Chriſts cauſe, thou ſhalt get a building in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: thou that takeſt no care of this life for Chriſts cauſe, death ſhall be aduantage to thee. The Lord graunt vs a too-looking to that Heauenlie buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; an aſſurance of that Heauenlie life. Thus much for the aſſurance that <hi>Paule</hi> hath, that hee ſhall dwell in Heauen.</p>
            <p>Nowe in the verſe following, learne howe hee groundeth this aſſurance, and what warrande hee hath for him: Faith is not a word, as to ſay, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue) and Hope is not a word, as to ſay, (I hope) Nay, but thou muſt haue a warrand of thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life or elſe I aſſure thee, in the Name of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16627:12"/>
GOD, thou ſhalt neuer get Heauen: It is a ſtraite way to come to Heauen, and it is wondrous hard to get the aſſurance of it: It is no ſmall matter to get an aſſurance of life euerlaſting after death. Then looke what warrandes this man PAVLE had, that thou mayeſt preaſſe to haue the like. The firſt grounde of his aſſurance is in this ſeconde verſe, <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>wee ſigh, deſiring to bee clothed,</hi> to put on, as it were, a garment: Wherewith? <hi>With our houſe which is from Heaven.</hi> Theſe are his wordes. Then his firſt warrande and ground of his aſſurance is a deſire of that ſame glory. What ſort of deſire?

               </gap>loore thou ſitteſt on is ſighing, and woulde faine haue that carcaſſe of thine to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: The waters, the aire, the heauens, all ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that laſt deliuerance: the glorie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to thee, and yet thou art laughing: Alas! what ſhall betide thee? The other argument hee taketh from the ſighing of men, who haue gotten the Spirit of GOD: We alſo (ſaith he) who haue the firſt fruites of the Spirit, euen wee doe ſigh in our ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodie. Thou that haſt not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Spirit ſhalt neuer ſigh for Heauen: fleſh and blood will neuer ſhed one teare for Heauen. It muſt onely bee the Spirite of IESVS, that muſt fetch vp the ſigh out of the heart, and the teare in the eye, <hi>Roman.</hi> 8. 26. So hee taketh his argument from them who haue gotten a ſenſe of the Spirit of GOD, and redemption of the body to prooue the certainty of that Heauenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory. Nowe, there cannot bee a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer argument to vs that euer wee ſhall obtaine glory, than this ſighing in heart for it, and this earneſt deſire thereof. If thou find thine heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of glory, a ſure argument thou ſhalt bee partaker of glory. It is ſaide, Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt for righteouſnes, for they ſhall be filled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. Seekeſt thou for CHRISTES righteouſneſſe and thy glorie, aſſure thee thou ſhalt get a ſweete filling. Marke it, I ſaye to thee,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16627:13"/>
thou haſt not onlie through this earneſt deſire of glorie, an aſſurance that thou ſhalt reigne in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but (looke to your experience) that deſire is not ſo ſoone begun of that life and glorie, but ſo ſoone alſo the ſoule of the faithfull beginneth to riſe with joye. Who euer yet was hee that gaue a ſigh from his heart, raiſed vp by the Spirite of Chriſt, that felt not with that ſigh a joye in his heart? Learne it by your experience. This letteth vs ſee, that the deſire and thirſt of glory putteth vs in preſent poſſeſſion of a part of glorie. Ere thou come to it deſire it earneſtly, and I promiſe thee, in the Name of the Father, thou ſhalt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put in poſſeſſion of a part of that Heauenly inheritance. It is true thou ſhalt not get it al here, yet there is none other Heauen after this life, but that Heauen which thou getteſt begunne in thee in this life. Alwayes, looke euer for that joye that is by ſight: There are two ioyes, the one by ſight, the other by faith, 2. Cor. 5. 6. The ioye by faith is in our pilgrimage in this life: The ioy by ſight is after this life, when with our eyes wee ſhall ſee Chriſt: The ioy by faith is to looke to Chriſt a far of, and yet wee reioyce, and loue Him that is farre abſent, 1. Pet. 1. 8. Faith hath a ioye that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth, by ſpeaking and thinking: Sight hath the ioye that it enioyeth by preſence: The ioye of the eye great in quantitie, and the fulneſſe of ioye: The ioye of faith not ſo great, for it is the ioye of a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, not as yet come to his home. The ioye of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16627:13"/>
the ſight is when wee ſhall ſee our glorious Lord, face to face, whom we ſee only now by faith. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13 12. This is the fulnes of ioy. The ioy of Faith, which induring our pilgrimage, is not ſo full. O how great ſhal be the ioy at the perfect ſeeing of Chriſt! Thinke never to have the ioy by ſight after this life, except in this life thou have the ioy by faith, as the earneſt-penny of the other, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by Faith thou once get a ioy before thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this life, thou ſhalt never ſee the face of Chriſt, nor have ioy in him. So brethren, it is a good thing to have that deſire of Heaven: Sigh and ſob, and deſire with <hi>Paul</hi> for Heaven: for it is a Charter &amp; Evidence of thine everlaſting inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: &amp; never earthly lord had a ſurer charter of his land, than thou that haſt a deſire of heaven, haſt of thine inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in heaven: for theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly evidences of land are without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their kiſts but this evidence of thine is written &amp; ingraffed in thine hart. Now, when extremity is threatned, it is time to ſeek thy warrands of this heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly in heritance: this preſent country is good forthee, &amp; the beſt country that ever thou ſhalt ſee, except thou find this warrand of ſighing, and deſire for that heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And therfore let ſcorners &amp; mockers ſcorn as they wil, the children of God muſt powre forth tears: And this is it that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord hath bene deſiring theſe many days paſt, he hath benegently drawing out of us this ſenſe, but now He beginneth to preſſe it out of us, that our eyes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16627:14"/>
might burſt out in teares: and thou that canſt not ſob, and deſire in theſe miſerable dayes to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, thou haſt no true matter of ioy. Woe bee to them that have none heart to ſigh for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Chriſts Church, but are ever ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgement againſt Gods ſervants when the Lord is viſiting them. Well, the Lord ſhall wring out teares out of them in His wrath, that will not ſob in the time of the danger and trouble of His Church. Then what is it that Pavle ſigheth for? And what deſireth he? Hee deſireth a new cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee put one above as a cloathing that is, he would keep this ſame body in ſubſtance, and caſt off this filthy garment of ſinand death, &amp; put on that glorious ſhape of the body of Chriſt. The reaſon is ſet down, <hi>For when the Lord ſhal cloath us, we ſhall not be found naked.</hi> So this body ſhall remaine in ſubſtance but <hi>O</hi> the glory and immortality of it! Mark the natur of the lodging which we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it ſhal not be another body in ſubſtance, than this body which we have heer in earth. The ſame body in ſubſtance wee ſhall have in heaven, which we have heer. Heerein onely is the difference, this body is vile, it is mortall, full of ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, unglorious, ignominious, full of corruption, weak infirm, But when this body ſhall be changed in heaven, it ſhall not be changed in ſubſtance, but in qualitie <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. 43. 44.

Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this miniſtreth comfort: there is none of vs, but naturally we loue this body: then let this comfort thee, that ſuppoſe thy ſoule ſhall bee for a time without this bodie, yet thou ſhalt get it again. Another comfort: death cannot deſtroy it, the graue ſhall not bee able to ſwallow vp that body, but the graue ſhal keep it, &amp; the duſt &amp; ſubſtance thereof till the comming of Chriſt, &amp; then it ſhall be compelled to render it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Life ſhall ſwallow vp death,</hi> but death (nor the graue) ſhall not be able to ſwallow vp the bodie of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Elect: But the reprobate ſhall be ſwallowed vp of death, both in ſoule &amp; bodie. In the 8. chap. to the ROMANES, the 10. and 11. verſes, <hi>Paul</hi> miniſtreth theſe two conſolations againſt death, Hee ſaieth, <hi>The bodie must die, becauſe of ſinne:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:16627:15"/>
but hee ſubjoyneth, The ſoule in the meane time ſhall liue: and the Spirit of Ieſus ſhall take it &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it with that blood: And albeit it was a ſinfull ſoule, yet aſſoone as the Father blinketh vpon it, wimpled and wrapped, as it were, in the blood of Ieſus, immediately hee biddeth it paſſe to glorie. He goeth forward: And where it might haue bene ſaid, shall we haue no conſolation in the body? He anſwereth, If the Spirite of Him that raiſed Ieſus from the dead, dwell in your mortall body: what then? He, that is, GOD the Father, that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, He, by His Spirit, ſhall raiſe your bodies: that ſame body that is dead and laid in graue, that ſame body, by Gods Spirit (for the Spirit of Ieſus, and the Spirite of the Father is all one) ſhall be raiſed vp Learne then, if this holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God once take lodging in you, He ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue you in ſoule nor body, He ſhal accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the body in the graue, and conuoy the ſoule to Heauen: The Spirit of Ieſus ſhall goe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, &amp; lift it vp: The earth getteth the body, when the ſoule is ſeparated from it, yet the Holy Spirit ſhall goe to the graue with the body, and ſhall remain with it in the graue, and with the leaſt part of the duſt thereof: And when Chriſt ſhall come, He ſhall gather it together, and make it a whole body. So, happy are they that haue once lodged this gueſt in their ſoules: for, neither fire nor water, nor none other power, euer ſhall bee able to deſtroy them, becauſe that Holy Spirit euer remaineth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Now in the next verſe, becauſe it might haue bene ſaid and objected, Thou wouldſt not want the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why ſigheſt thou then? and what meaneth this deſire, if thou wouldſt keepe the body? <hi>Wee</hi> (the faithfull) <hi>that are in this tabernacle, we ſigh, &amp; are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,</hi> (but marke our deſire) <hi>becauſe wee would not be vnclothed,</hi> (as ſome will ſay, Soule to God, and bones to the dung-hill, in contempt of the body: but thinkeſt thou to be glorified in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body? No) <hi>but would be clothed vpon, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie might bee ſwallowed vp of Life.</hi> As if hee would ſay, I wold haue this faire cloke of glory put vpon this body, that it might conſume and ſwallow vp all this ſtinke of ſinne that is in the body. Learne then firſt, the body as it is now is a burthen.

               </gap>n with childe, to bee relieued, what is the ende of this deſire? The ende of the mourning of the Godlie, is not that they woulde bee quite of the houſe, as manie deſire, that were wrong: for manie will mourne vnder this houſe deſperatelie, and the bodie will bee a burthen to the ſoule in them, and their life will be vnpleaſant to them: they will thinke to get a reliefe of the burthen by the want of this preſent life, and will put hand in themſelues: but then beginneth their euerlaſting mourning, for they neuer knew what mourning was till that end come. So then, this is not the way to bee deliuered of the burthen, but the way is, To ſeeke to put on a cloathing on this bodie, and heere is the ende of our deſire. It is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with mortalitie, and that is all the matter of thy mourning: It is not the ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that cauſeth thee to mourne, but ſinne, that poſſeſſeth thy bodie, and corrupteth the marowe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16627:17"/>
of thy bones, death accompanying ſinne. Then this mortalitie beeing an accident of ſinne, which is the chiefe cauſe thereof: the remedie is, Seeke to bee cloathed with the life that commeth from Chriſt: Sucke in, by Faith, a droppe of that life of Chriſt. This will not deſtroy thy bodie, but it will deſtroy the death &amp; ſinne that poſſeſſeth thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And the life of Ieſus Chriſt in a moment wil ſwallowe vp all that death and ſinne, and all that miſerie that laye on thee: There is the way to dwell with eaſe in the bodie: Seeke not to deſtroy the bodie, But ſeeke the ſlaughter of that ſinne and death that lieth vpon thy bodie, otherwiſe ſoule and bodie both ſhall periſh, the houſe ſhall fall downe, and the man that lodged in the houſe ſhall bee deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Remember then, Life and Death are not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to bee ſcorned withall, they are not wordes, nay, nay: Thinke grauelie of them, and before thy ſoule bee diſlodged, looke that thou bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a better life: Looke that thou finde the LORD of Life CHRIST IESVS by His Spirit working the death of mortalitie in thee, and the beginning of the Life that ſhall laſt for euer. The LORD by His Spirit worke theſe thinges in your heartes. To whom bee all Praiſe, Honour, and Glorie, for euer and euer,</p>

Firſt hee beginneth to comfort himſelfe and all others that are to die, and to be diſſolued, againſt death, &amp; the terrours of death. He (as he ſaith in the chap. preceeding &amp; 18. verſ.) is looking vp to Heauen, and whilſt he is looking vp to Heauen, to ſee that end that he was once to attaine to, there cometh in betwixt his ſight and the light of that glorie and life, a cloude of death, to haue caught away out of his eies (if it had bene

poſſible) all too-looke to life euerlaſting. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medic againſt it, wee ſhewed you was Faith, and a conſtant Hope, with a ſharpe, earneſt, and ſtedfaſt looking, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pierce in throrow death, and that cloude of death, and thorow death to get a ſight of that life, and light of glorie, which lieth hid vp in Heauen beyond death. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>and are aſſured, that our bodies and the earthlie houſe of this tabernacle, ſhall bee diſſolued, yet wee ſhall get a building for an houſe, a building that is from God, not made with mens hands, but an eternall building, that is ſituated in the Heauens aboue the carth.</hi> When hee hath ſet down this remedy, he beginneth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfe and others, by a ſure Faith, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death he ſhall liue againe, after the diſſolution of his mortall bodie, hee ſhall receiue a glorious bodie. The firſt argument of his aſſurance is from the deſire hee had of life, ſighing with an earneſt deſire of that Kingdome which is from Heauen. This deſire neuer diſappointed man: Neuer was there anie man that had an earneſt deſire of life &amp; glorie, and had the true knowledge and meane to attaine to this glorie, that was diſappointed of his deſire: but who euer deſired moſt earneſtlie to be glorified, moſt certainly they liue now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and at this houre they are glorified there: and none there ſhall be that ſhall haue this deſire, and ſtriue to throng into Heauen violently, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. but they ſhall enjoy Heauen after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting. Now in the Text which we haue read, we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16627:19"/>
followe out the aſſurances and warrandes which the Apoſtle hath of the glorie of the life to come. The ſecond aſſurance and warrand of the life to come is in the firſt words, <hi>Hee</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that hath created vs for this thing, is God,</hi> &amp;c. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the life to come in theſe words, is from the ende of our creation, GOD hath created vs to this ende, to wit, That in the ende this mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wherewith wee are clothed, might bee ſwallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vp of Life: therefore, liue muſt wee in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. This is the ende of our creation, therefore it cannot faile, but wee muſt bee glorified. Learne then, The maner of our glorifying is this: It is GOD, not man, that hath made vs, and created vs to this ende: It is impoſſible that GOD can be diſappointed of the ende which He ſetteth before Him of His worke: man may bee diſappointed, for hee will begin a worke for ſome purpoſe, but oft times hee will bee diſappointed of that purpoſe: Hee will build an houſe to dwell in, but it may be hee neuer dwell in it, another will dwell therein. GOD, when He worketh a worke to anie ende, it is impoſſible that Hee can bee diſappointed. All the world, if they would ſtand vp, and oppone to GODS worke, they cannot hinder it. That worke that GOD worketh in vs, is ſuch a worke that tendeth to Life, as to the ende thereof. <hi>Who ſhall condemne vs?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is God that justifieth vs, Roman.</hi> 8. 33. Will Hee juſtifie thee? all the world ſhall not bee able to condemne thee:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16627:19"/>
Will Hee ſaue thee? all the worlde ſhall not bee able to make thee periſh: So is it of His whole Church in generall: Suppoſe all the worlde were conſpired againſt His Church, He wil haue it ſafe: and wonderfully worketh He the ſaluation of His Church, &amp; euery member thereof: through death He bringeth them to life: ſo that it is folly to men to ſtriue againſt the works of GOD. Yet looke to the wordes, <hi>Hee that hath created vs to this end, is God.</hi> What creation is this that he meaneth of? Is this that firſt creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua?</hi> of euery one of vs in them that was at the beginning? Not ſo, that creation failed. Indeede wee were firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue, and thorowe that firſt creation euerie one of vs got a certaine right to liue for euer, but that right wee loſt in our owne default, wee are fallen from that right of our creation in the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> So we muſt ſeeke another creation, or elſe wee ſhall neuer ſee Life: for wee haue no right to that firſt creation, which was in all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to the image of GOD, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. If thou ſticke to that firſt creation and olde birth-right, thou ſhalt neuer ſee Life. Then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meaneth of another. What other making or creating of vs is this? It is our regeneration or renewing againe, which is nothing elſe, but as it were, a newe birth and begetting, from the which we are called new creatures, 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 17. Then, Brethren, wouldſt thou haue a ſure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that thou ſhalt liue after this life? (&amp; wo to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16627:20"/>
thee, if thou liueſt not after this life! woe to them that euer ſawe this worlde, and they get not a life after this life! for this life will away) Looke if thou art regenerated and renewed, looke if thou art ſanctified, and findeſt a ſlaying of thy luſts within thee: Looke if thou findeſt the life of God by his Spirit working within thee, not this naturall life, but this Heauenly and ſpirituall life begunne in thee not by nature, but by grace: If thou haſt this, thou haſt a warrand that thou ſhalt liue: and albeit this naturall life ſhall bee taken from thee, thou ſhalt get another life euerlaſting in glory: but if thou findeſt thy ſelf not renewed by the Spirit of grace, take this life from thee, thou ſhalt not get life euerlaſting in glorie. So looke if thou be a newe creature, thou haſt gotten a greater grace, than to be borne to an earthly kingdome, if ſo be thou mayſt aſſure thy ſelfe of lif euerlaſting. What is this newneſſe in the new creature? This newnes that is in the new creature, is nothing els but that ſame life which we ſhall liue in Heauen, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here. This newneſſe is only this new life of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which life ſo long as thou liueſt heere (from the time that thou haſt gotten a ſponke thereof) piece and piece eateth vp the olde and cankered nature. The life of God within thee, will conſume (euen as thou conſumeſt the meat thou eateſt) the olde corruption which lieth in thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and in the ende, in the glorious reſurrection of the dead, it ſhall bee altogether aboliſhed. This
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16627:20"/>
life then, which is begunne heere, it ſhall open the mouth, and ſwallow vp death, and death thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall haue no more place. This life is onely ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp by little and little death heere: but at that time it ſhall ſwallowe it vp wholly, and thou ſhalt ſay with <hi>Paule, Death is ſwallowed vp,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. So well is the ſoule that hath a warrande of his new creation, whether he die in his bed, or out of it, he ſhall die with joy. Then my counſell is ſeeing death is daylie threatned, let euery one ſtriue to get this aſſurance of this new life begun in him heere, that it may ſwallowe vp death: Woe bee to them that haue not this aſſurance! This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life euerlaſting. I pray you marke theſe aſſurances, for <hi>Paule</hi> had ſuch an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that hee ſought all aſſurances and warrandes of this life, and hee is reigning now in Heauen. So thou, who thirſteſt after life, learne at him. Nowe reſteth the thirde warrande in the next wordes, <hi>Who alſo hath giuen vs the earnest of the Spirite.</hi> Learne the words, for al the doctrine riſeth of the words. Then the third warrand is the Spirit of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in thee. If euer thou mindeſt to haue life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, thou muſt haue Gods Spirit in thee: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thine owne Spirite, but Gods Spirite, flowing from God through Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; entering into thy bodie &amp; ſoule. Beholde the liberality of God, when Hee by His Spirite hath renewed thee, Hee will not take that Spirite from thee, as a man will doe, when he hath builded a worke, hee will take
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16627:21"/>
his hand from it, ſtand if it will or not: But the Lord doeth not ſo, Hee hath renewed thee by His Holie Spirite, which Hee putteth within thee. O how the Lord putteth the third perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in thee, and maketh Him an earneſt-pennie to thee of Life euerlaſting: Becauſe thy regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vnperfect, and thou haſt not yet attained to that Life, therefore Hee letteth His Spirit abide in thee, aſſuring thee as an earneſt-pennie, that whatſoeuer God hath promiſed, He ſhal perform it to thee, and thou ſhalt not bee diſappointed of a jot thereof. Such is the infidelitie of our nature, that all the promiſes, all the othes which He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to confirme His promiſes, all His Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which Hee hath joyned to His promiſes, cannot perſwade vs. But looke to this thirde warrande, Haſt thou the Spirit of God, if Hee bee in thee, He will bee quicke, working joye with ſighs: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be idle, Hee will be working the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation both day and night: <hi>Then anger Him not, Epheſ.</hi> 4. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>30. Away with filthie cogitations, away with euerie rotten worde, away with euerie euill deede, labour to pleaſure Him day &amp; night, and ſtriue to keepe Him, and thou ſhalt hauea warrande of life in thy boſome, and when thou art dying thou ſhalt find ſuch ſweetneſſe in death as is wonderfull to tell. None euer had the Spirite of God, but in death they had vnſpeakable joye. Then ſeeke to bee in Chriſt, and get His Spirite within thee, and hauing gotten this Spirite, keepe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16627:21"/>
Him diligently, and powre out thine owne ſpirite but never Gods Spirit, for then in all diſtreſſes thou ſhalt have comfort. Now to reſume all: Yee who take great pleaſure in your Charters, the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your inheritance and land, take heed to this, Your inheritance is in Heaven, and thou art a foole, who thinkeſt that thou haſt an inheritance in earth: For either ſhalt thou be pulled from it, or it ſhall bee pulled from thee: Nay, looke as ever thou wouldeſt be an inheriter, that thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be in Heaven: Thou art the fooliſheſt begger, and the pooreſt that ever was, if thou bee a King, if thou thinkeſt thine inheritance to be in earth: Having laid this count with thy ſelfe, Mine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is in Heaven, then next looke that thou have thine evidence. For thou ſhalt never poſſeſſe Heaven, except thou have the evidence thereof laid up in thy charter kiſt. Now thine evidences are the ſame euidences that <hi>Paul</hi> had, and the ſame kind of evidences ſerve for all, it is an inheritance that all men muſt get, one ſort of charter muſt ſerve for one inheritance. What then can be the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and evidence? Canſt thou ſigh for that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance? Canſt thou have a deſire of it: There is thy firſt evidence: Then findeſt thou thy ſelfe to bee renewed? Findeſt thou CHRISTS life in thee? <hi>The life of Ieſus is manifeſt in me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. Findeſt thou the wicked life of this world reformed? There is the ſecond evidence. Yet more, findeſt thou the worker of the deſire, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16627:22"/>
the worker of thy regeneration, the Spirit of Chriſt within thee, then keepe him well: There is the beſt evidence of all the evidences of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: having theſe, aſſure thy ſelfe of Heaven: but wanteſt thou theſe, or any of them, thou ſhalt never get that inheritance in Heaven. As theſe three are three evidences of thine heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, ſo they are three props of Faith that gripe this Heavenly life: They are the three pillars that hold up Faith, which is builded upon them: cut one of theſe pillars away, and thou ſhalt loſe Faith and Hope. But here it may be asked, Are all theſe three of the nature of the life to come? I anſwere, As for the deſire, ſighing, and ſobbing for that heavenly inheritance, it endeth with this life, and in that life to come <hi>all weeping ſhall bee taken away,</hi> REVEL. 21. 4. Mourne and groane in time, then heereafter ſhall come ioy, aud pure ioy. A trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ioy is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eere in this life, but heereafter there ſhall bee a pure and ſolid ioy, and nothing but ioy. So this mourning ceaſeth then, and is not of the nature of the life to come but as to the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and regeneration, it is of the nature of the life to come, and it is the beginnning and firſt part of that heavenly glorie: ſo that our heavenly glorie ſhall bee none other thing but the per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yting of our regeneration: For when all this pelffrie ſhall be taken away, then wee ſhall fully bee renewed. As to the Spirit, if ever hee was powerfull in earth, he ſhall be more powerfull in Heaven: ſo that the ſame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16627:22"/>
Spirit that heere dwelt in thy body, ſhall then glorifie thy body, and make it to ſhine brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Sunne: Therefore let vs ſeeke this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the Spirit of CHRIST: For in theſe two ſtandeth the perfection and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the life to come.</p>
            <p>Now, when he hath reckoned out all the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands of life, whereby he aſſureth himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee concludeth in the next ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And albeit the body ſhall lie heere in graue, and ignominie for a time, yet all that ſhall bee recompenſed by the glorious ſight of CHRIST, which the ſoule ſhall enjoye in the Heauens, beeing ſeparated from the body. Wee thinke we can haue none Heauenly glory and joy, except wee haue this earthly body there: It is true indeede, the ſoule cannot haue ſo great joye, as if the ſoule and body were together: but it is alſo true, that the ſoule beeing ſeparated, hath greater joye in Heauen, than the ſoule and body can haue together in this earth.

In a worde, it is a full aſſurance and perſwaſion of the heart, that when we are dead, concerning the body, yet we ſhall liue againe, and ſhall receiue at the handes of God a more glorious body than euer this bodie was.

naturall reaſon of man cannot, nor will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that hee once beeing dead, the bodie beeing diſſolued in aſhes, that euer that bodie ſhall bee recouered againe. Therefore, the Apoſtle bringeth in three argumentes of this aſſurance: The firſt is the earneſt deſire that the Godly haue in this life to be glorified: It is a thing impoſſible that this deſire can bee in vaine: Hee that giueth thee a deſire of glorie and ſighing for it. He muſt giue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thee the life and glorie that is deſired and ſighed for: For otherwiſe Hee would neuer giue thee grace to ſigh once for this life and glorie except Hee were purpoſed to put thee in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that glorie one day. The ſecond argument is taken from our regen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ration, or the end of our regeneration. GOD is Hee that maketh vs of new againe, after we were diſmaide by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Hee createth vs of newe againe, to this ende, that wee ſhould liue the firſt creation. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded indeede, and wee haue loſt the right thereof, euen in the firſt creation. Wee were created to liue euerlaſtingly, yet wee died. But the ſecond creation in <hi>IESUS</hi> will neuer breake: but as in him wee are renewed to life, liue ſhall wee in the Heauens euerlaſtingly, it can neuer faile. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his firſt epiſt. chap. 1. verſ. 3. <hi>Wee are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againe into that liuely hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third argument is the Spirit of CHRIST, whereby GOD worketh in vs both the deſire and regeneration: hauing once giuen vs that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16627:30"/>
He taketh Him not from vs againe, but letteth Him dwell in ſoule and bodie, to bee an earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennie in vs, aſſuring vs He ſhal neuer leaue vs, till the whole promiſes in CHRIST be fulfilled to vs. And therfore He is called <hi>the Spirit of trueth. (Iohan.</hi> 15. 26. Notwithſtanding, of all this confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and aſſurance, vnder-propped with theſe three pillers, Deſire, Regeneration, and the Spirit, the Apoſtle hath not full contentation of heart, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe he ſeeth not the LORD. Hee is yet wandring as a pilgrime in this world, &amp; hath not gotten that joyfull countenance of CHRIST, in the which countenance is onelie ſacietie of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: For aſſure you, the faithfull heart ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue contentation till it ſee CHRIST. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to attaine to this thing, and to get the full ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the heart, he maketh choiſe of death and remouing out of the bodie: hee preferreth it to all grace that can be had in this life.

            <p>Yet, Brethren, becauſe the words are weightie, euery word would be weighed: <hi>We couet,</hi> ſaith hee, there is the firſt worde, and in the firſt language this word importeth not onely a common deſire, but an ambition: So by this word he vttereth that he is griedy of honour, and ambitious: for there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an holy ambition that is lawfull, that is requiſite, that is needefull in euery Chriſtian man, euen in the pureſt man that is. But to come to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he coueteth: <hi>We couet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we may be acceptable:</hi> There is the honour, to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to bee counted and liked of. The worldlie man that hunteth after the honour of the worlde, he deſireth to be eſteemed of, to bee had in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to be in grace. So is it with the man of God the honour which he deſireth is eſteematio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would be accounted of, hee would bee in grace and good liking, and if it were poſsible, he would be eſteemed aboue all the men in the world: but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16627:31"/>
whome would hee haue to eſteeme of him? The worldly ambitious man would bee accounted of by men, hee hath no regarde of GODS eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, hee would haue the Prince accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him aboue all Courtiers: hee would haue the people accounting much of him. But the man of GOD, that hath this holie ambition and griedineſſe of honour, hee careth not for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation of men, neither ſeeketh his praiſe of men, but of GOD, and CHRIST, with whom hee muſt dwell after this life: hee deſireth in this pilgrimage, to bee aſſured, that CHRIST hath a liking of him, that after this life hee may reigne with CHRIST as a king for euer: That is his honour.</p>
            <p>To goe forward in the wordes: When ſeeketh hee to bee acceptable to CHRIST? at what time? There is two times: One time of liuing, and another time of dying: A time when the ſoule dwelleth in the bodie, and another time when ſhee flitteth. The ambitious holie man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to bee acceptable to the LORD at both theſe times, both dwelling at home, and flitting from home. All the honour of the worldlie man is in this life, and whilſt the ſoule is dwelling in this bodie: But once laide downe in his bedde, and let death aſſaile him, there hee layeth downe his honour: and if yee tell him of the honour which hee was ſeeking, hee will ſpitte at it. But the godly man, if euer he was griedy of honour in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16627:32"/>
this life, in the houre of his death he is griedier thereof, and the nearer death, the griedier of the honour of CHRIST: hee can haue no contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heart, till hee know his ſoule is acceptable to that LORD whom to hee is going.

The worldly man is cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his honour by vnlawfull meanes, by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, by falſhood, &amp;c. but it endeth in miſerie.

haue bene dead: but here is another deſire, which muſt goe before that, and thou muſt haue the like deſire, before thou deſire to flit out of this bodie and to bee with CHRIST. Firſt deſire, whilſt thou art in this bodie, to bee acceptable to Him, and then deſire to flit, otherwiſe not: for certainely, if thou die, before thou bee acceptable to GOD in thy life, thou ſhalt not bee welcome to Him, and he ſhal be the moſt terrible ſight to thee that euer thou ſaw: I ſhall neuer deſire to ſee Him when I die, if I deſire not to bee acceptable to Him firſt in life and death. Therefore, ſtudie by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſcharge of thy duetie heere on earth, to bee acceptable to thy LORD, beguile not thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Learne againe heere. When hee hath made a choiſe to goe and dwell with the LORD, hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that hee may liue a godly life heere firſt: then the leſſon is, A godly life heere is a too-looke to that life which wee ſhall haue in CHRIST, which maketh a faithfull Pilgrime deſire to bee with CHRIST. It is an eaſie thing to haue an eye to the life to come, if thou ſtudie to liue well in this life. And on the other part, it is the hope of that life and glory to come, and an eye to Heauen that maketh a Pilgrime to liue well in this life: where this eye to Heauen is not, there is no good life. Wherefore ſhould we ſpeake further? Alas! theſe euill liues of men, theſe murthers, adulteries, thefts, tell vs plainely, there is no ſight of Heauen, nor regarde of the life to come.

            <p>Now in the next verſe, hee ſubjoyneth another argument, moouing him to bee ambitious to bee with that LORD of life. The firſt argument was, becauſe hee was to dwell with that LORD in Heauen. The ſecond is, that terrible Iudgement that all fleſh ſhall ſee, except they endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſerue GOD in this life: <hi>For</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>wee must all appeare before the Iudgement-ſeate of CHRIST.</hi> Learne a leſſon of the pith of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. As there is a force in the hope of the life to come, ſo there is a force in the feare of a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iudgement, to mooue a man to liue well here. Looke howe needefull the one is to cauſe thee to liue well in this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as needefull alſo is the other. Hope of life is needful, feare of judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: what ſhould be the cauſe of this? knoweſt thou not thy nature, how backward &amp; froward it is? ſo that except thou be pricked forward with terrors of judgement, thou wilt neuer addreſſe thy ſelfe to Heauen, but wilt linguer &amp; ſit downe by the way.</p>
            <p>Brethren, There are two things in Heauen, and two thinges in earth, both ſeruing to mooue vs to liue well heere in this life: In Heauen there is two ſeates, one of Grace, which is called, the Throne of grace: The other a ſeate of Iudgement,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16627:33"/>
a Tribunall: Fie on all tribunals in the earth, in reſpect of that Heauenly Tribunall! The Throne of grace is ſpoken of to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chapt. 4. verſ. 16. Let vs goe boldly to the Throne of grace that wee may get mercie. But this will not ſuffice, except the Tribunall of judgement be alſo before thee, to draw thee forward: both muſt bee before thee: and as thou lookeſt to the Throne of grace with the one eye, ſo look to the Throne of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the other eye. There are alſo in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner two thinges in earth, to draw thee forward: The one, the Goſpell of grace, The other, the Law threatning judgement. The Goſpel drawing thee louinglie to GOD, the Lawe threatning thee to goe forwarde, or elſe thou ſhalt die. The Goſpell gently alluring thee forwarde, promiſing that thou ſhalt get life: The Lawe ſtanding about the Goſpell as a fire, to terrifie thee, and if thou goe out of the right way, it will burne thee. It will not bee the Goſpell alone that will ſerue the turne. Indeede, if there were no canker in thee, the Goſpell would ſerue the turne: but in reſpect of this wicked canker in thy nature, thou muſt be threatned with the Lawe. Seeſt thou not thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? fairnes will not ſerue the turne, thou muſt be pulled forward by the haire, or elſe thou wilt fall into damnation. Take me away the rebukes of the Law, if thou bee a king or a Monarch, it is but a dead Goſpel to thee, ſuch is the corrupt nature of man: Take away the canker of the nature of man,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16627:34"/>
I ſhall ſpeake nothing of the Lawe: but as long as this canker remaineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Law muſt threaten all, from the king to the begger. I were a falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, if I vſed not the threatning of the Lawe to rebuke this canker of nature. Who is more holie than <hi>Paule</hi> was? He<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looking vp to Heauen, ſeeing the Mercie-ſeate, likewiſe ſeeth the Iudgement-ſeate, and if hee had not ſeene the Iudgement-ſeate, and beene terrified therewith, hee ſhoulde neuer haue gotten a ſight of that Mercie-ſeate: ſo muſt it bee with vs, wee muſt ſee that Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeate, as well as that Mercie-ſeate. This is wonderfull: Hee was euen nowe ſpeaking of CHRIST as a ſweete LORD, and faine would bee at Him, and nowe againe hee ſetteth Him vp as a Iudge to terrifie men. Is this the LORD, at whom he would bee? Who deſireth to appeare before a terrible Iudge? Who hath life and death in his handes? Take heede: this is <hi>Paules</hi> meaning: The LORD IESVS Hee is both terrible to men, and joyous to men, and Hee muſt bee both joyous and mercifull indeede, to thee who endeuoureth thy ſelfe to pleaſe Him in this life: Terrible to them who endeuoureth them not to pleaſe Him in this life. Wouldeſt thou haue Him mercifull to thee, ſtudie then to liue well ſerue Him ſincerely in thy calling. Wilt thou haue Him terrible to thee, thou ſhalt indeede finde Him terrible to thee, and thou ſhalt ſhake &amp; tremble at His countenance, in caſe thou ſeeke not to pleaſe Him in this life.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16627:34"/>
And this ſhall bee the firſt ſight that euer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, who deſired not to pleaſe Him in this life, ſhall get of Him. Heauen and Hell are thought jeſts &amp; mocks now adayes: &amp; this Tribunall is not looked too, but certainely thou muſt appeare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the Throne of Mercie, or the Tribunal of Iudgement.</p>
            <p>Yet to goe forward in the wordes: I ſhall only touch them, without diſcourſing on that generall judgement. Then firſt heere to let you ſee the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſſe of that judgement, there is an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof <hi>Eſaias,</hi> in his 45. Chapter, and the 23. verſe thereof, and <hi>Paule, Roman.</hi> 14. 11. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>As I liue</hi> (ſaieth the LORD) <hi>all knees ſhall how to Mee, and all thinges ſhall confeſſe Mee to bee GOD.</hi> There is the reuerence that ſhall bee at that appearance, all kinges in the earth ſhall bow their knees: &amp; the tongue that would not ſpeake in this earth to GODS glory ſhall then bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſpeake to His glorie. Then there is firſt an appearance: Secondly an neceſſitie, Thou muſt appeare: Thirdly, an vniuerſalitie, all ſhall appear, without exception, all ſhall be called and all muſt anſwere, <hi>Hic ſum,</hi> I AM HEERE: None ſhall bee away, man nor woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rich nor poore, from <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, to the laſt man borne on the earth. Then fourthly. The ſeate before the which this appearance muſt bee, is a Tribunall: the Iudge is CHRIST, IEHOVAH, GOD not man onely: all knees ſhall bow to Him as GOD, and not only to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16627:35"/>
CHRIST as GOD, but to CHRIST in our nature, as man, he ſhall ſit as a glorious Iudge, as it is ſaide, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 5. 22. The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Sonne. And as there ſhall bee one appearance of all, ſo there muſt be one receiuing: none ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare but ſomething they ſhall receiue. What ſhall bee receiued? A reward of thy actions and doinges in thy bodie, which rewarde ſhall apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the bodie as well as to the ſoule, becauſe thou didſt them in the bodie. As to the qualitie of the rewarde, it is proportionall to that which thou haſt done in the bodie, bee it good or euill: if it bee good, thou ſhalt bee rewarded with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: if euill, thou ſhalt bee rewarded with ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and ſhame.</p>
            <p>To inſiſt ſomething vpon the laſt wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Papiſtes ſticke to them, and thinke they haue an aduantage of this place: when they heare that euerie one ſhall receiue according to the thinges which they haue done in the fleſh, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent they conclude, ERGO, workes merites. I anſwere, Euill workes indeede merite damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and damnation ſhall bee thy portion for them, if thou bee out of IESVS: but good workes haue no merite: in all thy good workes there is no deſeruing, althogh they were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more than they are. There is force enough in an euill work to condemne thee, but in a thouſand good workes no force to ſaue. The Apoſtle ſaieth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16627:35"/>
not heere, They ſhall receiue a rewarde for that which they haue done, but according as they haue done: hee ſaieth not <hi>Propter,</hi> making workes a cauſe, but <hi>Secundum,</hi> that is, according to the teſtification of the works. But to leaue the larger inſiſting in this, as more pertinent to another place, and to come to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Weigh the wordes, for euerie worde is a worde of weight, importing a terrible Iudgement, an Appearing, a neceſſitie of appearing, an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall appearing without exception, no reſpect of perſons, of the king, more than of the begger, no mitigation of the ſeueritie of the Iudge, &amp;c. CHRIST will haue no mitigation, but if thou bee a reprobate, thou wilt bee handled ſeuerelie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou bee a king. The judgement then, being ſo terrible, the Iudge, CHRIST, muſt alſo bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: And ſo the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>Knowing, therefore, that terrour of the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And all this is to learne euerie ſoule, not ſo to preſume of the mercie of CHRIST, that thou ſhalt thinke to finde Him mercifull in that daye, except that thou haſt ſtudied to bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto Him in this life, and canſt ſay, LORD, I EMPLOY MY SELFE IN SERVING THEE. Away with that preſumption of mercie, which maketh the lowne, when hee is mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thering and committing adulterie, to ſay, GOD is mercifull. Hauing ſet downe the terrible Iudgement, hee concludeth what he will doe in his owne perſon.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16627:36"/>
Is the judgement and Iudge ſo terrible? I will bee wiſe: the LORD giue vs this wiſedome. <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that terrour of the LORD</hi> I will do my duetie in this life. My duetie is to preach, to bring men to the faith in CHRIST: I will walke in the diſcharge of that duetie night and day. Hee ſaith, <hi>Knowing perfectlie that terrour of the LORD:</hi> It is not a blinde terrour that will make a man to doe his duetie in this life, but it is the knowledge of a Tribunall: to belieue that there is a Iudge and a Tribunall in Heauen, and that there is a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day abyding. And if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belieued that there is a Tribunall in Heauen, a terrible Iudge ſitting there to take account of his doinges in earth, for all the worlde hee would not offende that GOD: but this cannot ſinke in the heart of man: Hee will ſay, there is a generall judgement, but this is from the mouth onely, and not from the heart: and ſurely, as long as a man continueth in ſinne, albeit hee ſhould ſweare that there is a Tribunall. it is a token hee knoweth it not. The wordes of judgement auaile nothing: it is the belieuing, and ſure knowledge that there is a judgement, and a terrible Iudge to ſinners in Heauen, that doth the turne. Therefore, ſeeke perſwaſion, and looke to that Article of thy Creede, that the Iudge ſhall come, and take account both of the quicke &amp; the dead: Belieue it, and then it ſhall draw thee to liue a godly life. <hi>Knowing, therefore, that terrour of the LORD, wee perſwade men,</hi> or cauſe them belieue.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16627:36"/>
Hee ſaieth not, I goe to play the part of a king, or of a politicke man, I am buſie in this or that turne that appertaineth not to my calling: No, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my calling, I preach the Goſpell, to perſwade men to belieue in CHRIST, that they may bee ſaued. To ſpeake the trueth, it is not thy labouring and doing in any other mans calling, that will profite thee, but thou art ordained by GOD to doe thy duetie in thine owne calling: and when the account of thy deedes ſhall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that Great day, hee ſhall not ſay, what haſt thou done in another mans calling? but, what haſt thou done in thine owne? I made thee a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, howe haſt thou traueled in that vocation? Therefore I ſaye, as euerie man would bee readie to giue an account of his doinges, let euerie man bee diligent in his owne vocation, ſeeking the glorie of GOD therein.</p>
            <p>Nowe it might haue beene ſaide to <hi>Paul,</hi> Thou boaſteſt much of thy doing and preaching: but looke with what ſinceritie thou haſt beene occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and with what vprightneſſe of heart thou haſt beene preaching in thy life time? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and firſt hee taketh GOD to bee witneſſe of the ſinceritie of his heart in diſcharging his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie: and then hee taketh the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> among whome hee had traueled, to bee witneſſe alſo of his ſinceritie. As for GOD, hee ſaieth, <hi>We are made manifest vnto GOD:</hi> And as for men, <hi>I trust alſo I am made manifest in your conſciences.</hi> Hee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16627:37"/>
taketh firſt GOD to bee witneſſe, who knoweth the heart, and then the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who ſawe his actions.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, it is not enough for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that preacheth CHRIST as <hi>Paule</hi> doeth, for to perſwade men to belieue in CHRIST, to ſpeake outwardlie to men, as I am now ſpeaking to you, but hee muſt looke in the meane time, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie his heart be ſet vpon GOD, that is, looke that he approoue his heart in ſinceritie to GOD, who ſeeth the heart. Men marke the wordes that come out of the mouth, but GOD marketh the ſinceritie of the heart, to ſee with what ſinceritie the man ſpeaketh. This that I ſpeake of <hi>Paul</hi> in his calling, I meane of all other men in their callings. Doeſt thou anie thing outwardlie to men, looke that thou doe it inwardlie in thine heart, with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie to GOD, otherwiſe thou loſeſt all thy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, albeit it were neuer ſo good in the preſence of men. Of this it followeth, al theſe are but vaine voyces, to ſtand vp and ſay, I haue done this thing or that thing. To ſpeake to men, who knowe not the heart, except in the meane time, as thou art ſpeaking vnto men, thou mayeſt draw the LORD to bee witneſſe (as <hi>Paule</hi> doeth) to the ſinceritie of thine heart, and may ſay, I haue beene trauei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with what ſinceritie the LORD knoweth: that which I haue done, I haue done it in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: not being content to call GOD onelie to bee witneſſe, he turneth him to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16627:37"/>
appealeth their conſciences to beare recorde of his ſinceritie in his doing, and hee ſaieth, <hi>As for you,</hi> Corinthians (ſpeaking ſparingly) <hi>I trust. &amp;c.</hi> Hee was aſſured of GODS teſtimonie, but hee truſted, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo would beare him recorde, that hee had traneiled truelie: Hee ſaieth, <hi>in your conſciences.</hi> It is to bee marked, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth to their conſciences, not their mouthes, but their conſciences: for the mouth of man will giue one teſtimonie, but the conſcience will giue another: And when the conſcience will bee ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the man hath ſpoken truelie and in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the mouth in the meane time will bee backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting him, and the conſcience will ſay, thou lyeſt mouth. Speake, therefore, euer according to conſcience for if thy conſcience ſpeak one thing, and thy mouth another, thou ſhalt bee challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a lye. It is true indeede, men knowe not the heart of man, as when a Miniſter is ſpeaking, yee cannot judge of his heart, the LORD jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, yet a faithfull and ſincere man, hee will vtter ſometime the inwarde ſinceritie of his heart in his wordes and deedes, that all that ſeeth and heareth him, will looke in therethorowe, and ſee the inwarde ſinceritie of the heart, and giue an outward confeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, then in this example of <hi>Paule,</hi> yee haue ſuch a proteſtation, as the faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor ſhoulde make in the houre of his death, and which ſhould be his teſtament. There is two things
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16627:38"/>
in his Miniſterie, the outwarde ſpeaking, and the inwarde ſinceritie of the heart. If hee would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of his faithfulneſſe, looke that hee proteſt as PAVLE did: Firſt outwardly, I haue vſed all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in diſcharging all the outward partes of my calling, I haue kept nothing abacke: and then inwardly, As for my ſinceritie, Firſt I take GOD to bee witneſſe, who knoweth and onely ſeeth mine heart, with what ſinceritie I haue ſpoken, and then I take you to witneſſe, that haue beene conuerſant with mee, ſo farre as yee can knowe the inwarde ſinceritie of mine heart, by my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and outwarde actions. Woulde to GOD wee coulde haue this ſinceritie. And I praye the LORD graunt mee this ſinceritie: and I beſeech Him, that as Hee hath beene with mee ſince the beginning of my Miniſterie, ſo Hee would neuer leaue mee, vntill the time I finiſh my courſe with joye. to His glorie, and comfort of His CHVRCH, through IESVS CHRIST our LORD,</p>
            <p>To whome, with the FATHER, and the Holie GHOST, bee all Honour, Praiſe, and Glorie, both now and euermore, So bee it.</p>

And yet for all this wee heard that the Apoſtle had not that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation nor full ſatisfaction of his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he is yet a pilgrime, liuing heere by confidence, and hath not gotten the full preſence of his LORD, hee chooſeth to leaue all the thinges in this life, and therefore, hee taketh reſolution what hee will doe in life and death, to the ende, that when hee commeth to his LORD in the Heauens, hee may bee welcome. The thing hee reſolueth to doe is this, hee endeuoureth himſelfe in his calling to be acceptable to Him in life and death: and hee will conſecrate all the actions and ſufferinges of both to Him. Beſide that glory to come, which moueth him to ſtudie to bee acceptable to his LORD, he ſetteth downe another motiue, a terrible Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall which abideth him and all men and women, who ſtudie not to bee acceptable to the LORD. The ſoule ſhall not ſo ſoone depart out of the bodie, but it ſhall alſo as ſoone bee preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Tribunall, and ſhall receiue that dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſentence, if they haue not ſtudied to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Him.

LORDm we trauell in our calling to preach Chriſt, and to bring men to faith, and that not for the faſhion, but in ſinceritie of heart: ſo that wee take God (who ſeeth the heart) to be witneſſe to vs of our ſinceritie. And as to you, <hi>Corinthians,</hi> vpon whom we haue beſtowed our labour, wee appeale to your conſciences, and wee take you to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that ſame ſinceritie of our calling. This is the ſumme of all which ye haue heard hitherto in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now to come to this Text which we haue read: In the firſt verſe, the Apoſtle hauing ſpoken of his ſinceritie in preaching, the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who had not that liking of him which they ſhoulde haue had, might haue objected, Well <hi>Paule,</hi> yet vaunteſt thou of thy ſelfe? thou haſt once vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of thy ſelfe (as appeareth in the ſecond and third Chapters preceeding) and yet art thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending thy ſelfe?

This is the meaning of this verſe.</p>
            <p>Then, this Text beeing plaine, learne theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:

That they, vnto whome the Lord hath made him a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, vpon whom hee hath beſtowed his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, may glorifie God, and render vnto him the honour of a Miniſter. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaieth, 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 1.

Therefore, the Apoſtle ſaieth, 2. <hi>Cor. 12. 11.

Then learne, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt not be borne with: it is pernicious both to the man in whome it is, and to other men who haue adoe with him.

            <p>To come to the next verſe: Yet they will not let him bee: yet they will object vnto him his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe.

            <p>Then, Brethren that which God counteth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the world counteth it fooliſhneſſe, and that which the worlde counteth wiſdome, God coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it fooliſhneſſe.

Was there any bragging here? So the wiſdome of God is fooliſhnes to the world, &amp; ſhal be, as long as corrupt nature is within vs: And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 19.

rauiſhed in ſpirit, and to be content to be counted a foole in this world, that God may bee glorified, and men helped forwarde to Heauen. If God bee glorified in my madnes, what regard I to be mad? what reſpect is to be made of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world? and what if men goe to ruine and decay, ſo that God bee glorified? But alas! there is ſuch a ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue ingraffed in the heart of euery man, that wee wil not ſuffer God to be honoured, except it may ſtand with our honour. &amp; we will ſay, I will not be eſteemed a foole, I will not be diſgraced: if it may ſtand with mine honour and profite I will glorifie Him: but if His honour and mine ſtand not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will chiefely haue reſpect to mine own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

And it ſhould be the greateſt endeuour that euer we ſhould haue in this world, to caſt out this ſelfe-loue, that we may be content, that God may bee glorified, although it were to our diſhonour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it were with our deſtruction. It is not ſelfe-loue that bringeth honour and glory, onelie honour is of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; thou ſhalt neuer get honour except thou caſt away ſelfe-loue, that God may bee glorified.</p>
            <p>Then to go forward: <hi>Paul</hi> muſt haue ſomthing for him, why he will bee mad for Gods cauſe: hee will not bee mad without ſome reaſon: therefore, in the next verſe he ſaith, <hi>For the loue of God conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs:</hi> as if he would ſay, I am conſtrained to this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16627:43"/>
fooliſhneſſe, and a charge is laide on me to doe ſo. I am bound and obliged ſo to doe: that is, to be a mad man for the glorie of my GOD. And from whence commeth this neceſſitie? It is the loue of God, ſaieth hee, that conſtraineth mee: this bande that bindeth me is the loue of Chriſt not the loue which I beare to Him (that is too weake) but the loue which H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e beareth to mee, it bindoth all my ſenſes, and vrgeth me to honour my God with my whole bodie. Theſe are the words. Then the verie neceſſitie which lieth on thee to bee a mad man for GODS cauſe, it is not a thing whereof thou canſt free thy ſelfe: there is a neceſſity aid on thee to bee counted mad for Chriſtes cauſe. Then, if there be a neceſſitie laid on vs to doe this (albeit it bee to our owne diſhonour) what if wee doe it not, but will ſhake off this yoke? Then I tell thee, in place of it, another neceſſitie muſt come in, a neceſsitie of woe. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaieth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Woe to me if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> God hath laid this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity on me to preach, and if I caſt it off, another neceſsitie of woe ſhall be laide on mee Alas! this world thinketh all this worſhipping of God to be voluntarie, that men may ſerue GOD as they pleaſe, and that men may preach as they pleaſe, this way, or that way, and ſpeake heere, and holde their tongue there, as they will. But I ſay to thee, Wilt thou free me of that neceſsitie that lieth on mee? Art thou able to take it off my backe? If thou bee not able, then for GODS ſake let mee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16627:43"/>
preach the Goſpell with freedome and ſinceritie of heart. I tell thee, There is ſuch a neceſsitie laide vpon the ſhoulders of the Miniſters to vtter euery thing which the Lord putteth into their mouthes, that if thou ſhake off this neceſsity another neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of woe ſhall be laid vpon them. And this ſhall be their crie on their dead-bed, Woe to mee, that I preached not the Goſpell truelie.</p>
            <p>Yet to goe forward. From whence commeth this neceſsitie? Hee ſaieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It is the loue of GOD that conſtraineth mee</hi> It is the loue of Chriſt which Hee ſhewed in His ſuffering for me, that bindeth mee. So, it was the loue of Chriſt towardes <hi>Paule</hi> that moued him patiently to be called mad for Chriſts cauſe. Chriſt, for the loue which He did beare to vs, ſuffered Himſelf not only to be called mad, but to be called a Deuill, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 24. He ſuffered the extremitie of paine and ignominie for our ſakes: and all the reuilinges and reproches that ſhoulde haue lighted vpon vs, Hee tooke them vpon Him. Such was His loue towardes vs. Then, wilt not thou ſuffer to be called a mad man for His cauſe? If thou wouldeſt haue a part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which Chriſt conquered, thou muſt bee bound, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt be laide vpon thee, and if thou bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thou art looſed from the loue of IESVS, and then woe and euerlaſting deſtruction ſhall come vpon thee. I ſee then, all our ſeruice of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is of neceſsitie. Then what pleaſure can bee in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of CHRIST, if it bee conſtrained ſeruice? The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16627:44"/>
thing I am compelled to doe, I will haue little pleaſure in the doing of it: In deed it is true, thou art not looſe, but bound: From the time that thou entereſt into the Church of Chriſt, thou entereſt into bonds: but there is a great difference betwixt band and band: one band will binde thee &amp; force thee to do a thing, whether thou wilt, or wilt not: Another band will only leade thee the right way, which thou art to goe.</p>
            <p>Brethren, this band that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of in this place, it is a ſweete band the band of the loue of Chriſt, and it bindeth thee ſweetly and louingly to diſcharge thy duety towards God: and all thy duety by this band is voluntary: and hee who is bound with this ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, will rejoyce more to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a foole for Chriſts ſake, than to be eſteemed a king vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. But thou muſt take heed where this band is that bindeth thee, that it may leade thee to doe thy duetie willinglie: If the loue of Chriſt, which is the band, be outwith thee onelie ſounding in thine eare (as when it is tolde thee, Chriſt loueth thee) I tell thee it wil not bind thee. All the preaching in the world will not bind thee, if it be without thee: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, therefore, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 5. 5. <hi>The loue of God is ſpread abroad in our hearts, thorow the holy Spirit that is giuen vs.</hi> Then, that that loue may binde thine heart it muſt bee powred in thee, and when it entereth into the heart, it looſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart with ſuch a ſweetneſſe to doe Gods will as is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable: it bindeth the heart with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16627:44"/>
joye. Would to God wee had a taſte of this loue! All is but words. There ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as that is, from once the Spirit hath powred the loue of Chriſt in thine heart, then let all our trauels be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we heare of theſe things, to get a ſenſe of the loue of Chriſt in our hearts. Al the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in the world will not mooue thee to doe thy duety ſo much as the feeling of this loue of Chriſt towardes thee. And nothing will bee able to ſtay thee from Chriſt, and honouring Him (and it were with thine owne ignominie) if once thou haue a ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>In the next verſe hee giueth two reaſons why the loue of Chriſt conſtrained him: The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is taken from that miſery that Chriſt founde him in, when he ſuffered for him: The ſecond is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ende of the death of Ieſus. As to the firſt, this was our miſerable eſtate before Chriſt loued vs, <hi>we were all dead:</hi> how proueth he that? <hi>If one be dead for all, then were all dead:</hi> if thou hadſt not bene dead, in vaine Chriſt died for thee: if thou hadſt bene but halfe dead (as the Papiſts ſay, who vaunt of their free will) the Sonne of God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer died for thee: if <hi>Paul</hi> had had this free will, and ſo bene halfe dead, Chriſt had neuer died for him: and if there were none other argument but this, To import that there is not a free wil, nor ſponke of godlines in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by nature, it is ſufficient to ſay, Chriſt hath died for all: we were without all ſponk of free will to good, when Chriſt came.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:16627:45"/>Marke the force of the argument. It is from that miſerable eſtate and ſpirituall death wherein CHRIST found vs, when Hee beganne to beſtow His loue vpon vs. Wee were dead ſpirituallie in ſinne, dead in treſpaſſes. What is this corporall death to bee reſpected, if thou bee dead in ſinne, thou art worſe than a carion.</p>
            <p>This ſpirituall death ſhould moue vs to thinke that the loue of Chriſt was wonderfull towardes vs: it ſhould euer make vs aggrege that loue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with He hath loued vs: Hee died for thee, who was dead in ſinne and treſpaſſes, and ſo an enemie to Him. Who is hee, ſaieth the Apoſtle, that will die for his enemies? <hi>Roman.</hi> 5. 7. Thou being dead in ſinne, thou liuedſt in ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo liuedſt an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the life of CHRIST. And therefore, thine heart can neuer ſufficientlie aggrege the benefites of His death. Men are miſerable, but alas! they feele it not: thou haſt no want nor ſcant of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but thou wanteſt ſenſe: and the leſſe feeling thou haſt of thy deadnes, the greater is thy dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for the ſenſe of death is the beginning of life: the more thou wanteſt the ſenſe of death, thou art euer the deader: the liuelier the ſinner is, leaping and playing in his wantonneſſe, the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is hee in ſoule: For hee hath a burthen vpon his backe, that will preſſe him thorowe the earth, and make him ſinke to Hell one day: and in the meane time, he is running to his miſchiefe and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, and knoweth not that hee hath death euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16627:45"/>
vpon his backe. O wo be to that miſerable catiue, although he be a king! Alas! men are dead in ſinne, and halfe in Hell, and will not conſider it. It is a pitifull thing to conſider howe there is no ſenſe of this infernall miſerie, that followeth vpon this death: When it is tolde them, The LORD hath died for them, they will make none account of it. The word of the Croſſe of Chriſt hath beene to the multitude of this Land but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a vaine ſounde, and they haue neuer eſteemed of ſuch a mercie. And therefore what wonder is it to ſee theſe vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! O SCOTLAND! thou ſhalt get another wakening, thou haſt ſo long contemned grace, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt precious thing that euer was. The Lord ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be Lord, if He ſuffer ſo long contempt and lightlying of Chriſt and His loue vnpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde argument is taken from the ende and purpoſe that Chriſt had in dying: looked Hee to this end, that thou ſhouldeſt play thee, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine own luſt? that thou ſhouldeſt abuſe that life, which He had bought ſo deare with His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood? No, his purpoſe was, that not only in his death &amp; ſatisfaction thou ſhouldeſt be juſtified &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted juſt but alſo that thou ſhouldeſt be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, that thou ſholdeſt caſt off the works of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, &amp; dedicate thy life in holines to him: it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>that he roſe again, that he might be Lord ouer thy life:</hi> For there was neuer man, that had ſuch a right to an earthlie thing, as Chriſt hath to thy life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then doe what euer may pleaſnte him,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16627:46"/>
if it were to die a thouſand times, if it were to bee a foole for His cauſe, what euer may pleaſure Him ſet thee to doe it, or of neceſſitie thou ſhalt loſe that life of thine: But here is the miſery: Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know not wherefore Chriſt died: Will yee aske men and women, when they are bathing themſelues in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, if they will goe to Heauen? they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, yes, they will goe to Heauen before their feet be colde. But, vaine lowne, thou neuer knewſt Chriſtes purpoſe in dying for thee, His purpoſe was, that thou ſhouldeſt be a new man, and thou ſhouldeſt not liue to thine owne ſelfe, but to Him. And the end ſhall proue (if thou proceed ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liuing to thy ſelfe, &amp; not to Him who died for thee) that the death of Chriſt had neuer force in thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, looke if thou liue to Chriſt: and if thou doeſt ſo, then aſſure thy ſelfe Chriſt died for thee. Looke if in the morning thou canſt ſay, Lord, thou died for me, I will giue thee my life, and conſecrate to Thee this day, all mine actions, and all that I haue. Well is the ſoule that can ſaye this way. Then all turneth to this, Seeing Chriſt died for me, I will take this reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will liue to Him al my dayes. The Lord grant vs this reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we may liue to Him in this life, that herafter we may liue with Him in Heauen for euer: To whome, with the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, and the Holie GHOST, be all Honour, Praiſe, and Glorie, both now and euermore, So bee it.</p>

Another argument was taken from our own eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were when He ſhewed this loue of His vpon

vs, wee were dead in ſinne and treſpaſſes. So this miſerable condition that we did lie in, which was the beginning of Hell &amp; euerlaſting damnation, ſhoulde mooue vs neuer to thinke on pleaſing of our ſelues, but onely to pleaſure Him who hath deliuered vs from ſuch damnation. The third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was taken from the purpoſe which the Lord had in dying for vs: to wit, that the life that was bought by His death ſhould bee conſecrated to Him, and employed in His ſeruice: for, beeing once redeemed by Him, we are no more our own men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but His who hath bought vs. And therefore, as the ſeruant ſetteth his eye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his lord, waiting to pleaſure him: euen ſo in all our actions with our whole minde wee ſhoulde bee ſet to pleaſure our Lord, who bought vs, when we were bond-ſlaues to ſinne and Sath in.

Imploy it in His ſeruice, or elſe thou ſhalt imploy it in the ſeruice of a worſe man. And euerie one ſhould ſay for their owne parts as <hi>Paul</hi> did for his part, Hath Chriſt died for me to this purpoſe, that I ſhould liue to Him, then will I take purpoſe, and will reſolue in mine heart to giue Him the life that He hath purchaſed to mee by His death: this was His purpoſe in His death concerning mee, I will not diſappoint Him of His purpoſe: that life that He hath wonne to me, I will conſecrate it to His ſeruice. It is true, thou canſt neuer diſappoint the Lord of His purpoſe, His purpoſe ſtandeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooueable: the man to whom He looked in His death, hee muſt liue: and euerie man, for whome Chriſt died, was in His eyes when Hee died. No godlie man was out of His minde in His ſuffering, but He ſaide in His heart. I will die for this man, and for this woman, that they may liue to mee. So He will not be diſappointed: But looke thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint not thy ſelfe: If thou ſayeſt, Chriſt died for me, and in the meane time thou wilt not giue thy life to Him, but wilt liue to thy luſts, and not to Him, thou of neceſsitie in the ende ſhalt bring thy ſelfe to a miſerable point. There is nothing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16627:48"/>
in the world that a man ſhould take more heede to, than to the life to come, to their maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heere, and to the actions that they haue in hand, and the thinges about the which they are occupied in their conuerſation: for if thou haue a conſcience, thy conſcience will tell thee by thine actions what part thou haſt in CHRIST: if in thine actions thou be ſeruing Him, thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience wil tell thee thou haſt a part in the LORD, whom thou art ſeruing: and thou in the meane time (if thou bee but eating thy dinner) if thou doeſt it to His glorie, thou ſhalt finde a ſweete apprehenſion of the death of CHRIST, and it ſhall raiſe a great joye in thine heart. But by the contrarie, if thou be euill occupied, and about to do an euill deede, thy conſcience within thee will giue thee a ſecrete warning, and will ſaye, O man! thy worke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth thou haſt nothing adoe with CHRIST, and thou ſhalt find in thine hart no comfort of Chriſts death, nor of His reſurrection. So it is good to be well occupied, euery man in his owne calling, and in all his doings euer to haue CHRIST before his eyes, who hath giuen him this life. Wouldeſt thou then trie whether the deedes that thou doeſt, bee ſeruice done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord or not, I ſhall tell thee how thou ſhalt know (I will not ſpeake of outward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens) but looke day and night within thy ſelfe to thine owne heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what thou feeleſt there: feeleſt thou a conſcience by night and by day, teſtifying to thee that thou art vpon a good courſe, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

Well art thou, if thou finde in all thy doinges a ſweete apprehenſion of CHRISTES death and reſurrection: if thou finde it not, woe is thee, leaue that deede, away with it: Away with all buſineſſe that will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a joye of conſcience in CHRIST, and will not make thee to ſaye, CHRIST is mine, I am doing Him ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to come to the purpoſe: The ſpeciall point of ſeruice that ſhould be giuen to CHRIST is ſet downe in theſe wordes: <hi>From hencefoorth know wee no man after the fleſh:</hi> Theſe are the wordes, weigh them. The ſpecial point of ſeruice ſet down here, is the right eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, among whom we liue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world. It is no ſmall matter to eſteeme of men &amp; women as we ſhuld do. The rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle will eſteeme of them, is not in the fleſh, nor by fleſhly doing, that is, by none<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward thing: All theſe outward things as kindred, nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, beautie, wiſdome, worldly eloquence, riches, honour, &amp;c. with all the reſt of theſe things which men hold in admiration, are nothing. This is not the rule of the Apoſtle, nor we ſhould not by that rule eſteem of them. How then? What is contrarie
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16627:49"/>
to the fleſh? the ſpirite. What is contrarie to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? grace. What is contrarie to the olde man? regeneration. Then what ought to be the rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the which wee ſhould judge of men? the ſpirit, grace, and regeneration. But ye will ſay, Are not all theſe worldlie thinges benefites of God? ſhoulde not men bee eſteemed of for them? I anſwere, The Apoſtle ſpeaketh not ſimplie of them, but in compariſon, in reſpect of the ſpiritual graces. The nobilitie of the king is but dung in reſpect of the leaſt droppe of the blood of Chriſt: the leaſt ſponke of grace is worth whole nature: the leaſt portion of Heauenlie glorie is worth all the glorie in the world: the leaſt ſponke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is worth all the genealogies that can bee in this worlde. When Chriſt commeth with His ſpirit, grace, and regeneration, all theſe earthlie prerogatiues vaniſh as the miſt.</p>
            <p>Then marke: There is the ſpeciall point of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice done to Ieſus, diſcerne betwixt dead men and liuing men in this world: Dead men are they who are natural men and no more. Haſt thou no more but nature, with all the prerogatiues that can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe nature, thou art dead, although thou bee a king. Liuing men are they who are borne againe by Chriſt. Haſt thou the Spirit of Chriſt, thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt: wanteſt thou the Spirit of Chriſt, thou art but dead. So there is a ſpeciall point of Chriſtes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, diſcerne betwixt liuing men and dead men thou art in the middeſt of them, and liuing men
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16627:49"/>
on the one hand, &amp; dead men on the other hand: Diſcerne betwixt them: Count not of the dead man, although hee had all the prerogatiues vnder Heauen: If he haue no more but nature, call him not bleſſed. The liuing man is hee that hath the Spirit of Chriſt in him, albeit he be a begger: and the men who make an account of their worldlie prerogatiues, and follow nature and the olde ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, are but naturall men: thou that accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of dead men, thou art dead thy ſelf, &amp; as thou art dead, ſo all thine eſtimation is of dead men.</p>

So the thing that cauſeth people to eſteeme of men for their earthly prerogatiues, is, becauſe they ſee not the glorie &amp; graces of CHRIST. Would the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue eſteemed ſo much of Herod, if they had knowne the Majeſtie of the Great GOD, when they called him a god? <hi>Acts,</hi> 12. 22.

            <p>Nowe to goe forward: Yee haue heard of the purpoſe that the Apoſtle taketh in ſeruing of his LORD, by the right eſteeming of men in this world, among whome hee liueth. In the next verſe he commeth to the eſtate of this world &amp; ſheweth what alteration was made in the world, by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration made in the perſon of IESVS: for when IESVS altered, all creatures altered with Him: when He went from the earth to the Heauen, and left behinde Him all theſe earthly pleaſures, there followed a wonderfull change and alteration in all the creatures.</p>

Then learne of this firſt, looke the force of the alteration of IESVS, when Hee altered from earthlie things to Heauenlie glorie, man eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie altered with Him.

And this preferment hath man aboue all the Heauens and aboue al the creatures. The maner how this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe is this: Ere thou bee altered, thou muſt bee raiſed vp to Him, and joyned with Him, and ingraffed in Him as an impe in a tree: then He and thou, and thou and Hee, being made one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the glorie that is in Ieſus ſpreadeth her ſelfe oued thee, &amp; couereth thee. But if thou bee not in Him, thou ſhalt neuer get any part of His glory. Looke

that thou be in Him by faith (for faith ingraffeth thee in Him) and beeing in Him, thou ſhalt get a part of His glory: and yet thou art but a creature, and not a creator. The difference is in newneſſe, thou was made before olde, but now made newe, greene &amp; liuelie, being once ingraffed &amp; planted in Chriſt thou art flouriſhing. It is true, all theſe things are not ſeene yet, and this flouriſhing of vs in Chriſt is not found yet perfectlie: and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Him with vs is not ſo ſenſible as it ſhall be: but this ſhall once be found true, we ſhall find that wee were the ſonnes of God, and newe creatures, when wee were on this earth: and wee ſhall get the accompliſhment of our felicitie in Heauen, when we are reigning in glory with Him. Now, as to the reſt of the creatures, hee ſaith, <hi>Olde thinges are past by, behold, all thinges are become newe.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Beholde:</hi> Marke the word: hereby ſtirring vp their hearts to ſee the alteration and renewing of theſe creatures, ſeing it is a thing difficill to be belieued by men.

ſpeake of the inferiour creatures, and their eſtate, of this Heauen, Sunne, Moone, Starres, Earth, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. that were created for the vſe of man, theſe creatures from the beginning euer altered with man.

When man fell, they fell alſo, the Heauen fell from his perfection, &amp;c. the earth was accurſed for man (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20.) As man grew olde that is, as hee grewe in ſinne, vnto the time that ſinne came to the height (which fell in that ſame period of time when CHRIST came into the world: then the Apoſtle ſaieth ſinne ſuperaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all was vnder ſinne.

Againe, after CHRISTS comming, when man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne of new to degenerate and grow olde, then the creatures alſo beganne to grow olde.

Learne here: ye ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures get renewing as well as man, but (marke the difference) in the ſecond roome: Man is firſt rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, then the creatures are renewed: Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath his preferment firſt, next the creatures are renewed, but not after that maner that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is renewed and preferred: for man is firſt graffed in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he is made one with Him. Ieſus the Head, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, the body, and euery faithfull man and womans member of that body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. 23. But the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when they are renewed, they are not ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in Chriſt: The Heauen, when it is renewed is not called to that honor to be ingraffed in Chriſt, it is no part of the body of Chriſt: The earth when it is renewed, is no part of the body of Chriſt. No, no ſuch conjunction is betwixt Chriſt and thoſe creatures, as is betwixt Him &amp; His Church. Then, ſeeing theſe creatures that are renewed with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are not honoured with that conjunction which is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16627:53"/>
with Chriſt the Lord, it muſt follow, that the glory of the creatures is not equall with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glory of man. When the Heauens ſhal be made new &amp; very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yet all ſhall be nothing to that glory of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thou, O man, ſhalt ſhine in body aboue the glorie of the Sun by a thouſand ſtages, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 43. The conjunction of Chriſt not being ſo made with the creatures, as it is with man, the glory of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compared with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of man, but al the glory of the creatures ſhall be as a participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the glory of man. Thou ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhalt be glorified with the glory of Ieſus Chriſt himſelf: the creatures ſhal bee glorified but with thy glory. All this telleth vs what glory wee ſhould looke for, ſeeing this Lord that maketh this renovation, is ſo glorious. It is certain that at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt in the world, and His paſsing vp to the Heauens, a renewing of all the creatures in the world was made, al things were renewed. This is a ground that we muſt hold if we belieue that Chriſt came in the world, &amp; hath aſcended to glory Alas! this is not perceiued, and in my ſelfe I cannot ſee it as I would, &amp; the moſte godly complain, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee this effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſtes glory. The cauſe is, the deadneſſe that abideth in vs ſin ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be gotten out of this world, till the Lord come again: it dwelleth in vs. and reigneth in the world, &amp; the Deuil, the prince of this world, reigneth by it (for where ſinne reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, he reigneth) yea, it oppreſſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly heart, that they can ſcarcely feele in themſelues this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16627:54"/>
ſo weighty is ſinne: who ſeeth it? There is a glimmering of this newe creation, but who hath this glimmering? None, but that new ſoule: an vnregenerate man neuer ſawe this regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither in himſelfe nor in others, and hee cannot ſuffer to heare of a regenerate &amp; ſanctified man, hee will laugh, as though there could not bee ſuch a thing as regeneration: becauſe the ſcorner himſelfe is vnrenewed, therefore hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weigh GODS graces in others: So long as thou art vnregenerate, thou canſt not but ſcorn regeneration, yea, and perſecute the regenerate man, and ſo raſh thine head againſt a wall: For the LORD hath made him inviolable, and the Temple of His Spirite, and therefore He ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee, that art the vnregenerate man: yea, and deſtroyed ſhall euerie man bee that daſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the Church of IESVS, that is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed body, that body, as an yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wall, ſhall bruiſe them. Experience telleth this. Who euer was hee that raſhed againſt the Church, but the Church hath beaten him into powder? Meddle not with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saincts of God: although it were but one Sainct renewed by the grace of God, hee is ſufficient to deſtroy and bruiſe a whole kingdome that raſheth on him. The Lord open mens eye, to ſee this. For all the world would not I bee one to make oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to one of the Saincts of GOD. The LORD therefore ſaue men, and learne them to account of this renouation, as they would haue a portion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16627:54"/>
thereof, &amp; be glorified at the comming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to end ſhortly. The Apoſtle when he hath ſpoken of the renewing of all creatures made by IESVS the Mediator (for all floweth out of him) in the next verſe hee riſeth, and mounteth vp (O howe hee that is carried with the Spirite of Chriſt will riſe, when hee is ſpeaking of IESVS) hee riſeth vp to a light inacceſſible, he ſeeth God the Father ſitting in his Throne and Majeſtie, and the worke of this renewing flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, through Chriſt the Mediator, &amp; riſing vp to the Father of Chriſt, hee ſaieth, <hi>And all thinges are of GOD,</hi> &amp;c. Our leſſon is, All graces come from Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, our regeneration floweth out of his life, but the fountain of all is the Father of Heauen, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ieſus: and therfore, when thou findeſt the grace flowing from Ieſus, raiſe vp thy ſoule, &amp; look thorowe to the glorious Fountaine, ſitting in his Majeſty &amp; ſay. All glory be to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all goodneſſe to come from thee, O Father, thou haſt giuen all graces to me through thy Son Chriſt.

CHRIST, thinking it not worthy that any mans faith ſhould be builded on it: For that faith that is builded on it, cannot ſtand, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſdome of man is a falſe foundation, and the thing that is builded on a falſe foundation cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>Now to come to this Text which we haue read preſentlie. It might haue beene ſaid to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Who counteth of thy wiſedome? thou eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt not of mans wiſedome nor eloquence, but who counteth of thee, or of thy wiſedome either? Hee anſwereth in the 6. verſe, <hi>Wee ſpeake wiſedome among them that are perfect,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Who ſoeuer are perfect in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God, or whoſoeuer are come to a degree of perfection, or preaſſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, aſpiring aboue nature, aboue humane things, to ſee things Heauenly and ſpiritual, theſe men account of my wiſdome, in the ſight of theſe I am wiſe, and in their audience I ſpeake wiſdom, howbeit earthly men thinke all that I ſpeake but follie. This is the meaning &amp; th'effect of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles anſwere ſhortly. As to this word of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will not iuſiſt in it. A full perfection is not heere meaned, but a ſtriuing to perfection. No man nor woman in this life is perfect, but the perfecteſt of vs all that liueth in this worlde, one lie are ſtriuing to perfection, thorowe infinite infirmities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this worde of perfection is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that conſummate perfection which wee ſhall haue in that other life, but as it is opponed vnto them that haue no perfection, no ſpirituall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16627:56"/>
nor Heauenly ſight or knowledge of things Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly &amp; ſpirituall. Then, there is the leſſon in one word: Yee know the ſentence ſpoken commonly, <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her owne children</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19) Let the world account of it as they will, wiſdome ſhall euer be wiſdome to them that haue any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fooles will neuer count that Heauenlie wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be wiſedome, nor the wiſe of this world will neuer eſteeme of it. Much conſiſteth in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the hearts of the hearers: that which is wiſdome to one, is meere follie to another, and all becauſe the diſpoſition is diuers and contrary. Set together a man that is Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly minded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; a man that is only earthly minded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpeak the wiſdome of God to them both, and wiſdome to the Heauenly minded man ſhall be wiſdom, to the earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man it ſhall bee fooliſhneſſe: <hi>The ſpeech of the Croſſe,</hi> ſaieth the Apoſtle in the 1. chap. of this epi. verſ. 18. <hi>to them that periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is fooliſhneſſe, but to them that are ſaued, it is the wiſedome and power of GOD</hi> Art thou one that art ordained to bee ſaued?

And therfore, ſeeing there ſtandeth ſo much in the diſpoſition of the hearer, before thou commeſt to heare, look to thy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, leaue thine earthly minde behind thee leſt thou receiue thine own damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; bring an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly mind with thee, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſdom of God may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thee: there hath bene lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hearing &amp; teaching among vs in this Towne, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This world neuer found it out; neuer inuented it, it came neuer from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heads of worldlie men. Indeede it is true this worlde is wiſe in her owne kind; <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 8. and this world, and all the men thereof, from the beginning of it vnto this houre, hath beene occupied in counſels, in laying of plottes, in ſetting downe purpoſes, and taking conſultation, they haue bene verie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: But amongſt all the things that euer man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed vpon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was neuer found ſo much as one thought in the head of a man, of the remedie againſt ſinne and death: but ſitting from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in their counſels, they ſate like as manie

O! but there are ſome Princes in the world that paſſe others in wiſdome: there are wiſe &amp; high ſpirited men that will put order to others, and with their wit will compaſſe Heauen and earth, that will ſearch out the deepneſſe of nature, and bee occupied in high things: it may bee that theſe men haue found out this wiſdome.

Emperours condemned men! and yet neuer ſuch a thing as a thought howe they ſhould be relieued of their condemnation! It is true, the Philoſophers among the nations aſpired to a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God to know Him, and ſome of them laboured to ſet downe a ſcience of Him. <hi>Plato</hi> traueiled much on this purpoſe, and therfore he was called Diuine: but all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was of GOD the Creator, as Hee created this world, and by His prouidence gouerneth it. But will ye ſpeake of GOD the Redeemer in His Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, they had neuer ſuch a thing as a thought of Him: and yet for all the buſineſſe that they had about the Creation; and GOD the Creator, what were they? fooles, and euaniſhed in their owne cogitations, &amp; as ye may reade, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. 23. in ſtead of the true God they ſet vp an idole to bee worſhipped. Then ſeeing they found it not out, and ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary for al men, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Princes (for they ſhal neuer ſee life except they get a part of this wiſedome) they are bounde to keepe that wiſedome, in ſinceritie, and not to prejudge her libertie one whit: but to maintaine her and keep her from all her enemies, that would peruert her. Thou foundeſt her not out, keep her therfore in her liberty. The Lord gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that men may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied this way in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, not in impairing,

but in preſeruing the libertie of this wiſedome, that onelie muſt ſaue them: Thy kingdome, thy life, thine honour and all theſe earthlie riches will away, onelie this wiſedome will abide.</p>
            <p>Then this wiſedome is not founde out by this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by the Princes thereof. Yet before wee come to the Author whereof it is come, ye haue a reaſon wherefore ſhe cannot bee of the Princes of the worlde, <hi>who come to naught,</hi> they are aboliſhed, they euaniſh, ſhee is eternall, and will neuer haue ende. A periſhing head, will neuer inuent a ſcience that will laſt for euer, albeit his head were neuer ſo quicke &amp; ſo curious but as the head periſheth and goeth to graue, ſo ſhall the wiſedome thereof die in her owne time: And therefore there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer anie Arte nor Science inuented by the braine of man, which ſhall not die &amp; periſh, becauſe they are all come of periſhing heads: howbeit the head die and the wiſdome remaine for a ſpace, yet that ſcience and wiſedome ſhall alſo die in her owne time. <hi>Aristotle</hi> is dead, his wiſedome abideth yet, but it ſhall die. <hi>Plato</hi> is dead, his wiſdome abideth yet, but it ſhall alſo die. But the immortall GOD, when He findeth out a wiſedome, it ſhall bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall alſo. In the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> (Chap. 1. verſ. 23.) there are two thinges joyned together. The immortall ſeede of the word, and a liuing and immortall God, who abideth for euer. The ſeede of the worde is immortall: and wherefore is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall? Becauſe it commeth from a God that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16627:59"/>
abideth for euer. If it be once ſown in thine heart it ſhall neuer die out of thine heart: No, this word ſhall goe to Heauen with thee, and there it ſhall ſpring out in a wonderfull glorie, and ſhall abide in him who found it out, and in thee in whome it is ſowne for euer. Then if the world be not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, who hath found it out? <hi>We ſpeake</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not our owne wiſedome, but the wiſedome of God. Paul</hi> inuented it not, neuer a man that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this Goſpell was the author of it, the Lord who is onelie wiſe, found it out.</p>
            <p>Then marke, Brethren: If God of His infinite mercie (after thou madeſt that foule fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and fell from grace &amp; innocencie) had not found out to thee the onelie meanes of thy deliuerance from death and ſin, thou hadſt neuer riſen againe: for thou hadſt neuer ſo much as once a thought of the way of thy redemption. <hi>Adam,</hi> when hee had fallen, and hid himſelfe in an hole, had not ſo much as one cogitation of his deliuerance: That God that created thee without thee, redeemed thee alſo without thee: when He made thee of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the beginning, Hee called not thee to the counſell, becauſe thou was not: no more was thou on the counſell of thy redemption, when He took purpoſe to redeeme thee: No, there was neuer an Angell on the counſell of thy redemption. And this is that that is ſpoken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34, <hi>Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or who hath giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Him counſell?</hi> No, all is of Him, &amp; all is from Him only:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16627:60"/>
He is the onlie finder out, as well of thy redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of thy creation, that the onlie glorie may bee giuen vnto Him. I might ſpeake ſomething here againſt the enemies of the trueth, but I will not inſiſt. If thou takeſt any part of that worke to thy ſelfe, thou bereaueſt God of a part of His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Therfore ſeeing thou haſt neither arte nor part in it, let Him haue the onelie glorie for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the ſeconde part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Goſpell, <hi>In a mysterie.</hi> It is in a myſterie, it was hid vp. Sciences vſe to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended becauſe of their ſecrecie: for men wil ſay, O! it is a myſticall and ſecrete thing, therefore it is a commendable and precious thing. But if euer anie ſcience or wiſedome in the worlde, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited commendation, thorowe the ſecrecie of it, eſpeciallie this wiſedome of GOD, for there was neuer ſo ſecrete a wiſedome, ſo manie ages, from <hi>Adam</hi> till CHRIST came, all cloſed vp in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, &amp; hidden from the world, and if there was anie blinke of it, it was verie obſcure.</p>
            <p>Brethren, there are ſundrie wiſedomes of God: There is a wiſdome of the creation and gouerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the worlde, and there is a wiſedome of God of the redemption of the worlde once crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and making defection from that bleſſed eſtate of creation. As for the wiſedome of creation, as ſoone as euer the worlde was created, this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome brake foorth, and was reuealed, and made
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16627:60"/>
knowne to men, and it ſhineth yet in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: looke to them, thou ſhalt ſee the image of that wiſedome ſhining in them: and more than this, man receiued this wiſdome of creation writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart. So this wiſedome was not kept cloſe, but made patent to the eyes of men &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to looke vpon it.</p>
            <p>But as for the wiſdome of God of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde, in the creation Hee neither vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in word nor writing, He wrote not one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it in the heart of man in the creation. But after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> He gaue an inkling of it, but very obſcure. Nowe, wherefore was this that the Lord hid vp this wiſdome? Thereby no doubt He would teſtify to the world, that this wiſdome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a precious thing, a jewell: there was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it the whole treaſure of Heauen. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Heauen is Chriſt Ieſus, who is incloſed in this myſterie and therefore, the Lord woulde not reueale it, till Ieſus Chriſt came into the world. Is it reuealed now? It hath beene reuealed euer ſince CHRIST came into the worlde, and this daye in SCOTLAND that treaſure is laid open, if we had eyes to ſee it. <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Kings and Fathers were neuer in ſo bleſſed an eſtate as thou art. But if thou repent not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not this wiſdome, the greater is thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For euer the greater the benefite bee, the greater is the condemnation, if it bee not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And many at that daye ſhall ſaye, Would to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16627:61"/>
GOD we had neuer heard of this Goſpell Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keepe it as yee will, there is no glorie but it, and take it awaye, farewell the glorie and well-fare of the Land: yea, I ſay more, There is no glorie in this world but it.</p>
            <p>Nowe, the Apoſtle ſtandeth not heere, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth forward in the praiſe of this wiſedome: Hee hath praiſed it from the Author, who is God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: from the ſecrecie, that it is a myſterie hidden vp ſo long: he commeth now to the time when it was found out, <hi>which God had determined before the world.</hi> Sciences vſe to bee commended from their antiquitie: men ſay, O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is an olde Science, it was ſound out by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> therefore, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Science. But there was neuer wiſedome that might bee compared in antiquitie to this wiſedome. Wilt thou aske howe olde is this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? I aske another queſtion, How olde is God Himſelfe? This Goſpell is euen as olde as GOD Himſelfe: the Goſpell is from all Eternitie, as the glorious GOD is without beginning from all Eternitie. Then this Goſpell that is preached this day, is no nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltie.</p>
            <p>This is that wiſedome and doctrine that GOD predeſtinated from all Eternitie, howbeit the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in contempt call it a new doctrine. Thou art a lyar, although thou bee the Pope, I ſpeake it to the glorie of God, this Goſpell that is preached in SCOTLAND, was from all Eternitie.</p>
            <p>The wordes import more. It is not onelie from
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16627:61"/>
all Eternitie, but it is grounded vpon an Eternall counſell. The glorious Trinitie ſet downe in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious counſell this doctrine of ſaluation. And therefore, ſeeing this doctrine is ſet on ſo ſolide a foundation, who will ſhake it? Shake it let ſee off her foundation, and thruſt at it, It will ſhake thee, and driue thee into Hell. I tell thee, it hath ſaued manie men from the beginning, but it is alſo true, it hath ſlaine manie one: beware that it ſlaye thee not: for it is the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt thing that euer was. Thou mayeſt well baniſh this Goſpell, and put it out of SCOTLAND, but thou ſhalt neuer put it out of the world, ſo long as there is a ſoule to be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it: But when ſhe is out of SCOTLAND and ENGLAND both, ſhee can goe, and it were, to all theſe newe found Landes, and abide there.</p>
            <p>Yet marke how he riſeth in his tearmes (I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard anie Philoſopher in all his Declamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s riſe ſo highlie in his praiſes of anie Science, as the Apoſtle doeth in praiſing of this wiſedome, and it is not the eloquence of man, but the eloquence of the Spirite of God, that raiſeth him. And yet hee hath not tolde all her glory. No, we ſhall neuer ſee it all, till wee ſee the Lord Ieſus, who is the ſubject of this Goſpell.) Sciences haue their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their ende: it is a good science that hath a good ende, and inuented for the weale of man, for his profite, and pleaſure, and glorie: But this ſcience in this mounteth aboue all the ſciences in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16627:62"/>
the worlde: for all the Sciences in the worlde will not make thee mount vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor raiſe thee one foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredth from the earth, although thou bee a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch: they may well get thee a piece of honour here, but it ſhall all be earthly honour. O! but the Science whereof our God is the Author, this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our redemption maketh thee to mount, draweth thee vp, in a word, glorifieth thee All that euer learne in her ſchoole ſhall bee glorified, wilt thou learne this wiſdome, ſhe ſhall glorifie thee in the Heauens. For why? <hi>ſhe is the power of God to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Roman.</hi> 1. 16. and as hee ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. wilt thou looke in her but as in a mirrour, to the glorie of GOD in her, ſhee ſhall transforme thee from glory to glory in that ſame Image. What more? All the wiſedome in the world without this wiſdome, is like as much poyſon, to ſwell vp thine heart in pride againſt GOD and man.</p>
            <p>Shall I come to the particulars? Art thou a Lawier? and haſt the knowledge of the Common Lawes? If thy ſcience of the Lawe bee not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with this wiſedome, it is meere poyſon to thee. Art thou a Mediciner, perfect in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haſt read all <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galene,</hi> and all the reſt of them, and haſt not this wiſedome, thou art poyſoned for all thy Medicine. Is thine head full of policie, and haſt thou manie plottes and conceites in it, and haſt thou not this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? thou haſt an emptie and poyſoned head. Art thou a Philoſopher, and canſt count all the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16627:62"/>
Starres, and canſt ſearch out all the mineralles, and canſt goe downe to the Center of the Earth. yea, and it were downe to Hell, and haſt not this wiſedome, thou art poyſoned. What neede I to ſpeake further? If thou haue no apprehenſion of this wiſedome, that onely ſanctifieth thee, and all thy Sciences, and maketh them profitable vnto thee, thou art a miſerable bodie, and woe to thee for euer. Would to God the worlde ſaw this, but alas, this humane wiſedome and the glory of this worlde pulleth CHRIST out of their eyes, and obſcureth this Heauenly glory. But woe is thee! that euer thou ſaw this light, if thou getteſt not a part of that Heauenly glory.</p>
            <p>Yet hee ſtayeth not heere, but looke howe hee climbeth vp, &amp; exalteth this Heauenly wiſdome. Sciences vſe to bee commended for their ſubtility and ſublimity. O, ſaieth the Philoſopher, it is an high and ſubtile Science, therefore it is praiſe worthy. Mathematikes are ſubtile, and are full of ſubtile demonſtrations, therefore they are worthy Sciences. But, Brethren, there was neuer Science comparable in ſublimity to this Wiſedome of GOD, who is onely wiſe. As farre as the head of GOD paſſeth thy braine, as far doth this wiſdom that is come of GODS head, paſſe all the wiſdom that thou canſt inuent, and it were a thouſande yeeres: and therefore th'Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This wiſdom none of the Princes of this world haue knowne:</hi> No, not after ſhee was reuealed and came into the world,

Hee giueth a reaſon in the end of the verſe, that teſtifieth, that the Prince; of this world knew not this wiſdome, yea, not when it was laid open to them. Hee ſaith. <hi>For had they knowne it,</hi> (namely that great Prince <hi>Herode,</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> that Romane Preſident) <hi>they would not haue crucified the Lord of glorie.</hi> They had not done ſuch indignitie to Him as to naile Him to an ignominious croſſe. How aggree theſe two together. The Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and an ignominious croſſe? Howe ſtand theſe two, The King of glorie, and ſuch a ſhamefull death? Becauſe they knew not His glorie, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned Him to ſuch an ignominious death. Thou that canſt not ſee the glorie of God in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, thou wilt commit the moſt ignominious, the moſte villanous thing in the world.

not that thou hadſt beene free of it if thou hadſt bene there. No, I tell thee, Thou that ſeeſt not the glorie of the Goſpell of IESVS CHRIST, if ſuch a deede were to be done, thou wouldeſt haue a ſhare in it. It will not be ſpeaking that will ſeru: the turne.

            <p>He ſtandeth not here, but goeth forward in her commendation: mark the words, &amp; I beſeech you to weigh them, that ſeeing the eminency of this Goſpel, ye may learn to ſtoup &amp; giue obedience to it. Sciences are commended from their ſubjectes whereof they entreat: if they haue a glorious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they are accounted high, &amp; accurate ſciences: but their was neuer ſcience that had ſuch a fair &amp; glorious ſubject, as this Goſpel which we preach. What is the ſubject of it? I cannot tell it in better words than are here ſet downe: <hi>The things which the eye hath not ſeene, neither the eare hath heard, neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into mans heart.</hi> All ſciences of this world, and wiſdom found out by man, are of things either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that are ſeen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye, or of things audible, heard with the eare, or of things intelligible, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with the mind. If I cannot ſee thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, if I cannot heare it, at the leaſt I will get ſome apprehenſion of it in my minde, I haue that aduantage. But as for the ſubject of this wiſdome, thy naturall eye neuer ſaw it, thy naturall care ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard it, and it neuer entered into thy naturall heart: and therfore whoſoeuer wil ſee theſe things, he muſt ſeek an cye that is more than natural, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16627:65"/>
is ſupernaturall, that is ſpirituall: ſeeke an eare that is ſupernaturall and ſpirituall. Goe to the heart, content not thy ſelfe with a naturall heart: ſeeke an heart that is ſpirituall and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: For gaze with thine eye as thou wilt, laye to thine eare as thou wilt, if thou ſhouldeſt heare an hundreth Preachings, if thou haue but a naturall care, and a naturall eye, thou ſhalt neither ſee not heare: but in hearing thou ſhalt not heare, and in vnderſtanding thou ſhalt not vnderſtand, as the Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> in the ſixt Chapter and ninth verſe ſaieth. Therefore, ſeeke at GOD an Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie eare, and an Heauenlie eye, and ſaye, LORD, giue mee an Heauenlie eare, and an Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie eye, that I may conceaue theſe thinges and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende them.</p>
            <p>Nowe, in the ende of the verſe hee bringeth them downe for as high as they were, and telleth what they are, <hi>Which GOD</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>hath prepared for them that loue Him.</hi> They are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from all Eternitie, and they are prepared in time, for ſo manie onelie as loue the LORD. Therefore, loue IESVS, and thou ſhalt get a part of them. The leſſon is this. Wonderfull are the thinges that GOD hath prepared for them that loue the LORD IESVS. But how ſhal I knowe that ſuch high and ſublime thinges are prepared for mee? Art thou marked with this token? and carrieſt thou it about with thee?

thou wouldeſt. (Accurſed bee hee that loueth not the LORD: <hi>let him bee an Anathema Marana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaieth in the ſixteenth Chapter and the two and twentie verſe of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>) Loueſt thou Him, aſſure thy ſelfe, howbeit thou canſt not get ſuch a loue to Him, or ſuch a ſight of theſe thinges, as thou wouldeſt haue, they are prepared for thee. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, thou art to take heede to ſee if that loue of GOD bee in thine heart. Goe not to ſearch what is in Heauen, and thinke not to get a full ſight of that glorie in this life, that is laide vp for thee: But reſt on Him, yea, though it were halfe blindlinges.

            <p>I will ende heere, and will recommende to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſoule that Loue of IESVS, as euer they woulde ſee the thinges that the eye neuer ſawe, nor the eare neuer hearde, nor hath euer ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the heart of man, to their euerlaſting comfort and conſolation, at the comming of the LORD IESVS: To whome, with the FATHER and the Holy GHOST, bee all Honour, Prayſe, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for euer and euer, world without ende, So bee it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt day, Brethren, we heard a cleare deſcription &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that wiſedome which `<hi>Paul</hi> ſpake and preached, which is none other, in effect, but this ſame bleſſed EVANGELL that is preached to you. We ſhewed you that there was nothing that might commende a ſcience or wiſedome in this world, but it concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him to the commendation, praiſe, and glorie of this wiſdome that is here deſcribed. The author of it is not the world, nor the Princes of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16627:66"/>
world, but God the maker of the worlde: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie of it, was hidden vp in a myſterie ſo manie ages, from the creation to the comming of Chriſt, and manifeſtation of Him in the nature of man: The antiquitie of it, it was predeſtinated from all Eternitie: The end of it, our glorie: The ſublimitie and highneſſe of it, when it was reuealed at the cumming of CHRIST, none of the Princes of this world could vnderſtand it, for if they had known it, they had not crucified the LORD of glorie. The ſubject of it, the thinges which the eye neuer ſawe, the eare neuer hearde, which neuer entered into the heart of man, and yet for all this, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them that loue the LORD.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to the Text which wee haue in hand. It might haue bene asked of the Apoſtle, If ſuch thinges as were neuer ſeene, neuer heard of, nor neuer entred into the heart of man, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that wiſdom which he taught, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite haue we by that wiſedome? what profite haue wee of the thinges whereof wee are not capable? The Apoſtle meeteth this in the firſt verſe which we haue read, <hi>But</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>God hath reuealed them vnto vs by His Spirit:</hi> It is true indeed, they paſſe the ſight of our eyes, they ſurmount aboue our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they paſſe the capacitie of our mind, yet that LORD hath dimitted Himſelfe vnto vs, &amp; by His Spirit He hath reuealed thoſe things to vs the ſillie ones of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, not to the princes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but to the ſillie ſimple ones. Hee hath reuealed them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16627:67"/>
not by our ſpirit, but by His owne Spirit. There is the ſumme of the anſwere ſhortlie: He giueth the reaſon in the next part of the verſe, and letteth vs ſee, that the Spirite of Ieſus is able to reueale all theſe high and hidden things to vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſetting out the nature of the Holie Spirit: <hi>For</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>the Spirite ſearcheth all thinges, yea, the deepe thinges of God.</hi> The Spirite is a ſearcher, and hee is a ſearcher of all things created in Heauen and earth. Nothing can eſcape him, but hee will ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rch into the ſecreteſt things in the world, and into the ſecreteſt parts of thine heart. What more? Hee is a ſearcher of the God of glorie Himſelfe, and will pierce into the infinite deepneſſe that is in God. Hee being ſuch a Spirit as this, is he not able to reueal the things whereof wee are not capable? There is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole verſe ſhortlie.</p>
            <p>Then we ſee theſe things contained in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie wiſedome, as the riches of God in IESVS CHRIST, our remiſſion of ſinne, our juſtification, our regeneration, our ſaluation, and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, euen common thinges which yee heare of daylie, together with Ieſus Chriſt the Mediator, in whome and thorowe whome all thinges are wrought, are the thinges which the eare hath not hearde, nor the eye hath not ſeene, neither haue they e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ered into the heart of man. Yet wee ſee that theſe thinges paſſe not ſo the capacitie of man, nor they are not ſo altogether hidden from man, but they are reuealed. And they are reuealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:16627:67"/>
to whom? To them for whom they are prepared. They are reuealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when? euen in this life: there is none for whom they are prepared from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but in this life, before the ſoule goe out of the bodie, they ſhall receiue ſome reuelation and vnderſtanding of theſe ſame things: and thou that getteſt no reuelation of them in this life, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not a ſight of them ere the ſoule goe out of the bodie, I will ſay to thee, They were neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee: Remiſſion of ſinnes was neuer prepared for thee, Iuſtification before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of GOD, Regeneration, Life euerlaſting was neuer prepared for thee. There is not a better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of life after this life, than a blink of life in this life, if it were but a glimmering (for the beſt of vs hath but a glimmering) a blinke of IESVS Chriſt, and of the graces that are in Him in this life, is the ſureſt token that thou canſt haue of the life to come. And by the contrarie, There is not a worſe token of darkeneſſe after this life, than to haue thine eyes ſo cloſed, that thou haſt no blinke heere of that life to come.

               </gap> Marke it: I ſhall tarie ſomwhat vpon theſe wordes. Yee heard before of a reuelation by the word which is this wiſedome. Now yee heare of a reuelation by the Spirite: It is not enough to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16627:68"/>
receaue a reuelation by the word, though it were neuer ſo faire and ſo ſoundly preached, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe thee good, it is nothing but as if thou wouldeſt holde a light before a blinde man, &amp; ſay to him, Man, ſeeſt thou not this light? Wilt thou bid a blinde man judge of colours? thou ſcorneſt him. Euen ſo, all the ſpeaking of the Scriptures vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men is but ſcorning of them, except they get this reuelation of the Holie Spirite. What is this reuelation of the Spirit? I ſhall tell you what it is. With that preaching of the worde, which is the firſt reuelation, the Spirite of IESVS commeth downe, and ſeateth Himſelfe in thine eye, &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thine eye to ſee the thinges which are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken commeth to thine eare, &amp; openeth thine eare to heare the things which are ſpoken, entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine heart, and maketh thee to conceaue the thinges which thou ſeeſt and heareſt, and maketh thee capable of them, of the which thou art no more capable by nature, than the verie ſtone in the pillar: ſpeak to thee, &amp; to the ſtone, all is alike, till this alteration be made in thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, There are two reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lations, The firſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, when it is preached: The ſecond by the Spirit, when that Holy Spirit concurreth with the word. I will tell you the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them, The firſt will bee common to all: the word is preached alike to all. O! but the other reuelation is not ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, but is only made to ſome ſecret ones of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. That bleſſed Spirit will not light vpon euery
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16627:68"/>
man and woman, but onlie vpon ſome ſecret per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vpon whom the Lord hath pitie. Wee reade in the 16. Chapter of the <hi>Actes</hi> of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is a meeting of manie: many are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, <hi>Paule</hi> the Apoſtle the Preacher, hee reuealeth the graces of the worde to all alike: amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all the reſt we reade of one ſpeciall perſon called <hi>Lydia</hi> (there was neuer a word ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt) it is ſaid of her namely, that the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to receiue that which <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: the Spirit of IESVS opened her heart, not <hi>Paul:</hi> the Spirit of IESVS only is the reuealer: be neuer content with hearing onelie: fie on thee, if thou thinke thou haſt done enough, when thou haſt ſitten an houre or two, hearing, if thou finde not the ſweet operation of the Spirit to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine heart with ſuch a ſweetneſſe as is vnſpeakeable. And therfore fixe not your eyes ſo much on men, as vpon the Lord, who ſendeth the Spirit, and crie euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord, giue me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit, or els all is but wind: bleſſed is that body that getteth the Spirit, for the word will neuer doe good without the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Yet I goe forward, and I marke the reaſon: <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all thinges, yea, the deepneſſe of GOD.</hi> Theſe are the wordes. There is a great deepneſſe in theſe wordes, if wee could attaine to it. The firſt thing that I take vp heere, is this, Great is that deepneſſe and that profundity that is in our God. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 3. chap. to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> and the 18. verſe, conſidering that deepeneſſe falleth out in theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16627:69"/>
words, <hi>That yee, beeing rooted and grounded in loue, may be able to comprehend with all Saincts, what is the breadth, and length</hi> (meaning of God, for He is both broade and long) <hi>and the depth</hi> (Hee is deepe) <hi>and the height</hi> (He is high alſo) Infinite in length, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in breadth, infinite in height, infinite in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what would yee haue? He Himſelfe is (as it were) a bottomleſſe Deepe. There is neuer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie in Him, as we call them, but all is an infinite deepneſſe, the wiſedome of GOD, an infinite and endleſſe deepneſſe: His power, an endleſſe deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34.) fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in an admiration of the deepeneſſe both of the wiſedome, and of the knowledge of GOD.</p>
            <p>Well then, Brethren, it is no wonder, albeit it was ſaide in the verſe going before, that <hi>the thinges that are prepared for them that loue Him, the eye hath neuer ſeene, the eare hath neuer hearde, neither haue they entered into the heart of man:</hi> Why? Becauſe all theſe things are hidden vp in a bottomleſſe deepneſſe, that is, in GOD. What wonder then, that thou canſt not ſee them? that the eye of a worme, cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon the earth, cannot ſee them? that the eare of a worme cannot heare them? and that the heart of a worme cannot be capable of them? It is true indeed, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Goſpel ſpeaketh of them al vnto vs, yet the worde is not ſufficient to ſhew them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are not ſo in the word, but they abide ſtill in that deepnes: the mercie is not ſo reuealed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, &amp; broght down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heauen, but yet it remaineth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16627:69"/>
ſtill in that deepnes: remiſſion of ſins is not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in the word, but yet it abideth ſtill in that deepeneſſe. And therefore, the worde, when it ſpeaketh of theſe thinges, whither ſendeth it thee vnto? When it ſpeaketh of the mercie of GOD in Ieſus Chriſt, of the juſtice of God, of Life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, whither doeth it direct thee? Euermore to this deepneſſe. Goe thy wayes (ſaieth the word) to the deepneſſe of GOD, and ſee all theſe thinges plainlie. Therefore, the ſame Apoſtle ſaieth, (<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.</hi> 3. 1. 3.) <hi>Seeke the thinges which are aboue, where thy life is hidden with Christ in God.</hi> Where is thy life then? I am ſpeaking of it now: but where is it? It is hidden vp in that deepneſſe of God. The word ſhould not holde downe thine eye, but lift it vp to ſeeke all thoſe mercies that are aboue with God. Ye may ſee then, theſe thinges that concerne our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, our remiſſion of ſinnes, our juſtification, our ſaluation (theſe are euen the things, to ſpeake them plainlie, whereof the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meaneth) they are incomprehenſible to the wit of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the eye of man, to the judgement of man, to the nature of man. Hee will ſtand vp, and talke of his nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his engine, an high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited man his wit will compaſſe all the worlde. O! but thy wit reached neuer vp heere to ſearch this deepneſſe. Therefore, by nature there is none aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of remiſſion of ſinnes, of ſaluation, of life, if thou haue no more but nature, (ſcorne as thou wilt) although thou be a Monarch, thou ſhalt neuer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16627:70"/>
get aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life, but die like a deſperate dogge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Art thou able to pierce in to the deepneſſe of the ſea, that hath a bottome? or to the deepnes of the earth that is finite? No, thou wilt neuer ſee one foot into it, albeit thou be neuer ſo clear of ſight: &amp; then, O foole, wilt thou ſtriue to reach vp to a bottomles deepneſſe that is in God, with thy wit and thy conception, when thou canſt not attaine to a finite thing?</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, I haue ſpoken of God, &amp; of His deepnes: next we haue to ſpeak of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the ſearching of the Spirit: I ſhall only touch it ſhortly as farre as the Text will furniſh, and not digreſſe in amplifying of theſe common heads. I marke then of this Text: As there is an infinite deepneſſe in God, ſo there is a ſearcher of it, it wanteth not a ſearcher. The onlie ſearcher of this deepnes, is the Spirite of God: euerie ſpirite is a ſearcher: it is the nature of a ſpirite euer to pierce in, and to ſearch: for it is a ſubtile thing, and will pierce in very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely to the ſecrets of things. The ſpirit of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is a ſearcher, and a ſubtile thing: the ſpirit of the Deuill is ſubtile, and will pierce in ſubtilely, he will pierce in to thine heart, and inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therein: likewiſe, the ſpirit of a man is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirit, and a ſearcher alſo: he will ſearch out the things that are in heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the ſea, and in the earth: for, he is wonderfully inclined to ſearching. But all the ſpirites, except the Spirit of that Holy One, ſearch onely the creatures. The ſpirite of an
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16627:70"/>
Angell, of the deuill, of a man, ſearch but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: As for the Creator, no ſpirit is able to ſearch in Him but His owne Spirit, yea, they knowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Him, but ſo much as He will reueale vnto them. As for man, hee is very buſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for all his buſineſſe, hee could neuer yet ſearch out his owne heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>there is a myſterie of ſinne lying in the foldes of his heart, which hee ſhall neuer ſee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Spirite enter in, and giue him light. But the bleſſed Spirit of God and of Ieſus Chriſt (hee is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Sonne, for one Spirit proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both) He ſearcheth the Father, He ſearcheth the Sonne, Hee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all And no man can bee a good ſearcher, or a ſanctified ſearcher, except hee haue this Spirite. If thy ſpirit be not ſanctified by this Spirite, which is the onlie ſearcher and ſanctifier of all thinges, all thy ſearching is but vanitie.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forward. Before Hee was called a ſearcher, and now He is called a reuealer: Firſt He ſearcheth out, then He reuealeth vnto vs, There is the order: He reuealeth the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things in God, becauſe He Himſelfe of His owne nature is a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of them: and before that euer Hee reueale them, He ſearcheth them out firſt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he that will be a reuealer, and will ſet himſelf to reueale thoſe things to men (I ſpeak it in plain talk) he that will bee a Preacher of theſe hidden thinges to others, looke that firſt hee bee a ſearcher, and let him bee occupied in ſearching, and heartilie beſeech
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16627:71"/>
GOD, that the Holie Spirite would lead him in to thoſe things that haue none acceſſe: For hee is not fit to bee a Preacher of the Goſpell, that ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not with all his might, firſt to ſee theſe things in God, which he ſpeaketh to others. Woe to him that commeth in of purpoſe to ſpeake the things to others which he neuer ſaw nor felt firſt in his owne heart. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Pſalme</hi> 116. 10.) <hi>I beleeued, and therefore I ſpake. Paule</hi> afterwardes ſaieth, <hi>We beleeue and therefore wee ſpeake, 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 13. What is this beliefe? None other thing, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſpeake to others, to get an aſſurance of them in his owne heart. Now looke the maner of the reuealing of theſe things. The Spirit, he reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, becauſe hee openeth our heartes, and taketh away the vaile off our heartes, to let vs ſee them: otherwiſe in vaine were it to laye them before vs. I ſee another maner of this reuelation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke what more the Spirit doeth: Hee is not content only to take the vaile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine heart, but hee taketh thy ſoule by the hand, (as it were) and leadeth it in thorow the deepneſſe of God, he will rauiſh it out of the bodie, (as it were) and leade it in to that light which hath none acceſſe, and will ſay, Loe there is the mercie, loe, there is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, loe, there is the euerlaſting Life, which is ſpoken of, ſeeſt thou not them all in Him? So he will point out euerie thing in God. Therefore, no doctrine auaileth without this Holie Spirit, ſeeing Hee alone taketh the vaile from our heartes, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16627:71"/>
leadeth vs in to ſee the thinges which are ſpoken of. There is no perfect Doctor but the Spirite of Ieſus onlie: There is no creature, although hee be an Angell, that can take the vaile off thine heart, to let thee ſee, that can bore thine care, to let thee heare perfectlie: And therefore, in preaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not vpon the mouth of men, but onlie vpon the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet I ſhall make the matter more plaine, and ſhew how the Spirit will take thee, and let thee ſee the thinges which are in God. I will vſe a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which cannot bee, yet it will make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more cleare. I ſuppoſe that my ſpirit or ſoule entered into thee, if my ſpirite or my ſoule bee in thee, there woulde bee nothing within mee, but thou wouldeſt ſee it, all my thoughtes would bee patent to thee.</p>
            <p>Now to applie this. This is no ſuppoſition. God will put His Spirite into a man or woman: for if His Spirit be not in vs, wo be vnto vs for euer and euer. If God put His Spirit into anie of vs muſt it not follow of neceſſitie, that wee muſt ſee in God at leaſt the things which concerne our weale and saluation. That ſpirite in mee, in thee, muſt reueale to mee, to thee, the thinges which lie in the verie deepneſſe of God, which concerne our weale and ſaluation: and that man that hath the Spirite of God, will ſee the verie heart of God, &amp; His mind, he will ſee the remiſſion of his ſinnes in the mind of GOD, and all by the benefite of the Spirite of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16627:72"/>
IESVS that dwelleth in him. Marke this yee that account ſo lightlie of the Spirite of Ieſus, in whom conſiſteth the onlie felicitie of man: For if thou want His Spirite, woe to thee, thou ſhalt goe to Hell. So wee haue a great vantage heere, that by the benefite of the Spirite, wee ſee the thinges that are in GOD.</p>
            <p>But, Brethren, God hath as great an aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of vs: for if Gods Spirit be in vs, by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Hee ſeeth all that is in our heartes: for if my ſpirit were in thee (as I ſpake before) as thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee all that is in mine heart, ſo I would ſee all that is in thy ſoule, &amp; the leaſt thought of thine heart would bee patent vnto mee: ſo, much more that Spirit ſeeth the leaſt motion &amp; thoght of the heart of man, in whom He is, &amp; will preſent them all to the Father, and lay them open before Him. So al ſerueth to this end, that we ſhould take heed to the leaſt thought of our hearts, and beware to thinke one thought to diſpleaſe Him: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as He is called the ſearcher of the deepneſſe of God, ſo He is called the ſearcher of the heartes of men. There is not one thought, nor one grone in thine heart, or one motion of joy in thy ſoule, but He reporteth all to the Father. We haue neede to take heede to all the motions of our heartes, and neuer to thinke one thought, but that which wee thinke is acceptable to the Father, &amp; neuer to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Spirit (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30.) neither in word or thought. And therefore, as thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16627:72"/>
keep Him &amp; not anger Him, ſtudy to ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſanctification ſhall bring on ſaluation, for it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very means that ſhall make thee to ſee God: look what th'Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Without ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification no man ſhall ſee GOD.</hi> Now vpon all this diſcourſe I marke ſhortly: There were neuer two things ſo ſtraitly joyned together as God &amp; man is: there was neuer ſuch kinred betwixt two things in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, as is betwixt the God of glory, and an earthly man: thou wilt count thy kinred with this man, and that man, if thou be joyned with him in blood or alliance. But I aske this queſtion, Is his ſpirite within thee? is his ſoule within thee? or is thy ſoule in him? Indeede it is true, the affection may goe out of thee to him, but giueſt thou him thy ſpirit with thy affection? or giueth he thee his ſpirit with his affection? knoweſt thou y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thought of his heart? or knoweth he the thought of thine heart? who will ſay it? O! but God with His affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction giueth thee His Spirit within thee, that thou mayeſt know the thought of His heart, and He of thine. This is the conjunction that is betwixt God &amp; thee: there is a narrow conjunction indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members of that myſticall body, for they are conjoyned together by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit of Chriſt, &amp; by loue, but no member putteth his ſpirit into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member: there is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>junction betwixt the head and the members of the naturall bodie: for the ſoule will, as it were, come downe, and the ſpirit of the head to the members, and they will
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16627:73"/>
vnderſtand the thought of the head, and the head will vnderſtand the thought of the members, but there was neuer ſuch a conjunction betwixt the members &amp; the head, as is betwixt God &amp; man, and all conjunctions among men, are but a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle of that which is betwixt GOD and man. In this conjunction with thy GOD, and with thine Head, IESVS, (for thou art joyned with GOD in Him) ſtandeth thy felicitie and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>To come to the next verſe. It might haue bene ſaid to the Apoſtle, Thou dedicateſt all to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, may not the ſpirite of man doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this purpoſe? may not my ſpirit ſearch in to God, and diſcouer the deepnes that is in Him? He anſwereth, <hi>Noman can ſee the thinges that are in God, but His owne Spirit.</hi> Then hee declareth his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere by a compariſon, <hi>Euen as no man can ſee the thinges which are in man but by the ſpirit of a man, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſearch the things which are in God, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi> Thou canſt not ſee the things that are in me. onlie I my ſelfe will ſee the thinges that are in me: euen ſo no man can ſee the things that are in God but onlie His owne Spirit.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Apoſtle heere hee meeteth the verie, pride of the heart of man, that hee will conciet of himſelf, that he by his ſpirit will ſearch the things that are in God. <hi>Paule</hi> had this experience in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were but carnall, they tooke vpon them to judge vpon his doctrine that was ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Haſt thou but that ſpirite which is carnall?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16627:73"/>
albeit thou bee a Monarch, thou art too bolde to take vpon thee to judge of thinges which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and ſpoken ſpirituallie.</p>
            <p>This ſame is the pride of the Papiſts this daye. There will come out a <hi>Thomist,</hi> a <hi>Scotist,</hi> who hath the ſpirit of a man onlie, and a verie ſubtile, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Sophisticall</hi> ſpirit, an humane. <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and hee will judge of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and turne it ouer into humane <hi>Philoſophie.</hi> They haue turned the Goſpell of Ieſus to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> all their writings are but ſpiritleſſe. There is not ſo much as a ſmell of the Spirit of Ieſus in them all: But, O that terrible judgement that abideth ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors as are prophane polluters of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt! There is none of vs all, but if a man would ſtand vp and ſay to mee, or to thee, I knowe thine heart, and what is in thine heart, wee would be angrie at him. Then, will not that glorious God bee angrie at a prophane villane, that will ſay, hee will ſearch in to that profunditie, hauing only his owne ſpirit?</p>
            <p>Brethren, when I was younger than I am, if I had ſeene one of great engine, &amp; great capacitie, &amp; great graces, I thought immediately he would comprehend the whole Bible, but I proteſt before God, that the longer I liue, I thinke euer the leſſe of the wit of man, I had rather haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt ſponk of the Spirit of Chriſt, nor all the engine &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: No, a ſilly body that hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Ieſus will conceiue more of ſpiritual things,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16627:74"/>
than all the high headed bodies in the worlde. Therefore, alwayes renounce thine owne wit, and be a foole, that thou mayeſt be wiſe.</p>
            <p>Another thing I marke heere. When hee hath magnified the Spirit, and made Him the ſearcher of all the deepneſſe of God, ſee howe hee holdeth off him the proude conceites of men: hee will not let thee touch him, or his priuiledges, that is, to ſearch the deepneſſe of God. Therefore, if yee will ſpeake of God, to His honour, (He is inuiolable) ſaue him from the proude conceites of men. Hold proude men off God, &amp; let them not touch Him, or violate that inuiolable Majeſtie, or elſe thou ſhalt be guiltie, if Hee be violated by thy default. Alas! wherefore art thou ſet in this world, but to preach His glorie? and to keepe it inuiolate from the injuries of all fleſh in the worlde. Looke what he doeth next in the laſt verſe, when he hath, as it were, holden off GOD the proude conceites of men, who woulde take vpon them to ſearch in to the deepneſſe of God, what doeth he? He draweth that Spirit to himſelfe, and ſaieth, <hi>Nowe wee haue receiued, not the ſpirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God.</hi> whereby hee learneth thee this leſſon: It auaileth thee not to magnifie, to glorifie God and His Spirit, except in the end thou take that Spirit to thy ſelfe, and mayeſt challenge Chriſt and His Spirit, as thine owne propertie. Men haue ſpoken verie highlie of Chriſt, and haue had little adoe with Him. Speake thou not of Him ſo, but as thou
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16627:74"/>
ſpeakeſt of Him to His praiſe, take Him to thy ſelfe: otherwiſe, in all thy ſpeaking of Him, thou art but a verie babler, if thou haue not that Spirite within thee: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No man can call Ieſus Lord, except he haue the Spirit of Ieſus, 1. Cor.</hi> 12. 3. Therefore, as thou wouldeſt ſaue thy ſelfe from prophaning of God, and of His Spirit, and of His graces, when thou art praiſing and magnifying Him, looke that thou haue the Spirite, that thou mayeſt ſay to thy ſelfe, This Spirit whom I praiſe, is mine: this God, whom I haue bene magnifying, and all His graces, is mine. In the end of the verſe hee ſetteth downe the ende wherefore GOD hath giuen vs this Spirit. The end is this, To make <hi>vs to know the things which are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs by God.</hi> I ſee here the Spirit of Ieſus, when He maketh our eye to looke in to that deepneſſe of God, to that ſtore of mercie, He will let vs ſee nothing in GOD, but meere grace &amp; mercy. As this Euangell preacheth nothing but meere grace and mercie, ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Ieſus, when He letteth thee ſee al the hidden things in GOD, Hee letteth thee ſee nothing but meere mercie and grace. And therefore, hee that will tell the people of the merits of men, or of the Saints, that they are not juſtified by meere grace, but muſt ad to their own deſeruings, I wil tell you my judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſuch a man, ſuppoſe he be neuer ſo glorious a Doctor, neuer ſo ſacond or ſo learned, hee neuer ſpake by the Spirite of IESVS. Papiſt Doctors, who leade men to leane to their owne
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16627:75"/>
merites, and to the merites of Saincts, neuer ſpake nor wrote by the Spirit of Ieſus: For the Spirite of Ieſus letteth thee ſee nothing in God but mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e mercie: for one merite of man will deſtroye all grace: ſo contratie is the Spirit of God, &amp; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, the grace of Chriſt, &amp; the merit of man, And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit that men ſtriue to put amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs againe: for if they bring in Papiſtrie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs again, farewell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit of Ieſus. No, I ſpeak it from mine heart, if that Idolatrie come in againe, I ſhall ſtand vp in my laſt Preaching, and ſaye, Farewell the Spirit of Ieſus: For, no more than Hell can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie Heauen, no more can that bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Ieſus accompanie that dirt &amp; dung of mans doctrine. Therefore, as thou wouldeſt keepe the Spirit of Ieſus, holde abacke theſe men, for thou ſhalt not enjoye them both in deſpite of thine heart. The Lord Ieſus cannot remaine amongſt Idolaters: and if thou haue not His Spirite, thou art not His, (<hi>Roman.</hi> 8. 9.) if thou be not His, thou art the Deuils, and ſhalt goe to euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the verſe immediatelie going before this Text which wee haue read in your audience, the Apoſtle hath beene ſpeaking of that ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, of that plainneſſe which hee vſed in the preaching of the Goſpell of CHRIST, which he vttered with ſuch an euidence, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hearde him, might vnderſtand him, might haue ſeene the light of the Goſpell, and haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it. Nowe becauſe this people of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> were ſtiffe-necked, hard to conceiue, full of conceits, and liked nothing but humane wiſdome and eloquence, ſcorning &amp; mocking the euidence
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16627:76"/>
of the Spirit: Therefore, ſome of them might haue objected immediatelie, <hi>Paule,</hi> thou ſpeakeſt of thy plainneſſe in vttering the Goſpel, yet for thy plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there is manie amongſt vs who knowe not what thou ſpeakeſt, thy Goſpell is hidden to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, manie vnderſtand thee not. The Apoſtle mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this in the firſt wordes which wee haue read, <hi>If our Gospell be hidden, it is hidden to them that periſh.</hi> A ſore ſentence: as if hee woulde ſaye, <hi>Corinthians,</hi> blame me not, nor my Goſpell, the fault is in that miſerable corruption which is in you: yee cannot ſee the light of my goſpel, becauſe ye are adjudged to perdition and damnation: ſo the blame is in your blindneſſe, who are appointed to damnation before all eternity. So this verſe being plaine, let vs obſerue ſome leſſons. The firſt is this: There hath beene, and is, many in the world, in all ages, that neuer ſaw, ſeeth, nor ſhall ſee the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Ye haue an example of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Goſpel ſhould ſhine clearer than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne at noone time of the day, it ſhall neuer be ſeene of them, it will be hidden to them, howbeit it ſhould bee as a booke laide open before them, yet it will bee a claſped booke to them. Let euerie man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of himſelfe, for this is a neceſſitie laide vpon the multitude of this worlde. A multitude hath bene in all ages, a multitude is in this age, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhal be in euerie age to come, who ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſee the light of the Goſpell. The next leſſon is: Theſe folke haue this propertie, and diſpoſition,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16627:76"/>
(beeing pleaſurers of themſelues) they are euer quarreling with the Goſpell, amongſt all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the worlde they are the moſt quarrellous, they, I ſay, who get the leaſt good of it, are alwayes the moſte quarrellous, and euermore laying the fault either vpon the Goſpel, or vpon the teachers thereof, becauſe they neither get light nor conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereby. Beware of this quarrellous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. I marke thirdlie, where is the fault, or in whome? They blame the Goſpell, and the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers therof, but where is the fault indeed? <hi>Paule</hi> telleth thee heere, <hi>If my Goſpell bee hidden, it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to them that periſh.</hi> That perdition and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction wherunto thou art appointed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, is the cauſe wherefore thou receiueſt no conſolation, no light in thy ſoule thorow the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. Thou layeſt the fault where it is not, thou art like a blinde man, that will ſtand vp againſt the Sunne, ſhining at the noone time of the daye, and accuſe it becauſe it ſhineth not, when in the meane time it is ſhining vpon the face of him. Thou art a veſſel of perdition, if there bee not a remedie, and becauſe the ſentence is paſt, therefore, as when a thiefe or a murtherer is once condemned to death, the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Prince is with-drawne from him, that hee may looke on him no more: Euen ſo, if once a creature bee adjudged to death, the gracious countenance of Ieſus Chriſt is with-drawne from him, leſt hee ſhould beholde it in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:16627:77"/>Another thing followeth: There are manie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of damnation, that men and women are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death: Amongſt the reſt this is a ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, If the Goſpell be hidden to thee, euen as it is preached in SCOTLAND, (wee haue neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> to teach vnto vs) yet if it be hidden to thee, if thou receiue neither light nor conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it, as it is now preached, if thou continue ſo till thy life be in thy lips, as wee ſpeake, till the laſt gaſpe, thou haſt a ſeale in thine owne boſome of euerlaſting damnation: thine heart is marked with the marke of perdition: yea, if thou bee a king, thou art a veſſell ordained for ſhame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, learne here: seeing there muſt be a number that muſt periſh, and a number of all eſtates in the worlde muſt die, that muſt goe to Hell, ordained from all eternitie to perdition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile not your ſelues, and ſeeing to this number the Goſpel muſt bee hidden, and muſt be a cloſed booke, they can neuer haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation of it. Then thou that deliteſt to walke in the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Ieſus Chriſt, thinke thou not euill of this Goſpell, thinke thou not euill of this Miniſterie. Ioyne theſe two together, that cannot bee ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Goſpel and the Miniſtery. Thou that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt euill of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſterie, thou thinkeſt euill of the Goſpell: bee thou not aſhamed of the Miniſters, nor of their bondes, nor of their captiuitie, nor of their death, nor of no croſſe that can be laid vpon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16627:77"/>
them: (the 2. Epiſt. to <hi>Timot.</hi> and the 8. Chapter) For the multitude of the worlde thinketh ſhame of the Goſpell, and of the Miniſters thereof, when affliction once commeth vpon them. Thou that loueſt the Goſpel, keepe thy comfort in thine own boſome, and aſſure thy ſelfe, there is none other way to Heauen: and knowing well, that this muſt bee the hazarde of the Goſpell, and of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, take all theſe troubles for ſure tokens of the trueth of God. I loue not the Goſpell that hath the countenance of the Princes of this world, and hath the confluence of the multitude. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and multitude of this worlde hath euer borne the pure Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt at hatred. Thus ſarre for the firſt cauſe, wherefore the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt is hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from manie, to wit, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereunto they are adjudged from all eternitie.</p>
            <p>Nowe take vp in the next verſe another cauſe wherefore the Goſpel is hidden to many, <hi>In whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the god of this world hath blinded their minds.</hi> The ſecond cauſe is excecation, blind-folding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> putting out of the eyes, and all to this ende, that they ſhoulde not get a ſight of the glorious light of the Goſpel, and ſo be ſaued. But how commeth this to paſſe? howe are they blinded? I ſhall tell you: Once beeing adjudged to die, and ordained in the counſell of God to perdition, in commeth the god of this worlde, that is, the Deuill, whome this worlde maketh a god of, the God of Heauen
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16627:78"/>
ſendeth him. Whome to ſendeth Hee him? Vnto that catiue, that miſerable creature that is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for perdition, as a torturer, &amp; perſecuter, an hang-man, to put that eternall decree in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And what doeth hee when he commeth in? The firſt turne that euer hee doeth, hee bindeth him. What bindeth hee, his handes or his feete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, he letteth them louſe, and letteth him worke on with them his owne ruine, and runne on vnto his owne perdition: But hee bindeth his eyes, or rather, pulleth them out, that the miſerable bodie may not ſee the gracious face of Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he ſent vnto him? The cauſe is not onelie in the ordinance of God, but in the catiue himſelfe, that maliciouſly repineth to the light, and will not receiue the Goſpell, therefore the GOD of Heauen ſendeth the Deuil to put out his eyes, that he ſhould not ſee. Mark then the leſſon: They that are adjudged to die &amp; to perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world to come, in this worlde, ere euer they goe out of this life, they are bounde like thieues and murtherers, to bee preſented bound to that damnation that is to enſue: they are reſerued in chaines till that great Daye. What chaines are theſe? Chaines of darkneſſe, their eyes are plucked out, that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, in that great Day, they may bee caſt into Hell, into that Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer. There is neuer a ſoule y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goeth to damnation in the worlde to come, but in this life it is blinded: Yee know the Ethnickes ſaying,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16627:78"/>
               <hi>Quos perdere vult</hi> IVPITER, <hi>iis mentem ſolet adimere.</hi> It is a true ſaying: and therefore, take vp a ſure note of perdition to come, excecation, blindneſſe: ſo that if thou canſt not ſee that gracious face of CHRIST in the Goſpel at no time, for all thine hearing, for all this Miniſtery that is in the world, take heede to thy ſelfe, and feare that euerlaſting damnation. Bee neuer at quiet night nor daye, till thou ſeeſt a light in thy minde by the Goſpell: otherwiſe thy conſcience ſhall condemne, thee as a veſſell of perdition. The Goſpell is not ſent for nothing: either ſhall it bee vnto thee a ſauour of life vnto Life, or a ſauour of death vnto Death, and this ſhall bee juſtified one day: And except thou get light, thou ſhalt curſe the time that euer thou hearde the Goſpell, when it commeth to that damnation. Another thing marke heere: When commeth the god of this worlde to blinde men? (Looke to the order of the Text) The firſt cauſe is counted perdition &amp; GODS ordinance, then commeth in the Deuill. When commeth in the Deuill? When GOD hath firſt ſaide the worde, I will haue this bodie periſhing, and will bee glorified in his perdition; then commeth in the torturer, and plucketh out his eyes. So the Deuill is nothing to GOD, but a perſecuter, a miniſter of His wrath, when Hee is angrie, than is the lowne at hande, as a ſlaue, to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that wrath. But it is a ſore pitie to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miſerable bodie on whome this wrath is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16627:79"/>
executed! When the hang-man commeth to bind the hands of a bodie, that bodie is ſorrowfull and ſad: but when the Deuill is binding thee, thou art merrie in the meane time: &amp; when he is a Deuil to thee, thou thinkeſt hee is a God to thee. Thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rejoyceſt, but in blindnes: look to experience, The multitude of this Land is neuer merrier, than when he is binding them, and drawing them to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, to murther and villanie, to gluttonie and dronkenneſſe: Count not of ſuch a man: but ſaye, or thinke, if thou dare not ſay it, O miſerable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue! the Deuill is blinding thee, and leading thee to perdition.</p>
            <p>Nowe marke in the thirde roome, the cauſes which haſten this damnation, and which muſt paſſe before the god of this worlde come as a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer to put in execution the ſentence of GOD. There muſt goe before this excecation, and that damnation that followeth this excecation, a cauſe in thy ſelfe, thou muſt euer bee the cauſer of thine owne death: notwithſtanding the ordinance of God, yet thou neuer periſheſt till thou be worthie of thine own death, and merite thine own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What bringeth on this blindneſſe? A mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, falſe, infidell heart, repugning to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for thou firſt deſpiſeſt it, and rejecteſt it ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſlie and deſpite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

heart, that thou wilt not ſee not look in the light when it is offered to thee, and holden vp before thine eyes: then He ſendeth His torturer &amp; ſaith, Go thy wayes, Sathan, and plucke out the eyes of this bodie: then hee plucketh out the eyes of thy mind immediately, and God giueth thee ouer to a reprobate ſenſe: and this is it which the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>It pleaſed them not to retaine God in knowledge, therefore God gaue them ouer to a reprobate ſenſe.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Hauing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their cogitations darkned, and beeing ſtrangers from the life of God, thorow the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the hardneſſe of their heartes.</hi> There plainlie hee letteth vs ſee that the hardneſſe &amp; malice of their heartes bringeth on this ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

            <p>Now, Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there are ſome words that I muſt weigh to you, as the Lord ſhall giue me the grace, &amp; I ſhall repeat them, &amp; marke ye with me, if they be not weighty, <hi>That the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, which is the image of God ſhuld not ſhine vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or ſpread His beames vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: ye know, &amp; anie man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath knowledge knoweth, that this might haue bene ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in fewer &amp; baſer words, but the Apo. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents not himſelf with baſe words in ſuch a matter, but ſaith, <hi>that</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>light of the glorious goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16627:80"/>
Well, is there one word here in vaine? and is there any cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of words made for nothing? are ſimple baſe words changed into glorious words for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? no (alas! we cannot ſee this) and it is one of the things in the world that I would faineſt haue you to vnderſtand, what moueth the Apoſtles and Prophets to vſe ſuch an high language, and ſet vp a thing in ſuch glorious tearmes, the which they might vtter in baſer tearmes. Thinke not that the men of God, Prophets and Apoſtles, haue ſpoken (as we ſay) <hi>hyperbolicè,</hi> great and loftie words, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the matter. Theſe wordes are borrowed words, and they are borrowed from the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing in the earth, and yet they attaine not to the thouſand part of the things which by them he would expreſſe. All the high wordes that a man can vſe to expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of Chriſt, are not able to expreſſe the thouſand part of that glorie.</p>
            <p>But to come to the purpoſe. Ye haue ſet down firſt in glorious tearmes the effect of the Goſpell: it is ſet down in ſhining and beames, thereafter ye haue ſet downe the Goſpell it ſelfe. To come to the firſt: The moſt glorious thing that a man can ſee in this earth, is the ſhining of the Sunn, which the Lord hath fixed in the Heauens. The pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thing that a man can looke to, when he hath looked to all theſe earthlie thinges, is the glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Sunne in a faire day. And therefore, ye ſee the glorie of the Sunne is deſcribed very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 19. Pſalme. To applie this:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16627:80"/>
Euen ſo the effect of the Goſpell beeing the moſt glorious effect that euer was wrought: the Spirite of God ſetteth it out by the moſt glorious thing in the world, the ſpreading of the Sunne beames. And ſurelie, ſuppoſe there were no more but this word [<hi>Shyning</hi>] it letteth vs ſee a wonderfull effect of the Goſpell in the hearts of men and women. Ye ſee by experience, the beames of the Sunne, ſuppoſe they were neuer ſo bright, will neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bodie which they ſhine vpon, nor make it bright like themſelues: the ſunne hath ſhined this long time in the world, but yet by ſhining it could neuer ſo tranſ-change any creature, that it coulde become as bright as the Sunne it ſelfe. It may well let thee ſee the bodie that is <hi>opacum</hi> (as wee ſaye) darke &amp; obſcure, ſo long as it ſhineth, but as ſoone as it is remooued, the bodie is darke as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But as to the Goſpell: The Goſpell, with the beames of it, not onelie maketh the object where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it ſhineth, to be ſeene, and to appeare: but it doeth more, it transformeth the ſoule of the man or woman into that ſame light and brightneſſe that is in it: That is to ſay, The face of IESVS, the Sunne of righteouſneſſe that ſhineth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, when the beames of it ſtriketh vpon thy ſoule, they make it lightſome and bright like the face of Ieſus, they turne the ſoule in the ſhape of the face of IESVS, that ſhineth in the Goſpell. Would yee haue Scripture for this? looke the laſt verſe of the chapter going before, <hi>We behold</hi> (ſaieth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16627:81"/>
hee) <hi>as in a mirrour, the glorie of God with an open face. and are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> And this is done in ſuch a ſort (O would to God wee knew the power of the Goſpell) that thou, who hadſt nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within thee, art made a ſhining light, caſting out thy beames, and ouer-ſhadowing ſillie darke bodies. Hee that brought light out of darkneſſe (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) by His word, Hee hath ſhined in mine heart, that I may miniſter the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt to others. So is it moſte certaine, thou in whome the Goſpell is ſo powerfull, art made a light in the world, to illuminate darke ſoules.</p>
            <p>Nowe to come to the next, the Goſpell it ſelfe: How expreſſeth he the Goſpell? Hee calleth it not ſimplie and barelie with a meane word, The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, (all theſe meane words, and ſillie ſimple ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of ſuch a glorie, telleth what feeling men haue in their heartes of the effectualneſſe of the Goſpell) but hee calleth it, The light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, The Goſpell is a light, and it is the light of lightes. The Sunne, albeit it be bright, was neuer comparable to it in ſhining, and therefore it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth out ſuch glorious beames in the ſoules of men and women. What is the cauſe that it is a light? The cauſe is in the ſubject of it. The ſubject of it is glorie. What will make a light, if glory will not make it? The Goſpell, is the Goſpell of glory, and all that is within it is glorie. What glorie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:16627:81"/>
his glory muſt be a great glory: what kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this Chriſt? He is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of God. He neuer reſteth mounting vp till he come to that diuinity. Lo how he riſeth: he climbeth from the Goſpel to the Mediator, &amp; from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mediator to that glorious Majeſty. So all the glorie that ſhineth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, and all the light of the Goſpel, is that light of God which th'Apo. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> light which hath none acceſſe, &amp; neuer man had acceſſe to it, till this Ieſus brought it down, &amp; without this light thou art but darkneſſe, and ſhalt end in exteriour &amp; vtter darkneſſe. All the beames of the Sunne are but darkneſſe in reſpect of it. The Sunne is but a creature, this is the light vncreated of the glorious GOD, the verie eſſence of GOD, count of it as thou wilt. Now marke one thing of this: This man by his ſpeach leadeth vs to his hart, what are words, if they want the heart? and if they haue no life, what are wordes to bee reſpected, ſuppoſe thou ſpeakeſt a thouſande yeeres of light and glorie, if thou haue neither light nor glorie in thy ſoule. Certainely, there are none that will looke to theſe wordes, but they may ſee the mans heart was repleniſhed with this light and glorie whereof hee ſpake. The face of IESVS ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on his ſoule, and ſo wonderfullie hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that conception, and fulneſſe of the heart, in ſuch wordes as are marueilous. The heart of PAVLE was full of light and glorie. But I ſee little light in the heartes of men and women, in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16627:82"/>
reſpect of that light which was in his heart. And therefore, Brethren, to ſpeake the trueth, becauſe this Goſpell, howbeit it hath beene ſounding in the eare theſe manie yeeres in this Lande, yet it hath not entered into the hearts of men &amp; wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it hath bene a ſound in the eare, but not a light in the ſoule, becauſe thou haſt not ſuffered it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thine heart, &amp; kept it there: therefore, the Lord is threatning to take it from thine eare alſo: and ſo will be ſeene on EDINBVRGH one day. The eye is alwayes vpon men, but thou lookeſt not to that poyſonable heart of thine, that is procuring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> away-taking of this Goſpel out of thine eare, and except ye deſcend into your owne hearts, &amp; ſearch the emptineſſe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> light in them, it is not poſſible that it can remaine. Can it bee poſſible that this contempt of the Goſpell, that of her owne nature is ſo effectuall in the hearts of men, can bee borne with for euer? No, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord will not ſuffer this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bee vnpuniſhed. And therefore, the Lord appearantly hath ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I will put away my Goſpel from this vngrateful people, whom it hath not illuminated after ſo long time.</hi> So ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue bene long looking to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, looke as long on your owne falſe hearts that are the cauſe of all. Yet, Brethren, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of al this contempt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, the Lord ſaue me, &amp; all them that I wiſh well to, from this, to be an inſtrument of the with-drawing of it for yet it was neuer ſeene that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord vſed good men to be inſtruments in ſuch a deed. Who is it that is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16627:82"/>
heere ſent to blind this worlde? who but the god of this world, the Deuil!? and therfore I giue this watch-word, Let no man preaſſe to bee the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the away-taking of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Nowe I ſhall take vp the next verſe ſhortly, and ſo I ſhall end. In the next verſe the Apoſtle giueth the reaſon wherefore they to whome the Goſpell was hidden, behoued to be they who were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for perdition, and whome the god of this world hath blinded. His reaſon is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen from his ſinceritie in preaching the Goſpell, <hi>For</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>wee preach not our ſelues:</hi> Whom preach I then? <hi>but IESUS CHRIST the LORD,</hi> and I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Him to be the Lord in my Goſpel: and what preached I of my ſelfe? <hi>Our ſelues your ſeruantes for Christ Ieſus ſake.</hi> For the Bridegromes cauſe I was a ſeruant to the Bride, for His cauſe who is the onelie Head and LORD of the Church, I was a ſeruant to the Church. Then of this reaſon marke this leſſon: A man, whome the LORD raileth to preach the Goſpell, not to ſeeke himſelfe, nor his owne aduancement, nor worldlie riches, nor honour, but onelie to preach the Goſpell in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, what effect will hee haue in his preaching? Strange effectes will followe him: if hee ſaue thee not, if hee winne thee not to God, if he miniſter not comfort to thee by his Goſpell, what will hee doe? I ſhall tell thee, Hee will put a ſtampe vpon thee, and thruſt it into thine heart &amp; conſcience, teſtifying to thee in the owne time (for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16627:83"/>
wakeneth not in all men at all times) that thou waſt not faithfull, but a reprobate ordained to perdition from all eternitie, if thou getteſt not repentance in time, and if the Goſpell preached by a ſincere man hath not fructified in thee, all his preaching is but a ſeale to thee of thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in the Great Day ſhall ſtand vp and aggrege thy judgement.</p>
            <p>Marke another thing heere: What is this that maketh this man ſo bold? He will denounce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, excecation, and blind-folding by the god of this world, (I aſſure you, this is a bolde ſpeach to denounce damnation) but what maketh him ſo bolde? Yee ſee it in a worde, the conſcience of his owne ſinceritie, that in his preaching hee ſought not himſelfe, but the LORD his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. There is the leſſon. A man whom the LORD will ſende (and the LORD as certainlie will ſende men to ſpeake in ſinceritie his meſſage, as euer he ſent any Prophet in the worlde, howbeit there be not an extraordinarie calling nowe) A man, I ſay, whom the LORD will ſend, he will denounce damnation to an obſtinate and rebellious people: and hee will bee bolde to take thee, as it were, by the eare ſuppoſe thou bee a king, and leade thee to that Tribunall to heare the ſentence of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pronounced againſt thee. The LORD giue mee this ſinceritie, and then I will not care for all the kinges and all the men in the worlde: for the LORD will giue boldneſſe to the man whome he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16627:83"/>
raiſeth in ſinceritie to cyte kinges before that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Another thing I ſee in this Text: There is no lord, but the Lord IESVS, who will tread down all the lordes in the earth, and treade vpon their neckes at his pleaſure. And more I ſee, There is no Ladie, nor Queene, but the Church, the Spouſe of IESVS CHRIST: As for Kinges, Queenes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickes in the earth, all are but ſeruantes onelie, Kinges ſeruantes, Queenes ſeruantes, Paſtors and Miniſters ſeruants and nouriſhers of the Church of IESVS: The Apoſtles, ſeruants, miniſtring food to this glorious bodie of IESVS, and feeding it with the ſincere milke of the worde. And that is it which the Apoſtle ſaith in the 1. epiſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Corin.</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 22. ſpeaking of himſelfe, and others. <hi>All is yours</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. Euen ſo, all is yours, all are but ſeruants to you, ye are Chriſtes, Hee is your Lord, ye haue none other lord, but Chriſt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church muſt haue a great prerogatiue, juriſdiction, and liberty. She is a Queene, and if euer there was in any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey a juriſdiction and libertie, ſhee hath it giuen her of her Spouſe, the Lord IESVS. Then ye know what ſhould follow: If ſhee haue a libertie and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, I will ſpeake that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the ſecond epiſt. to the <hi>Corin.</hi> chap. 13. verſ. 10. <hi>God hath not giuen me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paule</hi>) <hi>power to your deſtruction, but all the power which GOD hath giuen mee is to your edification.</hi> The GOD of

Let none earthly power meddle with it, and beware that no irruption bee made within it. There was neuer Emperour nor Monarch of this worlde, that made irruption within it, that euer wanne by it. Therefore, let euerie ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware to meddle with this libertie: for certainelie, that ſworde that ſhall be ſtrocken at her, ſhee ſhall<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding it back again like the hammer off the ſtithie.

And therefore, the LORD open mens eyes, and let them ſee this, that they may reuerence this glorious Spouſe of IESVS CHRIST, as euer they would ſee that glorious Face of CHRIST IESVS Her Head: To whome with the Father, and the Holie Spirite, bee all Praiſe, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, worlde vvithout end: ſo bee it.</p>

            <p>Now in the latter part of the verſe, hee ſetteth downe a deſcription of himſelfe, <hi>I Paul, who when I am preſent among you am baſe, but am bolde towardes you being abſent.</hi> This is one thing in effect with that which followeth afterwards in the 10. verſe of this chap. (for this diſ-eſtimation of himſelfe, is from that light account and regarde that they made of him, and of the Goſpel which he teached) For the Letters (ſaith he) are ſore and ſtrong, but his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie preſence is weake, and his ſpeach is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. He here deſcribeth himſelf conforme to their diſ-eſtimation of him, for the miſ-liking is recent in his memorie, yet his ſpeach is meeke to them. This matter would haue angered a good man, but <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo farre from anger, that hee breaketh out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16627:86"/>
in a gentle and humble requeſt. Whereupon I note, That the vnthankfullnes of the world ſhould not breake our patience, or cauſe vs forget that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie wherewith the Embaſſadour of Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde bee endued: for lenitie is bounde to vs, and wee are bound to it, yea, although this worlde be neuer ſo vngrate, yet we are bound to ſtriue by long ſuffering to ouercome in the ende. Secondly, think ye not but <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould haue thoght ſhame to regiſtrate (as it were) his own ſhame to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſteritie to come, ſo that I may ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> thou waſt of none eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; euery one may ſee in how ſmal acou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he was amongſt theſe people. There is none of vs all, if there be anie infirmitie in vs, but wee would haue it hidden: but a man hauing a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcharging a faithful part of duetie, is nothing blotted by the ſpeaking of the world, nor the regiſtrating of their ſpeaches, is nothing to his ſhame: But the ſhame pertaineth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: their words and deeds towards the Paſtor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in his memorie, and in the memorie of God, and ſhall continue vntill the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; except they repent: yea, euen theſe ſame wordes ſpoken againſt <hi>Paule,</hi> ſhall meete them in the teeth at the day of Iudgement.</p>
            <p>Yet I ſee in theſe wordes a ſharpneſſe and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mixed with lenitie, to let vs ſee, that when we haue to doe with wicked men, lenitie and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould not be corrupted, but tempered with ſharpeneſſe, that vngratefull men may be brought
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16627:87"/>
to a ſenſe and feeling of ſinne and miſerie. Lenitie alone will not ſerue the turne, but with ſweetneſſe ſowreneſſe muſt be mingled, that the word ſpoken may be the more effectuall and forcible, <hi>who when I am preſent among you am baſe,</hi> &amp;c. The worlde, and the men of this world account of nothing but of that which hath a faire ſhew, and that they eſteem highly of, although it were neuer ſo litle worthie: The ground whereof is this: All men and women by nature are hypocrites, painted bodies, no ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in them, all are viſorned folke: hee commeth out, ſhee commeth out, all masked and diſguiſed: For what is an hypocrite, but a falſe ſhowe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſurely: And therefore, becauſe there is no ſoliditie in themſelues, they can account nothing of ſoliditie: as hee is himſelfe, ſuch is his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others: as ſhee is her ſelfe, ſuch is her eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of others.

               <hi>And this I require you, that I need not to be bold, &amp;c.</hi> In this next verſe we haue his requeſt expreſſed in few words, which is as much in effect as if he wold ſay, Seeing I am the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to acknowledge of me as of an Apoſtle. The argument is, If ye count not of mee, whileſt I am abſent, when I come, if there be anie power in me, I ſhall make you knowe it, and vtter it againſt you: ye ſhall finde me bolde, and not baſe: ye ſhall finde ſowrneſſe, and not meekneſſe: ſharpneſſe, and not lenitie. Here he telleth by a compariſon, what kinde of boldneſſe hee will vſe: When I come to you, I ſhall vſe the ſame boldneſſe towardes you, that I vſe towardes the falſe apoſtles: and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe apoſtles, I ſhal thunder out againſt them ſhame, and confuſion, &amp; ignominie, ſo that they that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth not of me, that I am the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall finde my power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

is he therefore ſeeking his owne honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? No, hee is ſeeking the weale of the people. It is the weale of the people to count of the ſeruant of GOD, for when they count not of him, they cannot account nor accept of his doctrine: and when the doctrine is not well accepted of, then goeth the building ſlowlie forward Alas! this euill eſteeming of men in the Miniſterie, is the cauſe that ſo fewe are edified, and ſo manie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine faithleſſe: for where the man is lightlied, the doctrine is contemned: and where the doctrine is contemned, there can be no faith, no edifying: ſo that it is a greater matter to contemne the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, than men thinke it to be.</p>

Oratours, hee vſeth no lenitie towardes them. Yet there is a diſcretion to bee had betwixt the dealing with falſe teachers, and with the people. There ſhould be lenitie vſed towards the people: but what ſhould bee with a deceiuing lowne, that beginneth to bring the trueth in ſlander? Hee muſt bee handled with ſeueritie and rigour: no lenitie ſhould bee vſed towardes theſe that crcepe in daylie to bring the trueth in ſlander: Yee know their voyces, Who made LVTHER a Miniſter? Who made CALVIN a Miniſter? But they ſhall finde it one day that LVTHER and CALVIN were Miniſters, and that there was a power in the word which LVTHER and CALVIN teached: For this is true that PAVLE ſpake, <hi>The LORD conſumeth them daylie with the word that commeth out of the mouthes of His Ministers, and ſhall conſume them daylie, vntill the Daye of the LORDS appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

            <p>In the third verſe hee falleth out in a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the maner of his walking, <hi>Neuertheleſſe, though wee walke in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Though wee liue in the fleſh, that is, in the infirmitie of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature: for, to liue in the fleſh heere, is to liue in the weakneſſe of nature, <hi>yet we walke not, or warre not, according to the fleſh:</hi> that is, our actions and doinges in our Apoſtleſhip are not fleſhlie and weake: Yee ſee the outward bodie is weake, but meaſure not the inward man after the bodie and ſtrength thereof: for, ſuppoſe my bodie be weake,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16627:89"/>
yet mine actions are ſtrong. So hee taketh to him one thing, and refuſeth another.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, let euerie man that liueth take gladlie to him frailtie and weakneſſe: and if men call thee weake, take it to thee: for hee that will bee ſtrong in himſelfe, cannot bee ſtrong in GOD. In this ſame Epiſtle (Chap. 12. verſe 9.) <hi>The power of GOD</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>is made perfect in mine infirmitie.</hi> Of all men in the worlde, a man whoſe calling is to bee a Miniſter, ſhoulde take chiefelie vpon him this frailtie and weakneſſe: yea, let him accept it more redilie than it can bee caſten to him: and as hee is fraile and weake, ſo hee muſt feele his frailtie and weakneſſe, and the chiefeſt part of his preaching ſhould bee of frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and that Miniſter that neuer felt his owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, cannot perſwade the people that they are miſerable, and bring them to an acknowledging of it.</p>
            <p>And heerein appeareth the wiſdome of GOD, who chooſeth not to this Miniſterie thoſe who haue the greateſt graces of nature, and naturall giftes, but Hee chooſeth out the weake ones, and contemptible bodies, that are amongſt men, and Hee ſetteth them vp to bee Preachers to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as Hee ſpeaketh in the firſt Epiſtle to the CORINTHIANS, in the firſt Chapter, and the ſixe and twentie verſe, <hi>Yee ſee, Brethren, your calling, howe that not manie wiſe men amongst you according to the fleſh, not manie mightie, not manie noble are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16627:90"/>
               <hi>but GOD hath choſen the fooliſh thinges of the worlde, to confound the wiſe, and GOD hath choſen the weake thinges of the worlde, to confound the mightie.</hi> So the Lord chooſeth the ignoble and ſillie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſetteth them vp aboue kinges, yea, and the greateſt Monarches of the worlde, to beate them downe.</p>
            <p>Marke againe, as euerie man ſhoulde willinglie take to him this frailtie and weakneſſe of nature, ſo let him refuſe the other, that is to ſaye, let him refuſe to walk according to the fleſh: To walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, and to warre according to the fleſh, is all one, (for the walking of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a warrefare.) Holde backe theſe fleſhlie actions, and namelie, theſe actions of ſinne: take to thee the weakneſſe of nature, but caſt off ſinne: For if thine actions bee altogether fleſhlie, bee thou ſure thou haſt no part of the power of God, nor of the life of IESVS CHRIST: thou haſt but the life of a man, or of a woman, and ſhalt die like a man or a woman without the life of GOD. But aboue all men in the worlde, let a Miniſter eſchewe theſe actions of the fleſh, looke that his actions bee powerfull, and that the power of GOD appeare in his walking: ſo that when in outwarde appearance hee is but a weake bodie, yet it may bee ſaid of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ſtrong in Chriſt: For as weake as hee is to looke to, yet hee is a ſtrong warrier, the Spirite is ſenſible in him, hee ſpeaketh not like a man onelie, there is another
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16627:90"/>
grace conuoying his wordes, than can accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the worde of man. If thou bee a Miniſter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou were neuer ſo ſtrong in bodie, if thou findeſt not GODS power in thy life and doctrine, I will not giue one penny for thee: looke that thou feele the power that <hi>Paule</hi> felt, as yee reade in the 2. Epiſt. to the <hi>Corin.</hi> chap. 4. verſ. 16. when hee was dying in the bodie, then was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man quickeſt in him: and the more the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie life was away, the more the life of, GOD was manifeſt in him. A Miniſter that hath not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of GOD within him, howe can hee preach of CHRISTES power, or of His life? howe can hee bee a Miniſter of life, that hath no taſto of life himſelfe? how can he preach of life, that neuer felt life? of neceſsity, he muſt be a ſhameleſſe man, that will ſpeake of Chriſt, of His mercie, life, and power, when in the meane time hee knoweth not what the mercie, life, &amp; power of Chriſt meaneth: that man was neuer called of God to bee a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, all that hee ſpeaketh is like the babling of a Parockquet, the power of God doeth the deede: &amp; therfore, God chooſeth the weake inſtruments, that the world may ſee, that it is onelie His grace, and not the gifts of the men that doeth the turne. He calleth it not his walking, but warring &amp; figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The life of a Miniſter is but <hi>a warre-fare:</hi> and hee who would bee a Miniſter, ſhoulde make him for warre-fare, make him for paine and labour, otherwiſe, let him neuer ſtriue for that calling:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16627:91"/>
Yea, there is nothing ſo laborious or painefull, but the life of a Miniſter is compared vnto it. We neuer read in the Scriptures where it is compared to any thing that importeth eaſineſſe or idleneſſe. 1. CORIN. 9. 26. The Miniſter is compared to <hi>a Warrier,</hi> then to <hi>a runner,</hi> running with all his maine ſpeede, ſtriuing to come to the marke, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looking ouer his ſhoulder to this or that thing, as manie will doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, I haue done this turne, or that turne. No, when thou haſt done all thou canſt doe, ſay, thou haſt done nothing. Then hee is compared to <hi>a wrastler,</hi> and to <hi>an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that holdeth the plough from morning till euening. In all theſe compariſons of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the figure is not ſo great as the thing figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: when an heauenlie thing is compared with a worldlie thing, the worldlie thing is nothing in reſpect of the heauenlie thing. And therefore, there is no man comparable to the Miniſter in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the <hi>warrier,</hi> the <hi>runner,</hi> the <hi>plow-man,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him.</p>

            <p>In the next verſe hee prooueth that his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and fighting in this worlde was not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, taking the argument from the weapons and armour wherewith hee fought, ſuch as the armour is ſuch ſhall the warring bee, if the armour bee weake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fight ſhall be weake: if the armour bee ſtrong, the fight ſhall bee ſtrong. <hi>Our armour</hi> (ſaieth the Apoſtle) <hi>is not fleſhlie,</hi> our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are not of fleſh nor fraile matter, <hi>but our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are ſtrong through GOD,</hi> the power of GOD is in them, GOD is in the worde which wee ſpeake, Hee ſetteth downe the ende, <hi>To beate downe ſtrong holdes:</hi> This power will beate them downe, nothing will gaine-ſtand it.</p>

of the heart, which as an high mountaine, riſing vp as it were to the heauen, exalteth it ſelfe againſt GOD, and holdeth out GOD, and the light of GOD. Theſe then are the thinges which <hi>Paul</hi> aſſaulteth Nowe to come to the battell, the firſt thing that <hi>Paule</hi> doeth, hee wealdes his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſo skilfullie, that firſt of all he beateth down all the imaginations and reaſonings of the mind, which are as rampieres and fowſies wherewith ſhee circuiteth her ſelfe to holde out GOD and His light. Next, hee aſſaulteth the pride of the heart, which as a mountaine exalted it ſelf againſt GOD, hee beateth it downe, and maketh it equall with the ground. Thirdlie, hauing beaten downe all, hee commeth and taketh the thiefe by the necke, and leadeth him by the haire captiue to IESVS CHRIST, not to himſelfe, that he ſhould bee king ouer her: No. IESVS CHRIST is the King ouer the ſoule, as the Apoſtle in the ſecond epiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> chap. 11. verſ. 2. voweth the Church of GOD not to himſelfe, but to her Spouſe, to the ende that ſhee may bee ſafe, and GOD glorified. The man that ſeeketh his owne gaine, is but an hyreling. There are three actions heere, whereof the firſt two are none other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the deſtroying of the ſinne that is in the mind and in the heart. The third is the ſauing of man, by leading him captiue to Ieſus Chriſt, for the leading of a man captiue to Ieſus Chriſt, is his ſafetie, and the libertie of the ſoule is this capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16627:93"/>
and the ſlauerie of the ſoule is libertie to ſinne. <hi>When ye were ſlaues to ſinne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſixt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> the twentie verſe) <hi>then yee were free from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> Marke heere a wonderfull power of God in this baſe and ſillie Miniſterie, (O! would to GOD men coulde knowe this power) deſtroying the deceite of reaſon, and beating down the pride of the heart of man, mounting vp againſt GOD. Alas, ſo great is the power of ſinne, that it hath no match vnder heauen but this Miniſterie. I will tell it ouer againe, There is nothing to throw this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer downe but this Miniſterie. When this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie was not in the world amongſt the Gentiles (of the which SCOTLAND was one part, for our Progenitors were Gentiles without GOD in the world) ſinne raigned to death: (<hi>Roman.</hi> 5. 21) Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Gentiles periſhed: but from the time that Ieſus Chriſt, the author of grace, came into the world, and brought with Him this Miniſtery, firſt He himſelfe, thereafter His Apoſtles, amongſt whome <hi>Paul</hi> was as painfull as anie man) made it manifeſt howe powerfull this Miniſterie was by demoliſhing the kingdom of ſinne, for then grace beganne to reigne, and the power of GOD was manifeſted.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I dare affirme the onelie thing that holdeth down the power of ſinne is this ſillie baſe Miniſterie, take it away, (for men wold faine haue it away) and ſhoote it to the doore, (and for ought

This worlde thinketh that wee are come to ſlaye them: No, wee are come to ſlay ſinne in you, that will ſlay you, if it be not ſlaine. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the 1. epiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 12. &amp; 13.) compareth the Miniſtery to a burning fire, that burneth vp haye, ſtubble, and trees: euen ſo it burneth vp thy ſinne, and the droſſe of thy nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Howe is this that the world cannot abide the meane of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? they cannot get reſt neither night nor day, till they get away the thing that ſaueth them. Nowe it ſaueth the man, by taking him, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him captiue vnder the King of glorie. Ye ſee they that are ſuperiours in the battell, when they ſay to anie man.

Therefore, bleſſed are they that can ſuffer the ordinance of GOD, and ſtand ſtill vntill ſinne bee ſlaine, and they themſelues bee ledde captiues vnder Chriſt, for that captiuitie vnder Him is true freedome.

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AVL lying in bandes at ROME, there riſeth vp two ſortes of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: The firſt ſort of them that preached ſincerelie, that GOD and His glorie might be aduanced. The ſecond ſort of them that preached not ſincerelie, not for the aduancement of Chriſt nor His Goſpell, but to adde afflictions to <hi>Paule</hi> bands, moued with ambition and enuie towards him.</p>
            <p>In the firſt verſe which wee haue read in your audience, <hi>Paule</hi> vttereth his minde concerning theſe two ſortes of Preachers, and this is his mind in effect, Let them (ſaieth hee) preach as they will preach, let them preach of ſinceritie for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſt, let them preach for the faſhion: how<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer they preach, (preaching the trueth of God)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16627:95"/>
CHRIST is preached, euen by them who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not ſincerelie. And therfore, becauſe Chriſt is preached, I rejoyce notwithſtanding of all that injurie which I receiue by their preaching: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and will rejoyce, and no man will bee able to take my joye from me. Shortlie then, there is <hi>Paules</hi> minde concerning theſe two ſortes.</p>
            <p>My doctrine ſhall bee generall: And the firſt thing that I marke heere is this, (and anie of you may ſee it) The Lord is glorified, Chriſt is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, euen by a counterfeite doing of men, when they doe the thing that is good: yet not in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, nor of purpoſe to glorifie GOD in their doing. But their purpoſe not beeing to glorifie God in their doing, (they not doing ſincerelie) howbeit Hee getteth His owne glorie by their doing, yet they ſhall get little thankes. It is not ſo much the turne it ſelfe, the action it ſelfe, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or whatſoeuer it bee, that procureth to a man thanks and grace at the handes of God, as it is the purpoſe &amp; intention in doing. I had rather doe the ſobereſt thing in the world, and if it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> eate my meate, and drinke my drinke, of purpoſe to glorifie God in my doing, than to do the greateſt and faireſt worke that can be ſeene to the eye of man, without purpoſe to glorifie God in that doing. Marke it: Whether yee eat, whether ye drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, little or much, do all to the glorie of God, ſaieth <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. And therefore, Brethren, there is nothing that a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16627:96"/>
man ſhould ſo much looke to in his doinges and actions, as to his purpoſe, and to the intention of his heart. Looke thou as thou wilt, the Lord loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth chiefelie to euerie mans intention and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He that preacheth, what is to bee reſpected with what meaſure of grace he preach, if in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his intention be to glorifie God &amp; Chriſt: whatſoeuer anie man or woman doeth, let them looke aboue all things, that in doing their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to glorifie God, as euer they would looke for thanks at His hands. This is a leſſon. I ſee here another thing. The Goſpell is aduanced, IESVS CHRIST is glorified in <hi>Paules</hi> hurt, and who is a dearer man to Chriſt, than <hi>`Paul?</hi> The leſſon then is this. Wee ſee the Lord is glorified, when thoſe whom He loueth beſt, is damnified in this world, in their hurt and domage Hee getteth His glorie: that thing which is done againſt them in malice, the Lord therein is glorified.</p>
            <p>Well then, I learne by the example of <hi>Paule,</hi> If ſo bee that my GOD is glorified in mine hurt, if He getteth aduantage by my damnage &amp; skathe: then vnderſtanding that glorie redoundeth vnto Him by my ſuffering, and it were by my death, I am bound to rejoyce <hi>I rejoyce,</hi> (ſaieth the Apoſtle) <hi>and ſhall rejoyce:</hi> I am bound to rejoyce, and thou art bound to rejoyce ſtill in glorifying God to the ende. So aboue all thinges, the glory of Chriſt ſhold be ſought. What am I to be reſpected, &amp; my ſhame, hurt &amp; death? what art thou to be reſpected
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16627:96"/>
thy ſhame, hurt and death? if it redound to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of Him who made me and thee for His glorie?</p>
            <p>Now, when he hath ſhewed his joye and mind concerning theſe two ſortes of men, in the next verſe he commeth to the cauſe of his joye in that the LORD was glorified in his hurt and domage. <hi>For</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>I knowe that this ſhall turne to my ſaluation,</hi> &amp;c. That thing that is done to mine hurt, it ſhall bee ſo chaunged and turned about, that, againſt the expectation of men who woulde hurt mee, the LORD ſhall worke out my ſaluation. There is the leſſon. If I can rejoyce, &amp; thou canſt rejoyce, that the LORD getteth glory by thine or mine hurt or skathe, wee may bee aſſured, that our trouble ſhall be wonderfullie altered &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: that which was done to our hurt, ſhall turne to our ſaluation. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, (in the 8. chapter of the epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> verſe 28.) <hi>To them who loueth God, all things commeth for the best:</hi> For if the glorie of GOD bee deare to thee, if thou preferre His glory aboue thy ſaluation, be aſſured thy life and ſaluation ſhall bee deare vnto Him: yea, thy ſaluation ſhall bee dearer vnto Him, than His glorie can bee vnto thee: for thou canſt not loue Him ſo well as He loueth thee. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32.) vttereth a wonderfull zeale to GODS glorie, and ſaieth, Ere Thou deſtroye this people, raze mee out of the booke of Life: that is, altogether deſtroye mee. But what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere gets hee? No <hi>Moſes,</hi> I had rather raze them
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16627:97"/>
out of my booke who haue ſinned againſt mee. <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth that he may be an <hi>Anathema, Rom.</hi> 9. 3. and that for the zeale hee had to the glorie of God. But Moſe, ſhall neuer bee ſcraped out of the booke of God, becauſe hee loueth Gods glorie: <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall neuer bee accurſed, becauſe hee loueth Gods glorie. And if thou wilt looke to His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, all that euill which thou canſt wiſh to thee for His glory, ſhall be turned to thine health and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Then yee ſee there is nothing that we can loſe by ſeeking of Gods glorie. Our damnage ſhal be euer turned to our aduantage.</p>
            <p>In the next part of the verſe, and the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, is ſet downe the maner, and the ordinarie manes whereby the hurt and domage that the godlie ſuffer for the glorie of God, is turned ouer to their good: The Lord onelie is able to turne it to their good. Who is able to turne darkneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light? death into life? ignominie into honour, but Hee? It paſſeth the cunning of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to make this wonderfull change: The Lord onlie is able to make this change. And certainlie, the ſhame, trouble, and affliction, that the godlie ſuffer in this life, woulde all bee the beginning of Hell, except that moſte skilfull crafts-man, the Lord, come in, and made this wonderfull altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and turned all theſe thinges to their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, except Hee turned death to life, ignominie to honour, and trouble to joye, the eſtate of the godlie in their ſufferinges were moſte miſerable.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16627:97"/>
Thinke not that theſe thinges are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: No, death is not good of it ſelfe, it is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. The Lord onlie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the change, and maketh death to bee the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to life: but the Lord doeth all this by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes and middle: and yet all the meanes which Hee vſeth, derogateth nothing to His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe they all come of Him, and Hee hath the glorie of all. Seeing then, in making of this wonderfull cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of darkneſſe into light, of death into life, of woe into joye &amp;c. there muſt bee ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes: woe be to thee that contemneſt the meanes, for if thou doe it, the trouble ſhall lie ſtill on thee till thou bee troubled in Hell: Sickneſſe ſhall bee ſickneſſe indeede to thee, death ſhall bee death indeede, and the beginning of Hell to thee.</p>
            <p>Then let vs take vp the meanes, as they lie here in order. Yee haue heard of one alreadie, to wit, Rejoycing that God is glorified in trouble. If (as I haue ſaide) thou canſt haue that heart and care of His glorie, that thou canſt rejoyce in thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thy trouble glorifieth Him, bee aſſured a wonderfull alteration ſhall bee made of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Trouble ſhall be no trouble, affliction ſhall be no affliction, death ſhall bee no death: Onelie get thou this deſire of His glorie.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the next meane: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am aſſured, that this thing ſhall turne to my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, through your prayers.</hi> As the care to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God is a meane to make this alteration; and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16627:98"/>
to turne our troubles to our ſaluation: ſo the care and ſolicity of the body of the Church, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and prayer that the godlie maketh for vs, who lye in trouble, is another meane: for the prayers of the godlie for anie member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Church hath a wonderfull effect. They will turne miſerie into joye, darkneſſe into light, yea death into life. Yet howbeit others haue care of thee, lying in diſtreſſe, if thou thy ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſt and deſpiſeſt their care, if thou regardeſt not whether they pray for thee or not, &amp; no body make interceſſion at GODS handes for thee, there ſhall bee nothing but trouble to thee: trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall alwayes continue trouble: affliction ſhall alwayes remaine affliction. And as thou contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and deſpiſeſt the prayers of the Sainctes and the godlie for thee, ſo thou ſhalt lye ſtill in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and drowne in miſerie at laſt. It is a follie to a man to thinke, that his owne care onelie for himſelfe will ſerue the turne, contemning and deſpiſing the care of all others for him: I cannot thinke that ſuch a one hath one ſpunke of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him, who will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne the care of others: For it is certaine, the ſufficiencie of grace is not giuen to one man, or to one woman onelie, but to the whole members of the bodie. And therefore, there muſt bee a concurrance of the whole, all muſt concurre for thy good and ſaluation: for if the hand will ſtand vp and ſaye to the eye, to the mouth, to the foote, or to the reſt of the members,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16627:98"/>
Care for your ſelues: foote, care for thy ſelfe: wombe, care for thy ſelfe, &amp;c. I will care for my ſelfe: were not this a fooliſh hand? woulde not this hand periſh and wither? yea, it woulde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh if the mouth fedde it not, if the foote caried it not, if the wombe receiued not ſuſtenance to nouriſh it: Euen ſo if thou ſayeſt to the reſt of the members of the Church, Care for your ſelues, I will care for my ſelfe, thou ſhalt die like a drie member, and be cut off: no ſaluation but in the vnion of that bleſſed bodie of CHRIST, which is the Church. And none yet euer came to Heauen, but by a certaine concurrance of the reſt of the members of the Bodie, by praying by preaching, by admoniſhing exhorting, and rebuking If thou refuſe this concurrance in teaching, admoniſhing, and comforting thee, thou ſhalt neuer get Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the 8. chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> verſ. 28.) ſaith, <hi>Wee knowe that all thinges worke together for the best, to them that loue GOD.</hi> Marke the force of the wordes.

anie of the members of the body, of the Church, or of the Miniſterie, in preaching, praying exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and comforting, that in the meane time thou haue no care of thy ſelfe, to get the ſpirite and life within thee, for Chriſts Spirit is thy life: thou wilt not praye for thy ſelfe, but wilt bid the Church &amp; Miniſtery pray for thee, as if that were enough. No, except that Spirite bee within thee, (which is the Spirit of Adoption) to make interceſſion with ſighes vnſpeakeable at the hands of God: downe ſhalt thou goe, albeit that the Church and whole members thereof would pleaſe to holde thee vp. What if the hand had no motion, life, nor ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in it ſelfe, would the foote and the eye bee able to holde it vp? No, if the foote and the eye ſtriue to holde it vp, they ſhould rotte with the hand, and behoued to bee cut of: For whereto ſerueth a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten member? It will infect the whole bodie, if it be not cut off. So if thou bee without ſpirite and life within thy ſelfe, how beit all the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body of the Church would holde their hands about thee to holde thee vp, thou ſhalt fall downe and die. So as ye would haue others caring for you, care for your ſelfe, and ſee that yee haue the Spirit of God caring for you. If <hi>Moſes, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and all other faithfull men woulde praye for you, it is nothing. What good did <hi>Samuels</hi> prayers for <hi>Saul?</hi> The Lord ſtopped his mouth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to praye for him. Thus yee haue heard of three meanes whereby this wonderfull change is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16627:99"/>
made: The firſt is the care of God and His glorie: The ſecond is the interceſſion of the reſt of the members of the body: the third is the Spirite of Chriſt interceading for vs, and the care which we haue of our ſelues. We haue need of theſe meanes. And certainlie the day is approaching, that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will tell the trueth of theſe thinges. <hi>Paul,</hi> a man euer afflicted, in trouble and vnder danger, telleth of his owne experience what hee founde. But are there yet anie more meanes? Looke the verſe that followeth, <hi>As I</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>heartilie looke for, and hope,</hi> &amp;c. The worde importeth ſuch an hope, as when a man hath his head raiſed vp, his eyes open and bent, awayting for anie thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely. Wee ſee when a man looketh earneſtlie for any other, his head will bee lifted vp, his eyes will be bent, looking to that place where from he ſhould come: and if he loue him well, he wil looke attentiuely, hauing both heart and eyes bended vp, with hope of his comming. The like worde in the 8. chap. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> verſ. 19. is aſcribed to the creatures: They awaite with feruent deſire, when the ſonne of God ſhall be reuealed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make the words more plaine: <hi>I hope,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine attentiue exſpectation, <hi>that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I ſhall bee aſhamed:</hi> that is, that I ſhall neuer thinke ſhame of my Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt: becauſe, that if I thinke ſhame for any thing which I ſuffer for His cauſe, I thinke ſhame of Himſelfe. Hee ſaith, <hi>that in nothing I ſhall bee aſhamed:</hi> There is the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16627:100"/>
negatiue: I will be aſhamed of nothing. But what more? <hi>With all boldneſſe of ſpirite I ſhall magnifie Him in my bodie,</hi> not in my ſoule onelie, but in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alſo: and that, <hi>Whether it bee in my life, or in my death.</hi> Hee caſteth in the argument of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>as in all times by-gone, euer to this houre, I haue magnified Him in my bodie.</hi> So this by-gone expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (would he ſay) maketh me to be aſſured by hope, neuer to be aſhamed of Him, but to glorifie Him in life and death. Then take vp the leſſon. Amongeſt the reſt of the mean s whereby this change is made, of miſerie to felicitie, of death to life, and all thinges are made to ſerue to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Hope is one, and it is the fourth in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Wherein ſtandeth this Hope? That in no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which I ſuffer for Chriſtes ſake I will bee aſhamed, and ſo ſhame the Lord. (For in ſuffering if thou bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſheſt, and thinkeſt ſhame, thou ſhameſt Him) But by the contrarie, in all thinges that I ſhall doe or ſuffer in this bodie, I ſhall doe with courage, confidence, and libertie: I ſhall ſuffer with courage, confidence, and libertie. And ſo, in doing, in ſuffering in the bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall magnifie my LORD. So this is the point: If I glorifie Him before men with courage and boldneſſe in mine afflictions, I may bee aſſured, Hee ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me before His Father in Heauen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32. They that ſuffer with Him, ſhall reigne with Him, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. 12. But by the contrary, if thou with bluſhing think ſhame of Him and of His Goſpel,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16627:100"/>
and of the afflictions of the Goſpel, if thou ſhame Him before the world, He ſhall ſhame thee before His Father, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 38. So this Hope is no ſmall matter, for if thou haue an aſſured Hope during thy whole life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt magnifie Chriſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer falleth out in life or death, aſſure thy ſelfe all ſhall bee turned to the glory of God, and thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. All the troubles that ſhall bee laide vpon thee in this worlde, ſhall bee ſo turned ouer, that they ſhall ſerue to thy good and conſolation. But if this hope be away, if thou lie ſluggiſhly, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thine head raiſed vp, with cloſed eyes, not looking and hoping that thou ſhalt glorifie thy Lord, not caring for His glorie, either in thy life, or in thy death, all thy miſerie that lighteth vpon thee, ſhall remaine miſerie, and ſhall preſſe thee down to euerlaſting damnation. Looke then how precious this hope is? Learne another thing here. There ſtandeth much in theſe two, in shame and blushing, in confidence, libertie, and courage: I ſay to thee, there ſtandeth more in the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſuffering and doing, than ſtandeth in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and doing it ſelfe. I ſuppoſe thou ſuffer the death for Chriſtes ſake, if thou bee ashamed in ſuffering, and haſt not libertie and courage, thou ſuffereſt not ſo much for CHRIST, as for thy ſelfe: and thy death is nothing elſe, but a death to thee, and thy ſuffering is nothing, but a ſuffering to thy ſelfe. Euen ſo, do what thou wilt doe to glorifie Him, if it be not done with libertie,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16627:101"/>
freedome, and courage, thou loſeſt thy trauell. Seeing then, that ſo much ſtandeth in the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, let euery man looke that hee prepare himſelfe with courage and confidence againſt the daye of triall, that with confidence in ſuffering he may magnifie God: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> in his 2. epiſt. chap. 1. verſ. 8. <hi>Bee not aſhamed of Chriſt, nor of me, that am His captiue.</hi> Thinke ſhame of none that ſuffer for Chriſt, but rather bee thou partaker of that affliction, to ſuffer with courage and confidence thoſe things with them.</p>
            <p>Yet marke another thing here: he ſaith, <hi>that he might magnifie Chriſt in his bodie:</hi> Hee ſpeaketh not of the ſoule. And ſo I obſeru; that of the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. (let bee of the ſoule) euen of the very bodily maſſe which thou beareſt about with thee, a great duety is required for the glorifying of God and His Chriſt. When thou art liuing in thine actions, when thou art dying in thy death, it muſt be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument glorifying God, when thou art going vpon thy feete, it muſt bee an inſtrument of His glorie: when thou art lying in thy bedde, yea, the Lord muſt bee glorified in it, when it is diſſolued into aſhes in the graue. I marke this againſt that vaine conceite of men, who will ſaye, What care I, ſo I keepe a good minde to God, let mee proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute my body to harlotrie, gluttony, and all vices, yet I will keepe my ſoule to God. No, either God will haue all, or the Deuill will haue all. Awaye thou idolater, who wilt keepe thy ſoule to GOD,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16627:101"/>
and wilt bowe thy knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> the Deuill will get both ſoule and bodie. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth not, that the Lord hath only bought thy ſoule with a price, but that Hee hath bought both ſoule and body, that they ſhould glorifie God, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 6. 20, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee are bought with a price, yee are not your owne.</hi> Fye, filthie bodie, that wilt ſay, May I not doe with my bodie as I pleaſe? Haſt thou power to reaue it out of the handes of the Lord? The Lord hath the power of thy body, and in that laſt day thou ſhalt bee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged with theft and ſacriledge. And when hee hath ſaid, <hi>ye are bought with a price,</hi> hee ſubjoyneth, Glorifie God not in your ſpirite onely, but alſo in your bodies: Either Hee will haue both, or elſe none: Thinkeſt thou to ſend thy ſoule to God, and thy body to the Deuill? No, either the Lord ſhall get both, or both ſhall goe to Hell. Take heed how ye keepe theſe bodies, ye ſhall render accompt of them: Thy body ſhould be the Temple of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Spirit, if thou defile the ſeate of that holy One, ſhame ſhall light vpon thee. I marke heere: To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe of continuance, that hee ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in glorifying God in life and death, he taketh an argument from his former experience, Euer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I haue glorified God in my body, &amp; I haue a ſtedfaſt hope, that I ſhall continue &amp; that all the actions of my body ſhall glorifie Him: and when I am dead, He ſhall be glorified in my body.</p>
            <p>It is good then, to begin well, and to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that thou haſt ſerued GOD well in thy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16627:102"/>
calling: for experience bringeth hope, and hope maketh thee no wayes ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4. 5. And if thou haue experience that thou haſt ſerued GOD, and Hee hath beene with thee, and kept thy bodie in puritie, thou mayeſt bee aſſured to continue to the ende: Not that our continuance ſtandeth in our ſelf, (no our continuance ſtandeth not in our ſelues, for the beſt man that liueth is not able of himſelfe to ſtand one moment) but out ſtanding is in God, for if Hee would take His grace from vs, in one moment, we would fall. It is the loue that He beareth to vs that holds vs vp: be once aſſured of that loue of GOD towardes thee, and then thou mayeſt bee aſſured, that thou shalt glorifie God both in life and death.</p>
            <p>Now in the next verſe he ſaith. <hi>For Christ is to me both in life and death aduantage:</hi> Hee giueth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherefore hee ſaide hee would magnifie God in his bodie, both in life and death: The reaſon is, becauſe of the aduantage hee hath of Him, CHRIST IESVS is aduantage to him. And when? Not when I liue onelie, (ſaieth hee) but in my death alſo. Is it not good reaſon that I should glorifie Him both in life and death, in whome I haue aduantage both in life and death? All men doe for aduantage. When a man hath done and ſuffered, hee woulde haue aduantage. When wee honour the Prince, or anie man, all is for aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. If gaine mooueth to honour men, to ſerue them, where was there euer ſuch a gaine and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16627:102"/>
as may bee looked for at the handes of CHRIST? If gaine will mooue thee, where wilt thou get it, if not in CHRIST? Would thou haue gaine &amp; aduantage for thy doing in thy lifetime? He will giue thee it. Thou shalt not do one deed, but thou shalt haue thine hire in thine hande. Wouldeſt thou haue gain in thy death? if thou die for Him, thou shal get as fair an adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage as euer man got. Indeede, a man will giue thee gaine for honouring him in thy life-time, but when thou art lying in thy deathbedde, canſt thou get aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage out of the hand of a man? Suppoſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch would giue thee a kingdome, what aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is it to thee, if thou liueſt not to brooke it? But I tell you plainelie, The LORD is greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to vs in death, than in life: and all this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage which wee haue of Him in this life, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of that aduantage which we shall get in the life to come. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the third chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi>) when hee hath counted al his aduantages, and numbered out all the prerogatiues which hee had in this worlde, That hee was a <hi>Iew,</hi> a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> his father a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Ben-jamin,</hi> none ſo zealous of the Lawe as hee, &amp;c. manie aduantages and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues: but after that hee once commeth to CHRIST, and getteth Him, hee ſayeth, All is but dung, in reſpect of that excellent knowledge, of that aduantage of IESVS CHRIST. As I counted much (would he ſay) of theſe earthlie aduantages
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16627:103"/>
before I knew Chriſt, euen ſo, after that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> once had gotten a ſight of Him, I counted them nothing but dirt and dung. And therefore, hee telleth out the aduantages and gaines that hee founde in Chriſt. That (ſaith he) I may be found in Him: that is, not hauing mine owne righteouſneſſe, which is of the Lawe, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, euen the righteouſneſſe which is of God through faith. There is the firſt aduantage, Thou art juſtified before the Tribunall of GOD. What king can giue thee that aduantage, to ſet thee vp as a free-man before the Tribunall of God? And albeit thou hadſt gotten all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages that kings can giue thee, if thou getteſt not this aduantage to ſtand before that Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, cloathed with Chriſt, thou ſhalt goe to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Then hee addeth to another aduantage, That I may knowe Him, and the vertue of His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of His afflictions, and bee made conformable vnto His death, if by any meanes I might attaine to the reſurrection of the dead. There is the ſecond aduantage: thou art made like vnto Him in holineſſe, and both in ſuffering and in glory, thou art comformed vnto Him. Well is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that can get this aduantage, to be glorified. What are all adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tages to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of that can come to thee in this life, in reſpect of this aduantage? that when thou art lying (a vilde bodie) in the graue, Chriſt ſhall take thee vp, and ſet thee in that glory which is prepared for the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16627:103"/>
ſonnes of GOD. Alas! if men coulde ſee the aduantages which are in CHRIST: For all faileth for fault of ſight: If men got but one blink of CHRIST, they woulde not giue that ſight for all the kingdomes in the earth: Wee want ſpirituall eyes and ſenſes. Theſe ſpirituall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in CHRIST, are ſeene onelie with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye: and for fault of that ſpirituall ſight, wee ſee not the aduantages which are in Him. There is nothing which wee ſhoulde more deſire, than theſe ſpirituall ſenſes, wherewith wee maye get a ſight and fore-taſte of theſe thinges which are in IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Nowe, in the next verſe, taking occaſion of the wordes, that CHRIST was aduantage to him both in life and death, hee beginneth to doubt, whether it were better for him to liue or die <hi>And whether</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>to liue in the fleſh were profitable for mee, or what to chooſe, I knowe not:</hi> I thinke I woulde bee dead, to ſee mine aduantage which I will get in death: for my gaine, which I get li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, is nothing to that aduantage which I will get in death: But I am ſtraited, whether to liue in the fleſh, or to goe out of the bodie. Then he bringeth in the reaſon, <hi>It is better for mee to bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to bee with CHRIST:</hi> I will bee at Him, (yet hee ſaieth, I am in doubt, and not reſolued.) <hi>Neuertheleſſe, to remaine in the fleſh, is more needefull for you:</hi> For albeit it bee better for me to be dead, yet when I looke to you, it is worſe for you. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16627:104"/>
this doubting and reaſoning, hee concludeth, <hi>I will liue then, and the LORD will keepe mee for your weale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, I will marke heere one or two thinges, and ſo I ſhall ende. Yee ſee a doubting in PAVL, whether hee ſhoulde liue or die, which diſtracteth his minde. This doubting is common to manie: For ſometimes wee woulde liue, and other whiles wee woulde bee dead. But looke to the cauſe that diſtracted PAVLES minde, and made him to doubt, whether hee ſhoulde deſire to liue or die. Some men woulde die, becauſe there is nothing in this worlde but miſerie: Some men woulde die for other cauſes, becauſe of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome becauſe of ſhame following ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, for the life is tedious to a miſerable bodie, the life which ſhoulde bee comfortable, is tedious in diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>But howe manie commeth to this point, To deſire to bee diſſolued for the glorie that is with IESVS, and ſaieth. If I were away, I woulde get this aduantage of glorie? Who woulde be awaye for the glorie of Heauen, and aduantage that is laide vp there? It is a rare grace to get this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. No queſtion (thinke as yee will) infinite joy, glorie, and paſſing aduantage is in Heauen.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſome men woulde liue, wherefore? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are freſh, greene, and able men: they would paſſe their time yet: Some men would liue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they haue wife and children, and woulde
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16627:104"/>
care for them, (I condemne not lawfull care) but all this deſire is vaine. Where wilt thou get that man, that would liue to help the poore Church of CHRIST with his labour? How manie will come on with this, to liue onelie for the weale of the Church of CHRIST? I deſire ſuch a Paſtor who is minded to liue for the care y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath to leade ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie by the hand to Heauen, ere he goe away, that he may winne manie ſoules to CHRIST, that hee may bee the welcomer when hee commeth there himſelfe: He is happie. It is the ſight of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie glorie, that maketh men to haue this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide deſire. Howe manie ſeeth that Heauenlie glorie? Fie on vs, ſeeing ſuch a glorie laide vp in Heauen for vs, that yet will not make a meane to get it: wee periſh for fault of ſenſe: There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o lacke of aduantage in CHRIST, but the lacke is in me, &amp; in thee, I haue no deſire of that glorie, thou haſt no deſire of that glorie, and ſo wee periſhe. Therefore, get this ſenſe of glorie in time, or elſe thy ſoule ſhall bee drawne out of thy bodie. Doe accordinglie. Wouldeſt thou haue it ſweetlie loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Then get in time a ſenſe of this glorie. Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou haue it pulled out by force? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neglect the ſenſe and ſight of this glorie.</p>
            <p>Obſerue another thing of the care of <hi>Paul.</hi> He counted nothing of all theſe afflictions, in reſpect of the care which he had of the Church of God. I wonder at this care of his, conſidering now our careleſneſſe: For if euer care was dead out of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16627:105"/>
hearts of men, it is now dead. Farewell the care of the Church of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for fault of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> zeale of Gods glory, &amp; the care of the Church of God. I ſee this Land, and the Church of GOD therein, decaying. Learne another thing of PAVLES reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet he reſolueth to liue &amp; that for the weale of the Church of Chriſt. Marke it. There is none of vs, but wee ſhould deſire to haue the fruition of the glory and joye that is in the face of Ieſus: yet we, who may profite in the Church of God in this life, are bounde to deſire to liue for a while, that the Church may be holpen. The Lord accounteth more highly of this deſire, than of a deſire that a man hath to die, and to bee with Ieſus. The Lord accounted more of PAVLES liuing, to helpe the Church, than of his glorifying Him in his death. Thinke yee that PAVL woulde haue liued ſo long, except the Lord had ſeene him profitable to His Church? And no queſtion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Ieſus (knowing the miſery of this earth) would haue taken vp His Apoſtles at His aſcention with Him, if He had not loued the weale of His Church. There is no good body, but the Lord woulde haue them with Him: yet Hee letteth them remaine heere in paine, that they may help the Church, otherwiſe there would not be a good body left liuing in SCOTLAND, Hee would take them all away, and glorifie them. But ſo long as Hee hath a Church in SCOTLAND, Hee will let good men continue, but when Hee taketh them away, wo be to them that tary behind! It is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16627:105"/>
wonderfull to ſee how the Lord will keepe a man by whoſe trauels Hee will helpe His Church. All the worlde will not get leaue to hurt an haire of his head. HEROD taketh PETER, and putteth him into priſon, laying him betwixt two ſouldiers, thinking to execute him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next morning, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. But the Lord by His Angell wakeneth him, and bringeth him ſafe out, and yet hee wiſt not what hee was doing. PAVL and PETER were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliuered, ſo long as the Lord had to doe with them: but when He had done His turne, and they fell into the hands of NERO, there is no more dinne of them, they were ſlaine. So long as the Lord hath adoe with any man He will ſhake Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth ere hee periſh. Well, the care of the Church of God is decaying in SCOTLAND.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we ſhall conſider this Text (wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued in IESVS CHRIST) we ſhall find in it three things. The firſt, the miſerable eſtate and condition of man, wherein hee ſtood before hee was called to grace by IESVS CHRIST. The next is his mercifull deliuerie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that miſerable eſtate and condition. The laſt is the ende of his mercifull
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16627:106"/>
deliuerie: to wit, That he ſhould ſerue God all the dayes of his life, in all maner of thankfulneſſe for ſo mercifull a deliuerie. And ſeeing our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with the bodie and blood of the LORD approaches, our preparation ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand in three better thinges than theſe: Firſt, in a knowledge of our miſerie before that we knew God in CHRIST: Next in a knowledge of our mercifull deliuerie from that miſerable eſtate: And thirdlie, in a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie toward God for our deliuerie. We ſhall ſpeake at this time of the firſt two.</p>
            <p>Now, to returne, and to goe thorow the words as the Lord will giue vs grace: The occaſion of the ſetting downe of this firſt part, to wit, of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie before we knew Chriſt, is this: Immediatelie before he hath exhorted TITVS to vſe all kinds of lenitie towardes them that were not conuerted, not to deale with them in rigour, but to deale with them in meekneſſe. Hee giueth the reaſon: Looke what they are now, euen ſuch were we before wee were called, liuing in concupiſcence, our mindes were rebellious againſt God: therefore let vs deale with them as wee woulde haue beene dealt with our ſelues at that time. I marke here firſt, That our miſerable eſtate that we ſtood in, before we were called to this grace through Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde neuer be forgotten. The miſerie of nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are conceiued and borne, and wherein wee liue for a time, till wee knowe Chriſt, ſhould neuer goe out of our remembrance: When thou haſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16627:107"/>
plaide the foole a while in ſinne, when thou haſt followed harlotry, committed murther, oppreſſed thy neighbour, &amp; when God hath called thee out of that miſerable condition, &amp; made thee to know Him in Chriſt, forget neuer thy former miſery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get neuer that thou haſt followed filthineſſe, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, oppreſſed, &amp;c. Saieth the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who were <hi>Gentiles</hi> after their conuerſion in Chriſt, Forget your olde done deedes? ſaith he ſo? No: but he ſaith, <hi>Remember that ye were Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, it is true, the eſtate of grace in Chriſt hath a ſweetneſſe with it, if a man or woman haue a ſenſe of it, but looke that the ſweetneſſe of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> m iſ-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eliſh not ſo the taſte, that in the meane time thou loſe all ſenſe of thy former miſery. Keepe therefore both the miſery and the deliuery in thy mind, that thereby the true ſenſe of GODS mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie may be ſtirred vp in thine heart: for none haue the true ſenſe of the mercie of God in Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee onelie that ſigheth for the miſerie which we did lie in before. This is the firſt. Another thing I marke here. This ſame remembrance of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, it ſhould make euery one of vs that ſtand in grace, to haue a compaſſion vpon ſinners: where euer thou ſeeſt them, labour to winne them, but with pitie, and let bee thy bitterneſſe: A man that hath no pitie, but is full of bitterneſſe againſt a ſinner, that man hath forgotten that hee was a ſinner before. There is no man ſo cleane, but there is a remaining corruption in him, albeit hee
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16627:107"/>
ſee it not. They that haue the true zeale of God, they will indeede bee ſeuere againſt ſinners: Why not? but they beginne alwayes at their ſelues, and then reprooue others. Hypocrites beginne not at themſelues, but they hide and cloake their owne ſinnes, and are alwayes ſeuere againſt others. But the man that beginneth at himſelfe, his ſeueritie is aye mixed with pitie.</p>
            <p>But to come to the words, <hi>Wee were ſuch as they are now:</hi> we were mad, and out of our right wit, we were beſide our ſelues. There is the firſt part of our miſerie in nature, for wee were all miſerable by nature: there is not one ſoule, but it is borne miſerable by nature. Yee ſee then, Brethren, our miſerie beginneth not at our body: (there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie who if they haue their body well diſpoſed, are at eaſe then, but if it be not well diſpoſed, they are heauily diſpleaſed, then they grone and ſigh) no, our miſery beginneth not at our body, it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth within vs, at our ſoules, and not at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferior parts of the ſoule, but at the minde, which is the moſt excellent part &amp; light of our ſoules, and that ſhould guide all the reſt of the powers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule. Nowe the ſickneſſe of it is madneſſe, it is blinde, ignorant, without judgement, and wee are madde fooles by nature. There is no man born in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, but he is borne a foole: thou art borne a mad bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and beſides thy ſelfe. Thou wilt thinke thy ſelf very wiſe, &amp; thy wit will compaſſe Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, yea, &amp; others that look to thee wil think thee wiſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16627:108"/>
but if thou haue no more than nature, thou art a foole. As he is a fool in very deed, who thinketh he ſpeaketh alwayes an oracle, euen ſo art thou, that art not in Chriſt, and counteſt thy ſelfe wiſe: the wiſer thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe, thou art the more and the more a foole. All this is to let men ſee, that none is wiſe without God: For when the light of GOD is not in thee, all that thou doeſt is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and hee that is wiſe without GOD, ſhall curſe his wiſedome one day, and ſaye, that all was but madneſſe: yea, and all the Monarches in the worlde ſhall curſe that wiſedome, which they had without God. This natural ſickneſſe goeth further downe, it deſcendeth to the heart, it tarieth not in the minde: But next wee become maine rebelles againſt God, hee that is madde, he is ſet to rebell, and he is froward, euer inclining to diſobedience againſt GOD.</p>
            <p>Brethren, yee knowe there are two ſortes of fooles amongſt men: Some fooles are ſillie ſimple fooles: other fooles are malicious fooles: by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are all borne fooles, but malicious fooles, euermore rebelling and diſpleaſing GOD. If wee compare th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe two ſortes of fooles together, the ſecond is worſt. LORD ſaue vs from a rebellious heart: For I tell thee, the minde is not ſo blinded, but it hath ſome ſight of GOD: but the heart of man, after the fall, is altogether inclined to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: ſo that if there bee one ſpunke of light left in nature, it will trauell by all meanes to put in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16627:108"/>
finger in the eye of the minde, and put it out. And therefore, trauell to reforme thine heart, for if it bee not reformed, it ſhall euermore carrie thee the wrong way. So there are two partes of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of man. Nowe commeth on the thirde. Thy miſerie endeth not heere. Marke, and trauell to finde this in experience. (Fie on vs, if wee knowe not our ſelues, for if wee know not our ſelues, wee ſhall neuer knowe God aright.) The thirde part ſtandeth in actions, for the madde and rebellious heart muſt breake out in ſome actions. Can a mad and rebellious bodie bee idle? Hee calleth ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> works wauering, going out of the way. Can a mad man keepe the hie waye? No, but euermore hee goeth to one ſide or other. No more can wee by nature goe forwarde in the right waye: for by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee are madde, frowarde, and diſobedient. It is true, naturall men will doe things that are right in themſelues: but no man ſhall do that which is good in it ſelf rightlie, that hath y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rebellion in his heart: for wee doe nothing rightly, but when our eyes are vpon God. Albeit the action were neuer ſo good, if thou ſeekeſt not GOD in it, it is not done rightlie. Thou mayeſt well doe it to pleaſe the eyes of men, and thou mayeſt get thankes at the handes of men for it, but thou ſhalt get none at Gods handes: ſo if thou wouldeſt bee accepted of GOD, and wouldeſt haue the action of thine handes to pleaſe God, firſt looke that thine action bee good, and then looke to God in thine action.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16627:109"/>
Then there are three parts of miſery of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: firſt, madneſſe in the mind: ſecondly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſſe in the heart: thirdly, his actions are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerings, all wandring out of the way.</p>
            <p>To goe forward. Hee deſcribeth this wauering, and he calleth it ſeruing: it ſtandeth in ſlauerie, his whole life-time is but a ſeruice and ſlauery. The naturall man, if hee haue no more but nature, hee is a ſlaue and a ſeruant, bought and ſolde, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, <hi>hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſolde to bee ſubject to ſinne, Roman.</hi> 7. 15. Suppoſe hee were a Monarch of the whole earth, if hee bee without the newe man, hee is a ſlaue. It is true, hee will haue manie ſeruantes vnder him, but hee is the firſt and chiefe ſlaue himſelfe: yea, hee is a greater ſeruant than the verie kitchen boye, and the moſte abject ſeruant in his houſe. But to whome is this ſeruice done? To whome are wee ſlaues? In plaine talke, hee ſaieth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences. Hee calleth them pleaſures, but fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on them, how beit they are ſweete things, yet they haue a ſoure ende. Harlotrie is ſweete for a time, but, O that bitterneſſe in the ende! It is ſweete to murther, but, O that bitterneſſe that it ſhall bring with it in the end! it ſhal be bitterer than the very gall. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention here of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>varietie and diuerſity of luſts. Thou that ſerueſt thine own luſts, art not ſubject to one maiſter only, but to an hundreth: thou art ſubject to many vncleane mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of diuers qualities.</p>
            <p>Brethren, are theſe our maiſters? Fy vpon them,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16627:109"/>
the ſeruice done to them, it is a vile ſeruice. Thou that art a lord, when thou lookeſt to thy kitchen boye, thou wilt thinke his ſeruice vile, but fye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, thou art a greater ſlaue, hee is an honeſt ſeruant, but thou art a ſlaue: for thy ſeruice is done to thy filthy pleaſures, there is a variety of them, and ſo thou haſt manie maiſters, whom thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt. And therefore, yee will ſee theſe men who ſerue their owne luſtes, to bee the wearieſt bodies y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euer liued, euen as if they were drawne thorow a myre: for the onely true and cleane ſeruice, is the ſeruice of that onely one GOD: the onely repoſe of thy ſoule, is on that one GOD: there is no reſt, but on Him. Awaye with that creature that drinketh in the ſoule luſtes of this earth, that is no reſt to him heere, and woe to that reſt that ſhall come in the ende. So there are the maiſters which wee ſerue, foule concupiſcences, and fleſhlie luſtes. It may bee asked, Will a perſon bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch a great varietie of concupiſcences? I anſwere, The ſeede of euerie ſinne in the worlde is in euerie man: ſo all concupiſcences are in thee, becauſe the ſeede of them is within thee: No, the beſt men in the earth hath the ſeede of theſe luſts, which budde out into actions: it will lurke for a time in the winter, but in the ſpring it will breke out, and then thou wilt knowe thou haſt it, when thou feeleſt the ſtinke of it. So there is the firſt anſwere, the ſeede of euery ſinne is in the heart of euery man, in ſuch ſort that it wil make thee loath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16627:110"/>
at it, if thou ſaweſt it: but alas! it is hidden from our eyes, that wee cannot ſee it, and therefore we loathe it not. Againe, in ſome men and women, that ſeede of all luſts will breake out in actions: A man that followeth harlotrie, will bee a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard alſo: an auaritious man, will bee ambitious alſo, &amp;c. It is a maruell to ſee howe manie ſinnes will be reigning in one miſerable ſlaue, and to ſee howe that ſlaue will bee hurried from one ſinne to another. Fie on thee, wilt thou neuer get thy fill of ſinne? thou ſhalt once bee filled with wrath, and then thou ſhalt loathe at thy ſinnes: For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there were no more but one ſinne in thee, it is enough to cauſe thee to goe to Hell.</p>
            <p>Nowe to goe forward: Hee numbers out ſome of theſe concupiſcences, and the firſt is malice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſſe in the heart againſt our neighbour. Then commeth in her two daughters, enuie and hatred. When thou art ſorie at thy neighbours weale, and wouldeſt not ſee him thriue, then thou wilt hate him. There are three particulars, and they are as manie pleaſures to them that ſerueth them: hee that hath malice, thinketh himſelfe neuer well, but when there is malice in his heart: from thence commeth enuie, and the enuious heart is neuer well, but when it ſpeaketh euill of his neighbour, for that is meate and drinke to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee that hath hatred, is neuer well, but when hee hateth his neighbour, and that is his meate and drinke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:16627:110"/>Nowe I ſhall drawe theſe concupiſcences into certaine rankes. There are ſome of them againſt God, ſome againſt our neighbour, &amp; ſome againſt our ſelues, amongſt the which is intemperancie. Fie on thee, O <hi>Epicurian!</hi> thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inneſt againſt thy ſelfe. Now the Apoſtle in ſetting downe theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences, maketh a choiſe of the concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt our neighbour, for if we bee malicious againſt him, wee are malicious againſt GOD. Whoſoeuer is enemie to man, hee is alſo enemie to God. Now there is no harmonie amongſt men that are onelie naturall: For without GOD in Chriſt, there is no true loue, no true concord. Put a man and a woman together without God, will there bee anie concord there? No, for the dueties of the firſt Table are requiſite for the diſcharging of the dueties of the ſecond Table, and muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them. Howe canſt thou loue thy wife or thy children, without God? No, there is no true loue, and the ende ſhall prooue it to haue beene but hatred onelie.</p>
            <p>In the ende of the verſe hee ſetteth downe two ſortes of hatreds, hee ſaieth <hi>hatefull,</hi> that is, hee that ſuffereth hatred: then hee ſubjoyneth, <hi>hating one another:</hi> wee are odious to others, and againe we hate others. Alwayes marke one meeting here. Thinkeſt thou to hate, and not to be hated again? It is but the juſt judgement of God, that as thou enuieſt and hateſt, thou alſo to bee hated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied. What harmonie can bee heere, when thou
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16627:111"/>
hateſt mee, and I thee? No true concord, but all is loſe. There is no conjunction, but that which is in CHRIST IESVS. When this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not amongſt men, awaye with all other conjunctions. This is ſhortly the miſerable eſtate wherein wee ſtood by nature, before the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of mercy in CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the other eſtate. An alteration muſt bee made, or elſe wee are gone: For what can become of a body that dieth in madneſſe? Nowe looke howe wee are deliuered: <hi>But</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the bountifulneſſe and loue of GOD our Sauiour appeared.</hi> There is the way how our mercifull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery commeth on. Yee reade not one word heere, that man lying in miſery, began to find out a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery himſelfe. Ye reade not that the mad man of himſelfe beginneth to take vp himſelfe: hee ſaieth not, Then we took vp our ſelues: No, no, we would haue lied long ere we had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp our ſelues. Then the naturall man waltering and wallowing in ſinne, and drinking in the foule pleaſures thereof, he will neuer take vp himſelfe and let him goe on, if hee ſhould liue ten thouſand yeeres, hee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee the better, but ſtill worſe and worſe. Can a man that is dead naturally, thinke of any life to himſelfe, to riſe vp, and ſtand againe? Not ſuch a thing, hee cannot ſo much as once thinke to riſe vp.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, we are all blacke dead ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, by nature there is not one ſpunke of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16627:111"/>
life in vs, no more than in a dead bodie, that is dead naturally, there is a ſpunk of naturall life: and we are not halfe dead only, but are whole dead. Can a naturall man once thinke of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life? No, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 31. When wee were dead in our ſinnes, wee were quickned by CHRIST,</hi> meaning that wee had no power in our ſelues to riſe againe. If it bee ſo then, when I ſee a wicked man (that hath beene ſeruing his foule luſts all his life-time) take vp himſelfe, I will not ſaye, that that man tooke vp himſelfe, I will ſay, there is a dead man riſen to life: I will aske of thee, In the beginning of the creation, thoughteſt thou of thy creation? deſiredſt thou to thinke of it? No, no more thoughteſt thou of thy regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thou thoughteſt as little of thy ſecond crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thou thoughteſt of thy firſt creation. And therefore it is well ſaide, Hee created thee without thee: And as Hee created thee without thee, ſo He redeemed thee without thee. Dareſt thou ſaye, that thou gaueſt counſell to thy redemption, and thoughteſt of it when GOD redeemed thee? then how commeth this worke on? We are preuented, ſomething appeareth that was hid: there was one thing long hidden, &amp; nowe it beginneth to ſhine. And what was this bountifulneſſe &amp; loue to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde? it was hid, and breaketh out. And who is it that is bountifull? is this any mans bountifulnes? No, it is the bountifulneſſe of GOD: and this quickning loue is GODS, and that towards man.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16627:112"/>
And what God is this? Hee calleth Him <hi>GOD our Sauiour:</hi> For God is conſidered two wayes, as a Creator, and as a Sauiour. It is the loue of Him as a Sauiour, that is ſhewed to thee in thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And when was this loue reueiled? when IESVS CHRIST came into the world, and tooke vpon Him our nature, then this loue brake out toward man: Hee loued him from all Eternitie, but it brake not out till then. Marke then. It is the loue of GOD that ſaueth, it is GODS bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe that ſaueth: our deliuerie behooued to proceede of a wonderfull bountifulneſſe in God, whereof the ground is loue. If Hee had not loued thee, Hee would not haue deliuered thee. Then it is not a common loue which He beareth towards vs, but there is a ſpeciall loue in GOD to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: He loueth not theſe Heauens, theſe Starres, ſo well as Hee doeth men. No, Hee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the thouſand part of thoſe thinges that Hee communicateth to man, either to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, or to the Starres. Then it is not the loue of GOD the Creator that doeth this, and is the ground of this bountifulneſſe, and of our life in Him: but it is a ſpeciall kinde of loue. It is that loue that proceedeth of GOD the Sauiour. It is not the loue of a Creator, but of a Father, not to the creature, but to the ſonne. GOD loueth His ſonne better than Hee doeth His creature, He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs as His ſonnes. If there were no further loue of GOD, but as Hee is a Creator, thou durſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16627:112"/>
neuer crie, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father: and except the Spirit ſpreade abroade into our heartes that loue which Hee beareth vnto vs, for all the world thou durſt not appeare before Him. The time is ſet downe when Hee hath ſaued vs, when His ſingular loue appeared in the world, Hee ſaued vs beeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſhe. Then it followeth that wee were loſt, and gone, when GOD of His loue put to His hand, and ſaued vs, wee were out of our right wit, rebelles to GOD, wauering, and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunding out of the right waye, ſlaues to our owne luſtes. Whome count yee loſt, if theſe be not loſt? I will neuer count of a reprobate perſon, who is giuen ouer to filthineſſe, to harlotrie, to murther, to oppreſſion, to miſchiefe, &amp;c. I will neuer count of him but as a madde, deſperate, and loſt bodie: when hee is walking abroade, and moouing in the world, hee is but a dead carcaſſe: and if hee come to GOD againe in mercie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may bee ſaide. There is a dead bodie, turned to life. Haſt thou followed harlotrie? repenteſt thou? thou haſt bene dead in ſinne, but now thou art aliue. The loſt ſonne, when hee had ſpended his childes-part of goods yet he repented, and came home to his father againe: his father ſaieth, <hi>Hee that was dead, is liuing againe, Luke</hi> 15. 24. So in a worde, wee were loſt men. Thinkeſt thou that thou art not loſt, becauſe thou canſt breathe? And thinkeſt thou a man not dead, if hee can walke vpon the ſtreete? Thinkeſt thou thy ſelfe verie well, if thou haue theſe vitall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16627:113"/>
in thee? O, but ſuppoſe thou hadſt all the naturall liues in the world, if thou bee giuen ouer to thine owne affections and leaueſt not off thine olde ſinnes and iniquities, thou art a madde and a dead bodie. Began then that loue towardes man only to appeare when Chriſt came into the world? I anſwere: The loue of God the Father appeared &amp; manifeſted it ſelfe in ſome meaſure to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, euen before Chriſt came into the world: God forbid but this loue had bene appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the reſt of the godly, before the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Sauiour. But at the comming of Chriſt it manifeſted it ſelfe more brightly, than euer it did before: for al His loue of before was in Chriſt to come: but now, ſince He came into the world, the loue of God towards mankind hath appeared in greater aboundance. The Lord grant vs an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and ſight of this loue, that at the leaſt wee maye ſtriue to loue Him againe, who hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs ſo dearly in His Sonne IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Nowe, hee ſheweth by what meanes this our ſaluation is procured at the handes of GOD: hee telleth you by what meanes we are not ſaued, <hi>Net</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the workes of righteouſneſſe which wee had done.</hi> The meanes by the which we are not ſaued, is our owne juſt works: thou art not ſaued by thy juſt works, leane to them as thou wilt, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>in the name of that Great God,</hi> they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaue thee. Can a man that is mad and a rebell to GOD, and a ſlaue to his owne luſtes, doe ſuch
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16627:113"/>
works as may procure ſaluation? <hi>But ſuch were we,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: therefore wee can deſerue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by our workes. Fie on thee, Papiſt, with thy merites! fie on the works of preparation! can a madde man prepare himſelfe for grace? No ſuch thing. I tell you when GOD put to His hand to our ſaluation, Hee founde no matter in vs of our ſaluation, but damnation. When GOD begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to loue, Hee findeth no matter of loue in vs, but of hatred. And this commendeth the greatnes of His loue towards vs, when He ſeeth nothing in vs but matter of damnation, yet Hee of His free grace &amp; mercy loueth vs &amp; ſaueth vs, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 5. 8. This ſetteth out His loue highly towards vs, when that we were ſinners He ſent Chriſt to die for vs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeek not thy ſaluation neither before thou be in Chriſt, nor after thou art in Him by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> merite of works, for thou ſhalt neuer get it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way, but thou ſhalt ſtill be the further from it the more thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt it by that meane. Then if good works be not the meane, what is the meane? The Apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, <hi>He hath ſaued vs according to His mercy:</hi> Theſe are flat contrary, The mercy of God, &amp; the merit of man. If thou be ſaued by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mercy of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no merit, becauſe thy merite is not able to ſaue thee. The firſt fountaine of our ſaluation is loue, after loue commeth on mercy: then pitie and compaſſion in His mercie preſupponeth miſerie. Mercie is ſhewed to the miſerable creature. GOD ſeeing vs miſerable, madde, rebelles; following our own
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16627:114"/>
crooked affections, beginneth to bee pitifull, and to haue compaſsion of vs. Yee knowe mercie and pitie followeth vpon loue: For when wee loue any one, and ſee him in miſerie, then wee haue pitie vpon him: if thou hate him, ſuppoſe hee were in neuer ſo great miſerie, thou wilt not pitie him. Then GOD, ſeeing vs wrapped in ſinne and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, He hath pitie upon vs, which pitie proceedeth of loue, and with loue and pitie concurreth His power. Wee will lone one, and ſee him lie in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when it will paſſe our power to relieue him: but GODS power is alwayes effectuall, to deliuer all them who are ſubject to miſery, if once He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende His loue and compaſsion towardes them. Then the cauſe of our ſaluation is in GOD onlie, and no part in man, who is ſaued. The firſt cauſe is the loue of GOD, which is the fountaine: The next cauſe is mercie, for ere euer this worlde was created GOD of His mercie tooke a purpoſe to ſaue vs. The Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. Hee purpoſed of Himſelfe, Hee ſawe no thing in vs wherefore He ſhould take purpoſe to ſaue vs.</hi> And when Hee commeth on to the execution of that eternall purpoſe of our ſaluation, there is nothing in vs, but all is in Himſelfe, for He is all-ſufficient Himſelfe, and nothing is without Him. The ende wherefore He died, all of Himſelfe, without vs, was to the praiſe of the glorie of His grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. that thereby the whole glorie of our ſaluation might redounde to Him onelie, becauſe the cauſe is onelie in Him:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16627:114"/>
Thou that takeſt anie part in it, and attributeſt it vnto thy ſelfe, thou ſpoyleſt GOD of His glorie: Either giue Him all the glorie of this action, or take it all to thy ſelfe: this glorie is too heauie for thee, if thou take it vpon thee, it will preſſe thee to euerlaſting damnation. Then there is the meane of our ſaluation, The mercie of GOD.</p>
            <p>Next hee laieth out the partes of our ſaluation abroade one by one, that yee may ſee what ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meaneth: hee ſaieth, <hi>By the waſhing of the newe birth, and the renewing of the Holie Ghost.</hi> There is the firſt part. It is a waſhing of vs, when GOD put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to His hand to ſaue vs. Yee knowe, waſhing preſupponeth fouleneſſe: therefore it muſt follow, when GOD beganne to ſaue vs, we were vnclene, full of byles and botches, conceiued and borne in filthineſſe, and then warbling and wallowing in our owne ſinne and filthineſſe, and euer the longer wee liue, we are ſtill the filthier. It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that that Holy GOD ſhould euer ſuſtaine to looke to thy filthy byles, or to put His holie and pure hand to thy vile botches, or to ſende downe His cleane Spirit to dwell in thine vncleane heart, or that any wayes His purity ſhould meddle with thine impurity. Amongſt all the argumentes of His loue, this is one, When Hee putteth to His fair ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to thee that art ſo foule. Findeſt thou thy ſinnes pardoned? and thy ſelfe purged &amp; waſhed? aſſure thy ſelfe, thou art ſafe, and GOD hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee: For except the loue of GOD had beene
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16627:115"/>
all the greater towardes thee, Hee woulde neuer haue purged thee from thy ſinnes. It is a ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of His loue towards thee, that it is infinite &amp; exceeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He hath not loathed thee, and thy filthie byles &amp; botches. I ſee heere two waſhings, one outwarde, another inwarde: the firſt in theſe wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The lauer of regeneration,</hi> the next. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holie Spirite.</hi> The firſt, is our Baptiſme: the next, the inward waſhing and renewing by the Holie Spirite, repreſented by this outwarde Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. As the vvater vvaſheth away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the filth from the bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the Holie Spirite purgeth &amp; vvaſheth the heart from ſinne. I vvill ſpeake but thus farre ſhortly of Baptiſme. The outwarde vvaſhing in Baptiſme is not to bee looked to lightlie: the powring on of the vvater, is but a baſe ſigne to looke to: yet it is not a bare ſigne of the vvaſhing of the Holie Spirite: but it is the inſtrument that God taketh in His hand, &amp; vvhereby He applieth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o vs the inwarde vvaſhing of the Holie Spirite, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, hee aſcribeth our regeneration to Baptiſme. Wee by Baptiſme are buried vvith Chriſt, riſen vvith Chriſt, and if this meane bee con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emned, there ſhall bee no regeneration: if a man lightlie this Baptiſme. I affirme, there ſhall be no renewing inwardlie by the Holie Spirit: and if he be not renewed. hee ſhall neuer bee ſaued: for vvithout regeneration. no ſaluation. Ye ſee (2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 5. 10) vvhat vvas injoyned to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrien,</hi> vvhen hee ſought cleanſing, the Prophet bad him
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16627:115"/>
goe to the <hi>Iordane,</hi> and vvaſh him ſeuen times: But hee thought vvith himſelfe, What is this? Are not there faire Riuers at home at <hi>Damaſcus?</hi> Yea, hee would not goe till hee tooke better counſell: but ſo ſoone as hee vvent, and vvaſhed himſelfe ſeuen times, hee vvas cleanſed. Euen ſo it is in Baptiſme: if a man contemne the outward vvaſhing, hee ſhall neuer be cleanſed by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>This ſame is alſo true of the Sacrament of the Supper: Count not therefore little of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe God hath promiſed to giue Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vvith the Sacrament, if it bee rightly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Now looke howe long our regeneration is in working in this life, the force of Baptiſme conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth as long: thou muſt be continually renewed ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l thy laſt breath: therefore, the force of Baptiſme muſt continue vvith thee to thy laſt breath. It is a vanitie to thinke that the force of Baptiſme ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the miniſtration of the action onelie: no, it leaueth vs neuer, after wee haue once receiued it, till vve be placed vvith Ieſus Chriſt. Haue thine eye ſtill vpon Baptiſme, for it is a meane vvhereby the Lord vvill ſaue thee.</p>
            <p>Further, Brethren, hee beginneth heere at rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Yee may ſee then the neceſſitie of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Wouldeſt thou be ſafe? looke that there bee a newe birth. looke that thou bee borne ouer againe, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nicodemus, Iohn</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie, I ſay vnto you, except a man bee borne againe, hee cannot ſee the Kingdome of GOD.</hi> If thou bee
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16627:116"/>
not a new creature, thou art not in CHRIST, but without CHRIST, and without IESVS CHRIST there is no ſaluation. Yee ſee men woulde beguile themſelues, if they ſhoulde ſaye, when yee aske of them, Whether they will goe to Heauen or not? They will anſwere, Wee will goe to Heauen: and yet in the meane time they will holde on the olde man, and will neuer change their maners: but that vaine opinion wil deceiue them: 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Bee not beguiled, for no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ornicaters, adulterers, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, drunkardes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall inherite the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> If thou holde on the olde man, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee ſafe, IESVS CHRIST muſt beget thee a newe againe, or els thou ſhalt neuer enter within the gates of Heauen.</p>
            <p>Now when hee hath ſpoken of this inward and outward waſhing, hee inſiſteth in this point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirit, and declareth from whom this Spirit commeth, <hi>which Hee ſhedde on vs aboundantlie through IESUS CHRIST our Sauiour.</hi> We haue Him not our ſelues, He that waſheth vs is He that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth on the precious lauer of the Spirit, vvherby vve are vvaſhen. Then the Spirit is from GOD. Is that Spirit from the Father immediately? No, He powreth Him in through IESVS CHRIST our Sauiour: ſo immediatly this Spirit commeth from IESVS CHRIST, but mediately from GOD as the Fountaine: Hee commeth from the Father to the Sonne, from the Sonne to vs. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 26. The cauſe of this order is this: Hee is our Sauiour, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16627:116"/>
hath bought vs vvith a deare price: the Spirite is bought to vs by the blood of IESVS CHRIST, His blood hath bought all which vve receiue and get by Him: ſo He giueth His holy Spirit vvith all His graces, by the hand of IESVS CHRIST the man. Then if ye would haue the Spirit, dreſſe your ſelues to that treaſure in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and beſeech God that He would vouchſafe to ſend that Spirit vpon you through IESVS CHRIST, and giue you His grace by the hand of the man CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Yet to open vp the vvordes more narrowly, <hi>Which Hee powreth out,</hi> &amp;c. He ſpeaketh of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as it were of vvater: the Spirite heere is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vvater, becauſe of the vvaſhing: for as the one vvaſheth the filth of the body, ſo the other vvaſheth the filth of the ſoule. Hee is not content to ſay, Hee powreth out the Spirit, ſimply, but hee ſaith, <hi>aboundantly,</hi> in a great meaſure, as a flood in aboundance. This teacheth two things to vs: firſt, the liberality of GOD, Hee giueth not grace nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly, as men, but vvhatſoeuer vvee gette, it is in aboundance: His loue is rich, His mercy is rich, the Spirit vvhich He giueth vnto vs is rich: ſo Hee is liberall vnto vs. Then it followeth of this alſo, that vve are very foule and vncleane. A cloth that is very foule, will require much vvater &amp; waſhing: euen ſo vvee muſt haue aboundance of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvee vvere ſo foule through ſin: but ſuppoſe vve vvere neuer ſo foule, except vve get a ſight of our filthineſſe, vve vvill neuer deſire to be vvaſhen:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16627:117"/>
when <hi>Dauid</hi> felt himſelfe verie filthie in murther and adulterie, he cryed, <hi>Waſh mee, O Lord, and make mee cleane,</hi> PSAL. 51. When a bodie commeth to a remorſe of conſcience, it is a vvonder to ſee howe hee vvill drinke in that Spirite, and deſire to bee ſatiate vvith that vvater. A foule bodie that hath not the ſenſe of his filthineſſe, will neuer crie for vvaſhing. The murtherer and the harlot vvill neuer crie, Lord vvaſhe mee, except they gette a ſight of their owne vncleanneſſe. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirst for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be filled,</hi> MATTH. 5. 6. There may bee mooued a queſtion heere, Howe is it ſaide, that the Spirite is powred out ſo aboundantly, how many feeleth this riches? Will a man or vvoman diſcende into their ſelues, they will finde great lacke and ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this Spirit.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I anſwere: One droppe of the Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt is cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted great riches: one droppe of grace is great riches: one droppe of the vvater of life, is greater riches, than all the vvater in the vvorlde: it vvill vveigh downe all the precious things that are vpon the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. Thou that haſt gotten one droppe of grace in Ieſus Chriſt, thou art richer than all the kinges in the worlde. Moreouer, if this droppe of grace could bee dried vp in the heartes of the regenerate, it were leſſe to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of: but there is ſtil droppe after droppe, and none ende of dropping: Continually thou art refreſhed now and then vvith new drops of grace,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16627:117"/>
ſo long as thou liueſt. So this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is a great riches: thou haſt no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that hath this continuance. Well is the ſoule that getteth droppe after droppe, for that ſoule may ſaye it hath gotten great riches. Thus much for the firſt part of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: when God putteth to His hande to ſaue vs, He putteth to His ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; vvaſheth vs inwardly and outwardlie, and giueth vs His Spirit.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the next part, <hi>That being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by grace, we may be made heyres according to the hope of life euerlasting.</hi> The next part ſtandeth in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I vvill not inſiſt, I ſhall touch it in a worde: It is none other thing but the imputing of the righteouſneſſe of IESVS CHRIST vnto vs. This righteouſneſſe is not inherent in vs, but the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of IESVS CHRIST is imputed to vs. This Iuſtification in effect is none other thing, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes. when God forgiueth thee thy ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; accounteth Chriſts righteouſneſſe to bee thine, and laieth not thy ſinne to thy charge. Al is one thing. Iuſtification is not this y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> men dreame of, to wit, a righteouſnes inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in our ſelues, but it is another mans juſtice which by imputation is made ours. Compare theſe two together, Iuſtification and Regeneration, and conſider the naturall order of them, Iuſtification is firſt. A man is juſtified by the blood of IESVS CHRIST imputed to him, ere euer he be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the Spirit. The Spirite that vvaſheth him in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16627:118"/>
regeneration commeth through the blood: the blood, firſt, and then commeth in regeneration, and vvaſheth awaye the mother ſinne, and the foule ſtinking corruption that is in thee, and both thy juſtification and regeneration commeth of free grace, without merites: for theſe two are euer opponed, grace and mercie: preaſſe not to deale theſe two: to giue GOD one part, and to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute another part to thy ſelfe: leaue thy merites behinde thee, and take thee to the mercy of God, otherwiſe there is no ſaluation for thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after commeth on another part of ſaluation, vvee are made heires of euerlaſting Life: but there is ſomething going betwixt, that is not ſet downe here: For yee ſee, that when wee are juſtified and regenerated, vvee are made ſonnes by adoption: before we be heyres, vve muſt bee children. But I leaue this, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of it heere.</p>
            <p>Then the laſt part is: Wee are made heyres of the Kingdome of Heauen: vvhat more can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſaluation? there is the higheſt degree, Thou art placed in thine inheritance, there is thy perfection, <hi>According to the hope of eternall Lift,</hi> leſt vvee ſhould thinke, that vvee are alreadie put in poſſeſſion of this inheritance: he meeteth this, and ſheweth, that albeit vve are in this life made heyres, yet vvee are not in this life put into a reall poſſeſſion of this heyrſhip: but hee ſaieth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to hope: vvee are heyres by hope, but once
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16627:118"/>
hope and all ſhall goe awaye, and vvee ſhall bee heyres in very deede. Yet hope is neceſſarie ſo long as vvee liue heere: ſo long as the Father is liuing, the heyres haue a to-looke and a hope of the heyrſhip: Hope thou, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer ſee Heauen. Nowe this hope is not ſo bare, that in the meane time vvee haue no fruition of the thing hoped for: yea, euen in this life the fruition of Heauen is begunne in effect: and if thou haue not the beginning of it heere, hope neuer for the accompliſhment of it heereafter. Wee haue a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in this life, but as for the full poſſeſſion and fruition of our inheritance, it is reſerued to the life to come: And therefore it is, that the Godly in this life hope ſtill for the comming of IESVS CHRIST, till they bee ſet and placed vvith Him, in that inheritance purchaſed to vs by His blood: To vvhome vvith the Father, and the Holy Spirite, bee all Honour, Prayſe, and Glory, for euer and euer,</p>

By theſe deepe places hee vnderſtandeth great miſeries, great dangers, wherein his body was, great terror and feare in his conſcience, for his ſinne &amp; offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God: for the Scripture (as ye may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 2. 3) compareth great afflictions to deepe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein a man is like to drowne: and manie a time, when the body is in danger, the ſoule will bee like to drowne in deſperation. No doubt, the greatneſſe of the danger made him to vtter to the Lord voyces co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from the very deapth of the heart. If we felt our ſelues in great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, we wold call from the deapth of our hearts to God: he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not a voyce onely, but a lowde voyce, with a crie. This is the meaning of the words. We ſo here firſt, that the children of God, whom God loueth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16627:120"/>
moſt intirely, are many times ſubject to great and extreame dangers and troubles: and if euer thou thinkeſt to come to Heauen, make thee in thine owne courſe to ſuffer one trouble or other. Let no man therſore, judge euill of a man becauſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth. Next we ſee the greater the danger bee, the heauier y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſtreſſe &amp; the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is exerciſed bee, the more vehement, feruent, &amp; earneſt will their prayer be they haue to God: and howe commeth this to paſſe? Euen in this maner, &amp; by theſe degrees, Oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worketh in the hearts of the faithfull a ſenſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common miſery of nature: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is vpon afaithful man, then he begins to feele his ſinne &amp; corruption: And except the LORD exerciſe vs in this life, either one way or other, the beſt of vs all will fall into ſuch a ſound ſleepe, that we will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remember what we haue bene, what wee are, nor what wee ſhall bee, neither acknowledge our ſelues to be ſinners: So there is a neceſsity of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for affliction bringeth vs to a feeling of our miſery. Next, when through affliction, the heart is prepared and brought to ſome ſenſe of ſin, then it is capable of grace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it prayeth to God. (Look neuer to come to Heauen if thou feeleſt not thy finne, yea, and that thou art a miſerable ſinner) Then, if once thine heart bee prepared with ſome ſenſe of ſinne and miſerie, then commeth in that holy Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture is called the Spirit of adoption, who finding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16627:121"/>
dejected and made lowlie (the Spirite will nerer looke in to a proude heart) beginneth to worke, &amp; to touch the heart of the miſerable ſinner with a ſweet ſenſe of mercie through Ieſus, hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſhedde abroade the loue of Chriſt into the ſoule: and when once the heart hath taſted of the ſweetneſſe of mercie, and as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaieth, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted how ſweet and gracious the Lord is, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this paſſing loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When once that Spirite hath giuen libertie, then we crie with an open mouth (for the heart is wide opened) <hi>Abba,</hi> Father, <hi>Roman.</hi> 8. 15. Becauſe wee haue gotten a ſenſe of that fatherlie loue in Ieſus Chriſt. The prayer of the faithfull is moſt effectuall when they are in greateſt danger, and then the voyce is lowdeſt: for it is the Spirit of GOD, who maketh interceſsion for vs with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed, but God knoweth the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, ſurely few of vs haue yet beene in this deepneſſe and extreamitie of miſerie: the Lord hath not yet ſo preſſed vs with His hand, as Hee hath done many others: and therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there is amongſt vs, who hath this feeling of ſinne and miſerie: and conſequently few of vs can pray ſo earneſtly. Howe many are there amongſt you that dare ſay, that yee feele ſenſibly the common
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16627:121"/>
miſerie of nature? Goe to your hearts, and looke if yee feele it not ſleeping in ſinne: and ſo long as thou ſleepeſt thus, and knoweſt not thy miſerie, howe wilt thou bee carefull to feele the loue of Chriſt? and how wilt thou earneſtly pray to God? And certainly I take this coldneſſe in prayer to be a fore-runner of a judgement to ouer-take this Land. No, it were better to bee ſwimming in the waters of affliction, praying earneſtly to GOD, than to bee this way lying in proſperitie without prayer.</p>
            <p>Nowe I goe forward. After hee hath proponed, that out of the deepneſſe hee cryed to IEHOVAH, then to let vs ſee his cryes, hee ſetteth downe the forme of prayer that hee vſed in his great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: firſt he ſaieth, <hi>O Lord, heare my voyce:</hi> Next, in the other wordes, hee doubleth ouer the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>Attende to the voyce of my prayers:</hi> for hee prayeth not coldly, but hee cryeth earneſtly: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the doubling of the crie would be opened vp from the ground. Wee ſhould gripe downe to the heart, from whence the prayers of the godlie do flow, that when we heare them, or reade them, we may get ſuch an heart &amp; diſpoſition in prayer as they had. The doubling of the prayer, and the mouth wide opening, commeth of the doubling of the graces of the Spirite of GOD in the heart, and of a double opening of the heart: for except the heart be opened in prayer, the mouth cannot be opened with pleaſure, otherwiſe if thou ſpeake
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16627:122"/>
anie thing, I will not giue one pennie for it: So the opening of the mouth commeth from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart When the Holy Spirit ſo ſweetly maketh manifeſt the loue of God to the creature, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongue is looſed, &amp; the ſecond cry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the ſecond grace, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond opening of the heart: &amp; ſo oft as thou cryeſt, ſo oft is there a new grace &amp; motion within the heart wrought by the Holy Spirite, for it is Hee onely that openeth the mouth piece and piece, to ſpeake to God: for take this for a certainty that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is none that can call Ieſus Lord, without that Spirit come in,</hi> 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 3. And againe hee ſaith, <hi>We knowe not what wee ſhould pray, or how wee ought to pray, without that Spirit teach vs, Romanes chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And if Hee teach not, no man or woman is able once to open the mouth with confidence and liberty to pray.</p>
            <p>And ſo, Brethren, if yee would ſpeake well, pray well, or doe well, looke euer to the diſpoſition of the heart, and night and daye pray for that Spirit, who may tranſchange thee, transforme thee, and take thee out of nature, and plant thee in grace: for ſo long as thou remaineſt in nature, thou canſt not thinke well, thou canſt not ſpeake well, thou canſt doe nothing well, yea, thou art worſe than a very beaſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the wordes are very weightie, wee will yet conſider them better: What meaneth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I crie vnto Him, why crie I, and pray I, as though I had not His preſence? Are not ſuch prayers in vaine? No, for although we haue the preſence of God when wee praye, yet for all that our prayers to God are not in vaine: for if we had Him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any meaſure by our prayers, He will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Himſelfe more ſenſibly, piece and piece, more and more: And looke howe much more ſtrongly thou cryeſt, ſo much the more will the Lord bee drawne to thy ſoule, and ſo much the more ſhalt thou finde the increaſe and grouth of grace in thy ſoule. It is vnpoſſible, that the prayer of a faithfull man, if it were but one worde that proceedeth from the Spirit of adoption, can paſſe away without comfort: for the Lord giueth His Spirit to no man in vaine, but becauſe He knoweth the meaning of His owne Spirit, therefore He will graunt that thing for which hee maketh requeſt, there is nothing more certaine: And therefore the Lord (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6.) pronounceth them bleſſed, who hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, for, ſaith hee, they ſhall bee filled and ſatisfied: And ſo Chriſt ſpeaketh to that woman of <hi>Samaria, Ioh.</hi> 4. 13. 14. If thou ſoughteſt a drinke, I ſhoulde giue thee a drinke of the water of life: for the water that I ſhall giue, ſhall bee in a man (or woman) a Well of water ſpringing vp into eternall life: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning generally, that whoſoeuer hath gotten the firſt fruites of the Spirite, and the beginnings of grace, deſireth and ſeeketh for further progreſſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16627:123"/>
and increaſe, that the LORD ſhoulde euer furniſh them with ſomething to quench their thirſt, and that becauſe they ſhoulde euer haue a fountaine within their bellie, to furniſhe ſomething to them when they thirſted: ſo that when as they ſhoulde ſeeke refreſhment, they might gette it in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And if we felt this thirſt and drineſſe of the ſoule, we would ſeeke earneſtly: for there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch a dryneſſe and ſuch an heate in any man naturally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as there is in vs through ſinne. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thine owne experience, when thou haſt felt ſomtimes the great burthen of ſinne, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the wrath of God for ſinne, whenſoeuer in this eſtate thou cameſt to God, and prayedſt for mercie, and ſaid, I am a miſerable ſinner, LORD, giue mee mercie; haſt thou not felt, that the Lord hath anſwered thee comfortably? and hath filled thine heart with joye, euen when in thy prayer thou ſigheſt and ſobbeſt vnſpeakeablie? What meaneth that joye? Euen that as ſoone as thou openeſt thy mouth with libertie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſeeke that water of life, the Lord conuayeth ſome portion of it into thine heart to quench thy thirſt.</p>
            <p>Now after hee hath cryed twiſe, hee ſubjoyneth in the next wordes, <hi>If thou, O Lord, ſtraightly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand.</hi> This no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, followeth by way of preoccupation: It might haue bene objected to him in his prayer (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie are the temptations of the godly) by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, pleading for GOD againſt him: or GOD
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16627:124"/>
Himſelfe might haue ſaide, Thou prayeſt to mee and yet thou art a ſinner, how ſhould I heare thee? How dareſt thou ſtand before mee? It is a wonder that in my fierce wrath I deſtroye thee not. To this hee anſwereth, firſt by waye of confeſſion. It is true, O LORD, that if thou wilt ſtraitelie marke iniquitie, that no fleſh can ſtand in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but they muſt bee conſumed, through the rage of thy diſpleaſure. Then hee anſwereth by waye of correction, But mercie is with thee: the meaning is, Thou takeſt none heede to our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, but of thy free mercie and grace, thou pardoneſt them all in thy Sonne IESVS CHRIST: for none of the Saincts, none of the Fathers, none of the Prophets, euer got mercy, but thorow that blood of IESVS CHRIST, who was ſlaine from the beginning of the worlde: through His blood only was the wrath of God pacified: except Gods juſtice bee firſt ſatisfied, there is no place left to mercy: therefore ſaith he, my refuge is to thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Indeed our eſtate who liue now, is farre better than the eſtate of them who liued before Chriſt came into the world: for they ſaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the death &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, &amp; remiſſion of ſin in his blood but a far of: but we ſee now all, already paſt, &amp; wee may ſay, that now God in Chriſt is merciful to vs, is become our Father, and hath forgiuen all our ſins. Now out of theſe words, &amp; by this example of the Prophet, yee maye ſee what is the eſtate of Gods children in prayer: to wit, when in affliction
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16627:124"/>
they ſeeke to repaire to GOD by prayer, they will not ſo ſoone begin to pray, but as ſoone their guiltie conſciences will beginne to knocke and challenge them, as vnworthie to bee heard: the conſcience will ſtand vp, and if it be not cleanſed, it will preſent thy ſinnes before thee, and ſet them in order in all their circumſtances. Albeit thou forget thy ſinnes, after thou haſt gotten thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet thou ſhalt ſee, that thy conſcience hath marked them all: and as a man cannot reade when the booke is cloſed, yet beeing opened, they maye reade therein: Euen ſo, albeit vvhen our conſciences are benummed, wee ſee not the vglineſſe and guiltineſſe of ſinne, yet when GOD wakeneth them, wee will ſee ſinne in the owne colour, and finde the vglineſſe and guiltineſſe thereof: Our ſinnes will come in, and ſtand vp as mountaines, and will hide the bleſſed face and preſence of GOD from thee: Sinne goeth betwixt vs and GOD, and ſeparateth vs from GOD. The Sainctes finde in experience, that it is not an eaſie thing to finde a familiar acceſſe to God in prayer: except our conſciences firſt bee purged, wee can haue none acceſſe to GOD. Therefore, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woulde drawe neare to GOD, let him ſeeke to followe the counſell of the Apoſtle, in the 10. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the two and twentie verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>Let vs draw neare with a true heart, in an aſſurance of faith ſprinkled in our heartes from an euill conſcience.</hi> No fleſh can
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16627:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue a fauourable acceſſe to God, except his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bee firſt purged from guiltineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, that which wee ſpeake of the guiltineſſe of ſinne, wee ſpeake alſo of ſinne it ſelfe, that except it bee quite taken away out of His ſight, that He will not look fauourably vpon vs. And this is that which the Prophet ſaieth here, <hi>If thou, O Lord, ſtraightlie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> For, as guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne ſtayeth vs to beholde God, ſo ſinne it ſelfe ſtayeth God from beholding vs (miſerable wretches) with the eyes of His compaſſion. So long, therefore, as thy conſcience is not purged, when thou goeſt to preſent thy ſelfe before His Majeſtie, if thy conſcience bee wakened, thou wilt finde God marking thy ſinnes, laying them to thy charge, and wilt finde Him as a terrible Iudge, compaſſed about with burning wrath, readie to deſtroye thee: and if He marke thee, thou haſt no ſtanding: and if thou appeare not cloathed, with the righteouſneſſe and perfect ſatisfaction that IESVS through His blood hath purchaſed for thee, thou dareſt not preſume to approach, for then His fierce wrath ſhall bee poured out vpon thee.</p>
            <p>Further wee learne heereof, that when euer wee would haue our prayers accepted, wee ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with an humble confeſſion of our ſinnes, and vnworthineſſe, and with an earneſt prayer to forgiue the ſame: yea, wee muſt aggreadge our ſinnes by all circumſtances, as the Prophet doeth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16627:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
here. No, none, not the holieſt Sainctés, Fathers, nor Prophets, could be able to ſtand, if he marked their iniquitie, let bee himſelfe, who was ſuch an vnworthie wretch, who was laden with ſo manie and great ſinnes. Thou muſt not extenuate thy ſinnes before GOD, if thou wouldeſt find fauour with GOD, as manie men commonlie doe, ſaying wee are all ſinners, yea, manie men haue ſinned more, and haue done worſe deedes than I haue done. That is not the way to finde Gods fauour. Thou muſt bee very abject, vile, and contemptible in thine owne accompt, if thou wouldeſt haue the Lord to account of thee. Then where ſhall wee get a remidie, to helpe an euill conſcience? for ſinne taketh away all joy and confidence in prayer.</p>
            <p>The next wordes furniſh a faire remidie, <hi>But mercie is with Thee:</hi> Lord, it is not Thy juſtice I looke to, but Thy mercie, Thy juſtice holdeth mee abacke, but Thy mercie allureth mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I flee from Thy juſtice and I claime to Thy mercie. So when a man deſireth his prayers to bee heard, hee muſt firſt haue a ſight of his owne miſerie, guiltineſſe, and vnworthineſſe, and of the fierceneſſe of the Lords wrath for the ſame, and in all humilitie hee muſt confeſſe the ſame. Next hee muſt haue a ſight of the Lordes mercie, and hope, that it is poſſible that GOD bee reconciled with him: except that theſe two bee joyned together, hee commeth not duelie prepared, the one without the other will not ſerue, both are neceſſarie: for without the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16627:126"/>
knowledge, ſight, and feeling of our miſerie, of ſinne, and of the wrath of God for the ſame, vvee will neuer be earneſt in prayer: Who will aske, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee finde his want? and without an humble confeſſion, there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming before God. Thou muſt not do as the <hi>Phariſie</hi> did: reade that parable of the <hi>Phariſie</hi> and of the <hi>Publicane, Luke</hi> 18. The <hi>Phariſie</hi> was ſo blinded with ſelfe-loue, that hee could not ſee the filthineſſe and corruption of his own heart: and therefore, not only in the preſence of man, whom he might deceiue, would he juſtifie himſelf, but alſo in the very preſence of God, who cannot be deceiued, &amp; who ſearcheth the hearts, he would boaſt of his own righteouſnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the poore <hi>Publicane</hi> But what found he? It is ſaide, hee went home not juſtified, that all men might feare thereafter to come before God with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of their worthines. Thou muſt follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the poore <hi>Publicane,</hi> who being aſhamed of himſelf, would not looke vp to Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked down, &amp; ſmote his breſt, &amp; ſaid, <hi>O God, be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto mee a ſinner.</hi> Next, if thou haue no more but a ſight, ſenſe, &amp; confeſsion of thy miſery, will that bee ſufficient? No, for albeit thou ſaweſt all thy ſinnes, and foundeſt the burthen thereof, and foundeſt the Lord as a judge in a judgement pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thee, and heaping daylie judgement vpon judgement, and wrath vpon wrath, that will neuer make thee to drawe neare to the Lord, but by the contrary wil make thee to turne thy back vpon the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16627:126"/>
LORD: for as a male-factor hath no pleaſure to beholde the face of a judge, becauſe his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is terrible, No more can the ſinner abide the countenance of God, His judgementes &amp; His wrath may make vs aſtoniſhed, and ſtupified: but if there bee no more, they will neuer make vs to come to God. Then if this be not ſufficient, what more is requiſite? Euen a ſight of the Lordes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for that is moſt forceable to allure, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaieth here, and as the Church of God ſaith (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2) becauſe of the ſauour of thy good oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore the Virgines loue thee: this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is forceable to allure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of GOD, and curſes of the lawe, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer allure him. What was the chief thing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Prodigall ſonne to returne home to his father? Was it chiefely the diſtreſſe, the diſgrace, and pouerty wherewith he was burthened, or the famine that almoſt cauſed him to ſterue? No, but the chiefe thing was this, hee remembred that hee had a louing father: that maketh him to reſolue with an humble confeſsion, to goe home, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Euen ſo is it vvith a ſinner, it is not terrours and threatninges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chiefely vvil moue him to come to God, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſideration of His manifold &amp; great mercies: therfore, if the Lord waken thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, preſent thy ſins before thee, threaten thee, &amp; heap judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on thee, then ſay, Lord, I deſerue to be threatned, &amp; alwais to be plagued, but, Lord, thou knowſt my nature, thes things wil not make me to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16627:127"/>
come to Thee, but will put mee away from Thee: therefore, let mee ſee Thy manifolde mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners, to allure me, and then I ſhall come vnto Thee.</p>
            <p>So wee ſee the remidie againſt an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to wit, an humble confeſsion of ſinne and vnworthineſſe, and a fleeing from the juſtice of God, to His mercie. The faireſt &amp; ſweeteſt thing in the worlde is to feele the mercie of GOD. But herein there is great hardneſſe and difficultie. It is not ſo eaſilie attained vnto, as men commonlie thinke: for His mercie is compaſſed about with His juſtice, and with His wrath againſt ſinners, as with a wall of fire: and he who will come to grace, he muſt come through a conſuming fire: and when hee preaſſeth to come neare, the fire of Gods wrath will holde him off, and will ſtrike out and burne vp the impenitent ſinner, as fire doeth the ſtubble: So it is an harder thing than manie think it to be, to win to Gods mercy. And how ſhal this be remidied? By what meanes ſhall wee gette thorowe this wall of fire? Truely hee who woulde meane to paſſe thorow fire, had neede to bee well armed: the man who preaſſeth to approach neare to that inuialable Majeſtie, who can abide no ſort of vncleanneſſe, and woulde drawe neare to the Throne of His grace muſt bee well armed againſt the juſtice and wrath of GOD, which debarreth ſinners. Surelie there is none armour in the world that can preſerue vs from that raging and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16627:127"/>
fire of the juſtice and wrath of GOD, but only the righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt. Let a man vſe all the meanes in the world, and he be not found in Chriſt, he ſhall haue none acceſſe to come thorowe the juſtice and wrath of God to the Throne of grace: yea, his ſoule and his conſcience muſt bee ſprinkled and purged from dead workes, with that blood which was offered vp to GOD to that ende by His eternall Spirite, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. without he bee dipped in that blood, hee will finde GOD a terrible Iudge. And after that through faith in the death and blood of IESVS, thou commeſt to that Throne of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt heare the ſweeteſt and moſte comfortable voyce that euer was, that is, All thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee in that blood. And if a man were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to die for ſome haynous cryme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the king would ſaye, I abſolue thee, I forgiue thee, thou ſhalt liue: What joye and comfort woulde that voyce bring to the heart of him who was condemned? The Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>Hebr. 10. 22. Let vs goe to the Throne of grace with a true heart, and purged from an euill conſcience through the blood of IESUS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> CHRIST,</hi> that is, Thinke not to come to that Throne of grace, except firſt thou bee purged with that blood. Therefore, as euer thou wouldeſt bee in Heauen, or ſee the face of GOD to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſeeke to haue faith in CHRIST IESVS: Looke vvhat neceſſitie is laide vpon a ſinner: either muſt hee bee baniſhed from the preſence
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16627:128"/>
and face of GOD for euer, and be caſten into the ſocietie of the damned, or elſe if he would bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hee muſt bee imped and ingraffed by a true and liuely faith in Ieſus Chriſt: make thee for it with all thy maine, to get a gripe of Chriſt, as euer thou wouldeſt be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Nowe after hee hath met this objection, which God or his owne conſcience in Gods cauſe might haue caſten in, that hee was ſo vnworthie to bee heard by an humble confeſſion of vnworthineſſe, and by fleeing from His juſtice, and claiming to His great mercies, bee ſetteth downe the ende of this mercie and free forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, when he ſaieth, <hi>But mercie is with Thee, that Thou mayest bee feared:</hi> The ende whereof the Lord granteth mercie and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to ſinners, is that they may obey, ſerue, and worſhip God with pleaſure and alacritie. No man can euer be able to glorifie God, and to ſerue Him chearfully, but the man who hath aſſurance that his ſinnes are freely forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in that eternall loue of God, through the blood of Ieſus: for none can glorifie God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept firſt he be glorified of God. Albeit the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man got neuer ſo manie and great benefites, yet becauſe hee hath none aſſurance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of his ſinnes he can neuer glorifie God, nor be thankfull to Him. On the other part, It is vnpoſſible and if thou haue a ſure perſwaſion that thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, but thou wilt bee careful in ſome meaſure to meet the Lord God in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16627:128"/>
loue, to pleaſure Him, and to thanke Him: for the firſt effect that floweth from the remiſsion of ſinnes, is ſanctification or glorification: And it is not poſsible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if thou bee glorified, thou muſt glorifie the Lord againe. But the queſtion may be here proponed, Wherein ſtandeth our glorifying of God? hath He neede of our glorification? Can our ſeruice bee profitable to Him? Can our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing extend to Him? Hath He need of any thing that wee can doe? I anſwere: Indeede it is true, our well-doing cannot extende to Him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth of himſelfe in the 16. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and the 2. verſ. All the Kinges and Monarches in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe any thing that is profitable and ſteadable to God: We are not able to adde any thing to the glory of God, for His glory is infinite, and to an infinite thing nothing can bee added: for if anie thing coulde bee added, it were not infinite. The Father, the Sonne and the Holy Spirite perfectlie glorified one another from all eternitie. <hi>Glorifie Mee,</hi> ſaieth Chriſt, <hi>with that glorie which I had with Thee before the foundation of the world was laide.</hi> That bleſſed Trinitie was as perfect in glorie before the creation of the world, as it hath beene euer ſince. Our glorifying of God ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth only in this, when the Lord illuminateth our minds, that we may ſee His glorie, in all his properties, that wee in our heartes with pleaſure and chearfulneſſe conſent thereunto, allow of it, and with our mouthes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime that glory which we ſee to be in Him. And
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16627:129"/>
it lieth not in man nor angel to compare His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ELBELOVED in the LORD IESVS, The laſt day we diuided this <hi>Pſalme</hi> into theſe three partes. Firſt, the propoſition, whoſoeuer hee was that writ this <hi>Pſalme,</hi> hee maketh mention and rehearſall of that prayer that hee made to his God in the time of his great danger, and this hee doeth to the fift verſe: Then finding in experience a comfortable anſwere, and howe good a thing it was to pray to God, and to waite on Him, he profeſſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as before, he had awai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Him, ſo ſtill in time comming hee woulde awaite on Him, and this hee doeth to the ſeuenth verſe. In the third and laſt part, he turneth him to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16627:130"/>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the Church, and exhorteth them to await on God, as hee had done, promiſing them mercie and redemption from all their iniquities, if they would awaite on Him. The laſt day we ended the firſt part: ſo wee haue now to follow out the other two parts which remaine.</p>
            <p>Then as for the ſecond, The prophet finding in experience the fruite of his prayer, hee profeſſeth that hee will yet ſtill waite on the Lord: <hi>I haue waited on the Lord: my ſoule hath waited, and I haue trusted in His word:</hi> As though he would ſaye, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend yet ſtill on His word, for the preſence of the Lord that wee haue in this life, is in His worde, and in His Holy Spirite, that accompanieth it: So all the dependance we haue on GOD, is in His worde and promiſe. Take that away, and then wee haue no ſight, no preſence, no faith here, till wee ſee Him face to face.</p>
            <p>Yet the wordes are better to bee marked, hee ſaith, <hi>I haue waited on the Lord:</hi> Then hee ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>My ſoule hath waited on the Lord:</hi> as if he woulde ſaye, I haue not awaited on the Lord onely with my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, but with mine heart and ſecrete inward affections: I haue depended on Him from my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heart. For, Brethren, marke it well, It is the heart of a man or woman, that draweth GOD downe from Heauen, &amp; ſucketh in His preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marueilous is the power that a faithful heart hath when it ſendeth vp ſighes and ſobbes to Heauen for grace, to pull down Gods preſence and grace:
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16627:131"/>
if there be no more but the eye, it will not doe the turne, but where the Spirit of the Lord dwelleth in the heart, it maketh it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh with ſobbes that cannot be expreſſed. It is not poſsible, but GOD, who giueth His Spirite to no man in vaine, and who knoweth the meaning of His owne Spirite, will grant that for which the Spirit maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the 8. chap. to the <hi>Rom.</hi>) ſetting downe the waiting on of the godly, how they wait on the Lord, he ſetteth downe both the forceable operation of Gods Spirit in our hearts, as alſo the fruit of his operation, <hi>Wee ſigh in our ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodies:</hi> there the vvaiting on of the godly, is conjoyned vvith ſighes and ſobbes. Then after, hee letteth vs ſee what followeth vpon that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>What to ſeeke wee knowe not:</hi> but when the Spirite of the Lord interceadeth for vs with ſighes and ſobbes vnſpeakeable then the Lord, who ſearcheth the heart, &amp; knoweth the meaning of His owne Spirit, granteth that thing, for the which the Spirite maketh interceſsion: for what els meaneth that vnſpeakeable joye, vvhich many a time the Saincts of God finde before they haue ended their prayers, but that their prayers are fauourably accepted? What meaneth that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable joy, when he ſaith, <hi>Belieuing we rejoyce with joy vnſpeakeable and glorious?</hi> That joye witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the Lord giueth his preſence: for there is a ſure ground, There is no true joy, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: and ſo the joy teſtifieth to thee, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16627:131"/>
thou ſigheſt not ſo ſoone, but the Lord giueth his preſence to thee. Now, when hee hath ſaide, <hi>My ſoule hath waited,</hi> then he ſubjoyneth, <hi>I will waite ſtill vpon His word:</hi> I will hold vp mine eare to Heauen, as it were, and heare what He wil ſpeake vnto me. There is no conſolation nor joy in this world, but in the hearing of His voyce: <hi>The friends of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iohn, when they ſtand and heare the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome ſpeake, they rejoyce exceedingly:</hi> So it is the joye of a Chriſtian to heare the Lord Ieſus ſpeake. The meaning is this, I haue waited on ſo long, &amp; haue founde in experience how good a thing it is, and therefore that experience ſhall moue me to waite on ſtill, I am forced through the experience of mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to waite on ſtill without wearying. This <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> whoſoeuer he was was in a great danger, and therefore in the beginning hee ſaide, <hi>Out of the deepe places haue I cryed vnto thee, O IEHOVAH:</hi> ſo he was vnder great affliction, his affliction y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hee ſuffered wrought in him ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he waiteth patientlie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: a waiting with patience, in end he finds experience &amp; proof of the mercy of God, for hee was deliuered: finding experience of the Lords loue through that deliuery, hee conceits an hope that Gods fauor ſhal neuer leaue him, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he wil wait yet ſtil, &amp; wait on co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe of that experience of mercy. In the 5. chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> yee haue the notable effectes that affliction worketh, linked together: and if there vvere no more but the effects y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wee finde to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16627:132"/>
haue beene in this man, they teſtifie, that it is true that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here: <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worketh patience,</hi> that is <hi>when affliction is ſanctified to him that is afflicted,</hi> through time it bringeth forth patience. Then after that a man hath waited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently on the deliuerance of the Lord, then ſaith he, patience worketh experience, that is, a bodie that abideth patiently vnder the croſſe, in the end he findeth an experience and proofe of the Lords loue, one way or other, either by deliuery, or by furniſhing ſtrength to beare it out, or by ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace. Then he ſaieth, experience worketh hope, that is, when anie one hath founde in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the mercy of the Lord, hee conceaueth an hope, that the Lord ſhall euer deliuer him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forſake him: &amp; he hopeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhall get grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fauour, than euer he got before: for if the Lord giue the faithfull a temporall deliuerie, they hope Hee ſhall giue them eternall deliuerie: And this is ſure, thou canſt neuer hope for great enough things of the Lord, thine hope is farre inferiour to the things that ſhall be granted: for certainly, they that hope in the Lord, ſhall finde greater thinges than euer they hoped for: thou art not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in thine hope the greatneſſe of them: the kingdome, the joye, and the glorie, is greater than thou canſt looke for: when thou ſhalt come there, thou ſhalt finde that all thinges are greater than thine hope.</p>
            <p>Nowe when hee hath proponed that hee will
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16627:132"/>
hope in the Lord, hee beginneth in the next verſe to amplifie that propoſition, and declareth the earneſtneſſe of it by a compariſon taken from the watch-men, who watch all the night ouer without any reliefe, and ſaieth, <hi>My ſoule waiteth on the Lord more than the morning-watch watcheth for the morning.</hi> It is a worthie thing, to conſider how that after the heart is once preuented with a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the ſweetneſſe of Gods fauour, howe that heart will hing and depend vpon Him, and ſeeke and waite for grace at Him more and more. Alas! from whence commeth this, that men &amp; women are ſo careleſſe to ſeeke the Lord, and to waite on Him? Alas! they haue not taſted of that gracious ſweetneſſe that is in God through Ieſus Chriſt, for if they had once taſted of it, there would bee a perpetuall thirſting &amp; deſiring for that preſence: the heart would neuer haue reſt nor eaſe till it got that preſence. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he deſireth them to ſeeke that ſincere milke of the worde, whereby they might grow, hee ſubjoyneth, <hi>If once yee haue tasted how ſweet and gracious the Lord is:</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they that neuer haue taſted of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lordes preſence and His graces, haue not a deſire of grace. Wee ſee heere what is the eſtate of the faithfull in this worlde, by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the watch. The eſtate of euery one of vs. is this waking and watching from euening to morning. The watch, yee knowe, watcheth in the night, and there eſpecially where greateſt danger
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16627:133"/>
may fall out, and the watch that hath no reliefe in his watching, but muſt watch from the euening to the morning, hee muſt bee very weary, and being very weary, hee will bee very deſirous of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the ſunne riſing: when it commeth, he is relieued of his painfull watching &amp; goeth to take his reſt. To apply this to vs: This world which wee liue in, till the comming again of the Lord Ieſus, is but a darkeſome night, in reſpect of that glorious day that ſhall appeare when He commeth againe. Indeed, the world ſince the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, is called <hi>a day</hi> in the Scripture: but that is in reſpect of them that were before Chriſt, but in reſpect of that paſſing light that Ieſus Chriſt ſhall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring with Him: this is but paſſing darknes, and we ſhall thinke ſo, when that day ſhall come. Nowe next, the watch in this worlde was neuer more ſtraitelie bound to watch in the night, than euery Chriſtian man is bound to watch till he come again: &amp; this was the direction that Chriſt gaue His diſciples. <hi>Wait, for yee knowe not what houre thee good-man of the houſe ſhall come:</hi> and in watching, wee finde a great heauines: What faithfull man is in this world, that is not wearied with watching? The worlde that ſleepeth in this life, is not wearied, but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that watcheth is weary of this life, and faine would they haue that morning comming, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne of righteouſnes, the Lord Ieſus, ſhall riſe vp, that they may be relieued: And when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> morning ſhall come, thou that haſt watched in this worlde,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16627:133"/>
at the leaſt hath ſtriuen to watch, and looked for that glorious comming of the Lord Ieſus, thou ſhalt get reſt, ſo ſweet a reſt as neuer man found in this world: but thou that haſt ſlept here, &amp; haſt not vvatched for Him, ſleepe on: when Hee commeth thou ſhalt get no reſt, thy ſleeping ſhall ende in a terrible wakening. There is no reſt to them that hath not a deſire to watch in this world: but they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue a deſire to watch, &amp; to holde vp their heads, they ſhall get reſt, yea, endleſſe reſt, and quietnes.</p>
            <p>Now, hauing ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt &amp; ſecond parts, I ſhall goe ſhortly forward to the third part of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> wherein the <hi>Prophet</hi> turneth himſelfe to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that is, the Church of God, and hee exhorteth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Church of God, to watch, &amp; waite on the Lord: <hi>Let Iſrael waite on the Lord:</hi> finding in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what hee had gotten for his waiting on, to vvit, mercie and deliuerance, he cannot be holden from glorifying Him, and cannot get Him glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied enough: Therefore, hee turneth him to the whole Church, and exhorteth them to vvaite on, that they may finde ſuch experience as he found, and that they may glorifie the Lord alſo. So the end he looketh to, is to glorifie the Lord, that He may bee glorified in manie belieuers, and waiters on him. The ende of the mercy of God tendeth to His own glory. There are many properties in God, he is infinite in wiſdom, in power, in trueth, infinit in glorie &amp; Majeſtie. Now the Lord is glorified in all his properties, in his wiſdome, power &amp; juſtice.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16627:134"/>
But aboue all thinges, the LORD ſeeketh that the world ſhould glorifie Him in that deepe riches of mercie and gentleneſſe that is in Him, that wee ſhoulde praiſe Him euerlaſtingly in His mercie. And as this is His will, and as the mercy of GOD ſerueth to His glory, So the ſoule of a man that hath once taſted of the mercy of the Lord Ieſus, is caried away with ſuch a zeale to His glory, that it will cauſe am in forget himſelfe, and with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh to be a curſe and <hi>anathema,</hi> to haue God glorified. This man ye ſee, when he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted or His mercy, hee turneth him to the whole Church, and willeth them to truſt in Him, that they might find His mercy, that ſo God may bee glorified. So it is hee onely, who hath taſted of the mercy of God, who when he looketh thorow the miſerable world, can haue pity on any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He that neuer taſted of that mercy of God had neuer true pitic vpon any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing which he craueth is this, that many ſhoulde taſte of His mercy, that God may be glorified by many. His heart is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with pitie, and ſo all his endeuour is to ſee if once he can gette them win to God: for when hee looketh abroad vpon miſerable ſinners, he is full of rueth and compaſsion. But marke againe, the zeale which hee hath to the glory of GOD, is the firſt cauſe that mooued him to ſeeke that all the world ſhould taſte of mercy and glorifie God. So firſt he beareth a loue to Gods glory, and then he hath pitie towarde men: the one is the cauſe, the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16627:134"/>
other the effect: the one preceedeth, the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: the one is the roote, and the other the branch. All the loue we cary to man, ſhould be for the loue vve haue to GOD. And vvhere theſe two goe together, a zeale to the glory of God, (alas! vvhere is zeale to Gods glory now adayes? vvhich is a true token, that His glory is departing away) and then a pitie of the miſery of man, a deſire of the ſaluation of man: then that man vvill forget himſelfe, that hee maye ſeeke the ſaluation of the vvorld, that ſo in it God may be glorified. And the man that hath this diſpoſition in his heart, is fit to be a Miniſter &amp; Preacher of grace to the world, otherwiſe, if hee vvant this diſpoſition, it is but a colde preaching that he vvill make.</p>
            <p>Now in the next vvords, vvhen he hath propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the exhortation, and deſired them to vvaite on the Lord, to moue them the more, he pointeth out to the Church the nature of God, vvhat God is: for vvee muſt know vvhat God is, ere euer vvee put our truſt and confidence in Him: <hi>for</hi> why? ſaith he, <hi>with the Lord is mercie</hi> and gentleneſſe: as if hee would ſaye, The Lord is full of mercy. His mercies are incomprehenſible, yea, infinite, and neither man nor Angel can ſound out the deepneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: He is all mercie: and as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaieth in his firſt Epiſt. chap. 4. verſ. 8. <hi>The Lord is loue.</hi> Therefore, await on Him: for why? there is no want nor ſcant of mercy in Him. This is vvell to be marked, when hee exhorteth <hi>Iſrael</hi> to vvaite vpon the Lord, hee
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16627:135"/>
ſaith not, becauſe <hi>He is omnipotent, and infinite in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, onelie wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. But hee giueth this reaſon, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mercy is with Him,</hi> therefore waite vpon Him. This would be well conſidered, What is the cauſe of this? Nowe I will aske another queſtion, What thing in God neede wee moſte into this worlde? There are manie thinges which wee haue much neede of: What is it that wee haue moſte neede of? Another queſtion: What is the eſtate that euerie one of vs is borne in, in this worlde? Are wee not borne ſinners? conceiued and borne in ſinne and iniquitie? And ſo are wee not all miſerable? For there is nothing for ſinners, but miſerie, death, &amp; damnation: and ſo all ſinners are miſerable. So, what thing is it that a ſinner wanteth moſt? vvhat is it that ſinne and miſerie craueth, but mercie? And if thou bee miſerable, the thing in this world that thou ſhouldeſt craue firſt, is mercy, that God woulde bee mercifull to thee: So mercie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinne is the firſt thing whereto thou oughteſt to haue recourſe. And if thou wilt tell a miſerable bodie that feeleth himſelfe to bee miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and the childe of wrath, that God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent if thou point Him out in His wiſedome, in His juſtice, hee ſhall bee ſo farre from receiuing anie comfort, and conſolation, of anie of theſe things, that by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie he ſhall be ſo terrified, that hee dare not preſume to ſeeke God, to looke to Him, to come to Him, &amp;c: but hee will runne away from God: But tell him that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16627:135"/>
&amp; full of grace in Ieſus Chriſt, that is the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſpeach that euer he heard. But, alas! few of vs feeleth that burthen of ſinne: Who is he that gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnder ſinne? Who feareth the terrors of that wrath? If thou find them, then tell thee of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Ieſus Chriſt, it would bee the ſweeteſt tale that euer thou heardeſt. And when a man is once ſenſible of the infinite mercies of GOD in Ieſus, then tell him of all the infinite properties of God, tell him of His power, wiſedome, and prouidence, they will all ſerue to his comfort: for why? he will thinke that all things that are in God appertaine to him, and ſerue to his weale, he will finde that all things will ſerue to his ſaluation. Otherwiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this aſſurance of mercy, hee will neuer thinke them comfortable. So there is a ſure ground, The faith of a man or woman, firſt of all, is euer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the mercy of God: and that is the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith. Indeed, hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a gripe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then it extendeth to all the reſt: but before that, there is nothing in God that it can reſt vpon. Yee ſee by experience, when the law is preached, there is little allurance of the heart: but when the Euangell and Chriſt Ieſus is preached, the heart is drawne on and allured. What is the cauſe of this? The doctrine of the law is a doctrine of extreame juſtice, and His juſtice doeth nothing but terrifie the ſoule: but the doctrine of the Euangell is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the mercy of God in Ieſus Chriſt, which draweth to it the hearts of men. Albeit thou heare
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:16627:136"/>
the law preached an hundreth yeares, &amp; heare no more, thou ſhalt be ſo far from being the better, that thou ſhalt ſtill be the worſe. So this teſtifieth, that the object of our faith is the ſurpaſſing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. Then, if thou wouldeſt ſearch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of God (and ſearch Him a thouſand yeeres, thou ſhalt neuer come to the ground of His deepneſſe) ſearch out eſpecially His loue &amp; mercy: a man may faile &amp; vaniſh away in curioſity, ſearching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: but in ſearching out His mercy, thou ſhalt neuer erre, it ſhall be with a joy &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation of the heart. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> (chap. 3 verſ. 18.) that they might attaine to that infinite deepneſſe &amp; breadth, length &amp; height in God, for God is infinitly deepe in all things: but wherefore is it that he prayeth? Euen that they, ſearching in God, ſhould ſearch that infinit profoundity of the loue of God. Surely, if wee would know that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundity of God, &amp; ſearch in to His nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs ſearch alwayes in to that loue &amp; mercy of God in IESVS Chriſt. And this ſearching hath euer a grouth and increaſe in faith, till wee get a ſight of Him euerlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>To go forward. He is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to ſay, <hi>with Him is gentlenes,</hi> but he ſubjoynes, <hi>with Him is great redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:</hi> the words grow in highneſſe, &amp; theſe words comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; ſet out a greater mercy in God than the former: now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of God in Ieſus Chriſt is not all told in a word: alas, for want of feeling we ſpeake ſlenderly &amp; lightly of it: no, in very deed, all
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16627:136"/>
the words, and the greateſt words in the world, of the moſt holy, moſt wiſe, &amp; moſt eloquent men, is not able to ſet out &amp; point out that infinit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; deepnes of it: and he &amp; ſhe that once haue taſted of mercy, ſcarcely can they find words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the thouſand part of it: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a little taſte &amp; apprehenſion of it, they are not able to get words to expreſſe that apprehenſion of the heart. <hi>Paul</hi> commonly calleth it the riches of mercy, <hi>God, who is rich in mercy, according to His infinit &amp; great loue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Paul, Dauid,</hi> &amp; the reſt of them ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not get words to expreſſe that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mercy that they haue in their heartes. No, there is no creature that is capable of that infinite mercy: for the worke that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt doeth worke in the heart, whether it be a ſenſe of dolour, or a ſenſe of joy, the tongue of no creature can tell or expreſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it ſighes inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it joy vnſpeakeable: So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart cannot expreſſe the greatneſſe of the worke of the Spirit. Men will thinke them hyperbolicall words, but that is a token that they haue not taſted that joy and mercy in their owne hearts.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt words he commeth neare hand, &amp; makes a particular promiſe of His mercy to His Church, <hi>He will redeeme Iſrael,</hi> His Church, <hi>from all her iniquity,</hi> as hee would ſay, I haue told you, He is mercifull &amp; full of redemption, but I come nearer hand: Thou ſhalt finde in experience, that Hee is mercifull, &amp; full of redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: So it is not enough
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16627:137"/>
to the Preachers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, to preach Gods mercy and redemption generally to the world: no, they muſt come nearer hand, &amp; in promiſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they muſt make to the hearts of the people a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſay not only, God is mercifull, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will be mercifull vnto you, and He is full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and He ſhall redeeme you: and ſo ſay I, I haue not beene ſpeaking of mercy and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that appertaineth not to vs, but the Lord ſhal be mercifull, and redeeme you, if ye belieue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: for there is no grace but in Him. If this particular application be not made, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of ſinne is ſo great, that the ſinner dare not put foorth his hand to receiue mercy. Now to whom pertaineth mercy and redemption? He ſaith, Hee ſhall redeeme <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Church militant. The Church is milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this world, but redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pertaineth to it in the ende. But where from ſhall the Lord redeeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church? Not from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and tribulation in this worlde, but from all her ſinnes. So this preſupponeth firſt, That the Church is full of ſin ſo long as it is in this world. This is but a vaine dreame to imagine that there ſhall bee a Church, or any member of the ſame, in this worlde, without ſpot: away with that vanitie. So next, the redemption of the Church ſtandeth nor ſo much in freeing it from perſecution or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, although ſhe ſhall be redeemed from all theſe things alſo, as from redeeming her from ſin: the chieſe redemption ſhall be from ſin: for why?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16627:137"/>
the greateſt enemy of the Church is her own ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; it is her own ſins that is the cauſe of all her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and it is ſin that the Lord mortifieth and ſlayeth by perſecution and tribulation: for if there were no ſin, there would not bee ſuch a thing as a perſecuter or a tyrant againſt her: and the greateſt burthen that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly feele, is alwayes their owne ſins, &amp; they were neuer vnder ſo great perfecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no croſſe, no trouble comparable to the burthen of ſin. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, <hi>Miſerable man! who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> Where from? Not from perſecution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was ſubject to as great perſecution as anie man, but <hi>from this body of ſin,</hi> becauſe hee could not get that obedience to God, that hee would haue had. And wherfore died Chriſt? Was it to redeeme vs from perſecution, or croſſes in this world? No, the Lord died that Hee might redeeme vs from ſin with His precious blood. And <hi>Paul</hi> (to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Corin</hi>) maketh mention of that triumph that the Church ſhall haue when the Lord Ieſus ſhall come, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> Then ſhe ſhall glory that ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from ſinne, and from offending of GOD. And that ſhall be our chiefe felicity in that life to come, that our hearts &amp; thoughtes ſhall be free of all ſinne, we shall offend God no more, but al ſhall be full of obedience to Ieſus Chriſt, and then shall we be fully ſanctified and glorified when wee get that bleſſed preſence of the Lord Ieſus, which wee long for: To whome bee praiſe and glory, for euer,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this TEXT which wee haue read (wel beloued in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) wee haue a wonder, that the Lord wrought on a woman, a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> of a curſed genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the generation of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The wonder is, the healing of a womans daughter that was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſore and miſerably vexed with a deuill. The woman hauing the occaſion to meet with the Lord through His comming to theſe parts where ſhe abode, ſhee ſlippeth not the occaſion, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mercy and grace: ſhe findeth at the firſt great hardneſſe and difficulty, to get mercy: but at the laſt, ſhe ouercommeth all by her faith, and getteth mercy.</p>
            <p>Now to go through this Hiſtory ſo ſhortly and plainly as the LORD ſhall giue the grace. This woman is called a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> that is deſcended of that olde and rotten ſtocke of <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that was deſtinate for wrath and deſtruction. (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9. 25. Looke to her eſtate, ſhee is come of a curſed raſe, ſhe is lying in ſinne and ſecurity: firſt in ſinne, next in a deadly ſleepe and ſecurity of ſinne. This is the eſtate of euery one of vs: we lie in ſinne, conceiued in ſinne, and borne in ſinne: we feele not the ſinne, &amp; that deadly ſleepe of ſecurity is worſe than the ſinne we lie in: there is none of vs better by nature than this woman was. Then when ſhe is thus lying in ſinne &amp; ſecurity, the Lord from the Heauen ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16627:139"/>
her awakening, and a ſharpe wakening: for the judgements of God are like many meſſengers from Heauen to waken vs. In the example of the woman wee ſee that the Lords children muſt bee wakened: and oftentimes our firſt wakening is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sharpe, dolefull, and fearefull, as it is with one that is wakened in the rage of a feuer. Yet there is grace here: Well is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that is wakened, though the wakening were neuer ſo ſore and sharpe: for the multitude of the worlde dye in ſecuritie, and neuer waken, till the fire of Hell waken them. Well is thee, and thou be wakened, albeit it should be with neuer ſo heauy a judgement, yea, though thy daughter, or thy ſelfe, should bee poſſeſſed with a deuill.</p>
            <p>Now, when this poore woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is thus wakened, and is wraſtling vnder the heauy hand of God, the Lord caſteth an eye towardes her, (for no doubt, howbeit ſhe was one of the raſe of curſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet ſhe was choſen to eternall life) and of very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe He caſteth Himſelf into theſe parts where ſhe was: what euer other erand Hee had, there is no queſtion, but He had a particular reſpect to her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> she might haue the occaſion to come to Him, and this was a great grace. When we are wakened out of ſecurity, then the Mediciner hath his time, and this is a greater grace. It is a great grace to bee wakened, but it is a greater grace to find a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciner to cure thy diſeaſe: for, as multitudes die in ſecuritie, ſo alſo multitudes die in paine, torment,

But what maketh her to cry <hi>Mercy?</hi> Wee will raile &amp; blaſpheme God whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are in miſery: but what cauſed her to cry <hi>Mercie?</hi> No queſtion, the conſcience of her demerites cauſed her to crie <hi>Mercie:</hi> ſhee felt her ſelfe to bee worthy of all that miſery wherewith ſhee was burthened. The voyce of a miſerable ſinner, that feeleth miſery, is, <hi>O Lord haue mercy vpon mee:</hi> but loe howe ſhee ſtileth Him, <hi>O Lord, The Sonne of Dauid:</hi> theſe were the common ſtiles indeed of the Lord, in this life, He was called of the multitud, LORD, and <hi>the ſonne of Dauid.</hi> But certainly, I am of this mind, that this woman took theſe ſtiles otherwiſe than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common multitude: The very eye of her ſoule was opened, to ſee Ieſus Chriſt to be the Lord, &amp; to bee the Sonne of God manifeſted in the fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I will not attribute vnto her a diſtinct &amp; clear knowledge of both His natures in one perſon, and of His offices.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, ye ſee two grounds of her peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt is a Lordſhip, and Power, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Him, of whom ſhe ſought mercy. The next is, a Pitie, a Mercy in Him of whome ſhee ſought mercy. She ſought mercy at a mèrcifull face, grace at a gracious face. Looke that thy prayer bee well grounded on the LORD. When thou openeſt thy
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16627:140"/>
mouth to ſeeke mercy at that LORD, looke that thou acknewledge that there is a power in that Lord to giue thee euery thing that thou ſtandeſt in need of: and chiefely, looke that thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there is an infinit paſſing mercy in that Lord, ſurmounting all thy ſinnes, and then ſhalt thou pray from the heart, with confidence and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: otherwiſe thou mayeſt well ſeeke mercie from the teeth outwarde, but neuer with thine heart. Then ſhee letteth Him ſee a good cauſe wherefore ſhe ſought mercy: Lord, I haue need of a Phiſition, for I am ſicke. What ſickneſſe is ſorer to a poore body, than this, to bee rent both in ſoule and body with a deuil? <hi>Lord, my</hi> poore <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is tormented with a deuill:</hi> As in thy prayer thou muſt haue a ſight of the infinit power of thy God, of the mercy of thy God, ſo ſcorn Him not with a ſenſeleſſe heart: No, if thou getteſt not a ſenſe &amp; feeling of thy miſery, of thy trouble, &amp; vexation in thine heart, call not vpon the Name of the Lord. It is true indeed, the Lord ſeeth and knoweth thy miſery, as well as thy ſelfe, albeit thou ſpeake not a word vnto Him of thy miſery: yet for all that, the Lord taketh pleaſure to heare thy miſery out of thine owne mouth: He will not only haue thee to feele and grone in thine heart for it, but he will haue thee to vtter it vnto Him with thy tongue alſo, if oportunity ſerue: He wil haue thee to make it knowne vnto Him, as if Hee knew it not He will haue thee to bring vp thy miſery from the ground
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16627:141"/>
of thine heart, &amp; as thou feeleſt it in the ſadneſſe of thine heart, ſo to vtter it in thy voyce: for the Lord delighteth to heare miſerable bodies ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their miſerie.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forward. When shee hath made her petition, ſee the meeting: the text ſaith, At the firſt Hee anſwered her not a vvord, but goeth forward vvith the Diſciples, and letteth her follow on cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O Lord, haue mercie vpon me:</hi> not once nor twiſe, but the crie goeth neuer out of her head. This is wonderfull: Hee that preuented her vvith grace, and gaue her grace to ſeeke him, vvill not make her one vvorde anſwere, but goeth his vvaye, and vvill not ſpeake vnto her: Yea, thou vvilt find, that he, who preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted thee vvith grace, &amp; ſought thee, ere euer thou ſoughteſt him, &amp; gaue thee grace to crie and pray, <hi>Haue mercie, O God,</hi> yet he vvill ſeeme to miſ-knowe thee, and make thee none anſwere. Thou vvilt crie in ſickneſſe, <hi>Mercie,</hi> but vvilt thou alwayes find mercy? No, no, thou vvilt cry in other troubles, <hi>Mercie,</hi> and his Spirite no queſtion vvill interceade for thee, and yet for a time hee vvill make thee none anſwere. What meaneth this? why doeth he ſo? Now vvhen he hath giuen thee grace to crie for mercy, a thirſt &amp; an hunger for grace, <hi>(Bleſſed are they that hunger &amp; thirſt)</hi> vvhen he hath giuen thee this firſt grace, hee vvill let thee crie a great vvhile to trie thy conſtancie. We neuer get a ſpirituall grace in this life, but vvith the grace vve get alwayes a tryall: and vvhen he giueth vs grace
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16627:141"/>
to crie: hee vvill trie if vvee vvill crie on. And to ſpeake the trueth, Brethren, All our life heere, is but a tryall of the graces of GOD, vvhich hee hath giuen vs. Wee gette not our heauen heere, but a faith to looke a farre of vnto it, an hunger, a thirſt, a deſire of it, and vvith our thirſt a tryall of our Faith, a tryall of our Hope, of our deſire, to ſee if vvee vvill ſtand in it. And then ſaieth <hi>Peter,</hi> in the life to come, the tryall of thy faith, and hope, and patience, beeing ended, What ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, Praiſe, and honour, and glorie, vvhen IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS ſhall appeare, 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 7.</hi> Thou ſhalt bee filled vvith ſaciety and fulneſſe of joye, thine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt ſhall bee ſatisfied as ſoone as euer thou ſeeſt thy Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed. The Diſciples that followed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, they are troubled vvith the cry of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, &amp; ſay to the Lord. <hi>Either giue her one anſwere or other, and let her goe her way.</hi> Surely I thinke this ſute of the diſciples was not ſo much for anie deſire they had that he ſhould helpe her, as to be quite of her crying, becauſe they vvere deafned vvith her. So then the Papiſtes neede not vpon this, to ground their interceſſion of the Sainctes in heauen, for vs that remaine heere on earth: for this ground is as vveake as their doctrine of interceſſion is: and ſhe directeth not her ſpeach to the Apoſtles heere, to PETER, IAMES, or IOHN, that they ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cead for her, but to the Lord himſelf, ſhe ſpeaketh to none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſhe paſſeth &amp; ſpeakes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16627:142"/>
immediately: So ſhould wee leaue all the Saincter, and with confidence goe to the Lord Himſelfe. The Diſciples are deafned and troubled with her crying: the Lord Himſelfe letteth her crie on: and this is a token that Hee is not wearied with her crying Well then, thou findeſt a comfort heere, when thou cryeſt night and day, Hee neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with thee: He ſaith not, thou troubleſt me, al thy cryes ſighes, and ſobbes, are pleaſant to Him. Men will bee weary ſometimes with thy crying, as wee reade, that vnjuſt Iudge was importuned by the juſt ſute of the poore woman, and diſpatcheth her away, and ſaith, thou troubleſt and irkeſt mee night and day, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. But the true righteous Iudge is neuer wearied with thee, when He letteth thee cry out, He wil not anſwere with a grudge, as the Iudge did, but chearfully. The Lord that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a chearfull giuer, He Himſelfe giueth cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. What meaneth that joye that the faithfull finde in their heartes, accompanying the benefite that commeth from Him, but that the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth His benefites chearefully? for if the LORD gaue thee them not chearfully, but in anger and wrath, and threwe them to thee as to a reprobate, thou wouldeſt neuer haue joye in the receiuing of them. There is not ſuch a thing, as a reprobate can haue joy in the giuer, or euer haue his mouth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with true thankeſgiuing to the Lord to ſay once, I thanke thee: Why? Becauſe the Lord giueth him not His benefites in loue, but in anger. So this is a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16627:142"/>
ſure token when thou findeſt joye in thine heart, and a contentation in thy prayer, and a purpoſe to be thankfull, that the Lord giueth thee cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and heareth thee joyfully. And if thou canſt get but a joyfull looke of thy God, thou mayſt be aſſured that it proceedeth of mercy. When Hee looketh ſo vnto thee, Hee doeth not as earthly kings, or any earthly creature vſe to doe, for they can keepe a faire countenance, and yet haue little good will in their heartes. Well, the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crieth, &amp; the diſciples cry: The Lord muſt anſwere once, but Hee maketh an anſwere little to her content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> ſaieth He, <hi>but vnto the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> What haue I to doe with that poore woman? ſhee is not one of My ſheepe, ſhe is of a curſed generation of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ordained to deſtruction and wrath: In a word, He debarreth her from grace, Hee cloaſeth the gates of Heauen vpon her teeth: for when He ſaith, Hee is not ſent to her He ſhutteth her out of Heauen. Wee ought to marke this well, for we are <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that is to ſay. <hi>Gentiles:</hi> It is true indeed, the Lord comming down from the Heauen, &amp; manifeſting Himſelfe in the fleſh. He had His commiſsion firſt &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not to <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor ENGLAND, nor <hi>Germanie,</hi> nor <hi>France,</hi> chiefely and principally: as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Oh! that thou couldeſt ſee the day of thy viſitation! Luke</hi> 19. 41. Hee was ſent with commiſsion to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but in caſe of the contumacie &amp; rebellion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16627:143"/>
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid vnto him, Goe thy vvay vnto mine owne people, vvhome I haue choſen from among all the Nations of the earth, and ſee if thou canſt vvinne them, goe no further. And if the <hi>Iewes</hi> had not bene rebellious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, vve had neuer gotten mercie and grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Looke <hi>Roman.</hi> 11. 11.

So Chriſt, ſending out his Diſciples to preach, biddeth them go, not vnto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or vnto the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> their next neighbours, <hi>but vnto the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And vvee learne in the example of this vvoman that our entrie to grace, and to heauen, vvas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard and difficill: And as our entrie to grace vvas hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo if vvee fall from grace, our re-entrie to grace ſhall bee farre harder: And if thou fall

once from grace, hardly ſhalt thou get grace againe. A <hi>Gentile</hi> that falleth once from grace, and treadeth vnder his feete the blood of Ieſus, ſhall neuer bee renewed with grace againe. And I ſay to thee, O <hi>Scotland,</hi> if thou falleſt from grace, looke neuer for grace againe. Looke to the cities amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that fell from grace, looke <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> looke <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> looke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Galathians,</hi> &amp;c. got they euer grace again? No: ſo if <hi>Scotland</hi> fall from grace, it will bee a wonder if euer it get grace againe. The wrath of God ſhall bee powred foorth vpon euery one, from the greateſt to the ſmalleſt: for if He receiued not the <hi>Iewes</hi> (His owne people) into grace, after that they were once fallen from it, ſhal He take thee vp againe, a <hi>Gentile,</hi> a vile dog, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them? And yet our men in this countrey care not to caſt themſelues, and their whole land, into Hell, and into euerlaſting abjection from grace, without all hope of recouery. So this is an harde anſwere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhee findeth no grace at all. They that follow Ieſus Chriſt, and ſeeke for grace, will finde in their way a ſore tryall: men thinke that Heauen is but a common benefit, &amp; that it is eaſie to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come thither: but albeit thou be a king, an Emperour, or Monarch, thou wilt find an hard entry therein. Will thy kingdome or thy lordſhip bring thee to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? No, if thou ſleep on in careles ſecurity, thou ſhalt neuer ſo heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So if there were no more but this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this <hi>Gentiliſh</hi> woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it teaches vs, that it is hard to win to heauen, &amp; that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16627:144"/>
the gates of Heauen at the firſt ſhall be ſhut vpon our teeth. What is the cauſe of this? Thou art fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Chriſt, and from grace, from Heauen, and from the joye of Heauen, a thouſand times more than the naturall earth is from the naturall Heauen. Thou art a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> come of a curſed generation. What adoe hath a <hi>Canaanite</hi> with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? ſo vnworthie a thing, with ſo worthy a thing? The Lord, before He opened the gates of Heauen vnto her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee woulde let her vnderſtand, that ſhee had nothing to doe with Heauen. And I ſay vnto thee, that the Lord, ere euer Hee giue thee grace, Hee will haue thee knowing by tentations and tryalles, that thou art a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> deſcended of a curſed and reprobate generation, and vnworthie that euer thou ſhouldeſt ſee Heauen, or haue a do with Heauen: And if Hee bring thee not to this sight and this feare, I giue thee thy dome, thou ſhalt never ſee Heauen.</p>
            <p>Nowe marke, Hee hath cloaſed the doores of Heauen vpon her: And certainely, this anſwere might haue cauſed her to haue gone awaye with ſhame and confuſion. But for all this tentation, ſhe continueth ſtill, ſhe crieth ſtill, and hopeth for mercie: holde vpon mercy, hope ſtill, belieue on ſtill and that hope ſhal neuer make thee aſhamed. Shee hath cryed for mercie, the gates of Heauen are ſhut againſt her: What doeth ſhee? Goeth ſhe her way? No, no, ſhee tarieth ſtill, and knocketh. And if thou kneweſt what Heauen were, and what
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16627:144"/>
Hell were, thou wouldeſt bee loath to leaue Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Oh! the tormentes that remaine for them that fall into Hell! So ſhee knocketh, and falleth downe vpon her face, and adoreth, and ſaieth, <hi>O Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on mee.</hi> This adoring was not onely for the caſting the deuill out of her daughter: No, no, ſhe ſought euerlaſting life at the handes of the Lord, &amp; that healing of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was an earneſt-pennie of that Life. This was the mind of the woman no queſtion. It is ſaide in the Scripture, <hi>Seeke, and yee ſhall find: aske, and yee ſhall receiue: knocke, and it ſhall be opened vnto you. Mat.</hi> 7. 7. If the ſeeking faile thee, yet tarie ſtill and knocke. And if it had not bene the Lords will that a ſinner (when he findeth heauen gates cloſed vpon him) ſhould tary ſtil &amp; knock, would he haue bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him knock? It were a preſumptuous thing for a begger to knocke at one of our doores: but ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath expreſſely commanded thee to knocke, then knocke on boldly. And if thou goe away with the firſt anſwere, or the firſt nay-ſaying thou waſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer truely hungrie nor thirſtie: And it is a token that thou counteſt little of the grace of GOD. If thou kneweſt howe precious a thing the grace of God &amp; Ieſus Chriſt were, and what Heauen were, and what Hell were, thou wouldeſt neuer ceaſe knocking day nor night all the dayes of thy life: for if thou goe away proudly, and tarieſt not vpon Gods anſwere, but ſpeake preſumptuouſly, &amp; ſay, If He will not giue mee grace, let Him holde it to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16627:145"/>
Himſelfe, as blaſphemous men will ſay: then Hee will ſhoote thee into Hell: for if thou wert a king of all the worlde, thou ſhalt neuer get thine head in at Heauen gates, except thou knocke. Lord, if the world knew how hard a thing it is to get entry there! men think that they will come eaſily &amp; ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to Heauen, albeit they take their pleaſure &amp; paſtime: but they deceiue themſelues, there muſt bee much ſtriuing and fighting ere they get Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Before that Heauen could be opened, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed Ieſus Chriſt to ſhed His precious blood.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren ye may ſay to me, Alas, who can knocke? who is able to come there? No, thou haſt no power once to lift vp thine hand to knocke at that gate, except that the Lord put out His hand, &amp; hold thee vp, euen in the meane time when Hee is holding thee backe, ſo wonderfull is the Lordes working with His owne, He will be holding them abacke with the one hand, and He will be pulling them in to Him as faſt with the other hand, when He will be diſſwading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will perſwade, when He forbiddeth to approach vnto Him, hee inwardly allureth m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n to come vnto Him. Nowe, will yee heare the Lordes anſwere? If the firſt anſwere was hard, this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hard and rough: for with an angry countenance no doubt He anſwereth, <hi>It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> ſaieth Hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>to take the childrens bread, and to cast it vnto dogges.</hi> It is euen as much as if Hee had taken her by the ſhoulders, and thruſt her out: firſt Hee ſaieth, Thou art but a dogge, a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16627:145"/>
that thou ſeekeſt is a precious thing, the bread of life, this appertaineth onely to the children of GOD: Shall I take that and giue it vnto a dog? As if Hee had ſaide, Goe thy waye, dogge, thou ſhalt not get ſuch a precious benefite as thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt.</p>
            <p>Then we ſee here, becauſe ſhe was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hee calleth her a dogge. Suppoſe thou bee a King (I pray thee be not too proude in thine own conceit) and yet a <hi>Gentile,</hi> Ergo, by nature, a dogge. He will caſt a Kingdome, an Empire, a Monarchie to a man, as one will caſt a bone into the mouth of a dogge, but all is nothing in reſpect of one droppe of grace, and the hope of the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
            <p>Albeit thou bee a begger, and yet getteſt but one droppe of grace through IESVS CHRIST, anie hope of the Kingdome of Heauen, anie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of regeneration, then thou haſt gotten a greater grace, a more precious thing, than <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that got all the worlde. There is no compariſon betwixt the meaneſt ſpirituall &amp; heauenly gift, &amp; betwixt the greateſt temporall and earthly thing.</p>
            <p>Nowe I note againe the hardneſſe to winne to the Kingdome of Heauen. Would yee not thinke it a marueilous thing to turne a dogge into the Sonne of God? It is as great a wonder to ſee a <hi>Gentile</hi> to be called to Heauen as to make dogges and ſtones the Sonnes of God Nowe know, that before thou getteſt acceſſe to Heauen, although
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16627:146"/>
thou wert a king, thou muſt bee humbled in thine owne conceite, thou muſt know thine owne eſtate and condition, thou muſt thinke thy ſelfe as vile and contemptible as a verie dogge by nature, as this woman was brought to ſaye: otherwiſe, thou ſhalt neuer get heauen.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, if the entrie to the Kingdome of heauen be ſo harde, if thou like a dogge returne to thy vomite, or as a ſow to the puddle, (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaieth, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.) after thou art waſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now heare the poore womans anſwere: ſhe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all, It is verie true, thou ſayeſt, I am but a dog, a vile and an vnworthie wretch, and that bread of heauen is a precious thing, I am not worthie that it ſhould bee caſten vnto mee: <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaieth ſhee) <hi>the whelpes doe eate of the crummes which fall from their maiſters table:</hi> If thou wilt not ſhew mee this grace, to eate bread with the children, yet let me eate the paringes and crummes vnder the table. Ere euer the Lord beſtow grace and eternall life vpon thee, hee will haue thee to accompt thy ſelfe vnworthie of anie grace: yea, hee will haue thee to accompt as vilely of thy ſelfe as of a dog, albeit thou hadſt neuer ſo many great prerogatiues otherwayes in the worlde: ere thou get that life, thy conſcience will accuſe thee to bee vnworthie of ſuch a life, and ſuch a joye as the LORD ordained for his owne. Shee ſcipped before, nowe shee thrumbleth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16627:146"/>
and thruſteth in at the gates of heauen, and goeth like a violent woman: not indeede preaſſing like a ſturdie begger, to be in whether the Lord would or not: but by humilitie, and acknowledging of her owne vnworthineſſe, in all ſubmiſſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as it were, creeping like a ſillie whelpe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the table: that is the violence that is done to the Kingdome of heauen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 12. Shee taketh vp heauen by violence, in all ſubmiſſion and humilitie. And if thou bee once but a whelpe vnder the table of GOD, in the houſe of GOD, to gather vp the crummes of that plentifull table, thou art called to a greater honour, than if thou were made King of all the worlde. <hi>I had rather bee a doore-keeper in the houſe of GOD, than to bee king of all the worlde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, when shee is thronging in, hee is loath to put her out againe: No, hee ſaieth, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, bee it vnto thee as thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> thy faith hath wonne the victorie. From whence had this poore woman all this perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and this continuance, and this conſtancie, but from him? and yet hee ſtandeth wondering at his owne graces. The LORD, (beholde his doing) when hee hath giuen thee grace and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, when thou commeſt to heauen, he will wonder at thee: and there is the ende of all thy perſeuerance, a faire crowne of glorie. And what more doeth hee? That ſame moment, that force that was in the worde, that proceeded out of the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Text (welbeloued in the Lord Ieſus) containeth a notable Hiſtorie, of the conuerſion of a penitent ſinner, a ſinfull woman, whom the LORD firſt called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by His Spirit, &amp; to whom after outwardly by His owne voyce He giueth aſſurance of the remiſſion of her ſinnes: And wee haue firſt ſet downe the occaſion that the Lord offereth to this ſinfull woman to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16627:148"/>
metee with Him, that ſhe may receiue mercie and forgiueneſſe of her ſinnes: Of very purpoſe He ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth Himſelfe in her way, and into theſe partes where the woman was, and yeeldeth to dine in the houſe of a <hi>Phariſie,</hi> where ſhee might haue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and oportunitie to meete with Him: This occaſion being offered vnto her, being partly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a feeling of her owne miſerie, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preuented with the Spirite of Ieſus alluring her, ſhe letteth it not ſlippe, but ſhee commeth to the houſe, where the Lord was, and ſhee commeth not emptie handed, but ſhee bringeth with her a boxe of precious ſweete ſmelling ointment, and comming to the houſe where the LORD was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at table, looke what ſhee doeth, ſhee entreth not in peartly and boldly, neither commeth ſhee before His face, being aſhamed of her own ſinnes: ſhe was aſhamed that theſe eyes, theſe all-ſeeing eyes of the LORD, which pierce into the ſoule of man, ſhould ſee her: <hi>So ſhe ſtandeth</hi> (ſaieth the Text) <hi>behinde His backe,</hi> and then ſhee falleth downe at His feete.</p>
            <p>The ſight of thy ſinne, as it will worke ſhame of face, when the relicts of nature beginneth to challenge it, when it ſtriueth to enter into the ſoule, ſo that ſcarcely thou dareſt looke a man in the face, let be the Lord, who is the reuenger of it: Euen ſo, when it once pleaſeth the Lord to waken the conſcience, it will worke in thee a wonderfull humilitie: ſo that thou wilt ſtoupe, and caſt thy
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16627:149"/>
ſelfe downe vnder the feete of thy GOD. The ſtiffeneſſe that yee ſee in men, who bowe not their bodies &amp; knees vnto the Lord, proceedeth of the want of that ſight of ſinne and corruption within them. If theſe men, who fling their heads in the aire, (&amp; make their boaſts of their euill deeds) ſaw their ſins, they would bee aſhamed of themſelues, &amp; humble themſelues in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duſt. When ſhe is fallen downe, ſhe weepeth. The ſight of ſin will make thee to weepe &amp; mourne. Thou laugheſt now, &amp; plaieſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wanton, becauſe there is a vaile caſten ouer thine eye, that blindeth thee ſo that thou canſt not ſee ſin the own colour yea, it couereth thy ſelf from thee: but if once thou ſaw ſinne &amp; thy ſelfe well, it would make thee to weep &amp; lament bitterly. Wel, ſhe leaueth not of yet, but being drawne and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ſenſe of His preuenting mercy, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> came from Him, ſhe draweth near<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> vnto Him. If ſhe had not felt that loue that came from Him, ſhee durſt neuer haue come neare Him. As a male-factor hath no pleaſure to beholde the countenance of the Iudge, but his eye and countenance is terrible to Him: Euen ſo, the Lord is fearefull and terrible to them that feele not that loue that proceedeth from Him.</p>
            <p>It is the ſenſe of the loue that allureth ſinners to come to God, As <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3. <hi>If thou ſtraitlie markest iniquitie, no fleſh can ſtand: but mercie is with thee, that thou mayest bee feared.</hi> The teares that the diſpleaſure for ſin expreſſeth out of her,

                  </gap>aſheth his feet with them,</hi> &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>taketh the haire of her head, and dryeth them therewith.</hi> Haddeſt thou once a ſenſe of that ſweete mercy in Ieſus Chriſt, were that loue once ſpred abroade into thine heart by His H. Spirit, as th' Apoſtle ſpeaketh, O, how thou wouldeſt loue Him, &amp; be carefull to ſerue &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Him! This want of loue towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Ieſus argueth plainely, that thou haſt not felt that loue of His towardes thee: For if once thou hadſt felt how well Hee loueth thee, who ſhed His precious blood for thee: then it is a faire matter to thee to ſheede teares for Him, that ſhedde His blood for thee: And if thou once felt that loue, nowe all the teares, and all the moyſture in thy body, yea, thy very ſoule thou wouldeſt bee glad to poure it out for Him, and conſecrate thy life vnto His ſeruice: but liuing againſt Him, in doing all kinde of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in deſpite of Him, thou teſtifieſt plainely, that thou haſt neuer found the vertue of His blood.</p>
            <p>Looke what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>The loue of God conſtraineth mee:</hi> that is, bindeth vp my ſoule, and all the powers and faculties thereof, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyeth my whole ſenſes, that I am rauiſhed from all thinges in the worlde, to get mine heart and affections fixed vpon Him: Why? ſaieth hee, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He loued me ſo well, that Hee hath died for me: and therefore, I will conſecrate my life to him, who hath purchaſed euerlaſting life for me. And therefore, whoſoeuer hath not a purpoſe to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16627:150"/>
poure out his life for Ieſus Chriſt, and hath not a free heart towards Him in ſome meaſure, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue any ſure argument that Chriſt hath died for him. And if thou haue not that aſſurance, woe is thee, that euer thou tookeſt life! it had beene better thou hadſt beene made a ſtocke or a ſtone, if thou findeſt not that Chriſt died for thee.</p>
            <p>But what further did this ſillie woman? Shee ceaſeth not here, but is continually <hi>kiſsing the feete of the Lord.</hi> Ye who before delited in kiſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaue your harlots, and from this woman learne to kiſſe the LORD, or elſe thou, and thy vile mouth, ſhalt burne in Hell. Kiſſe the feete of the LORD, who hath ſhedde His blood for thee: for ſo oft as thou kiſſeſt the feete of the Lord, thou ſhalt finde that thou ſuckeſt grace out of Him. And this woman, who was before a vile harlot, now only ſhe taketh pleaſure to kiſſe the Lord. And what did this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more? It is ſaid, when ſhee had beſtowed her body vpon Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhee taketh that <hi>boxe of coſtlie oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that ſhee had prepared for Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and anointed his feete therewith.</hi> Beſtowe thy ſelfe firſt vpon the Lord, and beſtowe thy body vpon Him and His ſeruice, and ſay to Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nowe Lord I giue thee, and I beſtow vpon thee, mine heart, my ſoule, my body &amp; all the members therof, keepe thouthem in holineſſe, that they may bee conſecrate to thee. Then when thou haſt beſtowed firſt thine heart and thy ſelfe vpon Him, it will be none hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to beſtowe thy goods, when His glory requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16627:150"/>
And certainly, when men are ſo nigard in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oore members, it is a ſure argument, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euer beſtowed their heart vpon Him. Many vain men and women will ſaye, And if Chriſt were in the worlde, for the loue I carie vnto Him, I would followe Him, ſerue Him, imploye my body, and all that I haue in His ſeruice, and to His glorie: but if thou wilt not beſtowe thy goods vpon the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vpon His ſeruants, and vpon theſe who carie His image, if Chriſt Himſelfe were in the worlde, thou wouldeſt beſtowe nothing vpon Him: for if once thou were ſenſible of that liberality that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus offereth vnto His owne, thou wouldeſt loue Him ſo well, that thou wouldeſt ſhewe thy ſelfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall to theſe who cary His image: thou wouldeſt giue all that thou haſt for His cauſe, who is onelie able to make thee rich.</p>
            <p>Now to goe forwarde in the Hiſtorie. Whileſt ſhee is thus exerciſed in weeping, in waſhing the Lordes feete with her teares, in drying them with her haire, in anointing them with precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what doeth the Lord? what is His beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? All this time the LORD ſpeaketh neuer a worde vnto her: all this time while ſhee findeth ſo great grace and mercie in Him, Hee turneth not once His face vnto her. If thou getteſt once the Lordes backe neare vnto thee, if thou getteſt leaue to kiſſe His feete, howbeit thou getteſt not His
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16627:151"/>
face at the firſt, nor His countenance at the entrie, yet out of Him thou ſhalt ſucke grace and mercie vnſpeakeable. It is a marueilous thing to ſee how a ſinner will get grace. When the Lord will ſeeme to turne His backe vpon thee, yet follow thou on and leaue Him not, till He turne His face toward thee: and I aſſure thee thou ſhalt get His face at the laſt. Therefore, neuer depart from Him, but ſticke by His backe and His feete, and certainly in the ende thou ſhalt get that ſight of that joyfull countenance that ſhall compleate thy joy.</p>

Yee ſee now, Brethren, how diſdainfullie he thinketh of her, and howe hee contemneth her in his heart. A <hi>Phariſie</hi> that is an hypocrite, that wil counterfeite outwardly a kind of holineſſe: ſee how he will diſdain a poore ſinner, that is an open ſinner in the ſight of the world: An hypocrite is a foule ſinner, and he will doe ſuch things in ſecrete,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16627:151"/>
that it is a ſhame to ſpeake of, becauſe his ſinne is cloaked from the ſight of the world, and from his owne eyes: when hee beholdeth another ſinner, againe, that ſinneth openly in the ſight of the world, how diſdainfully will hee count and ſpeake of the open ſinner? and will ſpitte at him: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereſt cenſurer that euer was, is an hypocrite: and then he will ſtand vp, admiring of himſelf, and his coloured righteouſneſſe, and ſaye, I thanke God, I am not like other men: And what is the cauſe of this? The Lord ſaieth, The hypocrite is nothing but a whited tombe, a painted graue, that within is full of dead mens bones, ſtinke and filthineſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 27. And yet that cloake of hypocriſie beeing ſpred ouer the heart, the hypocrite ſeeth not that filthineſſe that is in his owne heart: and that hypocrite that thinketh to beguile all the world, chiefely he beguileth himſelfe. And if thou ſaweſt that ſeede of all miſchei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Marke, Brethren: Who euer ſeeth not that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie that is within themſelues, of neceſsitie they neuer ſaw that mercy that is in Ieſus Chriſt: Theſe two goe together of neceſsitie, Whoſoeuer ſeeth not himſelfe, is ignorant of Chriſt, and would not buy the mercy of Chriſt for one penny, hee careth not for Chriſts kindneſſe, hee counteth grace and mercy all but vanity.

And therfore, as thou wouldeſt not bee culpable of ſuch ſcorning, and wouldeſt not be inuolued in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> judgement that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth that ſcornfull number, ſeeke I beſeech thee, to get theſe two ſighs, &amp; ſay, Lord, I am but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable body, &amp; am vnworthy to look vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: &amp; then get a ſenſe of the mercy of the Lord: and then thou ſhalt bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o farre from ſcorning grace in thine heart, that thou ſhalt bee faine to creep in with all humility to get a part &amp; portion of the grace that is ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phariſie</hi> yet hath not bene one of the worſt of them, hee was not an open blaſphemer, but an hypocrite, I doubt not, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath had mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on him: but what, how, and when his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath bene, the Lord knoweth.</p>
            <p>Now I go forward to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part of the Lord: firſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Phariſie,</hi> and then toward the poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The <hi>Phariſie</hi> conceiued not this ſo quietlie &amp; ſecretly within his owne heart, but the Lord, the ſearcher of the heart, that made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, draweth it to light, and ſaith, <hi>Simon, I haue ſomewhat to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee,</hi> I know what thou thinkeſt well enough, no man needeth to tell me thine heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; therefore I will ſpeake ſomthing vnto thee: <hi>Simon</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Lord, ſaye on.</hi> Brethren, ſtriue to preſent holie thoughts before GOD: thinke it not enough to keepe thine hand holie, thy tongue from blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but keepe an holy heart vnto the LORD: begin not to play the counterfeit, to ſpeak holily,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16627:153"/>
and to haue a faire ſhewe outwardly, and then to keepe a foule heart: and if an euill thought eſcape thee (as who will not haue a thouſand euill thoughts?) if a blaſphemie againſt GOD eſcape thee, (as who blaſphemeth not God in their heart as well as the <hi>Phariſie?</hi>) bee ſorrowfull for it, away with it, let it not tarie, but ſay as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>It is not I, that doeth it, but the corruption of my nature which remaineth within mee.</hi> Renounce that foule birth, and take it neuer vnto thee: and this is that battell which we ſhould haue night &amp; day, to get that vile canker and corruption which vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it ſelfe ſo violently againſt that inuiolable Majeſtie, repreſſed and put away.</p>
            <p>Now when He hath thus ſpoken, He beginneth to let <hi>Simon</hi> ſee, that that ſame very woman, of whom hee counted ſo diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ainfully, was not ſo vile a woman as he thought: as though He would ſay, <hi>Simon,</hi> thou thinkeſt there is not ſo vile a ſinner in the world, as ſhe is: but I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y vnto thee, ſhee is not ſo ſinfull, I haue cleanſed her I haue giuen her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all her ſinnes: (Who dare call a ſinner foule, that the Lord hath called cleane?) dareſt thou call a penitent ſinner foule, who hath waſhen my feere with teares, and repenteth vnfainedly? Then ſubſuming He ſaith, This woman repenteth vnfainedly, and teſtifieth her repentance in louing me ſo exceedingly: Therefore He concludeth, All her ſinnes are forgiuen her: Therefore <hi>Simon,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine her not, no more than I doe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:16627:153"/>But to conſider more narrowly, firſt the ground of the propoſition: then the aſſumption: laſt, that joyfull concluſion. The ground of his reaſon is this, To whome a great debt is forgiuen, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will loue exceedingly. To make vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this the better, Hee bringeth in a familiar example, a parable, <hi>There was a certaine lender, who had two debters: the one ought fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie: And when they had nothing to pay, hee forgaue them both: Which of them, therefore, tell mee, will loue him most? Hee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Simon, to whome hee forgaue most.</hi> Well, ſaieth the Lord, then I take this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition out of thy mouth, <hi>Hee to whome much is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he loueth exceedinglie,</hi> he loueth much: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if thou haue no ſenſe of debt, if thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt in thine owne conceite, that thou oweſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I ſaye to thee, Thou loueſt not God, thou haſt no loue towards Him. A wanton ſinner, that feales not the burthen of ſinne, hee hath no more loue to God, nor to Chriſt, than a dogge hath: fie on thee dogge! fie on thee, that haſt not a ſenſe of ſinne: for thou haſt no loue to God. Next againe, ſuppoſe thou haue a ſenſe of ſinne, &amp; feeleſt ſome burthen therof, yet if thou but thinkeſt that thou haſt a pennie in thy purſe to paye GOD for thy debt, thou wilt neuer loue thy God. And I ſaye to thee. I could neuer thinke in mine heart, that a Papiſt, a vaine lowne, who will boaſt of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, who glorieth in his owne workes, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hee can pay God for his redemption: I ſaye,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16627:154"/>
I could neuer be perſwaded that ſuch a one could loue the Lord. Next, except with the ſenſe of thy debt, thou find alſo a free remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all thy debt, alas, thou canſt haue no loue to GOD: feele thy ſinne, and thy pouerty, as much as thou wilt, if thou findeſt not a free remiſſion and pardon of all thy debt, thou wilt neuer loue Him, but He is a terror vnto thee ſo oft as thou thinkeſt of Him, and thou wouldeſt flee out of the world to eſcape His handes. Then thirdly, thou that feeleſt thy debt, and then feeleſt thine owne pouertie, that thou haſt not one pennie to giue Him: (ſuppoſe thou bee a King, all thy Kingdome will not ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thy ſoule: n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, ſell Heauen and the earth and all, they will not ranſom the ſoule of one creature, they will not fill vp one penny of the ſumme to ranſome the ſoule of one ſinner) and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſenſe of the pouertie, ſeeleth a free remiſſion, and heareth the Lord ſay, I forgiue thee all, I will haue none of thy ſiluer: but I forgiue thee all in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of my deare Sonne the Lord Ieſus: (there is the ranſome and I adjudge thee to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that ſeekeſt any other ranſome) then thou wilt loue the Lord exceedingly. Theſe three things being felt, firſt with grones and ſobbes feeling the debt and burthen: Next, thy pouerty, and vnhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to pay: and laſt, a free remiſſion and disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening, that ſinner would beſtowe all his goods, and land, and life, and all that hee hath for the loue that hee beareth to the LORD IESVS:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16627:154"/>
thine heart will be ſweetly looſed with a loue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. Who is able to expreſſe that loue and that vnſpeakeable joye, that will bee in the heart of a ſinner, that feeleth the remiſſion of his ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Brethren, There is yet more than this in the compariſon: Hee to whome little is forgiuen, hee will loue little: and hee to whome much is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, will loue much. Hee or ſhee that will come in, and confeſſe their ſinnes, but will in the meane time extenuate it, and ſaye, it is but a little ſinne, it is but a veniall ſinne, and manie one hath done twiſe as much: that bodie, I ſaye, that will exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate ſinne, although it were but an euill thought againſt that inuiolable Majeſtie, I knowe not whether ſuch an one hath gotten remiſſion of their ſinnes or not: and ſuppoſing they haue gotten remiſsion of it, yet it will bee but a little loue that they will haue vnto the Lord.</p>
            <p>But hee or ſhee that will come in, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greadge their ſinne, though it were but a thought againſt that Majeſtie, for thou art neuer able to aggreadge it enough, and if thou find a remiſsion of thy ſinne, then no man can thinke how heartily that bodie will loue the LORD: for if once thou getteſt grace to repent, and to loue GOD, thou mayeſt bee aſſured, that thy ſinnes, though they were neuer ſo great, neuer ſo weighty, and many in number, ſhall neuer hinder thee of grace and mercie. And then againe I ſay to thee, the greateſt ſinner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> counteth moſt of their ſins, once feeling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:16627:155"/>
remiſſion of their ſinnes, euer the greater louer. <hi>Paul,</hi> an oppreſſor, a perſecuter, blaſphemer, a wrongfull man, once feeling the loue of the Lord, forgiuing him, O! how exceedingly loued he the Lord! A penitent ſinner ſhall farre ſurpaſſe them in loue that haue not ſinned halſe ſo much: the world ſhall admire at him for his loue, he ſhall be a miracle to all them that beholde him.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed forward. The <hi>Phariſie</hi> can judge well enough of this generall, that hee that hath moſt forgiuen him, loueth moſt, and that loue is the effect of remiſſion of ſinnes: (Well art thou that loueſt the Lord, for be aſſured that the Lord loueth thee, and hath forgiuen thee thy ſinnes:) But when it commeth to the aſſumption, that that poore woman, that ſinful woman, loued the Lord, there hee erreth. Beholde, Brethren, the light of nature, and the blindneſſe of nature: by nature wee will know the generall well enough: ſuppoſe thou haddeſt no more but that light of nature, thou wilt confeſſe that a murtherer ſhould die the death: But if thou come to the particular, O! but thou art a murtherer, thou haſt a bloodie heart, a bloodie hand, and thou art all bloodie: Will anie man ſuffer that? No, no, and therefore he will hold off this concluſion, Therefore thou ſhouldeſt die the death, and be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the place of execution, and there loſe thine head. And would to God that our bloodie men (whether they bee Noblemen, lordes, Earles, Barons, or others) had bene headed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:16627:155"/>
long ſince: for it is a maruell that plague ſollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not after plague continually, till this land bee purged of this blood that cryeth continually in the ſtreetes. So the <hi>Phariſie</hi> could not belieue the particular, that euer the poore ſinner coulde get mercie, hee was ſo hard a cenſurer of the poore woman. But I count it nothing worth, to judge vprightly in generall, except alſo thou judge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in particular. The Iudges of the Land they will judge vprightly in generall: but come to the particular, to kinsfolkes, friendes, and alliances, this man, or that man with his bud, O, there there the judgement is peruerted. Well is the Iudge that judgeth vprightly in particular: for a Turke may judge vprightly in generall: and woe is thee that judgeſt not vprightly in particular.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the other part of the reaſon, The Lord turneth Him to the poore woman, and the more the <hi>Phariſie</hi> findeth fault with the Lord, the more the Lord turneth Him toward her, and ſaieth, I ſay to thee, <hi>Simon,</hi> that this woman loueth mee more a thouſand times, than euer thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. If thou withholdeſt grace from a ſinner, then in deſpite of thy teeth, the Lord will heape grace vpon him. The aſſumption is this, This woman lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me exceedingly: then the concluſion will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the owne roome. Therefore this woman certainly hath all her ſinnes forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. Then He declareth the aſſumption by waye of compariſon with the <hi>Phariſie, Thou calledst me to dinner,</hi> ſaith hee,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16627:156"/>
but this woman loued me better than thou doeſt. <hi>I entered into thine houſe, and thou gaueſt mee no water to my feat,</hi> after the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the countrey: <hi>but ſhe hath waſhed my feet with teares:</hi> looke if this be a token of loue: then againe, <hi>Thou gaueſt me no kiſſe,</hi> after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the countrey, <hi>but ſhe, ſince the time I came in, hath not ceaſed to kiſſe my feete.</hi> Then, <hi>Mine head with oyle thou didſt not anoint: but ſhee hath anointed my feete with ointment:</hi> therefore, ſhee loueth me better than thou.</p>
            <p>Nowe the <hi>Phariſie</hi> coulde not diſcerne of the penitent ſinner: but the Lord letteth him ſee, that Hee can diſcerne betwixt an hypocrite &amp; a true penitent ſinner, there Hee hath payed him in his owne hand. And the Lord letteth vs ſee, that He taketh heede, and ſhall take heede to the ende of the worlde, to the leaſt thing that thou doeſt for His cauſe to anie of His. Who wuld haue thought that the Lord woulde haue taken heede to this? The Lord will take heede who giueth Him water to waſhe His feete, which is but a ſober office. The LORD will take heede who will ſtoupe downe and giue Him a kiſſe, and waſhe His feete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with teares. The LORD will take heede who will beſtowe common oyle to anoint Him with, or who will beſtowe precious ointment on Him: and in the Great daye, when all ſecretes ſhall bee reuealed, (looke if Hee tooke heede what wee were doing in the worlde) <hi>Matth. Chapter</hi> 25. <hi>verſe</hi> 34, Hee will ſaye, <hi>Thou gaueſt Mee nothing</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:16627:156"/>
               <hi>when I was heere in the worlde, thou viſitedst Mee not:</hi> and hee will point out, place, time, and all the circumſtances vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Then, Brethren, if the LORD taketh ſo good heede what wee doe, vvell is the ſoule that giueth but a piece of bread to an hungrie bodie for CHRISTES ſake, or a coate to a naked bodie for His ſake. And therefore, euer haue Him before thine eyes, and ſaye, LORD, I giue this to Thee, that Thou mayeſt not ſay to me when Thou commeſt to judge the worlde, <hi>Thou gauest Mee nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, I heare there is a great pouertie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in this Land, and woe vnto them that are the inſtrumentes of hunger: Let vs bee ſo farre from this, to bee the cauſes thereof, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wee may pintch our ſelues, that wee may ſpare vpon the needie: for I ſee the LORD will trie our liberalitie: Therefore, let vs ſpare vpon the poore in this Land, that wee maye heare of the LORD in that Great daye, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of My Father,</hi> for yee gaue Mee meate, and yee gaue Mee drinke in this worlde. And further, wee ſee heere, the tryall of an hypocrite. Howe ſhalt thou knowe an hypocrite? The LORD layeth downe the rule: <hi>Yee ſhall knowe them by their fruites, Matth.</hi> 7. 16. Yee ſhal know by their doings: an hypocrit hath many fair words: &amp; I doubt not but this <hi>Phariſie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he inuited the Lord to dinner, had many faire words, but there ſhall be little doing, at the leaſt hee ſhall
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16627:157"/>
neuer doe anie thing heartily. Where is this <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> humilitie? Hee offereth not to waſh the Lordes feete, who was euer traueiling and journeying, nor to kiſſe the Lord when He entered into his houſe, after the faſhion of the countrey, nor ſhewed none heartſomeneſſe towards the Lord. An hypocrite can neuer doe any thing heartily, neither to God nor man. Then wouldeſt thou know a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man or woman? Yee heare neuer a word out of her mouth, all this time that ſhe is waſhing the Lordes feete with teares, kiſſing them, anointing them with ointment: So a true Chriſtian hath few wordes, but many deedes. One good deede, is worth ten words. And when thou ſpeakeſt, looke that thy wordes bee heartie, and ſauour of loue. Looke that thou bleſſe not with thy mouth, and curſe with thine heart: &amp; whatſoeuer thou doeſt, doe it heartily, and though thou were but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a cuppe full of colde water to a poore bodie, do it heartily, &amp; then the Lord ſhall count wel of it, though it were neuer ſo litle. Looke what ſentence the Lord giueth out concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore woman that preſented two mites, Hee ſaieth, ſhee gaue more, than they all did, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 3. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou doeſt, doe it for the loue of the LORD, ſtill waiting for that day wherein the LORD ſhall reward thee. It is true indeede, that hee who hath anie diſcretion, will diſcerne the heart by the verie deede of the hand: And hee or ſhee, that hath any heartſomneſſe inwardly, it will be manifeſt and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16627:157"/>
in the verie deede of the hand outwardlie. But ſtand thou not vpon the ſight of any man in the world: But ſay, Lord, thou ſeeſt the heart, thou ſeeſt with what heartineſſe I doe this: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou doeſt, ſtriue euer to do it with heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake: ſo in doing thou ſhalt haue joye. No man can doe any thing hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie or joyfullie, but they who haue their eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord.</p>
            <p>Ye haue heard the propoſition, &amp; the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo: now He commeth to the concluſion: and He concludeth as it were in the teeth of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie,</hi> Therefore her ſinnes are forgiuen her. Not that this loue is the cauſe of the remiſſion of her ſinnes, but as a ſure argument and teſtimonie of her faith. Her loue toward Chriſt preceeded not, nor went before the aſſurance of the remiſſion of her ſinnes: but it followed as a true token. So it is an argument not from the cauſe, but from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that teſtifieth aſſuredly, that the cauſe is, and hath proceeded: that is, that ſhee hath faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Howbeit the Papiſtes abuſe this place, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heere, that the loue which this woman caried to Ieſus, was the cauſe of the remiſſion of her ſins: But I leaue them to their owne vanitie.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, after the example of this <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> I ſhall neuer judge euill, nor be a ſharpe cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of a penitent ſinner: for the poore ſinner that beleeueth once in Ieſus Chriſt, and repenteth, and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16627:158"/>
taketh purpoſe of amendement, (for faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance goe euer together) a ſinner that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Ieſus Chriſt, will repent, and hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinne to the death, wherewith hee hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God: for when hee hath once taſted of mercy, then will hee ſaye, Alas, that I haue offended ſo louing and ſo mercifull a Father: for after that hee hath once gotten a ſenſe of the infinite mercie of GOD, all his diſpleaſure will bee, that euer hee hath offended ſo louing and ſo mercifull a Father: I ſaye, ſuch a ſinner maye bee aſſured of forgiueneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe marke the Lordes anſwere to the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi> He ſaith not, howbeit ſhee be a ſinner, yet ſhee is penitent, and loueth mee: but Hee ſaieth, ſhee is no ſinner, all her ſinnes are taken awaye: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all her ſinnes had beene taken away and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Him, it is moſt true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Phariſie</hi> thought, to wit, the LORD would not haue ſuffered her to haue touched Him, Hee would not haue receiued the kiſſes of her mouth, nor the teares of her eyes: No, the LORD IESVS that Holie One, (if thou bee not made as vvhite as the ſnowe, and all thy ſinnes bee not purged) Hee vvill not ſuffer thee once to touch Him, nor to kiſſe His feete.</p>
            <p>It is a vvonderfull thing to ſee ſuch a ſuddaine change in an inſtant, that ſo vile and ſo vncleane a bodie, ſhoulde bee ſo pure and ſo cleane. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the bodie vvere as redde as the blood, and as the Scarlet, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaieth, in the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:16627:158"/>
firſt Chapter of his <hi>Propheſie,</hi> and the 18. verſe, yet ſuddainlie Hee vvill make it as vvhite as the ſnowe, and the vvooll. Indeede it is true, thou wilt neuer bee purged from the remainentes of ſinne, ſo long as thou art in this life: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if thou put on that righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt by faith, God ſhall count thee as clean as a glorious Angell in His ſight.</p>
            <p>Nowe vvhen Hee hath ended the ſpeech to the <hi>Phariſie,</hi> at the laſt Hee ſpeaketh to the vvoman, not thinking it enough to ſpeake in her hearing vnto the <hi>Phariſie:</hi> but to the greater joye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the poore vvoman, Hee ſpeaketh to herſelfe. Thou vvill runne in and out, hither and thither, to gette a vvorde of the king: and vvhy not? if ſo thy neceſsitie require: but ſtriue to get a vvord out of the mouth of IESVS. Kings manie times vvill giue thee flattering vvordes, but the LORD when Hee ſpeaketh vnto thee, Hee vvill ſpeake in trueth, and vvith vvonderfull loue, vvhen Hee ſaieth to thee, Thy ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee indeede: for the vvord of the Lord hath an operation vvith it, for if He once call thee an Holie One, thou wilt be ſo indeede. The worde of the Lord worketh in thee the thing that Hee ſpeaketh moſt powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: for Hee calleth theſe thinges that are not, and by calling Hee maketh them to bee. So the Lord filleth her heart with joy, her heart no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to find joy whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was ſpeaking to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>phariſie.</hi>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:16627:159"/>
Nowe Hee filleth vp her joye, for the fulneſſe of joye is not gotten in an inſtant, all joye is in the face of Ieſus Chriſt. Thinke yee not, but this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when ſhe heard this word, conceiued an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable joye in her heart? And I ſay vnto euerie one of you, who as penitent ſinners will bewaile your ſinnes, and mourne for offending of GOD, and will purpoſe to waſh the feete of IESVS with teares, and wipe His feete with your haire, as the Lord hath giuen mee commiſsion to ſpeake, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteſt thou ſinner of thy ſinnes? Thinkeſt thou to amende thy life? Deteſteſt thou thy ſinnes? Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thou aſſuredly? Loueſt thou the Lord? I ſay to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee in the blood of that ſame Ieſus whom thou loueſt ſo well.</p>
            <p>Nowe a worde, and ſo I ſhall ende. When Hee hath ſpoken thus comfortably to the woman, the <hi>Phariſic</hi> beginneth againe to interrupt and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede Him if it had beene poſsible, to hinder the woman of her ſaluation. The reſt about the table ſcorneth Him, <hi>What is hee this,</hi> (quod they) <hi>that taketh vpon him to forgiue ſins?</hi> He taketh too much vpon him, more than he is able to performe: So as the <hi>Phariſie</hi> concluded before, that Hee was no Prophet, now they conclude that Hee was no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16627:160"/>
For Chriſt came to make a new world again, and to renewe man, who was dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes: Therfore He beginneth to inſtruct <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> in this doctrine of Regeneration: and Hee bindeth him to learne it with ſuch a neceſsity, that except hee and whole mankinde bee regenerate, there is none of them that ſhall ſee the kingdome of God: and this Hee doeth with a great aſſeuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, <hi>Verily, verily. Nicodemus</hi> hearing and fearing that heauie denunciation of baniſhment from the kingdome of GOD, but not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this regeneration, beginneth to reaſon, that it was a thing vnpoſſible that hee coulde bee borne againe, becauſe hee was an olde man: and it is not poſsible that an olde man can enter into his mothers wombe againe. Chriſt anſwereth, and anſwering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſiſteth in that propoſition of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, vrging him againe with a neceſsitie of the ſame regeneration: Onely He addeth to that that He ſpake before the manner and waye of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting: to wit, <hi>of water, and the Spirite.</hi> It is not a fleſhlie generation, but a Spirituall generation, whereby a man is begotten againe, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renewing of the Holy Spirite in him, of the which, water is the ſeale to ſeale vp our faith in that aſſurance of that regeneration or new birth.</p>
            <p>Nowe in this Text which I haue read, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſame doctrine: and like as in the verſe preceeding Hee hath proponed the manner of this new birth not to be naturall, but ſpirituall: ſo
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16627:161"/>
in this verſe He ſheweth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> what a kinde of birth it is, <hi>That</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>that is begotten of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> that is, the Spirit of the Lord IESVS working, begetteth not a fleſhly or corrupt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Spirituall and Heauenly creature.

And Hee ſaieth, <hi>that the thing begotten of the fleſh, is fleſh:</hi> that is, as the fleſh, a corrupt maſſe of fleſh and blood cannot beget but corrupt fleſh: Euen ſo, the Spirit of the Lord Ieſus cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the meaning of this place.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this place offereth occaſion to ſpeake ſomewhat of Regeneration, whereof the worlde had neuer greater neede than at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: (for I thinke the world is going backe againe to that old corruption, from the which they were deliuered) Therefore, to the ende that all thinges may be the more cleare, I ſhall ſpeake to you firſt of the fleſh, and generation thereof: Next, of the Spirit &amp; Regeneration: And the LORD make vs carefull to finde the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to bee effectuall in euerie one of vs to regeneration.</p>
            <p>Then beeing to ſpeake of the fleſh, it ſhall bee expedient to deduce it from the fountaine. There are two ſortes of ſinne in this worlde: The one
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16627:161"/>
ſort is called Originall, that ſinne that man and woman is borne with in this worlde, which they drawe out of their mothers wombe vvith their birth: The other ſort is called Actuall ſinne, that ſtandeth in a doing and vvorking and vvhich flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth and proceedeth from that originall ſinne, as from the fountaine. I maye not inſiſt vpon theſe thinges particularlie, but I ſhall giue you a ſhort viewe of them.</p>
            <p>Originall ſinne ſtandeth in two partes: The firſt is that horrible defection and apoſtaſie which whole mankinde in the worlde, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the ende of the worlde, haue made in the loynes of <hi>Adam:</hi> for yee muſt vnderſtand, it was not <hi>Adam</hi> alone, that ſinned, and fell from GOD, but it vvas thou, and all others that euer vvere gotten of man, and borne of woman whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde made that defection: for as it is ſaide, in the ſeuenth <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> &amp; the ninth verſe, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> paide tithes to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> that <hi>Leui,</hi> vvho long after vvas not begotten nor borne, vvas tithed in the loynes of <hi>Abraham</hi> his fore-father: (hee payed his tithe as vvell as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) Euen ſo, vvee beeing euerie one of vs in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> vvhen hee ſinned, vve made all defection from the LORD, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him. Vpon this defection there followed a guiltineſſe, wherethorow there is none of vs, but vvee are obliged to die euerlaſtinglie: And if there vvere no more ſinne in all this vvorlde, but that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16627:162"/>
firſt <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> only, there is matter enough of thine euerlaſting damnation: thou needeſt not to heape ſinne vpon ſinne: there is thine obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thine euerlaſting death, and to damnation. This is the firſt part of originall ſinne. The ſecond part of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne is the effect that followeth vpon the firſt, a foule and horrible corruption, that entered in the whole nature of man: ſo that from the top to the toe of man, there is not ſo much whole as one intch: Man is a vile leprous creature, there is not a whole intch neither in bodie nor ſoule, but all is infected: for, Brethren, that firſt defection paſt not away ſo: but it brought with it a fearefull ruine and wracke to mankinde: and it leaueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it a foule ſtinke and terrible darkneſſe, and that came of the juſt judgement of GOD, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſinne by ſinne. And this corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bringeth with it the owne guiltineſſe &amp; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to eternall death: ſo that ſundrie wayes we are guiltie of death.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3.) ſetteth downe this guiltineſſe, when hee ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eth, <hi>Wee were all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath.</hi> This ſecond part of it, Is it that Chriſt calleth heere fleſh, in another place it is called the olde man: for by fleſh we vnderſtand not this fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and bodily lumpe which wee cary about with vs: nor yet as the Papiſts call it, a concupiſcence in this lumpe, and nothing in the ſoule: No, no, but this fleſh is a corruption both in ſoule and bodie, and in all the powers and faculties thereof: So
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16627:162"/>
that there is neuer an intch free from that peſt. The Lord who made man (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 8. 21.) expreſſeth the worke and the force of the fleſh after the fall, where it is ſaide, that after Hee looked, and ſawe this corruption, He ſaide, that the whole in agina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the cogitations of the heart of man, are wicked and euill continually: which wordes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that man from his youth, yea, euen from his mothers wombe, could doe nothing but imagine, thinke, and forge, euill, wickedneſſe, and all ſortes of miſchiefe. And when Hee ſawe this, Hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſadde and an heauie voyce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It forthinketh mee, that euer I made man, Geneſ.</hi> 6. 6. And it was no ſmall thing, no queſtion, that made the Creator to repent that He made man. What is man nowe, but a filthie creature, and a peſt to infect Heauen and earth, if it were poſſible?</p>
            <p>But that yee may the better vnderſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable greatneſſe of this euill, which is in man, I ſhall let you ſee howe it hath ſpred it ſelfe thorowe the whole power of the ſoule of man: for as for the bodie, I ſpeake nothing of it: it is true indeede, it neuer leaueth that bodie, till it reſolue it in earth againe, which otherwiſe was made to bee immortall, and in the meane time, till death come, it maketh the body to bee ſubject to many great and fearfull ſickneſſes and diſeaſes. Where from come theſe biles, the feuers, the palſie, the peſt, the leproſie, and other diſeaſes, but from this corruption? But I ſpeake nothing of it. I will let
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16627:163"/>
you ſee, howe it hath ſpred it ſelfe in the ſoule of man: Brethren, there is neuer a power nor facultie in the ſoule, but all is infected. This peſt it hath not only infected the inferiour appetite, as the blinde Philoſophers thought, and as the Papiſts doe this day affirme. But where beginneth it? What is the moſt excellent power of the ſoule? It is the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the minde, and this is it that we call rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: This corruption, it hath ſo entered into the ſoule of man, that when as that vnderſtanding ſhould be as a light going before, to direct all our actions, motions, and thoughts the right way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods worde and ordinance: It doeth nothing but fight and repine againſt the wiſdome of the God of Heauen. It is an hard matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath created this vnderſtanding, and yet it figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt Him. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8 7.) <hi>that the wiſdome of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh, is enemie against God:</hi> that is, the very vnderſtanding of man, which is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing in man, is enemy to God, let bee the inferiour appetites: And therefore, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23. hee deſireth not onely that the inferiour appetites ſhould bee renewed, but that regeneration ſhould begin at that which is moſt excellent in the ſoule: euen that they may bee renewed in the Spirite of their minde. Then yee ſee this vnderſtanding of man is altogether corrupt, and that light of the minde is turned vnto terrible darkneſſe and that this wiſedome fighteth directly againſt God: for this reaſon of man fighteth not onely againſt the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:16627:163"/>
wiſdome of GOD ſet downe and declared in the law, but chiefly againſt that which is more againſt His wiſdome manifeſted in the Euangell He eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it naturally to bee but meere fooliſhneſſe, that euer a man ſhoulde get ſaluation by a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>And to goe fordward. This peſt ceaſeth not here, nor reſteth not in the minde onely, but it entereth into the rootes of the heart, into the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of man: it hath entered ſo into his vvill, that when as this will of ours, this power of our ſoule, that we call the will, ſhould haue choſen that which is good, and refuſed that which is euill, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reaſon going before, &amp; informing what is to be choſen and purſewed, and what is to be refuſed and eſchewed: it fighteth not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt that moſt holy wiſedome and will of God: but euen againſt that ſponke of knowledge, light, and reaſon that is left in man: for when man fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord tooke not all kinde of light from man, but Hee left in His great mercy in man ſome ſponke of light and knowledge of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of GOD the Creator, whereby hee might in ſome meaſure knowe his Creator: And Hee left in man alſo ſome knowledge &amp; judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of politike things, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation &amp; dealing with our neighbors, what is juſt, &amp; what is vnjuſt, what is reaſonable, &amp; what is vnreaſonable: he left in him alſo ſome judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of naturall things, whereas He might haue ſet vp man as brutiſh as a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16627:164"/>
dogge or an aſſe. Notwithſtanding of this, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging corruption of the malicious will, repineth againſt this ſponke, and ſtriueth to blotte it out, that it ſhould neuer vtter it ſelfe to reformation, and to glorifie God, and to diſcharge a duetie to man, in ſuch ſort, that it were a juſt judgement of God, that they ſhould be made as brute as beaſts, as it went with the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>whome Hee gaue ouer vnto reprobate mindes,</hi> ſo that they had not care of naturall honeſtie or ſhame: but they wrought all ſort of vncleanneſſe, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the trueth of God in vnrightiouſneſſe, and ſuffered it not to reforme them. And naturall men hath found this repining of this corrupt will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the reaſon and light of the minde, and they haue ſaide, <hi>Video meliora proboque, deteriora ſequor:</hi> that is, <hi>I ſee and allowe better thinges, but I followe the worst.</hi> And to bee ſhort, this wit of man repineth as faſt againſt the Lordes will, as the will of the deuill doeth: for by nature we will that ſame thing that the deuill willeth: and there was neuer anie thing ſo abhominable that the deuill hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, but wee haue pleaſure of the ſame: <hi>Yee,</hi> ſaieth our Sauiour, <hi>are of the deuill your father, and the lustes of your father will yee fulfill, Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde how great matter and occaſion the Papiſtes haue to boaſt of free will to any good: they are but vaine blinde bodies. The will of man goeth wholly with the will of the deuill. There is no ſuch a thing. There is not ſo much as one jot of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16627:164"/>
will of man free: yet the corruption reſteth not here, but it goeth forward, and polluteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth all the affections that are in man, as anger, loue, hope, feare, &amp;c. none of them are free, they fight all againſt God, they haue no conformitie, but a great repugnance with that will of God.</p>
            <p>I goe forward, and I will not omit the naturall powers and faculties of the ſoule. And I affirme, that there are no powers of the ſoule that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as the facultie and appetite of eating of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, of expelling, but all are infected with this poſt. So that (Brethren) there is neuer a power of the ſoule that is free of this corruption. Would ye vnderſtand what becommeth of this corruption, and what it doeth? Beeing in the ſoule of man, it maketh that there is neuer a thought that a man thinketh, but it is a ſinne. And if thou haue no more than nature, the leaſt motion of thine heart is a ſin in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of God: neuer a worde that thou ſpeakeſt, but it is a ſin: neuer a deed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou doeſt, but it is a ſin: neuer a way thou wilt goe, but it is a ſin: &amp; conſequently, it maketh thee alwayes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the heauie wrath of GOD: If thou ſtirreſt but thine hand or thy foote, thou ſinneſt, and the wrath of God will purſue and followe thee, till at laſt thou bee caſten into hell, if thou bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. Beſides this, ſo long as wee remaine in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this corruption and peſt is ſo forceable in euery one of vs, that there is not one ſinne in the worlde ſo great and abhominable, but with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16627:165"/>
and delight euery one of vs woulde performe it, if the Lord of His mercy did not by His Spirite renew vs, at leaſt by His power reſtraine vs, when occaſion is preſented. The roote and ſeede of all miſchiefe vnder the ſunne is compacted in euerie man &amp; woman. Maruell not when thou ſeeſt ſome running to adultery, ſome to murther, ſome to ſorcery and witch-craft: for that ſeede which is forceable in them, would bee as forceable in thee to all miſchiefe, if the Lord reſtrained thee not: Naturally thou art as bent and inclined to theſe thinges as they are, if the Lord by His powerfull prouidence did not reſtraine thee. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> conſidereth the ſtrength and the force of that corruption that was in his heart, hee ſaieth, <hi>I knowe that in mee,</hi> that is, in my fleſh, <hi>there is no good.</hi> And in another place the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Except the LORD had left a ſeede in vs, wee had beene made like</hi> SODOME <hi>and</hi> GOMORRHA, <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Brethren, this ſame ſeede and roote of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in euery infant: yee thinke they bee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and men commonly call them innocentes: No, no, they are but wolues birdes, and there is a vvorlde of miſchiefe vvithin them, vvhich vvill burſt out, when yeeres, ſtrength and occaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth, except the Lord reſtraine the ſame.</p>
            <p>Further, I aduertiſe you of the deceitfull lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this peſt, for it is not onely to bee feared when it burſteth foorth, and is fruitfull in euill
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:16627:165"/>
deedes, but alſo when it lurketh: yee ſee if there be a peſt in the fleſh of man, before it be broken out, many a time they will thinke they haue not a peſt: So it is with this peſt: it will lurke within the fleſh and ſinewes of the heart ſo quietly, that a man wil thinke hee is the wholeſt body in the worlde: but touch him, preſent any object or ſmall occaſion, yea, apply but the holy Law of God to that heart, incontinent his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oule affections and luſtes ſhall vtter themſelues, and burſt out: Euen as yee ſee ſometimes, that fire vvill bee ſo hidden and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnder the aſhes, that it vvill not appeare, and men vvill thinke that there is no fire there: but as ſoone as there is any meete and apt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as wood, powder, or brimſtone applyed, then it vvill manifeſt it ſelfe, and burſt foorth in a flame. Euen ſo, albeit vvhen men feele not their foule luſtes and affections, they ſeeme to themſelues to bee holy: yet ſpeake to them of the Lawe of GOD, forbidding and diſcharging ſuch and ſuch thinges to bee done, then they ſhall finde the paſsions of ſinne, vvhich appeared before to bee dead vvithin them, to beginne to liue, yea, to rage in the ſoule, and to bring foorth fruites vnto death, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the ſeuenth <hi>Chapter,</hi> and fift <hi>verſe.</hi> And then vvhen theſe paſsions breake out, happie is hee that hath ſome part of the Spirite of Regeneration, to repreſſe them, and ſtriue againſt them in ſome meaſure: For, naturallie, there is nothing in vs to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:16627:166"/>
gaine-ſtand them, but wholly with all our force, and with griedineſſe wee will accompliſh them, yea, the deuill ſitteth betwixt the ſhoulders, yea, in the very heart of man, and carrieth him heere and there to accompliſhe all ſort of miſchiefe in all kinde of filthineſſe, and ſhall neuer let him ſtay, till hee bring him to deſtruction. There is no power in man to reſiſt: And therefore, ſinne is ſaide to reigne, and to haue a kingdome within vs: And except the Spirite of Chriſt come, and in mercie either holde downe, or elſe mortifie and ſlaye that foule corruption, it ſhall ſlay vs at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Yee ſee then, howe deceitfull it is, and howe eaſily men are deceiued, whileſt this corruption lurketh within and vttereth not it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But, Brethren, more dangerous is the deceite thereof when it burſteth out: We thinke that man to bee in a miſerable eſtate, who is raging in this bodily peſt, and yet is ſo blinded and ſenſeleſſe, that hee is not aware of the ſickneſſe, till hee die in the ſame: if hee were ſenſible of the diſeaſe, hee were in a better eſtate and condition. And ſo is the eſtate and condition of man naturally, when this corruption beginneth to vtter it ſelfe: for yee ſee ſome raging in murther with pleaſure, and waſhing their handes in innocent blood with griedineſſe, &amp;c. And ſome committing adulterie vvithout any remorſe yea, boaſting and vaunting of it amongſt their companions: Others, abuſing the benefites of God, thorowe intemperance in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:16627:166"/>
drunkenneſſe, vvithout any griefe of conſcience: And others, deliting to oppreſſe, and ſpoyle vvith violence ſuch as they may ouer-come: and in the meane time they haue no griefe, prick, nor trouble in their conſcience for ſuch doing: Are not ſuch men miſerably deceiued, who when they are going to judgement and wrath, rejoyce, yea, when they are poſting to deſtruction, take their paſtime, when they are running to condemnation, laugh, and who, when they are moſt miſerable, thinke themſelues moſte happy? And this is the eſtate of many, and chiefely of the great men in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: they rejoyce and boaſt of their ſinnes, and they thinke themſelues in a good and happie eſtate, becauſe they finde no remorſe nor griefe in their conſciences.</p>
            <p>I ſhall vſe an homely ſimilitude, to declare this matter: A man will haue a worme in his finger, or tooth, it will keepe it ſelfe quiet, and ceaſe from gnawing for a ſeaſon &amp; he will thinke he is whole enough: but take a little vineger, or ſome ſuch like pearcing and ſharpe water, then ſhee will beginne to gnawe, and then the ſillie man will complaine, that hee was beguiled, when hee thought hee was well enough: Euen ſo it is with the conſcience of man, for it lieth in the ſoule of man lurking, as a worme lieth in the fleſh, &amp; ſometimes it gnaweth, and ſometimes it lieth ſtill, and letteth the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, the adulterer, the oppreſſor, goe forward in murther, adulterie, oppreſsion, and other moſte
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16627:167"/>
abhominable ſinnes, vvithout anie accuſation, griefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remorſe, or feare of the law of GOD, and threatning of the curſes thereof. I ſhall tell you more than that: Sometimes the conſcience of a miſerable male-factor will bee ſo ſenſeleſſe, that it will no wayes bee moued by the Preaching: A murtherer will bee ſitting before the Miniſter: A vile filthy adulterer will bee ſitting there, deuiſing howe to accompliſh their abhominable luſtes, in the meane time that the Miniſter will bee threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning judgement againſt their wickedneſſe: they will not be moued with the threatninges, but will diſdaine and ſcorne them in their heartes, and will ſay, This fellow doeth nothing but prate and raiſe what hee pleaſeth: and after Preaching vvill goe out merrily to his dinner and there curſe and ſweare, and blaſpheme Gods Name and thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goe to his bedde, as a beaſt, or a ſenſeleſſe ſow. But I admoniſh thee, O miſerable wretch! in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of thy teeth, thy conſcience ſhall not ſleepe alwayes: the conſcience of all fleſh ſhall bee wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one day, either to their weale, or to their woe: And that Lawe which ſo ſecurely men contemne many a time, ſhall bee ſo powerfull to waken the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, &amp; to torment: hem, that by no meanes nor policie ſhall they bee able to pacifie them againe: Their drinking, their halking, their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, their carding, their dycing, and other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, will not then bring comfort or true peace to the ſoule: Then that man who thought himſelfe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:16627:167"/>
moſt happy, when he was enjoying the pleaſures of ſinne, ſhall thinke himſelfe the moſt miſerable wretch that euer the earth bore.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the lawe that was giuen, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, is wondrous terrible, and for as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as many men account of it, yet either one time or other it ſhall be effectuall to ſtirre vp and to waken the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I except no man: And if the conſcience ſleepe ſtill on in this life, till death ouer-take men, as it doeth in many, yet it ſhall be ſo wakened after this life in Hell, that it ſhall neuer get leaue to ſleepe againe, it ſhall ſo g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>w vpon the ſoule, that it ſhall neuer get reſt: And in that Great day, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that righteous Iudge ſhall appeare, the lawe ſhall bee moſte forceable to raiſe in the ſoule, dolour, griefe, and anguiſh for euer, which is impoſſible for any fleſh to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, expell, and put away: yea, it is as impoſſible as it is to ouercome the majeſty of God His owne ſelfe: for as the Goſpell is the power of GOD to ſaluation, to euery one that beleeueth: So the law is the power of God, to raiſe vp dolour, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and anguiſh in the ſoules of impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and at laſt to bring it into condemnation. Therefore, happy is that man, who in the time of grace, when the Goſpel is crying vpon euery wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and laden ſoule, to come to Ieſus, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to eaſe and disburthen all that cometh vnto Him, findeth this conſcience wakened in mercie: for nowe Ieſus Chriſt, by His ſeruantes, is going
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16627:168"/>
thorow the world, offering to cure all ſorts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, yea, euen theſe that are moſt incurable: And miſerable is that man, who ſleepeth on till death ouer-take him, for then the time of grace is paſt, repentance then will bee to late, it will not auaile, remiſſion of ſinnes then cannot bee obtained: the voyce of the Lawe ſhall euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nowe hitherto wee haue handled this naturall corruption, and this noble fleſh, which men glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſo much into. Nowe let vs ſpeake ſomething of the naturall birth, <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> And what can corruption breede, but corruption? What can a leprous man bring out, but a leprous childe? Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthineſſe? No, not one, <hi>Iob, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 4 For why, Brethren? In this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall generation, as the parent naturallie commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth nature, and his owne ſubſtance: ſo looke what venome, vileneſſe, and deteſtableneſſe is in his nature, hee giueth and communicateth it all to his children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:16627:168"/>Men glorie commonlie much of theſe thinges which they gette thorowe their parentes, they will ſaye, I haue gotten great heritages, much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and great riches by my father: But I ſaye, that no man euer got ſo ſurelie theſe things tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe their parentes, as they gette through them and their birth a poyſon and peſt with their fleſh, whereby they are made the children of wrath, and ſhall get Hell for their inheritance.</p>
            <p>Brethren, happie is the man that can conſider this naturall vncleanneſſe, and is touched in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with the pollution which hee giueth to his children, and ſtriueth to haue it purged: for in ſo doing, hee both acquireth a good conſcience to himſelfe, and giueth his children a better heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than if hee left him all the heyreſhips of the worlde.</p>
            <p>When thou haſt begotten thy childe, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered goods and riches together, and acquired great poſſeſſions vnto him, then if thou takeſt no care of the purging of that corruption which hee hath contracted from thy loynes, that ſame peſt ſhall bee laide to thy charge in that great day.</p>
            <p>Therefore, nowe hauing ſpoken ſomething of the fleſhe, and the generation thereof, let vs nowe ſpeake ſhortlie of the Spirite, and His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. What is meaned by the Spirite? This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is the Spirite of the LORD IESVS: this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Spirit of Regeneration, who reneweth men &amp; women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; of olde and ſinfull creatures, maketh
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16627:169"/>
them new and holy againe: For, as ſoone as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man beginneth to laye holde on the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, by a true and liuely faith, ſo ſoone findeth hee power and grace conuoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by His Spirit into his ſoule to renew it.</p>
            <p>Then, to ſpeake of Chriſt, becauſe this Spirit is His Spirit: As Ieſus Chriſt is our elder Brother, ſo is Hee alſo our Father, Hee is called the Father of Eternitie, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 9. 6. He is called the ſecond <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. 14. He is our ſpirituall Father, who beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs by His Holy Spirit. Nowe compare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parent with this ſpirituall parent: Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parent is not onely culpable and guilty of that firſt defection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo of innumerable ſinnes and tranſgreſſions following thereupon: Our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall parent, Chriſt, is culpable of no ſinne at all, but is full of all kinde of obedience: for Hee was obedient to the Father to the death, euen to the death of the Croſſe. Our naturall parent is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether naturally corrupt, yea, a lumpe of ſinne: but Chriſt, our ſpirituall parent, is not only cleane in nature from all ſpot of ſinne, and perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to come to their generation: The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parent begetteth by the force of nature: there is a force in nature to beget: our ſpirituall parent, Ieſus, is farre more able to beget by the power of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16627:169"/>
His Spirit who is the author of nature: The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parent by the force of nature will beget fleſh, a corrupt maſſe, a ſinfull creature, yea, the image of the deuill: this will hee giue to his childe: but our Heauenly parent, the Lord Ieſus, by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, begetteth the Spirit, that is, a ſpirituall man, an holy &amp; cleane man, who hath no delite nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinne: for Sainct <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, in his 1. Epiſtle, Chap. 3. verſe 9. <hi>Hee that is borne of God ſinneth not:</hi> that is, ſinneth not as the worldlinges doe, with pleaſure and delight: ſinne reigneth not in him: why ſinneth hee not? <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>the ſeede of God remaineth in him:</hi> that is, His Spirit, by whom as a liuely ſeede wee are begotten and made newe creatures. And what ſaith he more? He ſaith, ſuch a man cannot ſinne: that is, he cannot ſinne: that is, he cannot ſinne as the naturall and vnregenerate man ſinneth: hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow the courſe of this worlde, and wallow in the puddle of ſinne as they doe. And why can he not ſinne ſo? <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>he is borne of God.</hi> It is a marueilous force that the Spirit of GOD hath, Hee maketh a man that he cannot ſinne, all the worlde will not make him to ſinne. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man can doe nothing but ſinne, all his actions are ſinnes: but hee that is borne of God cannot ſinne</p>
            <p>Nowe this generation of the Spirite is called Regeneration: which word, albeit it be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in many mens mouthes, yet fewe vnderſtand what it meaneth: therefore, wee ſhall ſet downe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16627:170"/>
the nature and definition thereof, and touch ſome particular circumſtances, which may ſerue for the better vnderſtanding thereof. Then, what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? It is an alteration and changing of the whole nature of man, accompliſhed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the powerfull operation of the Holie Spirite. When I call Regeneration a changing of nature. I meane not that there ſhoulde be any change of the ſubſtance &amp; eſſence it ſelfe, either of the ſoule or of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bodie, as if that by Regeneration the olde ſubſtance were quite aboliſhed, and a newe ſubſtance brought foorth: but I meane that there is a change and alteration of the qualities which are in the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>I will let you ſee this in the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoule, as in the minde and reaſon, in the will, and in the affections. In the minde and reaſon, there muſt bee a change of the vviſedome of the fleſh into the vviſedome of GOD: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a greater enemie to GOD and His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to thy ſelfe and thy ſaluation, than the vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh: And therefore, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be ſaued, this wiſedome muſt be mortified, &amp; thou muſt become <hi>a foole, that thou mayest bee wiſe,</hi> as yee maye reade in the firſt <hi>Epistle</hi> of S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the 3. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the 18. <hi>verſe.</hi> In ſtead of this vviſedome muſt bee powred into the minde the wiſedome of GOD. In the vvill and affections there muſt bee a change of the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and wicked inclination, into holineſſe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16627:170"/>
and a good inclination: Whereas before there was nothing in them but frowardneſſe, (LORD that man is a froward creature, when GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him to goe one waye, hee will goe the plaine contrarie) that muſt be mortified and ſlain: and in ſtead of it there muſt bee wrought in the heart a propenſion and willingneſſe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to purſue and to doe that which the LORD commandeth, and hath pleaſure into.</p>
            <p>Nowe howbeit I call Regeneration a change onelie of the qualities, yet it is not ſo light a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo eaſilie performed, as men would think: for it is a greater worke to renewe man, than to create him. In the beginning GOD created all thinges with His word, but before man could bee renewed, the Sonne of God behooued to become the ſonne of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuffer ſhame and ignominy, &amp; die an accurſed death, <hi>euen the death of the Croſſe.</hi> It is an eaſie thing for thee to ſaye. I muſt bee changed ere euer I ſee Heauen: But, Brethren, it is not ſo ſoone done: it is the moſte difficill thing vnder the Sunne, to gette the heart of a creature changed: And they who haue found this vvorke ſenſiblie to haue beene begunne in them, haue found howe harde it is by their owne experience: for I tell thee, that before thou bee renewed, thou muſt denie thine owne ſelfe: CHRIST ſaieth, <hi>Thou must renounce thy ſelfe, and take vp thy croſſe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and followe Him,</hi> LVKE, <hi>Chapter</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 23. If the LORD had onelie bidden vs renounce our
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16627:171"/>
friendes, our father, our mother, our riches, our landes, and ſuch other thinges as are without vs, we would haue thought it a matter hard enough, and ſcarcely would we haue bene induced to giue obedience, as ye ſee in the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 16. But when the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to renounce our ſelues, euen that thing that is moſte excellent, that which is moſte wiſe, this reaſon it ſelfe, the wiſedome of the fleſh, that furniſheth ſo many reaſons to diſſwade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either to profeſſe or followe Chriſt: what can bee more hard? But ſuppone reaſon were conuinced, and the mouth thereof cloſed, that it coulde gette no ſhift to anſwere, yet thinkeſt thou ſo to bee quite of thy ſelfe? No, the will and the affections will ſtand obſtinately againſt the judgement of the minde, and follow out, and purſue that which the minde diſcearneth to be euill.</p>
            <p>So thou mayeſt eaſily ſee, that there is nothing more harde than to gette this Regeneration: yea, thou mayeſt ſee that it is a thing altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, except that Almighty Spirit of God be preſent, and worke it effectually in the ſoule, all the kings of the earth, with all their weapons and engines of warre, cannot be able to doe it. No, all the Angels in Heauen are not able to accompliſh this worke: <hi>The weapons of our warre-fare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, are not carnall, but mighty through God, to cast downe ſtrong holdes, casting downe imaginations, and euerie high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God,</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:16627:171"/>
               <hi>and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 5. There is no power in Heauen or earth, but onely the Spirit of God, that is able to renewe one creature. And this power is granted to this our Miniſterie, the preaching of the Euangell. Let great men, let worldly men eſteeme of it as they pleaſe, God hath ordained this Miniſtery, to miniſter this wonderfull power whereby the ſoules of men ſhall be regenerate.</p>
            <p>Further, thou muſt vnderſtand, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is not perfected in an inſtant, but in proceſſe of time: it muſt continue all the dayes of thy life: ſo long as thou liueſt, albeit thou liue a thouſand yeeres, this olde man will not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and altogether mortified and ſlaine, till the houre of death: Thou muſt all the dayes of thy life-time be groaning vnder the burthen of ſinne, ſubject to croſſes and troubles, (away with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed ſinners, who ſaye, they woulde alwayes haue their heartes vp: ſadneſſe becommeth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner well) and thou muſt ſtriue to finde the newe man to bee renewed degree by degree, piece and piece, euen till at laſt death bee ſwallowed vp of life, and mortalitie of immortalitie. And if thou wouldeſt haue this worke to goe forward in thee, then ſet euermore Ieſus thy Lord and thine head before the eyes of thy ſoule: looke vpon Him with the eyes of faith: for it is only His preſence &amp; the ſight of His glory, that worketh this marueilous change: for there is a great oddes betweene the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:16627:172"/>
ſight of His glorie, and the ſight of the glorie of worldlie Princes, for the ſight of their glorie will not change thee, nor make thee glorious, but vaniſheth awaye in a moment: But the ſight of the glorie of IESVS ſhall change thee, and make thee glorious, whenſoeuer thou beholdeſt Him, either by faith in this worlde, or elſe face to face in the Kingdome of Glorie: For when thou beholdeſt Him with the eyes of faith heere, thou ſhalt bee changed, according to the meaſure of thy faith: and becauſe thy faith is imperfect, thy change heere muſt bee imperfect: but when thou ſhalt ſee Him face to face, and beholde Him as Hee is, then ſhalt thou bee like vnto Him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: thy change ſhall bee perfect: His preſence ſhall bee effectuall to change thy vile bodie, and to faſhion it like vnto His owne glorious bodie: when thou beholdeſt His glorie, thou ſhalt bee changed into the ſame glorie.</p>
            <p>Therefore, yee ſee what neede wee haue to finde this Regeneration begunne in vs heere, and to finde a continuall progreſſe therein all the dayes of our life, that ſo wee maye bee aſſured, that the LORD ſhall crowne His worke in vs with glorie in IESVS.</p>
            <p>And nowe to ende: then ſurelie yee ſee, that corruption, miſchiefe, and venome, euerie man, without exception, communicate vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by naturall generation: Therefore, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16627:172"/>
this is mine exhortation to all, both to great and ſmall, (I except none, from the King, to the Begger) Striue, as yee are inſtrumentes of generation, ſo to bee inſtrumentes of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that your children maye bee taken out of nature, and planted in grace, and ſo bee made members of the myſticall bodie of IESVS CHRIST: Striue to bring them vp in the knowledge of CHRIST, that ſo yee maye bee free of that heauie judgement which remaineth for all ſuch as neglect this duetie towardes their children, and that yee maye ſee GODS bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon your children heere, and maye haue hope of that eternall life and glorie heereafter, which the LORD hath promiſed to His owne in CHRIST IESVS: To whome, with the FATHER, and the Holie SPIRIT, three perſons and one GOD, be all Honour, Glorie, Praiſe, Power, &amp; Dominion, both now and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, So bee it.</p>

            <p>To come to the wordes: Hee ſaieth, <hi>Therefore, I thanke him, who hath made me ſtrong, that is, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord:</hi> Theſe wordes depend vpon the verſe immediately going before: hee ſaide before, that the glorious Euangell of Ieſus Chriſt was concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to him, for the which cauſe he burſteth forth in thankeſgiuing, and hee ſaieth, Therefore I will be thankfull to Him, who hath concredited it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee.</p>
            <p>Then yee ſee, his thankfulneſſe ariſeth on two conſiderations: Firſt, vpon the conſideration of the excellency of the Euangel of Ieſus Chriſt. The Goſpell is glorious in it ſelfe, and it is come down from the bleſſed God: next, vpon the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne vnworthineſſe: looke howe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the Goſpell was, as vnworthie was hee: then conſidering that ſo worthy a thing was giuen vnto him, and that hee himſelfe was ſo vnworthy, hee knoweth not what thankes to giue, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe what manner of waye to teſtifie his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If once wee could ſee what God were, howe bleſſed that inuiolable Majeſty were, and what the Euangell is, how glorious how liuely, &amp; howe powerfull in operation, and then what our ſelues
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:16627:174"/>
are, how vnworthie we are, now, Lord, what would wee account of Ieſus Chriſt! this heart that now is bound vp, would then bee looſed to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: But wee ſee not what GOD is, and if we haue not found glorie and the power of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Looke what great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation this Apoſtle giueth to the Goſpell, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the Lawe with the Goſpell, and calleth the Goſpell the Miniſterie of the Spirit, the Miniſterie of righteouſneſſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Miniſterie of life. Then againe, wee ſee not what our ſelues are, how vile, how fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and vncleane we are: we ſee not that myſterie of ſinne that is in vs, and therefore we account ſo little of the Goſpell, and are ſo little moued when the Lord threatneth the away-taking of it: And to the ende men may knowe howe they ought to eſteeme of this Miniſterie &amp; of this Goſpell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, which now the world ſo much contemneth and diſdaineth, we ſhall ſpeake a litle of the dignitie &amp; excellencie thereof. To haue the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to a mans charge is no ſmall thing: No, there is no fleſhe worthie of ſuch dignitie and honour: no, not the Angels in Heauen, let be ſillie mortall creatures. Is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worthy to diſpoſe the treaſures of ſaluation? Is a man worthy to reconſile God and the world? Is anie man worthy to bee an inſtrument to bring remiſſion of ſinnes, peace of conſcience, and joye in the Holie Ghoſte to the ſoule of man? Is anie worthy to beare witneſſe to the ſoule of man, that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:16627:174"/>
life euerlaſting appertaineth vnto him, and is laid vp for him in the Heauens? And this mooued the Apoſtle to crie out, when hee conſidered this, <hi>Who can be found meet for theſe thinges?</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. And ſo, if wee knewe all that is contained in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wee woulde ſaye, that the Angels themſelues are not worthie to beare ſuch a meſſage, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſecrete and hidden thinges of GOD, to confirme forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, to put poore ſinners out of doubt, that the LORD loueth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taketh them for His children: and laſt, that Hee will crowne them with ſaluation, and euerlaſting life. And the conſideration of this ſhould moue them whom the Lord hath ſet in His ſeruice, to follow the example of th'Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and day and night to bee thankfull to God, vvho chooſeth ſuch fraile and poore creatures to ſuch an high, excellent, and glorious office, as to offer ſaluation to them who before were condemned and caſt-awayes. Next this, conſideration ſhould mooue men faithfullie and carefullie to execute that charge which is committed vnto them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to pray y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord earneſtlie, that Hee would bleſſe them with graces and ſtrength according to the weightineſſe of the calling, that they maye bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound faithfull in that Great daye: for man of himſelfe cannot doe ſo much as to thinke a good thought, (2. <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) let be to haue ſuch graces by nature as to furniſh ſuch an high and glorious a calling. And as the Paſtors haue their
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16627:175"/>
duetie to learne heere, ſo the people alſo may and ſhould make their vſe of it, that is, when they come to heare the word of God, to the ende that the Goſpell and the promiſes of mercy may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and edifie them, they ſhoulde bee reſolued in themſelues, that it is God that ſendeth men vnto them, and maketh them meete who were vnmeet. And in this place the Apoſtles minde is not onely to humble Preachers to acknowledge the grace beſtowed vpon them, but alſo to reſolue all men that hee that preacheth is ſent from God: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the preaching of the Goſpell will ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them.</p>
            <p>And laſt, this ſerueth to reprooue the vaine thoughtes and vngodly ſpeaches of the common multitude: for they thinke this Miniſtery to bee but a baſe and contemptible calling, and ſay, Who ſhould be placed into it? who but ſuch fooles and vnworthy bodies as cannot bee meete for another calling? who but kinleſſe bodies? But if a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, an Eſquires ſonne, a lordes brother, &amp;c. take on this calling, hee is diſgraced and abaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But. O vnworthy wretch! No Emperour, no Monarch, nor no fleſh whatſoeuer is worthy of ſo great a calling: no, the Angels in Heauen honour not ſo much the commiſſion, as the commiſſion honoureth them: If thou continueſt in counting baſely of it to the ende, thou ſhalt finde it at the laſt to bee the moſt glorious thing that euer was, but it ſhall be to thy confuſion and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:16627:175"/>Nowe I goe forward: Hee commeth to a reaſon of his thankfulneſſe: <hi>Who hath ſtrengthened me,</hi> ſaith hee, that is, of a weake body, full of imperfection, blottes, and ſinnes, which might haue hindered mee from that calling. Hee made mee ſtrong and able. So the Apoſtle compareth his eſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with that eſtate which he found of grace: and when hee was in nature, hee ſaieth hee was weake, and vnder the worde of weakneſſe hee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth his blaſphemy, perſecution, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which hee ſetteth downe heereafter: And heereby wee maye ſee, that men will neuer knowe the grace of God well, nor accompt worthily of it, vntill they conſider what men are, when GOD leaueth them to their owne eſtate: And when men get a ſight, either of themſelues, or of others, they will ſee that there is no goodneſſe, nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of praiſe, but much miſchiefe &amp; miſery both in themſelues, and in others. And when men once ſeeth and knoweth this, then it will bee an eaſie thing to them to judge of the grace of GOD, which ſupplieth and remedieth all wantes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When <hi>Paule</hi> looked to himſelfe, hee ſawe no goodneſſe, &amp; that that had appearance of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was nothing but euaniſhing ſmoake: and therefore confeſſeth, that whatſoeuer was in him by nature, was corrected: and ſo hee giueth the praiſe of all to God.</p>
            <p>Againe, I ſee that none will account of IESVS CHRIST, and His Goſpell, but they who finde a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16627:176"/>
power and ſtrength in the Goſpell. There is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Goſpell, which all the faithfull finde: for by the Goſpell he that was weake to any good deede, is made ſtrong: by the Goſpell he that was dead, is quickened, and beginneth to liue. This conſtrained the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> to giue ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and powerfull ſtiles to the Goſpell: hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>the power of God to life and ſaluation, Rom</hi> 2. 16. he calleth it <hi>liuely and mighty in operation, Heb.</hi> 14. 12. The children of God find it powerfull, <hi>to ouerthrow and caſt downe the imaginations of man and euery ſtrong holde</hi> which is raiſed vp againſt Ieſus. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer findeth this of neceſsity they muſt be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Alas! that there ſhould be ſuch a power and ſtrength in the Goſpell, and that we ſhould finde ſo little of it! for if wee found it, it could not bee poſsible but wee woulde teſtifie and practiſe by mouth and hand, by word and action, our thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe otherwiſe than we doe.</p>
            <p>Nowe wee come to the next argument, which moued the Apoſtle to be thankfull: hee ſaith, that <hi>our Lord Jeſus Christ counted him faithfull, and ſet him in His ſeruice:</hi> hee meaneth not here that the Lord fore-ſawe that there would bee ſome worthineſſe, goodneſſe, and faithfulneſſe into him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hee employed him, as vaine and ignorant men doe affirme: for are not all corrupt? are not all children of wrath. and ſubject to Sathan? what goodneſſe then can God ſee in anie of vs, except Hee put it into vs? and what can moue Him to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16627:176"/>
make a choyſe of one more than another, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie His good pleaſure and free-liking? But this he ſaith, to meete and ſtoppe the mouthes of wicked and malicious men, who went about to diſgrace his perſon and office, and to make his preaching fruitleſſe. The world is now full of ſuch perſons: as if hee had ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let men reproach mee, diſdaine me, ſet themſelues againſt me, yet this is ſufficient for me, that Ieſus Chriſt, who hath all authoritie, and who is ſupreame Iudge, who onelie can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and condemne, and from whoſe ſentence none can appeale, is on my ſide, and hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by putting me into His ſeruice. and by calling me immediatelie with His owne mouth, that Hee would vſe my Miniſterie, and declared, that where I was vnfaithfull before, Hee accounted me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, He accounted more of me than I was worthy of. So by this th' Apoſtle importeth a double grace which hee got from Chriſt: firſt, that whereas hee was ynfaithfull, the Lord gaue him ſaith, and ſo accounted him faithfull: Next, that he had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, by calling him to bee an Apoſtle, that Hee had a liking that he ſhould be in His ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Then heere yee ſee, that as before, hee thanked GOD for the power and ſtrength that hee founde, ſo heere hee thanketh GOD, for that exceeding mercie, vttered in forgiuing him his ſinnes, and in calling him to bee an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Hence wee perceiue, Brethren, that no man will euer account of IESVS CHRIST, except he
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16627:177"/>
firſt finde that CHRIST hath accounted of him: yea, except he finde that Chriſt hath accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him that which he is not: whereas he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, hee muſt finde that Ieſus counteth him faithfull: whereas hee is vnjuſt, hee muſt find that Chriſt counted him juſt. Yee ſee by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that when one man loueth another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, hee will account more of him than hee is to bee counted of indeede, for loue ouer-ſeeth and hideth many infirmities and offences. Was there euer ſuch a loue as Chriſt Ieſus carried vnto vs, vnworthy wretches? For when wee were vile &amp; wretched ſinners, euer offending the Majeſtie of God, and procuring His wrath, the Lord Ieſus in the multitude of His mercies, and infinite deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His loue, couered our ſinnes, and hid our iniquities that they ſhould not beeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ene by God. So when the Lord Ieſus hath once extended the mantle of His mercy and compaſsion vpon His choſen children, then albeit they were repleniſhed with neuer ſo many vile and groſſe ſinnes, yet the Lord will not laye them to their charge, but in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Hee will count them juſt, righteous, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: ſo Hee will account more of them than they are worthy of: For, except that euery one of vs be perſwaded of this, that we are greater men in the account of Ieſus Chriſt, than wee are in our ſelues, we ſhall periſh in our ſinnes for euer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> and that crew of his ſhameleſſe-ones, ſcorne this doctrine of the imputation of the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16627:177"/>
righteouſneſſe of IESVS: they will haue men to bee juſtified by their inherent righteouſneſſe in Gods preſence: But I denounce, <hi>in the Name of the Great GOD,</hi> that if they goe on ſo, if they leane to their own righteouſneſſe, and if they find not the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus to be imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they ſhall neuer taſte of mercy.</p>
            <p>But howe knoweth the Apoſtle that the Lord accounteth ſo much of him? The laſt words of the verſe declareth, <hi>Hee put mee into His ſeruice,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knowe that Hee hath accounted more of mee than I am. Wouldeſt thou knowe that the Lord hath accounted more of thee than thou art, hath the Lord Ieſus put thee into his ſeruice, then He accounted of thee. Indeede I grant, that there are many who are called to offices, both in Church and Policy, who cannot, nor may not ſay, that therefore the Lord hath counted them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for there are many who are not ſent of God, but who runneth vnſent, and are thruſt out by their owne corrupt affections, as by ambition, by vaine glory, by deſire of preferment, by couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Often times yee ſee, that many who haue the place and name of Paſtors, ſet themſelues to trouble the eſtate of the Church, and to giue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto the weake ones, to ſpeake nothing of their negligence in that calling. And ſuch like in the ſeate of Iuſtice, yee will ſee men without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God, conſcience, nature, and common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, to giue out wicked judgement, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:16627:178"/>
manifeſt hainous crimes, and to ſtand dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie in contrarie tearmes with the Majeſtie of God, contra-manding where Hee hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Therefore, ſuch perſons cannot alleadge that the Lord hath counted them faithfull. And men cannot ſaye, that they are ſet into theſe offices by Gods hand: but as it were by Sathan: Therefore, to the ende that thou mayeſt know whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord counteth thee faithfull or not, Looke and ſee that thou haue theſe ſignes &amp; teſtimonies, which may beare witneſſe that the Lord hath called thee. It is true, men now adayes cannot haue ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as <hi>Paul</hi> had, for he was called immediatly by the mouth of Ieſus Chriſt from Heauen, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might ſpeake confidently: but it is as true, there are none whome the Lord calleth, but they haue ſome ſignes thereof. Looke therefore, if thou haue an earneſt deſire to glorifie the Lord in the riches of His mercy, to propagate the kingdome of Ieſus, to draw me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from darkneſſe to light from miſerie to felicitie, from death to life, from Hell to Heauen. Look if thou haſt grace in ſome meaſure for ſuch a calling: looke if the Lord accompanieth thy Miniſtery, with euidencie &amp; demonſtration of the Spirite, and by thy preaching hath acquired ſubjectes to His kingdome. Looke if thou doe the worke of the Lord chearfullie. If thou haue theſe tokens, thou mayeſt be aſſured in thy conſcience, and other men alſo may bee perſwaded, that thou runneſt not vnſent. But if thou haſt not theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:16627:178"/>
then boaſt not of this, that thou art in a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And to ſpeake more generally to all them who are called Chriſtians, Wouldeſt thou know in what eſtate and calling ſoeuer thou art into, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate or publike, whether the Lord account more of thee than thou art worthie, whether Hee accounteth thee faithfull or not, Looke to the markes, ſignes and tokens of a true Chriſtian: if thou finde them in thee, as namely, whether thou haſt a pleaſure in body and ſoule, through infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſerue the Lord, to be exerciſed in the means of grace, in preaching, prayers, reading, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp;c. Looke if thou haue a pleaſure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thy ſelfe in all thinges to thy LORD and Maiſter. Looke if thou haue a care, to further others in the courſe of Chriſtianitie, and waye of repentance: then, if thou haſt theſe tokens, thou mayeſt rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Then he goeth forward: &amp; he cannot ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſet out that mercy which he found, he knoweth not how nor in what tearmes to vtter &amp; proclaim it: If we could find that mercy of Ieſus, we would ſee that the heart would neuer ſatisfie it ſelfe with thinking of it, or the mouth with ſpeaking of it. And to the intent that hee maye magnifie the greatneſſe and the riches of the mercie of the LORD, hee confeſſeth and ſetteth downe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to his owne ſhame, his former ſinfull life and behauiour, in ſundrie degrees, <hi>Whereas before,</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecuter,</hi>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:16627:179"/>
               <hi>and an appreſſor.</hi> Looke if hee thought much of himſelfe, hee was one of the cruelleſt perſecuters that euer was in the Church, hee was in a rage againſt Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Beholde Brethren, <hi>Paul</hi> is not aſhamed to paint out himſelfe in his owne colours, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to confeſſe his former euill deedes, and to regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them to his owne ſhame to the worlds end. Yea, yee ſhall ſee in ſundry places, where hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himſelfe, that he can neuer ſatisfie himſelfe in aggregating his owne wickedneſſe. The ſinner who hath found mercy, will not regard to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſinnes to his owne ſhame, and to tell all the world of them, that hee may glorifie Him who hath giuen him mercy: hee will not ſtand vpon his reputation, but hee will preſerre Gods glorie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne account, hee will glorifie the LORD with his owne ſhame. When <hi>Dauid</hi> found mercie for his vile adulterie, and abhominable murther, hee not onelie confeſſeth his ſinnes to his owne ſhame, but alſo aſcendeth, to confeſſe the naturall corruption which hee had from the loynes of his parentes. The man that hath fallen into a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and vile ſinne and offence, and yet for ſhame will not confeſſe it, that God maye bee glorified, that ſoule hath neuer felt the mercie of God. And if thou hadſt felt that mercie of God thine heart would bee looſed, and thy mouth alſo, to glorifie God by an humble confeſsion.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, ye may perceiue out of theſe words,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16627:179"/>
how and what way th' Apoſtle found the ſtrength and power of the Goſpell: hee found a power in it, but not at the firſt inſtant: but ere euer hee felt the power of the Lord, hee findeth himſelfe to be weake: and ere hee feele the mercy of God, hee findeth himſelfe to bee a miſerable man: Thou ſhalt neuer feele the power of God, except firſt thou feele thine owne weakneſſe: and thou ſhalt neuer feele His mercie, except firſt thou feele thy miſerie. And therefore, the Lord Ieſus manie a time ſundrie wayes croſſeth His owne in this life, to the ende that they maye knowe and feele their weakneſſe and miſerie, and ſo goe out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to find ſtrength and mercie in Ieſus Chriſt. Sometimes Hee will exerciſe His owne with ſhame and reproach in the worlde: ſometimes with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie diſeaſes, and painfull ſickneſſes: ſometimes with want of the outward comfortes of this life: ſometimes with trouble and terrour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and all to this ende, that they may knowe what they are without the Lord, howe weake, how fraile, howe abject and naughtie they are: that ſo finding themſelues as nothing, they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to renounce themſelues, and to ſeeke to be found in Ieſus. Yea, after the Lord hath drawne them to Him by croſſes, the Lord vſeth all the dayes of their life-time, to expone them to croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that euerie day, finding more their wantes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and lack of comfort in themſelues, they may the more daylie ſeeke and ſtriue to bee found
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:16627:180"/>
in Ieſus, who can ſupplie all their wantes, and furniſhe euerie thing that they ſtand in neede of. It is true indeede, manie a time the Lord will not exerciſe His owne with croſſes, but ſpare them &amp; let them haue libertie, &amp; giue them in abundance the outward comfortes of this life, befor they bee effectuallie called. Looke to <hi>Paul</hi> before he knew Chriſt hee boaſted much of his worldlie prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, of his kinred: hee was a gentleman, hee was in great account, by the lawe a <hi>Phariſie, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 3. 4. 5. he knew not what the croſſe meaned. The like ye will find in many others of the Saincts of God: but aſſoone as He calleth them effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Hee layeth the croſſe vpon them: that ſeeing their weakneſſe, and diſtruſting themſelues, they may learne to renounce themſelues, and deſire to finde the power and life of IESVS in them, which they will finde effectuall in the croſſe in a wonderfull manner: Looke 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. The LORD layeth manifolde croſſes vpon <hi>Paule,</hi> and when with teares hee prayeth, that the Lord would take them away, hee getteth this anſwere, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect through thy weakneſſe:</hi> Meaning, that Hee will bee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and make <hi>Paule</hi> to finde ſtrength in Him, when as hee is weake in himſelfe. And neuer one is ſtrong in CHRIST, but when hee feeleth himſelfe weake. Therefore hee ſubjoyneth, that hee woulde rejoyce and take pleaſure in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that the power of CHRIST might dwell
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16627:180"/>
in him: He ſaith (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. 9. 10. <hi>And</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10.) <hi>Euerie where wee brare about in our bodie the dying of the LORD IESUS, that the life of IESUS might alſo bee made manifest in our bodies,</hi> &amp;c. When the bodie by croſſes was dying, then hee founde the life of CHRIST: and no ſoule ſhall finde that life without it bee dying. Therefore, if euer thou wouldeſt finde the power and life of Chriſt in thee, bee carefull to feele thine owne weakneſſe and miſerie.</p>
            <p>Yet marke the wordes: Hee ſaieth, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my ſinnes, <hi>the Lord had mercie vpon mee:</hi> And if ye looke to the ſpeach, it importeth a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that euer hee ſhould haue found mercie, vvho vvas ſuch a great ſinner. It is the greateſt vvonder that euer was, that one ſinne is forgiuen to a ſinner, ſuppoſe it were but an euill thought: And if thou ſaweſt that great, inuiolable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſtie, and the greatneſſe of thy ſinnes, thou wouldeſt wonder that euer thou getteſt one ſinne forgiuen thee, let bee blaſphemie and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution forgiuen thee: And wonder thou as thou wilt: all the Angels of Heauen wonder that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould get mercy, &amp; that God loued the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy worlde ſo, that Hee would giue His onelie Son to die that they ſhould liue for euer: and they wondered when <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; the Fathers of olde got mercy: but when Chriſt came into the world to dy for the ſinnes of the worlde, they wondered farre more at that mercie, and vvith chearefull voyce

praiſed GOD for the ſame, ſaying, <hi>Glorie bee to GOD in the high heauens, and peace on earth, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes men good will, Luke</hi> 2. 14.

It is their pleaſure to pierce in to that miſterie, and to looke to that mercie, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, to whom it belongeth, commonlie wondreth not at it. But albeit the prophane man, when hee is ſleeping in ſinne, and going on in an euill courſe thinking it but an eaſie thing to gette mercie: and albeit hee wonder not much when he ſeeth another miſerable ſinner to get mercie, but account it a matter of ſober importance, yet if it pleaſe the Lord once to waken his conſcience, and make his ſinnes to appeare in their owne colour, how great, how vile, and how deteſtable they are, and what it is to offende that infinite and inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Majeſtie, that Omnipotent <hi>IEHOVAH,</hi> who created all thinges, and to finde the terrours and tormentes of that ineuitable wrath and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting paine. And if the Spirit of God leaue him there to his owne ſelfe, and helpe him not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, hee woulde conclude, that there were no mercie for him: and hee would maruell that euer a ſinner ſhoulde get mercie: for hee woulde ſee the juſtice of God, as a wall of fire, ſtanding before God, holding off the ſinner, that hee preaſſe not to come neare to God. So ſuch perſons woulde dite their owne dittie, and giue out their owne doome againſt themſelues. And except it pleaſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:16627:181"/>
the Lord to ſende His Holie Spirit, who ſearcheth all thinges, yea, the deepneſſe of God, out of His owne boſome, to a miſerable ſinner, thus exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to conuoy him through His juſtice, thorowe that wall of fire, and to let him ſee and feele the mercie of God in the Lord Ieſus, he would neuer, nor durſt neuer claime to His mercie. Onelie they who getteth that Holy Spirit, who cometh out of that deepeneſſe, to conuoye the creature to that vnſearcheable deepneſſe, (for albeit the deepneſſe of that mercie bee infinite, yet the Spirit of GOD ſearcheth out that deepneſſe) will acclaime and apprehende mercie: and then ſuch perſons will maruel, that euer themſelues, or any other, ſhould haue found ſuch infinite mercie. And the Sainctes of God, in the kingdome of Heauen, ſhall euer be exerciſed in marueiling at the mercies of God vpon them.</p>
            <p>It is true, that manie vaine wanton men, when they are going on in ſinne, beeing drunken and bewitched with the pleaſures of ſinne, and mad in their damnable courſe, will promiſe mercie to themſelues, and will applie mercie to ſinne, to make ſinne more and more ſweete, as if it were not ſweete enough before: But away with thee, for mercie appertaineth not vnto thee, but wrath and judgement, ſo long as thou remaineſt in that eſtate. Thou art not in that eſtate, that thou mayſt claime to His mercie: for onely the man who hath a ſadde, a contrite, and a broken ſoule, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:16627:182"/>
to mercie, and ſuch a man in greateſt ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ſinne ſhall haue vnſpeakeable joye.</p>
            <p>Nowe after hee hath vvondered at the mercie of GOD, in the ende of the verſe, hee ſetteth downe a cauſe not ſo much vvherefore GOD gaue him mercie, as that GOD was ſo readie to giue him mercie: Hee ſaieth, that hee <hi>was an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant:</hi> and that hee prooueth, <hi>becauſe hee wanted faith:</hi> His ignorance deſerued no mercie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made him culpable and guiltie: For the Lord will not allowe ſuch an excuſe in that Great day: but ignorance maketh the ſinne the leſſe. The ſinne that proceedeth from ignorance, is not ſo great as the ſinne that proceedeth from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for the ſeruant vvho knoweth not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters vvill, and doeth it not, ſhall bee ſtriped with fewe ſtripes: but the ſeruant vvho knoweth the maſters vvill, and doeth it not, ſhall bee ſtriped vvith manie ſtripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47. 48.</p>
            <p>But for the better clearing of this point, vvee muſt vnderſtand, that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth not, that euerie ſinne vvhich is committed vvillinglie and vvittinglie, men knowing vvell enough that they are ſinning, ſhall not bee forgiuen: for in vvhat caſe ſhould vvee all bee into then? Doe vvee not all manie a time ſinne vvittinglie and vvillinglie? Doe not our conſciences challenge vs in the verie act? Will vve not doe vvrong to our neighbour, in his perſon or in his goods, or in his name and account? yes, no queſtion: and vve cannot juſtifie

our ſelues in our doinges: If therefore, they vvho offend God, euen with open eyes, were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without hope of mercie, alas! in what caſe would wee bee into? Hee meaneth not then of all ſins in generall, hee meaneth not of the ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Table againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but by joyning ignorance and miſ-beliefe together, he ſheweth that hee meaneth of the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the trueth of God, which is a far greater ſinne than theft, hooredome, or backe-biting: for they who reſiſt the trueth, doe as much as in them lieth, to pluck God out of His ſeat, and to put out the remembrance of His glorious Majeſtie, that He reigne no more: and they ſay in effect, Let mee alone with God, &amp; I ſhall handle him wel enough, I ſhall bring him to nought, hee ſhall not reigne, I ſhall fight againſt him. Therefore, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch an accurſed ſinne, ſaieth not without cauſe, <hi>I did it of ignorance:</hi> as if he had ſaid, It is true, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Gods name and to treade Gods word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feete, and to perſecute the Saincts of God, is a ſinne that ſurmounteth and ſurpaſſeth all ſinnes, and I am culpable of this ſinne: But what?

Yet for all this,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16627:183"/>
hee ſaieth, hee <hi>was ignorant, becauſe hee wanted the knowledge of Christ.</hi> Suppoſe thou knoweſt all the worlde, and yet if thou knoweſt not Ieſus Chriſt, thou knoweſt nothing. And though thou kneweſt all the lawes in the worlde, all humanitie, all phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, yet if thou knoweſt not Chriſt, thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt nothing.

            <p>Marke againe, hee ſaieth, <hi>becauſe hee was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> therefore hee <hi>was a blaſphemer and perſecuter.</hi> Ignorance is a dangerous thing: they who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Chriſt, they who haue not faith in Him, they who knowe not what a glorious perſonage Hee is, what incomparable benefite Hee brought with Him vnto the worlde, who hath not founde His mercies, who haue not beene ſenſible of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, who haue not founde the image of God repaired in them, and they who haue not found that peace of conſcience and joye in the Holie Ghoſt, they will perſecute Chriſt, and His Goſpell, and His Sainctes. It is a dangerous thing for the Sainctes of GOD to dwell among ignorantes and vnbeleeuers, for ſuch men are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, yea, they are Atheiſtes. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> requeſteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to praye to God for him, that hee may bee deliuered from froward and vnreaſonable men: <hi>for</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>all men haue not faith, 2.

And it is a maruell that the Church of God ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſo long amongſt them: for few is the number, &amp; ſilly is the flocke of God that beleeueth, in compariſon of them who remain in ignorance and infidelity.

Further, think not that <hi>Paul</hi> alleadgeth his ignorance that thereby he may juſtify himſelfe, as if it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault and offence: for no mans ignorance ſhall ſerue to be a cloke to abſolue him before God. It will not ſerue a man to ſaye, I thought not of it, I thought otherwiſe, I knew it not: but if he get not mercy, hee muſt die for his ignorance: but hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth it to let me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee, that it was not of malice &amp; deſpite that he ſet himſelf to fight againſt God: &amp; therfore that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord was more ready to forgiue him.

When he hath told that the grace of the Lord ſuperabounded, he addeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>With faith and with loue in Ieſus Christ,</hi> he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that ſuperabundant grace by a wonderfull mutation and change that was made in him by the power of IESVS CHRIST, that of a blaſphemer of Chriſt, he is made a beleeuer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him by Faith, of a perſecuter and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour of the Sainctes of God, hee was made a louer of them. The ſenſe of the mercy of God, &amp; faith in Ieſus Chriſt, bringeth foorth loue in the heart. And whoſoeuer hath aſſurance of mercie &amp; true faith, his heart wil be joyned with Chriſt and he will haue a great loue towardes Him: then for Chriſtes ſake he will loue all His Saincts: there wil not be a ſoule in the Church of Chriſt, but he will loue him ſo intirely y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he wold giue his life for him, &amp; as he will loue him ſo he will pity him: for he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath faith, wil both loue &amp; pity me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts pity,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:16627:187"/>
and careth not what beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, ſo he bee well hee hath neuer found what was the mercy of God in his heart. Alas! howe few is the number of theſe faithfull ones! how rare a thing is faith in the hearts of men! What argueth this coldneſſe in the heartes of men, this want of loue and pity in the multitude? Nothing but this, that albeit mercy be preached, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude feeleth it not. And if thou hadſt all this world, and yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not of that ſweetneſſe of this mercy of God in Ieſus Chriſt, thou kneweſt neuer what joy, what comfort, what pleaſure was.</p>
            <p>Then in the next wordes hee openeth vp the ground as it were of that mercy that was ſhewed vpon him, which is the generall ende of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt into this worlde: and from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall he concludeth on this manner, <hi>Christ Ieſus is come into the world to ſaue ſinners,</hi> and I am a ſinner, therefore He will ſaue me amongſt the reſt. Before he come to the words of the propoſition, becauſe it is a great and notable ſentence, hee vſeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Ieſus in matters of importance vſed to ſay, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you:</hi> ſo here th' Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This is a true ſaying, and by all meanes worthy to be receiued.</hi> In this preface he prepareth not onely <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> but all that euer ſhal heare this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the end of the world: and he prepareth them not only to the attenſion of the eare, but he prepareth them vnto faith in the heart: ſo that as ſoone as they ſhould heare this ſentence, they ſhould apply
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:16627:187"/>
it with their hearts. Alas! why ſhould ſo worthy &amp; excellent ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as theſe are paſſe away without any attention or preparation on our part? It is true, Brethren, we ſhould neuer come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing of any part of the word without preparation: wee ſhould not come to the holy congregation like as many ſwine, without hauing any regard what wee are doing, but we ſhould come with preparation: &amp; not only with an eare prepared, but with an hart prepared: and when thou entereſt into the Church thou ſhouldeſt ſay, <hi>The Lord prepare mine heart, that I may receiue ſome ſponke of grace.</hi> So a preparation is requiſite in generall to the hearing of the worde. But yet the heart of man would be better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the hearing of ſuch notable ſentences as this is, <hi>Christ is come into the world to ſaue ſinners:</hi> they require a more ſingular preparation. There is no doubt he ſpake through the full aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith, and that which he ſpake, he aſſuredly beleeued: &amp; therefore he ſpake of it. When wee ſpeake of that grace, the heart ſhould riſe with an aſſurance. Look to the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> with what aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it, <hi>I beleeued</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>therefore did I ſpeake, Pſal.</hi> 116. 10. Look to the Apoſtles, with what faith &amp; aſſurance they ſpeake of it: <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, 2. Cor. 4. 13. We haue the ſame Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I beleeued, and therefore haue I ſpoken, wee alſo beleeue, and therefore we ſpeake.</hi> So when thou heareſt or ſpeakeſt of this grace of the Lord Ieſus, ſeek to haue this aſſurance in thine heart, and ſaye, <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:16627:188"/>
               <hi>giue me Thy grace in ſpeaking and hearing of the benefite of Chriſt, that I may ſpeake and heare with aſſurance.</hi> And if ye take heede to the words of the preface, he riſeth vp in commending of this ſentence, that <hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners:</hi> and hee ſaieth not onelie, <hi>This is a true ſaying,</hi> that wee may aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie beleeue: but likewiſe hee ſaieth, <hi>and by all meanes worthie to bee receiued.</hi> Hee welcommeth (in a manner) Chriſt Ieſus comming into the world, he embraceth that ſaluation that Hee brought vvith Him. And would to God, whether wee bee Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or hearers, that wee coulde attaine to that meaſure of grace, that ſo oft as wee name the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, that in ſpeaking of it our hearts may be mooued to embrace Him, and that life and ſaluation which He hath purchaſed for vs. So this preface ſerueth to confirme our hearts, &amp; deepelie to imprint in them the doctrine of the grace of Chriſt of remiſſion of ſinnes, of ſaluation through Him, &amp;c. for by nature there is in euerie one of vs ſuch a miſtruſting &amp; doubting thereof: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> albeit God wold a thouſand times offer it vnto vs: albeit Chriſt himſelfe would teach neuer ſo much vnto vs, yet are we euer ſtill in doubt and queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our owne heartes, whether it be ſo or not. Againſt all this miſtruſting and reaſoning of our owne hearts, we muſt bee armed with this preface of the Apoſtle, as with a buckler, that <hi>it is a true ſaying, &amp; by al means worthy to be receiued.</hi> But to come to the ſaying it ſelf, It reckoneth vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:16627:188"/>
for what is the Euangell in fewe wordes? <hi>The Lord Ieſus, the Sonne of God, is come into the world, by his manifeſtation in the fleſh &amp; taking vpon him our nature, and in it, hee hath ſuffered the moſte ſhamefull death of the Croſſe, for the ſinnes of man, and riſing againe from death, hath paſſed vp to glorie, and all to this ende, For the ſaluation of man:</hi> There is the whole Goſpell. Alas! if we took heed to theſe tithings, our hearts woulde not bee carried after ſo manie vanities. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. 16.) calleth this the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of godlineſſe, and a great myſterie, That GOD is manifeſted in the fleſhe, juſtified in the Spirite, ſeene of the Angels, preached vnto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> beleeued on in the worlde, receiued vp into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c. All this hee ſetteth downe here in a word, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the worlde:</hi> and hee telleth vs it was <hi>to ſaue ſinners:</hi> that wee, who are ſinners, might haue joye, and rejoyce at His comming: for wee ſhould neuer heare nor reade ſuch ſentences, but with joye. But the wordes woulde bee weighed, hee ſaieth, <hi>CHRIST came into the worlde to ſaue ſinners.</hi> What is this that hee calleth ſinners? there are two ſorts of ſinners in the worlde: The firſt are they who thinke they haue no ſinne, they are ſo hardned in their ſinne, they neuer got their hearts opened to ſee their owne ſinne, and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: (for an indured ſinner feeleth no ſinne) but by the contrarie, they thinke themſelues juſt: they are puft vp with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues whole &amp; free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:16627:189"/>
diſeaſe of ſin, and theſe are the greateſt part of the world. An example we haue in that proude <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> who would ſtand vp and juſtify himſelfe before God, &amp; ſay, <hi>I thanke thee, O God, that I am not</hi> a ſinner <hi>as other men, extortioners, vnjust, adulterers, or eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as this Publicane, Luke</hi> 18. 11. But it is not for the ſaluation of thoſe men that Chriſt came into the world: no, mercy belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth not to them, they will neuer taſte of any mercy of God in Ieſus Chriſt and therfore Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 12. 13.) <hi>The whole need not a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> that is, they who are whole &amp; free of the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin in their own conceit: <hi>I am not come to call the juſt,</hi> that is, indured ſinners who think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues juſt, becauſe they are touched with no ſenſe of ſin: and well had it bene for them, if Chriſt had neuer come into the world, for they want not only grace in Him, but by the contrary, by the contemning of the grace that is offered, they heap on co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their own heads. There is another ſort of ſinners, who haue a true ſenſe of ſin, and grone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen thereof, who are ſore grieued in their owne conſciences for it: and it is of theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that th' Apoſtle ſpeaketh here: for Chriſt ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth mercy only on theſe ſinners, <hi>He came into the world to ſaue them only:</hi> therfore He ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>I come to call ſinners to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> meaning theſe ſinners who haue their conſciences wakened with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenſe of ſin: theſe ſinners only He inuiteth to come vnto Him to get grace &amp; refreſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>Come vnto me,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>all ye that weary &amp; laden, &amp; I will refreſh you, Mat.</hi>

11. 28. Theſe ſinners will get grace to heare the word, and wil get their minds illuminated with it, whereas indured ſinners, the more they heare the more are they blinded: and therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 39. <hi>I am come vnto judgement into this world, that they that ſee not, may ſee,</hi> to wit, the penitent ſinners: <hi>and that they ſee,</hi> that is, indured ſinners, <hi>may bee blinded:</hi> &amp; if thou be an indured ſinner, thou canſt not heare the word with profite, thou canſt not be inlightened thereby. But albert thou be a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, an adulterer, an harlot, &amp; the greateſt ſinner that is, if thou harden not thine heart at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word of God, O how wonderfully will it worke in thy ſoule! it wil bring thee to a ſenſe of thy ſin, it will make thee to bee grieued for thy ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to lament &amp; mourne vnfainedly for it: it will make thee to runne &amp; ſeeke for grace &amp; mercy in Chriſt that thy ſin may be done away: an example of this ye haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he had committed adultery &amp; murther: no ſooner is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word preached to him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> but aſſoone his heart is pierced with the ſenſe of his ſin, he confeſſeth &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it, hee is ſore grieued for it, hee crieth for mercy in the Meſſias, to put away his iniquities, as ye may ſee, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Such like ye ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> who before was perſecuting the Church, aſſoone as he heareth the voyce of Chriſt, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is wakened, he trembleth, he is aſtonied, he humble intreateth for mercy, hee offereth ſeruice to the Lord, &amp; ſaieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. And it is onely ſuch perſons as theſe, who are of a contrite Spirit, who tremble at the Lords wordes, that doe get mercie and ſaluation. Then in a word, a humble &amp; penitent ſinner, how great ſo euer his ſinne be, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all get ſaluation. So there is nothing that hindereth thee from mercie and ſaluation, but the malitiouſnes of thine owne heart. It is not Adulterie, it is not Murther, it is not Blaſphemie or oppreſlion, that depriueth thee of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaluation, but the hardnes of thine heart that cannot repent: if thou haſt a contrite heart, and canſt ſay, Woe is me, that I haue offended ſo ſweet &amp; gracious a God, thou ſhalt get mercie. It is an heauie &amp; Iamentable caſe, that ſinners ſhould want mercy for fault of repentance. When he hath ſet downe this generall ſentence, whereon hee groundeth the mercy of God that was ſhewed on him, that Chriſt came in the world to ſaue ſinners, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the particular application, &amp; he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, <hi>But I am the firſt ſinner in the world,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is vnderſtood, therefore Chriſt Ieſus came in the world to ſaue me. Would to God euery ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the world could learne to apply this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſentence to themſelues in the ſame maner that <hi>Paul</hi> doth here, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heart could ſay with him, Chriſt Ieſus is come in the world to ſaue ſinners, &amp; then ſubjoyne, Bot I am the firſt ſinner in the world, that ſa he might apply mercy &amp; ſaluation to himſelfe, for without this application, theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſentences can ſerue for no vſe. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:16627:190"/>
Brethren, ſciences of theſe generall ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are contained in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture, is very good, yea, the knowledge of them is moſt neceſſary: for no man can haue conſcience without knowledge: But it is as true on the other part, that ſcience and knowledge auaile not without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, applying particularlie to a mans ſoule the thing that hee knoweth. As when men know theſe generall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſet downe in the word, if they applie them not to themſelues, the knowledge of them can ſerue to no purpoſe: As for example: when a man knoweth this generall ſentence of the law, <hi>Curſed is euery man that continueth not in euery thing which is written in the booke of the law, to doe them,</hi> if thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it not, it can doe thee no good: But if thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be wakened, to acknowledge thy tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, &amp; conſequently to apply to thy ſelfe that curſe of the lawe, &amp; eternall condemnation, what ſorrow &amp; griefe will it worke in thine heart? what earneſt deſire will it worke to bee free from that curſe and eternall condemnation? Yea, thou wouldeſt bee content to giue all the world to bee free of that curſe, and the heauie burthen of the wrath of God. And Brethren, look neuer for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor ſaluation, except firſt thine own conſcience condemne thee: if thy conſcience condemne thee not, the Lord of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal condemne thee. There is neuer one that is freede from the curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the law, but they who feele their ſin &amp; groane vnder the burthen of it, &amp; get a ſight of their condemnation for ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:16627:191"/>Another example we haue of this generall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the Apoſtle hath in this place, <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is come into the world to ſaue ſinners:</hi> If thou applie it not, &amp; ſay not as the Apoſtle doeth, <hi>I am a ſinner,</hi> it can furniſh thee no joy nor comfort. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when we come to heare the doctrine of grace &amp; mercy, let vs come with a conſcience wakened &amp; wearie with the ſenſe of ſin: for if the ſoules of men and women were weary, &amp; laden with the burthen of ſin, they would feele an vnſpeakeable joye in their hearts at the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doctrine of ſaluation. But becauſe we are caſten vp in a ſenſeleſſe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, our conſciences are aſleep, &amp; the thing that we haue is but a generall motion: therefore it is, that at the preaching of the law there is no ſorrow, no griefe no heauineſſe of hart: &amp; if the glad tithings of the Euangell bee preached, there is no joye nor comfort: And this is the thing that we haue moſte to lament at the preaching of the word, that wee haue no feeling neither of ſadneſſe nor of joy: and therefore the judgement is the nearer. And hee or ſhe that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth hardeſt ſleeping in greateſt ſecurity, ſhall get the foreſt &amp; moſt terrible wakening when the judgement commeth. Nowe the Lord waken our conſciences in time and giue vs grace to take heed to the preaching of the word, and to beware of our ſelues, &amp; euer pray to the Lord for grace: &amp; neuer let neither the memory of His mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſinners, nor of His judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt indured and impenitent ſinners, paſſe out of our

mind. Marke againe: In application when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the generall vnto himſelfe, he applieth not immediately ſaluation, but firſt he applieth ſinne to himſelfe, and then ſaluation: he ſaith not firſt, I am ſaued, but firſt hee ſaieth, I am the greateſt amongſt ſinners, &amp; thereafter he ſaith, I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy. Then take heed to thy application. When thou heareſt, by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſaluation offered to ſinners, take not firſt to thy ſelfe ſaluation, but firſt take ſinne and death: then take life, and apply it to thy ſelfe: Rejoyce not firſt at the preaching of the glad tithinges of ſaluation, but firſt conceiue a diſpleaſure: then let joy ariſe out of diſpleaſure: for joy of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt ariſe out of the diſpleaſure, through the feare of damnation. It ſhall paſſe thy power to finde joye through the ſenſe of mercy and ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before thou find ſadneſſe &amp; heauineſſe of heart through the ſenſe of ſinne and damnation. Euen as ye ſee a ſpring of water will not breake out of a rocke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the rocke bee broken: Euen ſo is it with this effect, No joye can bee to the heart of a Chriſtian man or woman, till the heart be contrite and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſadneſſe through the ſenſe of ſinne: The heart is firſt exceeding heauy and ſorrowfull, and out of that heauineſſe ariſeth the joy: and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier the heart is, the greater the joye is. Would to God we had this ſorrow &amp; ſadneſſe, and the ſenſe of the wrath of God in our hearts for ſinne: for the ſaddeſt heart for ſinne will get the greateſt joy, &amp;
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:16627:192"/>
euermore the greater ſadneſſe, the greater joye. If our hearts bee grieued, and weary with the ſight of ſinne, wee ſhall haue ſuch a ſpirituall joy, as the world knoweth not: And this joy is as ſure an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-penny of that joy of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as euer was. And he that hath that joy that ariſeth from that ſorow in the hart for ſinne, he hath a ſufficient warrand of that joy in Heauen: and hee that hath not that joy, hee hath no warrand of that Heauenly joye: Therefore Chriſt ſaieth, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne, for they ſhalbe comforted, Mat.</hi> 5. 4. Now in this world this joy is mixed with teares, but then it ſhall be a perfect joy, and all teares ſhalbe wiped away from our eyes. Now for Chriſtes ſake put away vanitie and wantonneſſe and let euery one of vs take vp a new courſe of life, that we may mourne and weep vnfainedly for our ſinnes, (for we haue all neede) that in ſtead of this worldly joy, wee may get that ſolide &amp; vnſpeakeable joy that ariſeth out of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: otherwiſe we only enjoy the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but as the diſpoſition of the heart which is required in a Chriſtian, it is farre from vs.</p>
            <p>Yet marke further: His conſcience is not onelie wakened with the ſenſe of ſinne, hee is not onelie touched with a true ſorrow for it, but alſo he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a cleare &amp; plaine confeſſion of it. Then mark it: Before thou getteſt mercy in Chriſt, thou muſt firſt of neceſſity acknowledge &amp; confeſſe thy ſin: for confeſſion of ſinne muſt of neceſſity go before mercy. <hi>Dauid</hi> found this by experience, for ſo long

as he held his tongue, and would not confeſſe his ſinne, he could find nothing but the wrath &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie hand of God againſt him: <hi>My bones</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>were conſumed, I roared all the day,</hi> &amp;c: but aſſoone as hee taketh this reſolution with himſelfe, <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi> againſt my ſelfe, <hi>my wickedneſſe vnto the Lord:</hi> then hee found the Lord to ſhew mercy on him, and to forgiue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment of his ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. 4. 5.

Why ſhouldeſt thou then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with Him? why ſhouldeſt thou not make a plaine &amp; open confeſſion of thy ſinnes vnto Him, that thou mayeſt get mercy? Another thing would be marked: Hee is not content to confeſſe his ſin, but he ſaith, <hi>I am the chiefe of ſinners:</hi> Hee ſaieth not ſimply, I am a ſinner, but the chiefeſt ſinner, the firſt ſinner in the world. Brethren, if we had a ſenſe of our ſin, euen the leaſt ſinner of vs would thinke he were the greateſt, hee would not goe about to excuſe his ſinne, hee woulde not cloake it as <hi>Cam</hi> did, hee would not extenuate it, much leſſe would hee haue a proude conceit of himſelfe, and of his own righteouſneſſe: he would not enter in as that proude <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10, who helde vp his head, and ſaide, <hi>I am not as other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extortioners, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, adulterers, or euen as this Publicane:</hi> The poore

He ſetteth downe next the end of this grace: <hi>But herefore</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>he had mercy on me, that he might first ſhew on me al long ſuffering:</hi> there is an end: another end is, <hi>that I ſhould be an example,</hi> to others in the world.</p>
            <p>Nowe, Brethren, when God ſheweth mercy on any man, it is not for nothing, it is not without great &amp; manifeſt cauſes, for He will not caſt grace lightly away: Indeed He will giue theſe temporall benefits to the wicked, becauſe He eſteemeth not ſo much of them: Hee will throwe a lordſhip, an earledome, yea a kingdome, to a reprobate: but as for one ſpunke of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpirituall grace of Ieſus Chriſt, He will know well to whom He giueth it: He will take good heed to whom Hee giueth one drop of that precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and Hee will loue them exceedingly. Thinke yee not that hee would loue a leprous man well, that would waſhe him with his owne blood? The preciouſeſt liquor that euer was in the world, is the blood of the Lord Ieſus, yea, ſuch is the worthineſſe &amp; preciouſneſſe thereof, that all the worlde will not buy one drop
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16627:193"/>
of it. Shall we not thinke then, that He loueth that man well, whome Hee waſheth with His blood? Shall we not thinke, that He beareth an vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loue to that man whom He waſheth with His Holy Spirit? Marke it, Brethren: Mercy commeth by chance to no man: it is vſually ſaid, Kingdomes come of hap: but it is not ſo with mercy and the grace of Ieſus Chriſt: none gets it but theſe whoſe names are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in the booke of life: none are called to the participation of one ſpunke of that ſauing grace, but they who were predeſtinated from all eternity. And therefore, if thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one ſpunke of grace, count with thy ſelfe, that thou waſt predeſtinated from all eternity to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and count with thy ſelfe, that thou haſt gotten a more excellent and precious thing, than if thou hadſt gotten all the world. Now as He will not lightly giue grace, ſo He giueth it not for the perſon himſelf alone, who receiueth the grace: but Hee will haue a conſequence following vpon the giuing of that grace and mercy: firſt, He will haue the glory of that grace and mercy to Himſelfe: and what more? Hee will ſet him, on whome Hee hath vouchſaſed that grace and mercy, to be a ſpectacle and example of His mercy before the worlde. To ſpeake of the firſt ende, <hi>That he ſhould ſhow on mee al clemency:</hi> that is, that ſhewing ſuch mercy on me who was the greateſt ſinner, Hee might manifeſt and declare the exceeding greatneſſe of His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:16627:194"/>Brethren, the thing that God looketh to in His workes, is, that Hee might bee glorified in His eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall properties: but aboue all the reſt of His properties, Hee will bee glorified in His mercy, He will bee glorified in His power, in His wiſedome, in his juſtice. <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> was a ſpectacle to ſinners of His juſtice, to terrifie ſinners to the ende of the worlde. But aboue all, Hee ſeeketh to bee glorified in His owne mercy. Aboue all things the Lord will haue His loue and mercy to ſhine in the worlde, Hee will haue the creature to glorifie Him in His mercy. What is the cauſe that Hee ſent Chriſt into the worlde? That in Chriſt His mercy might ſhine in the world. What is the cauſe of this preaching of the Euangell? Why is it ſent? That His mercy might ſhine in the worlde: And all the Paſtors ſhould teach and proclaime this mercie of God, and not ſpeake of judgement, but when men regardeth not His mercy. Looke what the LORD will doe, that His mercy ſhould ſhine in the world, Hee will take blaſphemous perſons, perſecuters, oppreſſors, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and Hee will ſhewe mercy vpon them, Hee will make them to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of His mercy in the ſight of the world, that all the worlde ſhoulde ſtand wondering, that the Lord ſheweth mercy vpon them. And there is not one of them who are juſtified by Chriſt, but they are ſpectacles of the mercy of God, ſet before the world, to make the world to wonder at his mercy: that ſo wee may learne to knowe, and deepely to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:16627:194"/>
conſider, the mercy of GOD, not onely by His worde, but alſo by His workes and examples of them that haue obtained mercy. Now to come to the ſecond ende, hee ſaieth, <hi>Unto the example of them that ſhall in time to come beleeue in him.</hi> Then <hi>Paul</hi> getteth mercy not for himſelfe onely, but alſo for other ſinners, who ſeeing this mercy ſhewed vpon him, might reaſon with themſelues and ſay, Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blaſphemer, yonder perſecuter, yonder op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, hath gotten mercy, and may not I likewiſe bee aſſured to get mercy? Therefore, when thou ſeeſt that the Lord is merciful to any man, ſay with thy ſelfe, It is not for nothing that the Lord hath giuen this man mercy: but it is for my cauſe, that I may by his example be ſtirred vp to ſeeke mercy: therefore I will goe and get mercy at his handes. But alas! ſuch is our ſecurity and ſenſeleſneſſe, that howbeit the Lord be continually calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, and offering mercy vnto vs by His worde, and likewiſe by euer ſetting foorth before vs god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men and women, that of vnholy creatures are made holy creatures, to be ſpectacles of His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that by them wee ſhould take example: yet all theſe meanes that God vſeth to teſtifie His mercy vnto vs, mooueth vs not to conſider and take vp His mercy. But bleſſed is that ſoule that can learn by anie of theſe meanes, to take vp the mercie of GOD, and to ſeeke for it: for mercie is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſeſt jewell that euer was. Therefore, when
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:16627:195"/>
thou findeſt not aſſurance of mercy, then be ſorie for it, and ſtriue earneſtly to obtaine it: for there is no ſurer token that the Lord is to ſhew mercie to anie ſoule, than vvhen vpon the ſight and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the vvant thereof the ſoule is grieued, and ſtriueth and endeuoureth more and more to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a more full aſſurance thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vvhen I conſider howe men in this Land are ſleeping in ſinne, vvithout anie remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and are ſo careleſſe to ſeeke to haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mercie, I am afraide, that the LORD is about to vvith-draw mercie from this Nation. The LORD auert His vvrath, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto this ſinfull Nation, for CHRISTES ſake: To vvhom vvith the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe, and glory, vvorlde vvithout end, AMEN.</p>
