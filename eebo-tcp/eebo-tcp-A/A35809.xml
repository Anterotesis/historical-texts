            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS for His Majeſties Paſſing
The BILL of
EXCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I Am not ignorant that you have lately heard Reports to my diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
concerning ſome matters relating to the Publick: and
though I flatter my ſelf (much more I confeſs from your Partiality
to me, than any Merit I can pretend to) that you do not think
the worſe of me for them; yet becauſe one cannot be too ſure of
what one values ſo highly, as I do your Eſteem, I take the liberty to give
you ſome account of my Thoughts of the preſent poſture of Affairs, that
if I am not ſo happy as to continue ſtill in the good opinion you have
formerly had of my firmneſs to the Publick Intereſt, I may learn at leaſt
in what particular you conceive I have varied from it: Which laſt, though
perhaps leſs welcome than the firſt, will yet be own'd as a very great mark
of your Friendſhip, ſince I aſſure my ſelf, you have too much Charity
for me to impute my Errours in this kinde to any worſe cauſe than want
of Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I have had no great Veneration of late for ſome Men,
who though extreme zealous in appearance for things of Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
and particularly for the Bill for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from
the Succeſſion to the Crown, have yet taken ſuch Methods for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that Bill, as (with reſpect to their Popularity) look't to me, as if
they had rather wiſh'd it ſhould be denied, than granted.</p>
            <p>I mean a ſort of men that paſs with the Vulgar for very publick Spirits,
yet are no otherwiſe for the Publick Good, than as they think it may
conduce to their own private Deſigns. If matters be not diſpos'd for
them to leap into a great Place, or to be reſtor'd to ſome Office they
have formerly enjoy'd, and in which they have diſcovered Principles far
different from what they now profeſs: if every one they have a prejudice
to be not immediately removed, or perhaps if they fancy themſelves the
moſt likely to head the Rabble, ſhould things fall into confuſion; they
will be ſure with great appearance of Zeal to preſs things of leſs moment,
and which they think will be denied, leſt any thing that really tends to
Settlement ſhould be granted; and they are for the moſt part gainers by
this, for their Vehemence, which proceeds from dark and hidden cauſes,
ſeldom fails of being miſtaken by the Vulgar for a true and hearty Love
of their Country. I believe His Majeſty will finde theſe men harder, I
am ſure leſs neceſſary to be ſatisfied, than the Nation: And therefore I
hope you will not wonder if I, who care not much for a great Office
if the Bill of Excluſion do paſs, or to be popular with the Rabble if it
do not, cannot heartily concur with all that ſeems to be aimed at by
that ſort of people.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you have heard which way I have declar'd my Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57968:3"/>
that Bill, when I thought it to any purpoſe: But give me leave
(with as little reflection upon the Cauſes of the breach of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as the ſubject will permit) to tell you, what in my poor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may moſt conduce to the paſſing it in the Parliament which is to
meet at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I cannot imagine how popular Speeches in either Houſe,
or angry Votes that are not always backt with the ſtrongeſt Reaſon, much
leſs the Pamphlets that fly about in the Intervals of Parliament, can
ſignifie much to the obtaining this Bill; for to what purpoſe are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the People to prove the neceſſity of that, which they are ſo
fully convinc'd of already?</p>
            <p>I ſhould rather think it worthy the Wiſdom of the next Parliament, to
conſider what Argumens are moſt likely to prevail with the King himſelf
in this matter; and inſtead of ſuch Addreſſes as carry the leaſt ſhew of
Menace in them, which cannot but be offenſive, ſince to ſuppoſe a King
capable of Fear, is the worſt Complement can be made him; inſtead of
angry Votes which may alienate the Hearts of the people yet farther from
His Majeſty, and make him more averſe from granting their reaſonable
Deſires, and conſequently from conſenting to this Bill, to lay before
him ſuch Reaſons for it, as may convince him that it is his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Intereſt to paſs it.</p>
            <p>I do not mention the Houſe of Lords, being too well aſſur'd of the
Loyalty of that Noble Aſſembly, to doubt of their paſſing any thing for
which His Majeſty ſhews the leaſt Inclination. Taking it then for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that this Bill only ſticks with His Majeſty, no Arguments are of
moment to obtain it, but ſuch as ought to be of weight with Him;
and thoſe I conceive to be of this Nature.</p>
            <p>One Objection muſt firſt be removed: for ſince Kings, of all Men living,
ought to have the greateſt regard to Juſtice, we muſt not ſuppoſe that His
Majeſty can ever conſent to this Bill, till he be ſatisfyed of the Juſtice of it.
I ſhall therefore endeavour to prove, not onely that it is juſt, but agreeable
to the very intention and deſign of Government.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me to be an undeniable Poſition, that Government is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the ſafety and protection of thoſe that are Govern'd; and that
where the Supreme power is lodg'd in a ſingle Perſon, he is Inveſted with
that power, not for his own greatneſs or pleaſure, but for the good of the
People. The Tyrannies in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time, and thoſe that continue to
this day in the Eaſtern parts, muſt certainly have degenerated from a better
kind of Government by ſome accident or other; ſince what people can be
ſuppos'd to have been ſo void of ſenſe, and ſo ſervilely inclin'd, as to give
up their Lives and Liberties to the unbounded diſpoſal of one man, without
impoſing the leaſt condition upon him? For admit, according to Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
that Monarchical Government is form'd by an Agreement of a Society of
Men, to devolve all their power and intereſt upon one Man, and to make
him Judge of all Differences that ſhall ariſe among them; 'tis plain, that
this can be for no other end, than the Security and protection of thoſe that
enter into ſuch a Contract; otherwiſe, you muſt ſuppoſe them Mad-men, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to ſtrip themſelves of all means of Defence, againſt the fury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of one of their number, rather than continue in a ſtate of War,
where at the worſt, they are as free to Rob, as they are ſubject to be Rob'd.
'Tis hard therefore to conceive, that Abſolute Monarchy could ever have
been conſtituted by conſent of any Society of Men, (beſides that we ſee
thoſe that live under them, would be glad to ſhake off their Yoke if they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57968:3"/>
could) but 'tis probable they may have been rais'd by the Ambition and
Valour of ſome Prince, or Succeſſion of Princes, or by the peoples ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſuffering themſelves to be enſlav'd by degrees, and ſo being at laſt
forc'd to ſubmit, when 'twas too late to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this Argument, becauſe another depends
upon it, which comes nearer the preſent Queſtion; for if no Reaſon of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
can be aſſign'd, but the Safety and Protection of the People, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
naturally, that the Succeſſion of Princes in Hereditary Monarchies, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be binding, nor ought to be admitted, where it proves manifeſtly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with thoſe ends. I need not inſtance in all the caſes that incapacitate
a Prince to perform the Office of a Chief Governour; but I can think of
no diſability ſo ſtrong or ſo undeniable, as his being of a different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from that which is generally own'd by the People.</p>
            <p>Religion, conſider'd only in a Politick Senſe, is one of the chief Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Civil Government; for the fear of corporal Puniſhments, nay
of Death itſelf, would often prove inſufficient to deter men from refuſing
Obedience to their Superiours, or from breaking their Laws, without
thoſe ſtronger tyes of Hope of Reward, and Fear of Puniſhment in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Life. The <hi>Romans,</hi> of a fierce and rude people, were made tractable
by <hi>Numa,</hi> and ſubmitted to ſuch Laws and Cuſtoms as he thought fit to
introduce, not ſo much by their being convinc'd of the reaſonableneſs
of thoſe Laws, as by the finding a way to perſwade them, that all his
new Conſtitutions were the Dictates of a Divinity, with whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
daily to converſe. This ſenſe of Religion rais'd that People
afterwards to that incredible exactneſs of Order and Diſcipline; and the
belief they had the Gods of their ſide, made them run ſo intrepidly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Dangers, that <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves, that though ſome Nations excell'd them
in Learning and Arts, others equall'd if not exceeded them in Valour
and Strength, 'twas to Religion, and their reſpect to Divine Myſteries,
that they ow'd their Conqueſt of the World. But this very Religion,
that is the Bond of Union between a Prince and his People, when both
profeſs the ſame, muſt of neceſſity produce the contrary Effects, and be
the ſeed of the moſt fatal Diſorders, nay of the Diſſolution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where they differ. The ſame Conſcience that tyes the Peoples
Affections faſteſt to the Prince in the firſt caſe, diſſolves all manner of
Truſt, all bonds of Obedience, in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible that a Prince ſhould ſignifie any thing towards the ſupport
of the People's Religion, being himſelf of another; nor would it ever be
believed, if he could: And how can that Government ſubſiſt, where the
People are unanimouſly poſſeſt with a belief that the Prince is incapable
of protecting them in that which for the moſt part they value above all
other conſiderations? I know no inſtance can be given in this <hi>Northern</hi>
part of the World, even in thoſe Kingdoms that have varied from their
Original Conſtitution and are become Abſolute, that a Prince of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Religion from the People, was ever admitted to the Crown.
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> met with ſome oppoſition; yet ſhe could
not be ſaid to be of a different Religion from the People: for <hi>Popery</hi> was
ſo far from being extirpated in her days, that ſhe found a Parliament
that joyn'd with her in the reſtoring that Religion. But in <hi>France,</hi> when
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a Proteſtant, was preſumptive Heir to the Crown,
the States aſſembled at <hi>Blois</hi> (as all Hiſtorians of that Time agree) had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57968:4"/>
Excluded him, and the reſt of that Branch that were <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
from the Succeſſion, if they had not parted abruptly, upon the Death of
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his Brother. Nay ſome affirm, that the King
himſelf, though of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, was not out of danger of
being Depos'd, upon a Suſpicion of his favouring too much the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Faction, in oppoſition to the League. After the Kings Death the
Hereditary Right was without Diſpute in the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> but he
found none to aſſiſt him in the making good his Title, but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Party, of whom he was the Head, and ſome Creatures of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
that took his part more out of Hatred to the League, than Affection
to him. This Prince was at laſt indeed admitted to the Crown, upon
his Converſion to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
nor would the Generality of the People, who were extremely
zealous for their Religion, ever have truſted one that had been of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
had he not happen'd to be a Prince of incomparable Courage and
Conduct, who through Seas of Blood, and after many Victories, forcing
his Entrance into the Capital City, made his way to the Throne by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
rather than by a voluntary Admiſſion of the People. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
by the way, that the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>France</hi> were ſo far
from ſetting up a Divine Right of Succeſſion above the Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
that moſt of them oppoſed him even after his Converſion, all of
them before; and the Pulpits rung with ſuch bitter Invectives againſt
him, (only upon the account of Religion) as perhaps no Age can parallel.
This I ſhould think might ſerve for Inſtruction to ſome Biſhops, that I
could name, who by maintaining that nothing ought to over-rule the
Hereditary Right of Succeſſion, muſt either confeſs, that their Religion
deſerves not ſo much to be defended as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> doth, or that they
themſelves are not ſo zealous in the defence of it as they ought to be.
Let theſe Aſſertors of Divine Right tell me, if in <hi>France,</hi> at this day the
moſt Abſolute Monarchy in <hi>Europe,</hi> and where the Succeſſion is held moſt
Sacred, a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince would be admitted to the Crown.</p>
            <p>And here in <hi>England,</hi> beſides the conſideration of Religion, that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
is not to be neglected, ſince what ſecurity can be given that Abbey-Lands,
in which moſt Landed men in the Kingdom have a ſhare, would not
be reſtor'd to the Church under the Reign of a Popiſh Prince? The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
that a Prince may be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not change
the Eſtabliſht Religion, is frivolous. For though there may be a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his not attempting it, deterr'd perhaps by the peoples univerſal dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of Popery, or diſcourag'd by the ill ſucceſs of former Attempts;
this amounts to no more, than that he will not bring Popery in, becauſe he
cannot. But is this all that a King of <hi>England</hi> is obliged to do, by the
Oath which he takes at his Coronation? An Oath not only a Crime for
him to take, (if he be a Papiſt) but impoſſible for him to keep. For can
a Papiſt defend that Religion to the utmoſt of his power, which cannot
be fully ſecured but by the ſuppreſſion of his own? Can he be a fit Head
of the Proteſtant Intereſt abroad, who (while he continues of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi>) muſt wiſh there were never a Proteſtant left in the world? If he
be incapable of doing this, that is, if the ends of Government cannot be
obtained in the ordinary courſe of Succeſſion, the State muſt of neceſſity
fall into Confuſion, if there be not an extraordinary power lodg'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
to provide for its preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57968:4"/>
That Power here in <hi>England,</hi> is in a Parliament, and has often been made
uſe of; but I conceive, for the Reaſons above mention'd, never more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>And though the Juſtice of this Bill be very clear, I think the next thing
yet eaſier to prove, which is, That it is His Majeſties real Intereſt to paſs
it. For if this Government be ſo conſtituted, that the King having the
Hearts of his people, is one of the moſt conſiderable Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> but
without them ſignifies but little, either at home or abroad, as I doubt that
is the caſe; and if nothing can contribute more to the alienating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Affections from him, than his denying this Bill, one would think there
needed no other Motives to induce His Majeſty to paſs it. But beſides, I
ſhould not think this unworthy of His Majeſties Conſideration, if there
are ſome perſons to whom he may have a juſt prejudice; and who if they
cannot bring to paſs what-ever they propoſe to themſelves, will ſtill be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to make the Breach wider; whether the denyal of this Bill may
not furniſh them with too plauſible Arguments with the People, to refuſe
ſuch neceſſary demands as His Majeſty may make for the Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or the ſupport of his Alliances; and whether on the contrary, the
paſſing it may not very much diſappoint thoſe Counterfeit Patriots, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from them the beſt pretence they have of ſtirring up the People to
Sedition.</p>
            <p>Nay, who knows but the refuſal of this Bill may exaſperate the Nation
to that degree, that a Title may be ſet up on pretence of a former Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
by the help of falſe Witneſſes, which though as ridiculous in itſelf, as
injurious to His Majeſties Reputation, may yet put the whole Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flame?</p>
            <p>The Expedient of taking away all Regal Power from a Popiſh Succeſſor,
and leaving him only the Name of a King, can be no ſatisfactory ſecurity
to the Nation, unleſs ſuch a Form of Government were ſetled during the
Life of his Predeceſſor. For otherwiſe the Succeſſor, (having a right to the
Crown, which without an Act to exclude him he will have) may not only
pretend that the Predeceſſor cannot give away his Prerogative, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
may ſucceed in oppoſing it, by the difficulty that is always found in the
introducing of New Conſtitutions. Now whether this Expedient (being
put in practice during the Life of the preſent King) be not as good for the
people, as the Bill, I ſhall not now diſpute; but as to the King himſelf, I
think 'tis clear, that nothing can be leſs for his Honour or Intereſt, than to
admit of ſuch an Expedient.</p>
            <p>The Objection that this Bill may Diſunite <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> ſeems
not very weighty. For firſt, we know not but a Free Parliament there,
may paſs a Bill to the ſame effect; but if they do not, the Diſunion cannot
happen, unleſs the Duke outlive the King; and in that caſe, will continue
but during his Survivance, for the next Succeſſor will unite the Kingdoms
again. This inconvenience therefore, if it be at all, will be of ſo ſhort
continuance, as cannot be of weight to ballance with thoſe preſent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Miſchiefs that may fall upon the Nation for want of this Bill.</p>
            <p>Some have fancy'd, and I hope 'tis but a fancy, that the King has made
a Solemn promiſe to his Brother, never to paſs it. I will ſuppoſe the
worſt. If His Majeſty have made ſuch a promiſe, I conceive, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
it is void in itſelf. For if he have taken an Oath at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to maintain the Eſtabliſht Religion, and in order to that, it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57968:5"/>
to paſs this Bill, I doubt no ſubſequent promiſe can abſolve him from
the performance of that Oath. In the next place, all promiſes are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be for the advantage of him that makes them, or of him they are
made to, or both. But the performing this would not only be ruinous to
His Majeſty, but of no advantage to his Royal Highneſs: for how great
ſoever his Merit and Vertues are acknowledged to be, he lyes under a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
that makes it impoſſible for him to come to the Crown (though
this Bill never paſs) but by Conqueſt; and that way he may have it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Acts that can be made to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more to the trouble I have given you upon this Subject,
but that I am for this Bill, becauſe I think it juſt and neceſſary, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is contended for by a Party: for I hold my ſelf as free to differ
with that Party, when I think them in the wrong, as to agree with them
when they have reaſon of their ſide. This may be an Errour, at leaſt may
be ſubject to miſ-conſtruction, in a time that moſt things are ſo; but I hope
you that have known me long, will judge more charitably of</p>
