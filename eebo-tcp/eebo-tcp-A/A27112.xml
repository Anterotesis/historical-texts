            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe not deſire by way of Preface to trouble Thee with many words, but ſomething I muſt crave leave to ſay, that thou mayeſt the better understand the reaſon and nature of this enſuing worke. It may be thou art not unacquainted with a Booke, which now hath beene extant ſome <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>It was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed</hi> Anno <hi>1649.</hi>
               </note> years. The title of it is <hi>Certamen Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſum,</hi> and it containeth in it a Conference, which was held partly by word of mouth, but chiefly by Writing, betwixt the late King and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a ſtiffe defender of the Romiſh Religion. To the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes firſt Plea (I ſpeake of that, which paſſed betwixt them in writing) the King returned Anſwer; but the Marqueſſe replying, the Kings occaſions (it ſeemes) would not permit him to rejoyne, eſpecially the Reply being ſo large, and ſo thick lin'd with quotations, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall and examination of it would require no little time. I know there are <note n="*" place="margin">See the Advertiſement to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perfixed to the late Kings workes ſet forth together in one volume.</note> ſome, who account this Conference no better then ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; which reflecting upon the Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, Doctor <hi>Baily,</hi> he hath lately in a Preface to a <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>It is intituled (as I remember)</hi> Herba Parietis, <hi>or</hi> The Wall-flower.</note> Booke, which hee hath ſet forth of his own, vindicated himſelf, and aſſerted the Conference. For my part, I know no cauſe to queſtion the truth of the Relation, neither, as to my purpoſe, is it much materiall, whether
<pb facs="tcp:40220:3"/>
there were any ſuch Conference; or if there were, whether it were ſo mannaged, as is related. This I ſee, that in the Booke before mentioned (to wit, <hi>Certamen Religioſum)</hi> the Romiſh cauſe is ſet out in great pompe, both Scriptures and Fathers being produced as aſſerting moſt of thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaine, and we impugne, and the Reader is left naked, and unfurniſhed with any Armes and Weapons, wherewith either to defend himſelfe, or to offend his adverſary ſave onely as he ſhall be able to provide for himſelfe, and bring with him. The firſt time that I heard the Booke mentioned, (which was about the laſt Spring it was ſpoken of as a Booke of no little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſo (I underſtand ſince) diverſe judge of it. Yea, I have heard that ſome have ſaid, that the Marqueſſe in this Reply hath done more for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then any have done before him. When I got the Booke, and looked a while into it, though I ſaw no reaſon to conceive ſo highly of it, as (it ſeemes) ſome have done, yet I found in it I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) much more then I expected, ſo much as that I thought it <hi>operae pretium</hi> no miſ-pent time to anſwer it. This I have indeavoured; how I have performed it, is left to Thee (Reader) to judge. The great difficulty in the undertaking did ariſe from the multitude of Authors that are alleged (whether the Marqueſs himſelfe did peruſe theſe authors, or tooke them upon truſt from others, I will not inquire, much leſſe determine) eſpecially conſidering how lax and looſe the quotations are, the words of the Authors being ſcarce once in a hundred times cited, and ſometimes onely the Authour named, many times only the Book, but no Chapter or Section mentioned. In this reſpect it could not be expected, that every allegation ſhould receive a punctuall anſwer, beſides that (as in the <hi>Rejoynder</hi> it ſelfe upon occaſion I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) ſometimes for want of the Authour I had not liberty
<pb facs="tcp:40220:3"/>
to examine what is alleged; but this (I preſume) will not be found ſo frequent, nor yet at all prejudiciall to the maine, ſo much ſtill being ſaid as may ſuffice to take off the force of that which is objected. There is an anſwer already come forth to the Marqueſſes laſt Paper, with which I have to deale. The <note n="*" place="margin">Hamon L'Eſtrange <hi>Eſquire.</hi>
               </note> authour of it is a gentleman of much reading, well verſed in Greek and Latin writers, both Eccleſiaſticall and others, as appears by this work, which is all that I have ſeene of his, though I hear of ſomething elſe that he hath publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not without great commendation. I had undertaken this task before I had any intimation that another was about it: and I think this of mine was at the Preſse before the foreſaid Anſwer came from it. I could not confine my ſelfe to ſuch narrow bounds as that Gentleman hath done in anſwer to the Marqueſſe, (for he hath others alſo beſides him to deal with) the reaſon of his conciſenes is beſt knowne unto himſelfe. I have launched further into the deepe, and have exſpatiated more in the diſcuſsion of thoſe points, which are handled by the Marqueſſe; yet ſo, as that the Reader (I hope) will have no cauſe to complaine of proxility, or to thinke me tedious. I have divided the worke into two parts; in the former part I have indeavoured to ſhew the ungroundednes of the Romiſh doctrine in thoſe points, which the Marqueſſe propoundeth, and the repugnancy of it both to Scriptures and Fathers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any thing he hath alleged in defence of it. In the latter part I have laboured to wipe off thoſe aſperſions, which the Marqueſſe doth caſt upon diverſe of our moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines, and chiefe inſtruments in the worke of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuing lius, Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> partly in reſpect of their Doctrine, and partly in reſpect of their converſation. This the learned anſwerer before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hath not attempted; but I did not think it meete to wave it, calumnies and reproches being more apt to prevaile
<pb facs="tcp:40220:4"/>
with ſome then any other argument whatſoever. Some points of controverſie alſo, which the Marqueſſe taketh occaſion to bring in, having not mentioned them before, are inſiſted on in this ſecond Part. Some perhaps may ſay, <hi>Quorſum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio haec?</hi> What needed all this? theſe controverſies have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bin ſufficiently handled by our writers, both at home and abroad, long agoe. I anſwer, 'Tis true, they have bin ſo: yet if the Marqueſſe thought it not enough that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and many others of the Romiſh party have written largely in that behalfe, but judged it meet to produce his own Plea; I think there is as much reaſon why we ſhould conſider what he ſaith, and that ſome anſwer ſhould be given him, that ſo none may boaſt, as ſome are apt to doe in ſuch a caſe, that becauſe hee is unanſwered, therfore he is unanſwerable. And beſides, though <hi>(Nil dictum, quod non dictum priùs)</hi> the matter be not new, yet there may be (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) a handling of the ſame things in another manner: yea, and diverſe treating of the ſame ſubject, ſomething may be found in one, which is not in another. But (may ſome ſay) there are many other great and groſſe errours of late ſprung up among us, and theſe doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call for our care and diligence to ſuppreſſe them. For anſwer unto this, I grant that the prevailing errours of the times are mainly to be oppoſed; yet (as our Saviour ſaid in another caſe) <hi>this ought to be done, and the other not to be left undone.</hi> Yea, Popery is the grand evill that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Church; and by how much it is the more inveterate, &amp; the more diffuſed, by ſo much the danger of it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it requires the more oppoſition. There is alſo a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warning to <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> Revel. <hi>18. 4.</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will availe us little to come out, except we alſo keepe out of it. And if we would keep our ſelves out of Babylon, we muſt keepe the Babyloniſh Doctrine from finding entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us. This will aske no little care, no humane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:40220:4"/>
in the world (I think) being greater then that which is uſed either for the ſupporting of that doctrine where it is, or the introducing of it where it is not embraced. Shall we thinke that the Romanists are idle in theſe buſy times? Though few doe ſhew themſelves, as the Marqueſſe did, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) with open face; yet we may well ſuſpect that many are working ſo, as that by how much they are the leſſe conſpicuous, by ſo much they are the more dangerous. And as <hi>David</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine caſe ſaid to the woman of Tekoah, <hi>Is not the hand of</hi> Joab <hi>with thee in all this?</hi> So in reſpect of that heape of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox opinions that is among us, may it not be ſaid, <hi>Is not the hand of a Ieſuite in all this?</hi> Diverſe Pamphlets in theſe times have admoniſhed us to beware, and among the reſt one intituled <hi>Mutatus Polemo</hi> (what ever the Authors deſigne were) doth ſpeake not a little to this purpoſe. Before theſe trouble ſome times began, ſome have either expreſſed (as Mr. <hi>Archer)</hi> or intimated (as Mr. <hi>Mede)</hi> that (in their <note place="margin">Arch. <hi>of</hi> Chriſts <hi>perſonall raign on Earth,</hi> Page <hi>50. and 55.</hi> Mede <hi>on</hi> Revel. <hi>11. 7.</hi>
               </note> opinion) Popery ſhall yet againe for a while univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile in thoſe Countries and Nations, out of which it hath bin expelled. If this be ſo (as for any thing I ſee, I may hope the contrary) may it not be feared, that, as thoſe <hi>many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> (as they are called <hi>1 Joh. 2. 18.)</hi> that is, thoſe many heretikes, that were in the primitive times, did make way for the riſe of that great Antichriſt; ſo theſe in our times may make way for the reſtauration of him? And whereas we have heard long ſince of <hi>Romes Maſter-peece,</hi> I ſee not how any Romiſh deſigne can better deſerve this title, then ſo to debaſe the Miniſtery, and to decry learning, as the practice of many is in theſe times. <hi>Hoc Ithacus velit, hoc magno mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur Atreidae,</hi> The Chieftaines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can deſire nothing more, then that among their adverſaries the Miniſtery ſhould be caſt down, and learning overthrown. For then why ſhould they doubt but that they may ſoon reduce
<pb facs="tcp:40220:5"/>
all unto them, none being now of any competent ability to oppoſe them? It is obſerved by thoſe that are acquainted with Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, <note place="margin">

                  <hi>hold forth unto us ſeemes ridiculous, and to picke and chuſe verities according to our owne fancie, and reject as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and forgeries what we pleaſe, as impoſsibilites and fabulous; the Scriptures themſelves may as well ſuffer by this kind of tolleration: for what more ridiculous then the Dialogue betweene</hi> Balaam <hi>and his Aſs, or that</hi> Sampſons <hi>ſtrength ſhould be in his hair, or that he ſhould ſlay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs, the Diſputation betweene Saint</hi> Michael <hi>and the</hi> Devill <hi>about the body of</hi> Moſes; Philip's <hi>being taken up in the air, and found at</hi> Azotus, <hi>with a thouſand the like ſtrange, and to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion (if we looke upon them with carnall eyes) vaine and ridiculous: but being they are recorded in Scripture, which Scripture we hold for truth, we admire, but never queſtion them: ſo the fault may not be in the tradition of the Church, but in the libertie which men aſſume to themſelves to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tradition. And I beſeech Your Majeſtie, to conſider the ſtreaks that are drawn over the Divine writ, as ſo many delenda's, by ſuch bold hands as thoſe: the Teſtaments were not like the two Tables, delivered into the hands of any</hi> Moſes, <hi>by the immediate hand of God, neither by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Angels, but men inſpired with the holy Ghoſt writ, whoſe writings by the Church were approved to be by inſpiration, which inſpirations were called Scripture, which Scriptures, moſt of them, as they are now received into our hands, were not received into the Canon of the Church, all, within three hundred years after Chriſt; why may not ſome bold ſpirits call all thoſe Scriptures (which were afterwards acknowledged to be Scripture, and were not before) forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Nay have not ſome ſuch (as blind as bold) done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? Saint</hi> Hierom <hi>was the firſt that ever pickt a hole in the Scriptures, and cut out ſo many books out of the word of God, with the penknife of</hi> Apocrypha; Ruffinus <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth</hi>

                  <hi>him for ſo doing, and tells him of the gap, that he hath opened for wild beaſts to enter into this field of the Church, and tread downe all ill corne.</hi> Jerom <hi>gives his reaſons, becauſe they were not found in the Originall Copie, (as if the ſame ſpirit which gave to thoſe, whom it did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, the diverſities of tongues, ſhould it ſelfe be tied to one language) but withall he acknowledgeth thus much of thoſe books, which he had thus markt in the forehead,</hi> Canonici ſunt ad informandos mores, ſed non ad confirmandam fidem: <hi>how poor a Diſtinction this is, and how pernitious a preſident this was, I leave it to Your Majeſtie to judge: for after him</hi> Luther <hi>takes the like boldneſs, and at once takes away the three Goſpels, of</hi> Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John; <hi>Others take away the epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>others the epiſtle of Saint</hi> Jude, <hi>others the ſecond and third epiſtles of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>others the epiſtle of Saint</hi> James, <hi>others the whole book of the</hi> Revelation. <hi>Wherefore to permit what the Church propoſes to be queſtionable by particular men, is to bring down the Church, the Scriptures, and the Heavens upon our heads. There was a Church, before there was a Scripture, which Scripture (as to us) had not beene the Word of God, if the Church had not made it ſo, by teaching us to believe it. The preaching of the Goſpell was before the writing of the Goſpell, the Divine Truth that diſperſed it ſelfe over the face of the whole earth, before it's Divinitie was compriſed within the Canon of the Scripture, was like that</hi> Primaeva Lux, <hi>which the world received before the light was gathered into the body of the Sun: this body ſo glorious and comfortable is but the ſame light, which was before, we cannot make it another, though it be otherwiſe: And therefore though the Church and the Scripture, like the light that is concomitant and precedent to the Sun, be diſtinct in tearms, yet they are but one and the ſame; no</hi>

If you admit Sillogiſmes</hi> à priori, <hi>you will meet with many paralogiſmes</hi> à poſteriori <hi>cry downe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Authoritie, and pull out the Scriptures efficacie, give but the Church the lie now and then, and you ſhall have enough will tell you the Scripture is falſe here and there; they who have ſet ſo little by the tradition of the Church, have ſet by halfe the Scriptures, and will at laſt throw all away: wherefore in a word, as to deny any part of the Scripture, were to open a vein, ſo to queſtion any thing which the Church propoſes, is to teare the ſeameleſſe Coat of Chriſt, and to pierce his body.</hi>

                  <hi>admitted to be his owne judge; you of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>left your Mother the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and Mother to all the Churches round about; You forſook her, and ſet up a new Church of your own, Independent to her: there comes a new generation, and doth the like to you; and a third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that is likely to do the like to that; and the Church falls and falls, untill it falls to all the pieces of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. It is a hard caſe for a part to fall away from the whole, and to be their owne judges. Why ſhould not</hi> Kent <hi>fall away from</hi> England, <hi>and be their owne judges, as well as</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>fall away from Chriſtendome, and be their own judges? why ſhould not a Pariſh in</hi> Kent <hi>fall away from the whole County, and be their owne judges? why ſhould not one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily fall away from the whole Pariſh, and be their owne judges? why ſhould not one man fall away in his opinion from that Family, and be his owne judge? If you grant one, you muſt grant all; and I feare me in doing one, you have done all. So that every man deſpiſeth the Church, whilſt he is a Church in himſelfe; rayles againſt Popery, and is the greateſt Pope himſelfe, deſpiſeth the Fathers, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne his own judgment above the wiſdome of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; refuſeth Expoſitours, that he may have his own ſence; and if he can ſtart up but ſome new opinions, he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as worthy a member of Chriſtianity, as if he were an Apoſtle to ſome new found land. Now Sir, though ſome do take the Church to be the Scriptures, yet the Scriptures cannot be the Church, becauſe the Scriptures ſend us to the Church,</hi> audi Eccleſiam, dic Eccleſiae: <hi>others take the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to be the Church, yet this cannot be, for we know not who are elect, and who are not, that which muſt be the Church, muſt be a viſible, an eminent ſocietie of men, to whoſe Authority in caſes of appeale and matter of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to acquieſce and ſubſcribe.

               <p>My Lord, I have not done with you yet: though particular Churches may fall away in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall reſpects of obedience to one ſupreme Authority, yet it follows not, that the Church ſhould be thereby divided, for as long as they agree in the unity of the ſame ſpirit, and the bond of peace, the Church is ſtill at unitie, as ſo many ſheaves of corne are not unbound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſevered. Many ſheaves may belong to one field, to one man, and may be carryed to one barne, and be ſervient to the ſame table. Unity may conſiſt in this, as well as in being hudled up together in a rick with one cock-ſheave above the reſt. I have an hundred pieces in my pocket, I find them ſomething heavie, I divide the ſumme, halfe in one pocket, and halfe in another: and ſubdivide them afterwards in two ſeverall leſſer pockets; The moneys, is divided, but the ſumme is not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40220:15"/>
broke, the hundred pounds is as whole as when it was together, becauſe it belongs to the ſame man, and is in the ſame poſſeſſion; ſo though we divide our ſelves from <hi>Rome,</hi> if neither of us divide our ſelves from Chriſt, we agree in him, who is the Center of all unitie, though we differ in matter of depending upon one another. But my Lord of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> we are got into ſuch a large field of diſcourſe, that the greateſt Schollers of them all can ſooner ſhew us the way in, then out of it; therefore, before we goe too far, let us retire, leſt we loſe our ſelves; and therefore, I pray my Lord, ſatisfie me in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: Why doe you leave out the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and cut another in two? why doe you with-hold the Cup from the Laytie? why have you ſeven Sacraments, when Chriſt inſtituted but two? why doe you abuſe the World with ſuch a fable as Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and make ignorant fooles believe, you can fiſh ſoules from thence with ſilver hookes? why doe you pray to Saints, and worſhip Images? Thoſe are the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which are given by your Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto the Church of Chriſt; of theſe things I would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <hi>Sir, although the Church be undefiled, yet ſhe may not be ſpotleſſe, to ſeverall apprehenſions: For the Church is compared to the Moon, that is full of ſpots; but they are but ſpots of our fancying; though the Church be never ſo comly, yet ſhe is deſcribed unto us to have black eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes, which may to ſome be as great an occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as they are to others foyles, which ſet her off more lovely. We muſt not make our fancies, judgements of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to her, with whom Chriſt ſo much was raviſhed. For Your Majeſties Objections, and firſt, as to that of leaving out the ſecond Commandment, and cutting another</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40220:15"/>
                  <hi>in two; I beſeech Your Majeſtie, who called them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? who told you they were ten? who told you which were firſt, and ſecond?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Scripture onely called them</hi> words: <hi>thoſe words, but</hi> theſe: <hi>and theſe words were never divided in the Scriptures into ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but two Tables; the Church did all this, and might as well have named them twenty as ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that which Your Majeſtie calls the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is but the explanation of the firſt, and is not razed out of the Bible, but for brevitie ſake in the manualls it is left out, as the reſt of the Commandment is left out concerning the Sabbath, and others: wherefore the ſame Church which gave them their Name, their Number, and their Diſtinction, may in their breviats, leave out what ſhe deems to be but expoſition; and deliver what ſhe thinks for ſubſtance, without any ſuch heavie charge as being blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table out of the booke of life, for diminiſhing the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For withholding the Cup from the Laytie, where did Christ either give, or command to be given, either the Bread or the Wine to any ſuch?</hi> Drink ye all of this: <hi>but they were all Apoſtles to whom he ſaid ſo, there were neither Lay-men or women there: If the Church allowed them afterwards to receive it, either in one, or both kinds, they ought to be ſatisfied therewith accordingly, but not queſtion the Churches Actions. She that could alter the</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>into the Lords day, and change the dipping of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed over head and eares in water, to a little ſprinkling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face, (by reaſon of ſome emergencies, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, occaſioned by the difference of Seaſons, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) may, upon the like occaſion, accordingly diſpoſe of the manner of her Adminiſtration of her Sacraments. Neither was this done without great reaſon, the world had not wine</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40220:16"/>
                  <hi>in all her Countries, but it had bread. Wherefore it was thought for uniformity ſake (that they might not be unlike to one another, but all receive alike) that they ſhould onely receive the Bread, which was to be had in every place, and not the Cup, in regard that Wine was not every where to be had. I wonder that any body ſhould be ſo much offended at any ſuch thing, for Bread and Wine doe ſignifie Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; I appeal to common reaſon, if a dead body doth not repreſent a paſsion as much as if we ſaw the bloud lie by it. If you grant the Churches Power in other matters, and reſt ſatisfied therein, why do you boggle at this, eſpecially when any Prieſt, (where Wine is to be had) if you deſire it, he will give it you? But if upon every mans call the Church ſhould fall to reforming upon every ſeeming fault, which may be but ſuppoſed to be found, the people would never ſtop untill they had made ſuch a through Reformation in all parts, as they have done in the greateſt part of</hi> Germany, <hi>where there is not a man to Preach, or hear the Goſpell, to eat the Bread, or drink the Wine: you never pickt ſo many holes in our Coates, as this licentiouſneſſe hath done in yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For our ſeven Sacraments, ſhe that called the Articles of our</hi> Faith 12, <hi>the</hi> Beatitudes 8, <hi>the</hi> Graces 3, <hi>the</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues 4, <hi>called theſe</hi> 7, <hi>and might have called them</hi> 17 <hi>if ſhe had thought it meet. A Sacrament is nothing elſe but what is done with a holy mind, and why Sacrament, either in Name, or Number, ſhould be confin'd to Chriſts onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I ſee no cauſe for it; If I can prove that God did institute ſuch a thing in</hi> Paradiſe, <hi>(as he did Marriage) ſhall not I call that a Sacrament as well as what was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, when he was upon the Earth? If Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the Order of giving, and receiving the holy Ghost, ſhall not I call this the Sacrament of Orders? If Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40220:16"/>
                  <hi>us all repentance, ſhall we not ſay repentance is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? If Christ bleſſeth little children, and ſaith,</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to come unto me, and forbid them not; <hi>ſhall we not ſay that ſuch confirmation is a Sacrament? Truly I doe not underſtand their meaning; They have taken away five, which five, either by God, or Chriſt, or the holy Ghoſt, (who are all one) were inſtituted; and yet they ſay they are not Sacraments, becauſe they were not inſtituted by Chriſt: And the two that are left,</hi> viz. <hi>Baptiſme, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for the firſt, you hold it neceſſary to Salvation; and for the ſecond, you do not admit the reall preſence: ſo that of the two remaining, you have taken away the neceſsity of the one, and the reality of the other, ſo farwell all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for Purgatory, I do believe, we have as good ground for it out of this place of Scripture,</hi> viz. He ſhall be purged, yet ſo as if it were by fire: <hi>as you can prove a Hell out of this place of Scripture,</hi> He ſhall be caſt into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and into the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. <hi>Neither can you make more exceptions to our inference out of this place of Scripture, to prove Purgatory, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt (if wits may be permitted to roame in ſuch things, as theſe once ſetled, and believed generally) will find ground enough to quarrell at your burning lake; and the vaine Philoſopher, Contradictions enough, in the deſcription of the effects of thoſe helliſh Torments,</hi> viz. <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: the one having its procedure from heat, the other from cold, which are meer Contradictions, and therefore fabulous; take heed we doe not take away Hell, in removing of Purgatory. You ſee not, how your laughing at Purgatory hath cauſed ſuch laughing at Hell, and Devils; untill at laſt, you ſhall ſee them bid the Heavens come down, and pluck the Almighty out of his Throne: If a Text of</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40220:17"/>
                  <hi>Scripture with the Churches Expoſition be not ſufficient for a man to reſt, both his Science and Conſcience upon: I know not where it will find a reſting place, it may ſhoot at Randome, but never take ſo right an ayme; and for the ſilver hooke you talk'd of, I do not juſtifie the abuſe of any, I know there is a great difference betweene the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and if theſe Errours were in the Church it ſelfe, yet the tares muſt not be haſtily pluckt out of the field of the Church, leſt the wheat be pluckt up with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for our praying to Saints, there is no body that prayes to any Saints, otherwiſe then as we on earth deſire the benefit of one anothers prayers. We do not believe that they can help us (of themſelves) or that they have power to forgive ſin, but we believe that they are nearer to God his favour, and more deare unto him: and therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he will heare them with, or for us, ſooner then he will hear us when we pray upon our own account: as we deſire the prayers of ſome good and holy man, (whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be ſo) hoping it will be a benefit unto us. All that can be ſaid againſt it, is, that they do not hear us. I will not trouble Your Majeſtie with the Schoolmens</hi> Speculum Creatoris, <hi>but I ſhall deſire to be plaine: When there is</hi> joy in heaven over every ſinner that repenteth; <hi>do you think that the Saints which are there, are ignorant of the occaſion of that joy? or do they rejoyce at they know not what? If the Saints in heaven do crie, How long Lord, how long, holy and juſt, doſt thou not avenge our bloud upon them, which dwell upon the earth: if they know that their bloud is not yet avenged, do they not know when a ſinner is converted? and if they know the time of converſion, do they not know, the time of prayer? If</hi> Abraham <hi>knew that there were ſuch men as</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, who was dead ſo many</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40220:17"/>
                  <hi>hundreds of years before their time, can we ſay, that they are ignorant? think ye, that thoſe miniſtring Angels who are called Intelligencers, give them no intelligence? or that they gather nothing of intelligence by looking him in the face, who is the fulneſſe of knowledge, and to all theſe the practice and opinion of ſo Catholick a Church; God can onely forgive ſins, Chriſt can onely mediate, but Saints, whether in heaven, or on the earth, may intercede for one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, for our worſhipping of Images: confounded be all they that worſhipped them, for me, God is onely worthy to be worſhipped; but if I kneel before the Picture of my</hi> Saviour, <hi>I worſhip him kneeling before his Picture; the worſhip is in the heart, and not in the knee, and where the true God is in the intention, there can be no Idolatrie.</hi>

                  <hi>O Sir, Chriſtian Religion is not a Proteſtation, but a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: it would better conſiſt with unity, then oppoſition: we hold it a peece of popery to knock our owne breaſts with the fiſts of conſtitution, whilſt we hold it moſt Evangelicall, to knock at our neighbours with a Cunſtables ſtaffe: a pious care in a Mother Church, labours to educate her own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and having fed her at her owne breaſts, all the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe returns her mother, is to call her whore, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, Babylon, and all the ſpitefull and vile names that can be imagined; they forget that ſaying of the Apoſtle St.</hi> James: If any man among you ſeeme to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that mans Religion is in vaine; Pure Religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this: to viſit the fatherleſſe and widows, in their affliction, and to keep himſelfe unſpotted from the world. <hi>What ſhould I ſay more, the Scriptures are made a noſe of wax, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold hand to wring it which way he pleaſeth, they are</hi>

No more then I can imagine, that there may be a tree bearing fruit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a root: or that the Sun can be up, before it be day: or that a fire can have no heat; for although it be poſſible, that a man may do ſome good without Faith, yet he cannot do good works without it; for though we may naturally incline to ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as flowers and plants naturally grow to perfection; Yet this good cannot be ſaid to be wrought by us, but by the hand of Faith; and Faith her ſelfe (where ſhe is truly ſo) can no more ſtand ſtill, then can the Sun in the Firmament, or refuſe to let her light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee her good works, then the ſame Sun can appeare in the ſame Firmament, and dart no beams. And whilſt Faith and good works ſtrive for the proprietie of Juſtification; I do believe, they both exclude a third, which hath more right to our Juſtification then either. For that which we call Juſtification by Faith, is not properly Juſtification; but onely an apprehenſion of it: as that which we call Juſtification, by good works, is not properly Juſtification, but onely a Declaration of it, to be ſo: <hi>exempli gratia:</hi> I receive a pardon, my hand that receiv's it, doth not juſtifie; 'tis put in execution, and read in open Court, all this did not procure it me. <hi>Doubtleſſe there is a reward for the righteous, doubtleſſe there is a God that judgeth the Earth,</hi> wherefore upon this ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, <hi>I work out</hi> my Salvation as well as I can: and do all the good that lies in my power. <hi>I do good works.</hi> Doubtleſſe this man hath ſome reaſon for what he doth: it is becauſe he hath ſtore of Faith, which believes, there is a God, and that that God will accept of his endeavours, wherefore to him alone who hath given us Faith, and hath wrought all our good works in us can we properly attribute the tearme of Juſtification: <hi>Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio apprehenſiva,</hi> we may conceive and beare in our hearts: <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio</hi>

               <p>May it pleaſe Your Majeſtie: A great many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between us and the Papiſts might be ſoon decided, if the Churches revenues (which were every where taken away, more or leſſe, where differences in Religion in ſeverall parts of the world, did ariſe in the Church) were not an obſtacle of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union; like the ſtone, which the Crab caſt into the Oyſter, which hindred it from ever ſhutting it ſelfe againe; like the diviſion, which happened between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church. <hi>Photinus</hi> intrudes himſelfe into the Patriarch-ſhip of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> over the head of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the lawfull Patriarch thereof; whom the Pope preſerved in his Communion, and then the difference of the Proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, between thoſe two Churches, was fomented by the ſaid <hi>Photinus,</hi> leſt the wound ſhould heale too ſoon, and the patient ſhould not be held long enough in cure, for the benefit of the <hi>Chyrurgion.</hi> Sacriledge hath brought more diviſions then the nature of their cauſes have required: and the Univerſities play with edged tools, whilſt hungry ſtomacks run away with their meat; wherefore ſince Your Majeſtie was pleaſed to diſcharge the watch, that I had ſet before the dore of my lips: I ſhall make bold to put Your Majeſtie in mind of holding my Lord to the demand which Your Majeſtie once made unto his Lordſhip, concerning the true Church; for if once that Queſtion were throughly determined, all Controverſies not onely between Your Majeſtie and his Lordſhip, but alſo all the Controverſies that ever were ſtarted, would ſoon be decided at a ſhort race end; and without this, we take away the meanes of reconciliation. For I muſt confeſſe ingenuouſly (yet under the higheſt correction) that there is not a thing that I ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40220:20"/>
leſſe, then that aſſertion, of the Scriptures being judge of Controverſies, though in ſome ſence I muſt, and will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it: but not as it is a book conſiſting of papers, words, and letters; for as we commonly ſay in matters of civill differences, the Law ſhall be the judge between us, we do not meane, that every man ſhall run unto the Law books, or that any Lawyer himſelfe ſhall ſearch his Law-caſes, and thereupon poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of any thing that is in queſtion between him and another, without a legall tryall and determination by lawfull Judges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to that ſame purpoſe: In like manner, ſaving knowledge and Divine Truths are the portion, that all Gods children lay faſt claime unto: yet they muſt not be their own carvers, though it is their own meat that is before them, whilſt they have a mother at the table; They muſt not ſlight all Orders, Conſtitutions, Appeales, and Rules of Faith; ſaving knowledge, and Divine Truths, are not to be wreſted from the Scripture by private hands, for then the Scripture were of private interpretation: which is againſt the Apoſtles Rule. Neither are thoſe undefiled, incorruptible and immaculate inheritances, which are reſerved for us in heaven, to be conveighed unto us by any Privy-ſeales. For there is nothing more abſurd, to my underſtanding, then to ſay, that the thing conteſted (which is the true meaning of the Scriptures) ſhall be Judge of the Conteſtation: no way inferiour to that abſurditie, which would follow, which would be this, if we ſhould leave the deciding of the ſence of the words of the Law, to the preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtanding of one of the Advocates; neither is this all the abſurditie that doth ariſe upon this ſuppoſition: for if you grant this to one, you muſt grant it to any one, and to every one: if there were but two, how will you reconcile them both? If you grant that this judicature muſt be in many, there are many manyes, which of the manyes will you have? decide but that, and you ſatisfie all. For if you make the Scripture the Judge of Controverſie, you make the reader Judge of the Scripture: as a man conſiſts of a ſoule and body, ſo the Scripture conſiſts of the letter and the ſence; if I make the dead letter my Judge, I am the greateſt, and ſimpleſt idolater in the world: it will tell me no more, then it told the <hi>Indian</hi> Emperour <hi>Powhaton,</hi> who asking the Jeſuite, how he knew all that to be true which he had told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40220:20"/>
him, and the Jeſuite anſwering him, that Gods word did tell him ſo. The Emperour asked him, where it was? he ſhewed him his Bible. The Emperour, after that he had held it in his hands a pretty while, anſwered, It tells me nothing. But you will ſay, you can read, and ſo you will find the meaning out of the ſignificant Character; and when you have done, as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, ſo it muſt be; and ſo the Scripture is nothing elſe but your meaning: wherefore neceſſitie requires an externall Judge, for determination of differences, beſides the Scriptures. And we can have no better recourſes to any, then to ſuch as the Scripture it ſelfe calls upon us to heare, which is the Church, which Church would be found out.</p>

               <p>Doctor, Saint <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle tells us, that the holy Scripture is that, to whoſe truth the Spirit beareth witneſſe. And <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt tells us, that the Scripture is that which gives a greater Teſtimonie of Chriſt, then <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that if we believe not the Scripture, we would not believe though one were riſen from the dead: and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who raiſed men from death to life, tells us; they cannot believe his words, if they believe not in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that the holy Scripture is <hi>ſurer then a voice from heaven:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us; that <hi>it is lively in operation, and whereby the Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates his power;</hi> and that, <hi>it is able to make a man wiſe to ſalvation; able to ſave our ſoules; and that it is ſufficient too) to make us believe in Chriſt, to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> John 20. As in every ſeed, there is a Spirit, which meeting with earth, heat, and moiſture, grows to perfection: ſo the ſeed of the word, wherin Gods holy Spirit being ſowen in the heart, inlivened by the heart of faith, and watered with the teares of repentance) ſoon fructifies without any further Circumſtance.</p>

               <p>It doth ſo, but Your Majeſtie preſuppoſes all this while, husband-men, and husbandry, barnes and threſhing floors,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40220:21"/>
winnowing and uniting theſe ſeveral grains into one loafe, before it can become childrens bread. All that Your Majeſtie hath ſaid concerning the Scriptures ſufficiencie, is true, provided, that thoſe Scriptures be duly handled; for as the Law is ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine right, and keep all in peace and quietneſſe, yet the execution of that ſufficiencie, cannot he performed without Courts and Judges: ſo when we have granted the Scriptures to be all that the moſt reverend eſtimation can attribute unto them, yet Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot be exerciſed, nor differences in Religion reconciled, without a Judge; For as Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> tells us, who was no great friend to Popes or Biſhops: <hi>Si non una, exors quaedam, &amp; imminens detur poteſtas, tot efficerentur in Eccleſia ſchiſmata quot Sacerdotes.</hi> Wherefore I would faine find out that which the Scripture bids me heare, <hi>Audi Eccleſiam:</hi> I would faine referre my ſelfe to that to which the Scripture commands me to appeale, and tells me, that if I do not, I ſhall be a Heathen and a Publican, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae:</hi> which Church Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle calls the pillar and foundation of Truth, of which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith: <hi>I will place my Sanctification in the midſt of her for ever:</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay,</hi> that the Lord would never forſake her, in whoſe light the people ſhould walke, and Kings in the brightneſſe of her Orient; Againſt which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith: <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile:</hi> with whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>He would be alwayes unto the end of the world.</hi> And from whom the Spirit of Truth ſhould never depart. For although the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that the word of the Lord is clear, inlightning the eyes, yet the ſame Prophet ſaid to God: <hi>Enlighten mine eyes, that I may ſee the marvels of thy Law:</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, that the booke of God hath ſeven Seals, and it was not every one that was thought worthy to open it, onely the lambe. The Diſciples had been ignorant, if <hi>Ieſus</hi> had not opened the Scriptures unto them. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> could not underſtand them without an Interpreter; and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that the Scripture is not of private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: and that in his brother <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles there are many things hard to be underſtood, which ignorant and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed-men wreſt to their owne perdition. Wherefore though as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith: <hi>Omnia clara ſunt &amp; plana ex ſcriptur is divinis: quaecunque neceſſaria ſunt, manifeſta ſunt:</hi> yet no man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40220:21"/>
ever hath yet defined what are neceſſary, and what not. What points are fundamentall, and what are not fundamentall. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation is one thing, and neceſſary for knowledge, as an improvement of our faith, is another thing: for the firſt, if a man keeps the Commandments, and believes all the Articles of the Creed, he may be ſaved, though he never read a word of Scripture; but much more aſſuredly if he meditates upon Gods word with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> day and night. But if he meanes to walk by the rule of Gods word, and to ſearch the Scriptures, he muſt lay hold upon the meanes that God hath ordained, whereby he may attaine unto the true underſtanding of them; for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>God hath placed in the Church Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, Paſtors and Doctors,</hi> to the end we ſhould be no more little children, blown about with every wind of Doctrine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for babes in underſtanding to take upon them to underſtand thoſe things, wherein ſo great a Prophet as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> confeſſed the darkneſſe of his owne ignorance. And though it be true, the Scripture is a river through which a lambe may wade, and an Elephant may ſwim, yet it is to be ſuppoſed and underſtood, that the lambe muſt wade but onely through, where the river is foordable; It doth not ſuppoſe the river to be all alike in depth, for ſuch a river was never heard of; but there may be places in the river, where the lambe may ſwim as well as the Elephant, otherwiſe it is impoſſible that an Elephant ſhould ſwim in the ſame depth, where a lambe may wade, though in the ſame river he may; neither is it the meaning of that place, that the child of God may wade through the Scripture without directions, help, or Judges, but that the meanneſt capacitie, qualified with a harmeleſſe innocence, and deſirous to wade through that river of living waters to eternall life, may find ſo much of Comfort, and heavenly knowledge there, eaſily to be obtained, that he may eaſily wade through to his eternall Salvation; and that there are alſo places in the ſame river, wherein the higheſt ſpeculations may plunge themſelves, in the deep myſteries of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with pardon crav'd for my preſumption, in holding Your Majeſtie in ſo tedious a diſcourſe, as alſo, for my boldneſſe in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding my opinion, which is except (as incomparable <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall pollicy hath well obſerved) the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40220:22"/>
be required herein, as neceſſary hereunto we ſhall be ſo far from agreeing upon the true meaning of the Scripture, that the outward letter ſealed with the inward witneſſe of the Spirit (being all hereticks have quoted Scripture and pretended Spirit) will not be a warrant ſufficient enough, for any private man to judge ſo much as the Scripture to be Scripture: or the Goſpell it ſelfe, to be the Goſpell of Chriſt: This Church being found out, and her Authority allowed of, all controverſies would be ſoone decided, and although we allow the Scripture to be the lock upon the door, which is Chriſt, yet we muſt allow the Church to be the Key, that muſt open it; as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his 38. Sermons calls the agreement of the Apoſtles in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our beliefe, <hi>Clavis Scripturae,</hi> one of whoſe Articles is, I believe the holy Catholick Church. As the Lion wants neither ſtrength, nor courage, nor power, nor weapons, to ſeize upon his prey, yet he wants a noſe to find it out: wherefore by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtinct, he takes to his aſſiſtance, the little Jack-call, a quick ſented beaſt, who runs before the Lion, and having found out the prey, in his language gives the Lion notice of it, who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly (untill ſuch time as he fixes his eyes upon the bootie) makes his advance, but once comming within view of it, with a more ſpeed then the ſwifteſt running can make, he jumps upon it, and ſeizes it. Now to apply this to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Chriſt crucified is the main ſubſtance of the Goſpell, according to the Apoſtles ſaying, <hi>I deſire to know nothing, but Ieſus, and him crucified;</hi> This crucified Chriſt is the nouriſhment of our ſoules, according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> own words: <hi>Ubi Cadaver, ibi aquilae;</hi> Thereby drawing his Diſciples from the curious ſpeculation of his body glorified, to the profitable meditation of his body cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: It is the prey of the Elect: the dead Carkaſſe feedeth the Eagles, Chriſt crucified nouriſheth his Saints: according to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> ſaying, <hi>except we eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his bloud, we have no life in us;</hi> him we muſt maſtigate, and chew by faith: traject, and convey him into our hearts as nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by meditation: and digeſt him by Coalition, whereby we grow one with Chriſt, and Chriſt becomes one with us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying of <hi>Tertullian, Auditu devorandus eſt, intellectu ruminandus, fide digerendus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40220:22"/>
Now for the true underſtanding of the Scriptures, which is no other thing, then the finding out of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and him crucified, who is the very life of the Scriptures; which body of Divinity, is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with no other food, and all its veines fil'd with no other bloud: though this heavenly food (the Scripture) have neither force nor power to ſeize upon its prey, but is endued with a lively ſpirit, able to overcome the greateſt ignorance, yet there is a quick ſented aſſiſtant called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> or Church, which is derived from a <hi>verbe,</hi> which ſignifies to call, which muſt be the Jack-call, to which this powerfull ſeeker after this prey muſt joyne it ſelfe, or elſe it will never be able to find it out; and when we are called, we muſt go ſoberly to work, untill by this means we have attained unto the true underſtanding and ſight thereof, and then, let the Lion, like the Eagle, <hi>Maher-ſhalal haſhbaz</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay cap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3. tells us,) <hi>make haſt to the prey, make ſpeed to the ſpoile.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confirmes the uſe of this Etymologie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Corinthians, viz.</hi> To the Saints called: and the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians cap.</hi> 4. he tells us, if ye would be in <hi>one body, and in one ſpirit,</hi> and of one mind, you muſt be <hi>as you are called in our hope of your vocation:</hi> and in his Epiſtle of the <hi>Coloſſians cap.</hi> 3. he tells us, that if we will have <hi>the peace of Chriſt</hi> to rule in our hearts, that is it <hi>by which we are called in one ſelfe body,</hi> where we muſt allow a conſtitution or Society of men called to that purpoſe, and whoſe calling it is to procure unto us this peace and unitie in the Church, or we ſhall never find it. Thus when diſſention aroſe between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> concerning Circumciſion, their diſputations could effect nothing but heat, untill the Apoſtles and Elders met together, and determined the matter: there muſt be a ſociety of men that can ſay, <hi>Bene viſum fuit nobis &amp; Spiritui ſancto,</hi> or elſe matters of that nature will never be determined: which ſocietie is there called the Church, which Church we are to find.</p>

               <p>My Lord, all this ſhall be done, by the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Marqueſſe called upon me to help him, ſo that he might kneel: and being upon his knees, he deſired to kiſſe His Majeſties hand, which he did, ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I have not a thought in my heart, that tends not to the ſervice of my God, and you: and if I could have reſiſted</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40220:24"/>
                  <hi>this motion of his Spirit, I had deſiſted long ago, but I could not: wherefore on both my knees, I pray to his Divine Majeſtie, that he will not be wanting to his owne Ordinance, but will direct Your underſtanding to thoſe things, which ſhall make You a happy King upon Earth, and a Saint in Heaven;</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">And thereupon he fell a weeping, bidding me to light His Majeſtie to His Chamber. As the King was going, he ſaid unto the Marqueſſe:</hi> My Lord, it is great pittie, that you ſhould be in the wrong: <hi rend="margQuotes">Whereat the Marqueſſe ſoone replyed: It is greater pittie, that You ſhould not be in the right.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">The King ſaid:</hi>God direct us both: <hi>The Marqueſſe ſaid: Amen, Amen, I pray God.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Thus they both parted: and (as I was lighting His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to His Chamber,) His Majeſtie told me, that he did not think to have found the old man ſo ready at it, and that he believed, he was a long time putting on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: yet it was hardly proofe. To which I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I believe, his Lordſhip had more reaſon to wonder, how His Majeſtie (ſo unprepared) could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the on-ſet. The King (being brought to His door,) commanded me, that before I brought him his Lordſpips Paper, I ſhould peruſe it, and give him my opinion of it. Which I promiſed to obey, and ſo returned to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, whom I found in the dark upon his knees, whom I did not diſturbe; but when he roſe, he ſaid unto me: Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, I will tell you what I was doing, I was giving God thanks, that he had preſerved the uſe of my memory for ſo good a work, and imploring a bleſsing upon my endeavours.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">To which I made anſwer: My Lord, no queſtion but you think it a good work, or elſe you would not implore Gods bleſsing upon it. Whereupon my Lord ſaid: Ah! Doctor, I would to God you thought ſo too:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">And waiting upon him into his Chamber, he further ſaid unto me: Doctor</hi> Bayly,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40220:24"/>
                  <hi>you know I am obliged not to ſpeak unto you in this nature, yet I hope I may ſay thus much unto you, without any breach of promiſe, you may be an Inſtrument of the greateſt good that ever befell this Nation. I ſay no more: Good night to you.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>The Marqueſſe his Paper to the King.</head>
               <p>IT muſt be granted by all, that there muſt be (alwayes) in the world, one holy, Catholick, and Apoſtolique Church: one, that it may be uniforme: holy, that it may be certaine: Catholick, that it may be knowne: and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, that it may ſucceed: this Church muſt be either the <hi>Romane,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or elſe ſome other that is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to both. It cannot be any Church which is oppoſite to both: becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not (when ſhe ſeparated from the <hi>Romane)</hi> joyn her ſelfe to any: not to the <hi>Grecian:</hi> for that holds as many Doctrines contrary to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as doth the <hi>Roman;</hi> nor to any elſe, becauſe ſhe agrees with none, no reformed Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, that is, or ever was, hath the ſame articles of beliefe, as hath the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, beſides the <hi>Romane,</hi> ſhe never had a being: and with any other Church beſides the <hi>Romane,</hi> ſhe never had Communion; She cannot be that one, becauſe ſhe is but one: nor Catholick, becauſe ſhe agrees not with any: nor Apoſtolick, becauſe ſhe hath acknowledged ſuch a fine and recovery, that has quite cut off the entaile which would have (otherwiſe) deſcended unto her from the Apoſtles; neither can ſhe be holy, becauſe ſhe is none of all the other three. Now if theſe Attributes cannot belong unto the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40220:25"/>
Religion, and do (clearly) belong unto the <hi>Roman,</hi> then is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Catholick Church. And that it doth, I ſhall prove it by the marks, which God Almighty hath given us, whereby we ſhould know her.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is Univerſality: <hi>All Nations ſhall flow unto her, Eſa. 2. 2.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt: <hi>The heathen ſhall be thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt part of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion, Pſal. 2. 2.</hi> And our Saviour Matth. <hi>20. 14. This Goſpell of the Kingdome ſhall be preached in all the world, as a witneſſe to all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Now I confeſſe, that this glory is belonging to all Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion: yet amongst all thoſe, who do profeſſe the name of Chriſt, I believe, Your Majeſtie will conſent with me herein, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church hath this forme of univerſality, not onely above all different and diſtinct Profeſſors of Religion, but alſo beyond all Religions of the world, Turkes or Heathens: and that there is no place in the world, where there are not <hi>Romance</hi> Catholicks; which is manifeſtly wanting to all other Religions, whatſoever: Now I hope Your Majeſtie cannot ſay ſo of any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion: neither that Your Majeſtie will call all thoſe who proteſt againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwiſe then <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> but not <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Catholicks, or Catholicks of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, being they are not religated within the ſame Communion, and fellowſhips: for then Religion would conſiſt in proteſtation rather then unity; in Nations falling off from one another, rather then all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flowing to one another: neither is it a Conſideration altogether invalid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath kept poſſeſsion of the name; all along other reformed Churches, leaving her in poſſeſsion of the name, and taking unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves new names according to their ſeverall founders: except the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (who is now her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40220:25"/>
like a Chapter that is full of nothing elſe) whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſuch a one, whoſe name it may be they were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to owne.</p>
               <p>For antiquity, if we ſhould <hi>inquire after the old paths, which is the good way, and walke therein;</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> adviſeth us: if we ſhould take our Saviours rule, <hi>Ab initio autem, non fuit ſic:</hi> if we ſhould obſerve his ſaying, how the <hi>good ſeed</hi> was firſt ſowed, and then the <hi>tares:</hi> If we ſhould <hi>conſider the pit from whence we were dug, and the rock from whence we were hewen,</hi> we ſhall find antiquity more applicatory to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church. But you will ſay, your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is as ancient as ours; having its procedure from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles: ſo ſay the <hi>Lutheran Proteſtants,</hi> with their Doctrine of Conſubſtantiation: and many other ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> having other Tenents, altogether contrary to what you hold: how ſhall we reconcile you? ſo ſay all hereticks that ever were, how ſhall we confute them? a part to ſet up themſelmes againſt the whole, and by the power of the ſword, to make themſelves Judges in their owne cauſes, is dealing, that were it your caſe, I am ſure you would think it very hard, I wiſh you may never find it ſo.</p>
               <p>For Viſibility: Our Saviour compares his Church to <hi>a Citie placed on a hill,</hi> according unto the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>a Tabernacle in the Sun:</hi> It is likewiſe compared unto <hi>a candle in a candle-ſtick: not under a buſhell:</hi> and ſaith our Saviour, <hi>If they ſhall ſay unto you, behold, he is in the deſart, go ye not forth; Behold, he is in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places, believe it not;</hi> forewarning us againſt obſcure and inviſible Congregations: Now I beſeech Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, whether ſhould I betake my ſelfe, to a Church that was alwayes viſible, and gloriouſly eminent; or to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40220:26"/>
Church that was never eminent, and for the moſt part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; ſhrowding their defection, under an Apoſtolicall Expreſsion, of a <hi>woman</hi> in the Revelation, <hi>who fled into the wilderneſſe for a thouſand years?</hi> as if an allegory, could wipe out ſo many clear texts of Scripture, as are ſet down by our Saviour, and the Prophets, concerning the Churches inviſibility? And I could not find any Church in the world to whom that Propheſie of <hi>Eſay</hi> might more fitly appertain, then to the Church of <hi>Rome: I have ſet watch-men upon the walls, which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night,</hi> which I am ſure no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church can apply to her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to ſay, I maintaine the ſame Faith and Religion which the Apoſtles taught, and therefore, I am of the true Church, ancient, and viſible enough; becauſe (as I have ſaid before) every heretick will ſay as much: but if you cannot by theſe marks of the Church, (ſet down in Scripture) clear your ſelves to be the true Church, you vainly appeale to the Scriptures ſiding with you in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point: for what can be more abſurd, then to appeale from Scripture, (ſetting things down clearly) unto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſetting down things more obſcurely? There is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point of Doctrine in the holy Scripture ſo manifeſtly ſet downe, as that concerning the Church, and the Markes thereof: nothing ſet down more copious and perſpicuous then the viſibility, perpetuitie, and amplitude of the Church.</p>
               <p>So that Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did not ſtick to ſay, that the Scriptures were more clear about the Church, then they were about Chriſt. Let him anſwer for it. He ſaid ſo in his book, <hi>de unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> and this (he ſaid) was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: becauſe, God (in his wiſdome) would have the Church to be deſcribed without any ambiguity, that all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40220:26"/>
about the Church may be clearly decided: whereby que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about particular Doctrines, may find determinations in her judgement: and that Viſibility might ſhew the way unto the moſt rude and ignorant: and I know not any Church, to whom it may more juſtly be attributed, then to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> whoſe Faith (as in the beginning was ſpread through the whole world) ſo (all along) and at this day, it is generally known among all nations. Next to this, I prove the Catholick Church to be the <hi>Romane;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, a lawfull ſucceſsion of Paſtors is required in every true Church, according to the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> his Prophecie concerning her, <hi>viz. My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, for ever;</hi> This ſucceſsion I can find onely in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> This ſucceſsion they onely can prove; nons elſe offering to go about it. This ſucceſsion Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſayes, kept him in that Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſucceſsion of Prieſts, from the very ſeat of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhop of his time. And <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> reckons all the <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhops from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Syricius,</hi> who then was Pope: and by this, he ſhewed and made it his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the true Church was not with the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> bidding them, to ſhew the originall of their Chayre; this no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> did, or ever can doe: The <hi>Romane</hi> Church gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops Commiſsion to preach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, as they have delivered it unto them; but they never gave them any Commiſsion to preach againſt her Religion: which Biſhops being turned out, for obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>depoſitum</hi> (wherewith they were inſtructed) and new Biſhops choſen in their room (by her, who not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe with being a nurſing mother thereof, muſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40220:27"/>
needs be head of the child: and moderatrix in the ſame Church, wherein by the Apoſtles precept ſhe is forbidden to ſpeak) the ſucceſsion was broke off: the branch cut off from the body, becoming no part of the tree, fit for nothing but to be chopt into ſmaller pieces, and ſo fitted for the fire; this proofe of ſucceſsion the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> thought ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for proving their Church to be the true Church, that they affirmed themſelves to be conſecrated by Catholick Biſhops, their Predeceſſors, which (never proved) argues the interruption, and affirming it, ſhews how that (in their owne opinion the ſucceſsion could not hold in the inferiour Miniſters (as indeed it cannot) for as there is a continued ſupply of Embaſſadours in all places, yet the ſucceſsion is in the royall race: ſo though all vacancies are repleniſhed by Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet the ſucceſsion of the Authority was in the Biſhops, as deſcended (to them) from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, according to our Saviours rule: <hi>I will be with you alwayes unto the end of the world;</hi> Which Affirmation of theirs, argues that their calling is ſufficient without it: and in that they would faine derive it from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it argues, that that is the true Church: and yet they would forſake her, ſuppoſing her to have errors, when that Reformation it ſelfe was but a ſuppoſition; for ſeeing they hold that their Church may erre, they can be certain of nothing: and whilſt (for errors ſake) they forſake the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in forſaking her) may be in the greateſt error of all: where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Succeſsion, nor aſſurance, I muſt leave her to her ſelfe, and your Majeſtie to judge.</p>
               <p>Next: I prove the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, to be the true Church, by her unity in Doctrine: for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> requires all the Churches children to be <hi>of one mind.</hi> viz. <hi>I beſeech you, that all ſpeak one thing; Be ye knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40220:27"/>
                  <hi>in one mind, and one Judgement, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to keep the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. <hi>4. 3. The multitude of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, were of one heart, and of one ſoul,</hi> Act. <hi>4. 32.

This Unity I find no where but in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for Doctrine, whereas the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine, like the hereſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> divided it ſelfe into ſeverall Sects, and to that of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> which were cut into ſmall threds, in ſo much, that among the many Religions which are lately ſprung up, and the ſub, ſub, ſub-diviſions under them: each one (pretending to be the true <hi>Proteſtant)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the other: and all of them together, no more likely to be bound up in the bond of peace, then a bundle of thornes, can expect binding with a rope of ſand; In vaine is their excuſe, if non-diſagreement in fundameatalls: for they diſ-agree amongst themſelves about the Sacrament: for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> hold Conſubſtantiation: but the Church of <hi>England</hi> no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>Some, that Chriſt deſcended into hell: others not. The Church of <hi>England</hi> maintain their King to be the head of the Church: The <hi>Helvetians</hi> will acknowledge no ſuch matter: the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will acknowledge no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the <hi>Independent</hi> will acknowledge no ſuch matter: Concerning the Government of the Church by Biſhops, ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> maintaine it to be <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> others,

And I believe that theſe are fundamentalls; If they cannot agree upon their Principalls, how ſhall they agree upon the deductions thence? If theſe be not fundamentall points, how come <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to fight againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>The diſagreement is not ſo amongst the <hi>Romane</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: for all points of the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, that have been defined by the Church, in a generall Councell, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon exactly, by all nations, tongues and people, <hi>uibicunque terrarum:</hi> but in thoſe points which are not determined by the Church, the Church leaves every man to abound in his owne ſenſe; and therefore all the heat that is either between the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and the <hi>Scoliſts:</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> either concerning the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bleſſed <hi>Lady,</hi> or the concurrence of Grace, and free-will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being points, wherein the Church hath not interpoſed her decrees, is no more prejudicall or objectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall againſt the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Unitie, then the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Schools of our Univerſities are prejudiciall to the <hi>39.</hi> Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But in each
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40220:28"/>
ſeverall <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Dominion there are certain ſeverall Articles of beliefe, belonging to ſeverall <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in which ſeverall agreements, not any one, agrees with any of all the reſt; neither is there any poſsibility they ſhould: being there is no means acknowledged, nor power ordained, whereby they ſhould be gathered together in one councell, whereby they might be of one heart, and of one ſoule: neither is there this Unitie in any one particular Dominion: as is in the Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; for they are all in pieces amongst themſelves, even in their owne ſeverall Dominions, practiſing diſobedience to their Superiours, they teach it to their Inferiours.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Unitie the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have, is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but in not believing: in knowing, rather what they are againſt, then what they are for; not ſo much in knowing what they would have, as in knowing what they would not have. But let theſe negative Religions take heed they meet not with a negative Salvation.</p>
               <p>Neither can the <hi>Converſion of Nations</hi> be attributed to any other Church then to the <hi>Roman,</hi> which is another mark of the true Church, according to the Propheſies of Eſay cap. <hi>49. 23.

But the <hi>Romane</hi> Church I find ſtretching forth her armes, from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> receiving and imbracing all within her Communion; For the firſt three hundred years, the Church grew down-ward, like a ſtrong building, whoſe foundations are firſt laid in the earth, whoſe ſtones are knit together in Unity by the morter that was tempered with the blood of her ten Perſecutions. Afterwards this building, haſting upwards, <hi>Conſtantine the great Emperour, ſubmitting his neek unto the yoke of Chriſt, ſubdued all Chriſtian Churches to Pope</hi> Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter, <hi>then Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>from which time to theſe our dayes the Pope and his Clergy hath poſſeſſed the outward and viſible Church</hi> as is confeſſed by <hi>Napier,</hi> a learned <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in his treatiſe upon the <hi>Revelation</hi> pag. <hi>145.</hi> and all along hath added Kingdomes upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to her Communion: untill ſhe had incorporated into her ſelfe, not onely <hi>Europe,</hi> but <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica:</hi> as <hi>Simon Lythus,</hi> a Proteſtant writer, affirmeth, <hi>viz. The</hi> Jeſuits <hi>have filled</hi> Aſia, Africa <hi>and</hi> America <hi>with their Idols</hi> (as he calls them) for the late Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> if you read <hi>Joan. Petrus Maffeus Hiſt. Indicarum, Joſ. Acoſta de natur. novi orbis:</hi> You ſhall find that no Church in the world hath ever ſpread ſo farre and wide, as the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40220:29"/>
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore I hope in this reſpect (alſo) I may ſafely conclude that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> moſt juſtly deſerves to be called the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Neither is it a vainer thing, to ſay, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be head of the Church, becauſe Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is head thereof; then it is for a man to ſay, that the King of <hi>England</hi> cannot be King of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe <hi>God is King of all the earth,</hi> Pſal. <hi>46. 8.</hi> As if the King could not be Gods Vice-gerent, and the peoples viſible God: ſo the Pope Chriſts Vicar or Deputy, and the Churches vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible head. And let Kings beware how they give way to ſuch Arguments as theſe, leſt at the laſt ſuch inferences be made upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>As ſtrange an inference is that, how that the Church was not built upon <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe it was built upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion; as if it might not be built caſually upon the one, and formally upon the other: as if both theſe could not ſtand together. As if the Confeſsion of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith might not be the cauſe why Chriſt built his Church upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as if Chriſt did not as well (perſonally) tell him, <hi>Tu es Petrus:</hi> as (ſignificantly) <hi>ſuper hanc Petram (id eſt, ſuper iſtam Confeſſionem) aedificabo Eccleſiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No leſſe invalid is that Objection of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oeconomacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Greg.</hi> ſometimes Biſhop of that ſea, <hi>viz. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled himſelf univerſall Biſhop, exalted himſelf like</hi> Lucifer, <hi>above his brethren, and was a fore-runner of Antichriſt:</hi> As if there were no more meanings in the word Univerſality than one: as if there were not a Metaphoricall as well as a Literall and Grammaticall ſenſe: as if Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> might not cenſure this title of Univerſality in the Grammaticall, and excluſive meaning, (which being ſo taken, would have excluded all other Biſhops from their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40220:30"/>
Offices, Eſſences, and Proprieties which they held under Chriſt) thereby depriving them of the Key of orders, and yet ſtill keep the Superiority, <hi>(viz.</hi> of one Biſhop over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and himſelf over all in a Metaphoricall and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſe) thereby ſtill keeping the Key of Juriſdiction in his own hands; and this not onely is, but must be the meaning of Saint <hi>Gregory;</hi> for he thus explicates the matter himſelf, <hi>lib. 4. ind. 13. cp. 32.</hi> viz. <hi>The care of the Church hath been committed to the Prince of all the Apoſtles, Saint</hi> Peter: and yet had Saint <hi>Peter</hi> called himſelfe the Univerſall Apoſtle; in the firſt ſence (ſeeing that Chriſt Jeſus made other Apoſtles as well as him) he had been no Apoſtle himſelf, but Antichriſt; and yet this hindred not, but that the care and principality was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>Peter:</hi> Whereby you may plainly ſee, how he aſcribes a head-ſhip over the Church, whilſt he denies the Univerſality of Epiſcopacy. Wherefore, having ſhewed Your Majeſty my Church, I humble beg, that You will be pleaſed either to give me a few lines in anſwer hereunto, or elſe to ſhew me Yours.</p>

               <p>Our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, we muſt not ſo much <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to what has been ſaid by them of old time,</hi> Mat. 21. 12. as to that which <hi>he</hi> ſhall <hi>tell you,</hi> where <hi>Auditis dictum eſſe antiquis</hi> is exploded: and <hi>Ego dico vobis</hi> is come in its place, which of them all can attribute that credit to be given unto him, as is to be given to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Yet he would not have us to be followers of him more, then he is a follower of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1.

We are all of us in <hi>gremio Eccleſiae;</hi> ſo that controverſies cannot be decided by the Catholick Church, but by the Scriptures, which is the thing by which the neareneſſe unto truth muſt be decided; for that which muſt determine truth muſt not be fallible: but whether you mean the conſent of Fathers, or the decrees of generall Counſels, they both have erred; I diſcover no Fathers nakedneſſe; but deplore their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that we ſhould not truſt in armes of fleſh: <hi>Tertullian</hi> was a montaniſt; <hi>Cyprian</hi> a rebaptiſt; <hi>Origen,</hi> an Anthropomorphiſt; <hi>Heirom,</hi> a Monoganiſt; <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> an Angeliſt; <hi>Euſebius,</hi> an Arrian; Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had written ſo many errors, as occaſioned the writing of a whole booke of retractations: they have often times contradicted one another, and ſometimes themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now for generall Counſels: Did not that <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Ariminenſe,</hi> conclude for the Arrian hereſie? Did not that <hi>Concilium Epheſinum,</hi> conclude for the Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian hereſie? Did not that <hi>Concilium Carthaginenſe,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay more? when the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſſe obnoxious to error, either in life or doctrine, more to be preferred then any, or all the world beſides; one of them betraies his Saviour, another denies him; all forſake him. They thought <hi>Chriſts Kingdome to have been of this world;</hi> and a promiſe onely unto the Jewes, and not unto the Gentiles; and this after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>They wondered that <hi>the holy Ghoſt ſhould fall upon the Gentiles.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> twice <hi>worſhipped the Angel,</hi> and was rebuked for it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 8.

Not onely <hi>Peter,</hi> but other of the Apoſtles, were ignorant, how the word of God was to be preached unto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But who then ſhall rowl away the ſtone from the mouth of the monument? Who ſhall expound the Scriptures to us? one puls one way, and another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: by whom ſhall we be directed?</p>

               <p>But firſt to the removall of thoſe rubs in our way; and then I ſhall ſhew as much reverence to the Scripture as any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the world; and ſhall endeavour to ſhew your Majeſty that the Scriptures are the Baſis or foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Church is built.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty was pleaſed to urge the errors of certaine Fathers, to the prejudice of their authority; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive would have been ſo, had they been all <hi>Montaniſts, Rebaptiſts, all Anthropomorphiſts,</hi> and all of them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally guilty of the faults, wherewith they were ſeverally charged in the particulars: ſeeing that when we produce a Father, we doe not intend to produce a man in whoſe mouth was never found guile: the infallibility being never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by us, otherwiſe then unto the Church, not unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church-men: as Your Majeſty hath moſt excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, in the failings of the holy Apoſtles, who erred after they had received the holy Ghoſt, in ſo ample manner: but when they were all gathered together in Councell, and could ſend about their <hi>edicts,</hi> with theſe capitall letters in the front, <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis,</hi> Acts <hi>15. 28.</hi>

then I hope your Majeſty cannot ſay, that it was poſsible for them to erre.</p>
               <p>So, though the Fathers might erre in particulars, yet thoſe particular errors would be ſwallowed up in a generall Councel, and be no more conſiderable in reſpect of the whole, then ſo many heat-drops of error, can ſtand in competition with a cloud of witneſſes, to the divine truth; and be no more prejudicicall to their generall determinations, then ſo many exceptions, are prejudiciall to a generall rule. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a particular defection in any man any exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his teſtimony, except it be in the thing wherein he is deficient; for otherwiſe we ſhould be of the nature of the flies, who onely prey upon corruption, leaving all the reſt of the body that is whole unregarded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Your Majeſty taxes generall Councels for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting errors. If Your Majeſty would be pleaſed to ſearch into the times wherein thoſe Councels were called, Your Majeſty ſhall find, that the Church was then under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how that <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperours, rather made Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Divines, then called any Generall Councels; and if we ſhould ſuppoſe them to be generall and free Councels, yet they could not be erroneous in any particular mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill a like generall Councell ſhould have concluded the former to be erroneous; (except you will allow particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to condemne generalls, and private men the whole Church) all generall Councels, from the firſt unto the laſt that ever were, or ſhall be, makes but one Church: and though in their intervals, there be no ſeſsion of perſons, yet there is perpetuall virtue in their decretals, to which every man ought to appeale for judgement, in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. Now as it is a maxim in our law, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit regi:</hi> ſo it is a maxim in divinity, <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tempus occurrit deo: Ubi deus eſt,</hi> as he promiſed, <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40220:35"/>
                  <hi>will be with you alwaies unto the end of the world;</hi> that is with his Church, in directing her chief Officers, in all their conſultations, relating either to the truth of her doctrine, or the manner of her diſcipline: wherefore if it ſhould be granted, that the Church had at any time deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined amiſſe; the Church cannot be ſaid to have erred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you muſt not take the particular time for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; becauſe the Church is as well Catholick for time as territory; except that you will make rectification an error.</p>
               <p>For as in civil affairs, if that we ſhould take advantage of the Parliaments nulling former acts; and thereupon conclude, that we will be no more regulated by its lawes, we ſhould breed confuſion in the Common-wealth; for as they alter their laws, upon experience of preſent inconveniences; ſo the Councels change their decrees according to that <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge</hi> which the holy writ aſſures us, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the latter daies; provided that this knowledge be improved by means approved of, and not by every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick, that ſhall oppoſe himſelfe againſt the whole Church.</p>
               <p>If I recall my own words, it is no error, but an avoidance of error: ſo where the ſame power rectifies it ſelfe, though ſome things formerly have been decreed amiſſe, yet that cannot render the decrees of generall Councels not binding, or incident to error, <hi>quoad ad nos;</hi> though in themſelves, and <hi>pro tempore,</hi> they may be ſo.</p>
               <p>As to Your Majeſties objecting the errors of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and pen-men of the holy Ghoſt; and Your inference thereupon, viz. <hi>That truth is no where to be found but in holy Scripture;</hi> under Your Majeſties correction, I take this to be the greateſt argument againſt the private ſpirit (urged by your Majeſty) its leading us into all truth, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40220:35"/>
could poſsibly be found out. For if ſuch men (as they) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the holy Ghoſt, inabled with the power of working miracles; ſo ſanctified in their callings, and enlightened in their underſtandings could erre: how can any man (leſſe qualified) aſſume to himſelfe a freedome from not erring, by the aſsiſtance of a private ſpirit?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as to Your Majeſties quotations of ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the Scriptures eaſineſſe and plainneſſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. If the Scriptures themſelves doe tell us, that they are hard to be underſtood, ſo that <hi>the unlearned and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wreſt them to their owne deſtruction: 2</hi> Peter <hi>3. 16.</hi> and if the Scripture tells us, that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> could not <hi>underſtand them except ſome man ſhould guide him:</hi> as <hi>Acts 8. 13.</hi> and if the Scripture tells us, that Chriſts owne Diſciples could not underſtand them, untill Chriſt himſelfe <hi>expounds them unto them,</hi> as <hi>Luke 24, 25.</hi> and if the Scriptures tell us, how the Angel wept much, <hi>becauſe no man was able either in heaven or earth to open the Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, nor to look upon it:</hi> as <hi>Apoc. 5. 1.</hi> then certainly all theſe ſayings of theirs are either to be ſet to the errata's that are behind their books, or elſe we muſt look out ſome other meaning of their words, then what Your Majeſty hath inferr'd from thence; as thus, they were eaſie, <hi>id eſt, in aliquibus,</hi> but not in <hi>omnibus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> or thus, they were eaſie as to the attainment of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſalvation, but not as to the generall cogniſance of all the divine myſtery therein contained, requiſite for the Churches underſtanding, and by her alone, and her conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and diſcuſments (guided by an extraordinary and promiſed aſsiſtance) onely to be found out; of which as to every ordinary man, this knowledge is not neceſſary, ſo hereof he is not capable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we hold the reall preſence; you deny it: we ſay his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40220:36"/>
body is there: you ſay there is nothing but bare bread: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Mat. 20. 26. Take, eat, this is my body,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke 22. 19. This is my body which is given for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay that the bread which we muſt eat in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is but dead bread; Chriſt ſaith that that bread <hi>is living bread:</hi> you ſay <hi>how can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> we ſay that that was the objection of Jews, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, <hi>(1 John 6. 25.)</hi> not of Chriſtians and believers: you ſay it was ſpoken figuratively; we ſay it was ſpoken really, <hi>re vera,</hi> or as we tranſlate it <hi>indeed,</hi> John <hi>6. 55.</hi> But as the Jews did, ſo doe ye, Firſt, <hi>murmur that Chriſt ſhould be bread,</hi> John. <hi>6. 41.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that that bread ſhould be fleſh,</hi> Iohn <hi>6. 52.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>that that fleſh ſhould be meat indeed,</hi> John <hi>6. 55.</hi> untill at laſt you cry out with the unbelievers, <hi>this is a hard ſaying, who can heare it?</hi> Iohn <hi>6. 60.</hi> had this been but a figure, certainly Chriſt would have removed the doubt, when he ſaw them ſo offended at the reality, <hi>John. 6. 61.</hi> He would not have confirmed his ſaying, <hi>in terminis,</hi> with promiſe of a greater wonder, <hi>John 6. 62.</hi> you may as well deny his incarnation, his aſcention, and ask, <hi>how could the man come down from heaven and goe up againe?</hi> (if incomprehenſibility ſhould be ſufficient to occaſion ſuch ſcruples in your breaſts) and that which is worſe then naught, you have made our Saviours concluſion an argument againſt the premiſes; for where our Saviour tels them thus to argue according unto fleſh and bloud, in theſe words, <hi>the fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and that if they will be enlivened in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they muſt have faith to believe it in theſe words, <hi>it is the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> John <hi>6. 63.</hi> They pervert our Saviours meaning into a contrary ſenſe, of their owne imagination: <hi>viz. the fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> that is to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40220:36"/>
ſay, <hi>Chriſts body is not in the Sacrament:</hi> but <hi>in the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>we muſt onely believe that</hi> Christ <hi>dyed for us,</hi> but not that his body is there: as if there were any need of ſo many inculcations, preſſures, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, miſ-believings, of and in a thing that were no more but a bare memoriall of a thing; being a thing nothing more uſuall with the Iſraelites: as the twelve ſtones which were erected as a ſign of the children of Iſraels paſsing over <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan: That when your children ſhall ask their Fathers what is meant thereby, then ye ſhall anſwer them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſh. 4.</hi> there would not have been ſo much difficulty in the belief, if there had not been more in the myſterie; there would not have been ſo much offence taken at a <hi>memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> nor ſo much stumbling at a figure.</p>
               <p>The Fathers are of this opinion, Saint <hi>Ignat.</hi> in Ep. ad <hi>Smir.</hi> Saint <hi>Juſtin. Apol: 2. ad Antonium:</hi> Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ser. 4. de lapſis.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambr. lib. 4. de Sacram.</hi> Saint <hi>Remigius, &amp;c. affirme the fleſh of Chriſt to be in the Sacrament, and the ſame fleſh which the word of God took in the Virgins wombe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We hold that there is in the Church an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule for underſtanding of Scripture, beſides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, this you deny: this we have Scripture for, as <hi>Rom. 12. 16.</hi> we muſt <hi>propheſie according to the rule of faith:</hi> we are bid to <hi>walke according to this rule:</hi> Gal. <hi>6. 16.</hi> we muſt <hi>encreaſe our faith, and preach the Goſpel, according to this rule: 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10. 15.</hi> this <hi>rule of faith,</hi> the holy Scriptures call <hi>a form of doctrine:</hi> Romans <hi>6. 17.</hi> a <hi>thing made ready to our hands: 2.</hi> Cor. <hi>10. 16. that we may not meaſure our ſelves by our ſelves: 2</hi> Cor. <hi>10. 12. the depoſitions</hi> committed to the Churches truſt, <hi>1 Tim. 6. 20. for avoiding of prophane and vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and oppoſitions of ſciences,</hi> and by this <hi>rule of</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40220:37"/>
                  <hi>faith,</hi> is not meant the holy Scriptures; for that cannot do it, as the Apoſtle tells us, whilſt there are <hi>unſtable men</hi> who wreſt this way and that way, <hi>to their owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but it is the tradition of the Church and her expoſition, as it is delivered from hand to hand as moſt plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>2. Tim. 2. 2.</hi> viz. <hi>The things which thou haſt heard of us (not received in writing from me or others) among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach it to others alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this opinion are the Fathers; Saint <hi>Irenaeus 4.</hi> chap. <hi>45. Tertul: de praeſcr.</hi> and <hi>Vincent. lir. in ſuo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is very needfull in regard of ſo many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors proceeding from miſinterpretations of Scripture, that the line of propheticall and Apoſtolicall expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be directed according to the rule of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall and Catholike ſenſe;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> prae. ſcript. adverſ. haereſ. chap. <hi>11. We doe not admit our adverſaries to diſpute out of Scripture till they can ſhew who their Anceſtors were, and from whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Scriptures: for the ordinary courſe of Doctrine, requires that the firſt queſtion ſhould be, from whom, and by whom, and to whom, the form of Chriſtian Religion was delivered; otherwiſe preſcribing againſt him as a ſtranger:</hi> for otherwiſe if a heathen ſhould come by the Bible, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> came by the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and have no <hi>Philip</hi> to interpret it unto him, he would find out a Religion rather according to his owne fancy, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine verity.</p>
               <p>In matters of faith, Chriſt bids us <hi>to obſerve and doe whatſoever they bid us who ſit in Moſes ſeat,</hi> Mat. <hi>22. 2.</hi> therefore ſurely there is ſomething more to be obſerved then onely Scripture; will you not as well believe what you hear
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40220:37"/>
Chriſt ſay, as what ye hear his Miniſters write? you hear Chriſt when you hear them, as well as you read Chriſt when you read his word: <hi>He that heareth you heareth me:</hi> Luke <hi>10. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay the Scriptures are not eaſie to be underſtood; you ſay they are: we have Scripture for it, as is before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted at large: the Fathers ſay as much: Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lib. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>47. Origen: contr. Celſ:</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambr.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>44. ad Conſtant.</hi> calleth the Scripture a Sea and depth of propheticall riddles: and Saint <hi>Hier. in praefat: comment.</hi> in <hi>Epheſ:</hi> and Saint <hi>Aug: Epiſt: 119. chap. 21.</hi> ſaith: <hi>The things of holy Scripture which I know not, are more then thoſe that I know:</hi> and Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> cited by <hi>Euſebius, lib. 7.</hi> hiſt. <hi>Eccleſs. 20.</hi> ſaith of the Scriptures, <hi>that the matter thereof was far more profound then his wit could reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay that this Church cannot erre: you ſay it can: we have Scripture for what we ſay; ſuch Scripture that will tell you that <hi>fools cannot erre therein:</hi> Eſaiah <hi>35. 8.</hi> ſuch Scripture as will tell you, <hi>if you neglect to hear it, you ſhall be a heathen and a publican:</hi> Mat. <hi>18. 17.</hi> ſuch Scripture as will tell you, that this Church ſhall be unto Chriſt a glorious Church, a Church that ſhall be without ſpot or wrinkle: <hi>Epheſians 5. 27.</hi> ſuch a Church as ſhall be enlivened for ever with his Spirit: <hi>Iſaiah 59. 21.</hi> The Fathers affirm the ſamme, Saint <hi>Aug: contra Creſcon:</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi> Saint <hi>Cypr: Epiſt. 55. ad Cornel.</hi> num: <hi>3.</hi> Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi> chap. <hi>4. Cum multis aliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay the Church hath been alwaies viſible; you deny it: we have the Scripture for it, <hi>Mat. 5. 14, 15. The light of the world; a City upon a hill cannot be hid: 2 Cor. 4. 3. Iſaiah 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers unanimouſly affirme the ſame; <hi>Origen:</hi>

               <p>We held the perpetuall univerſality of the Church, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch a Church: you deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Pſal. 2. 8.

               </p>
               <p>We hold the unity of the Church to be neceſſary in all points of faith: you deny it: the ſeverall articles of your <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Eph. 4. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme.</hi> Acts <hi>4. 35. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1. 10.</hi> The Fathers are of that opinion, Saint <hi>Aug: cont. ep.

               </p>
               <p>We hold that every Miniſter of the Church, eſpecially the ſupreme Miniſters or head thereof, ſhould be in a capacity of fungifying his office in preaching the Goſpel, adminiſtring the Sacraments, baptizing, marrying, and not otherwiſe, this we have Scripture for, <hi>Heb.

as that your Church hath maintained and practiſed it a long time, <hi>for a woman to be head or</hi> ſupreme <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix in the Church;</hi> when you know that according to the word of God (in this reſpect) a woman is not onely forbid to be the head of the man, but to have a tongue in her head. <hi>1 Tim. 2. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 14. 34.</hi> yet ſo hath this been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by you, that many have been hang'd, drawn, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for not acknowledging it: the Fathers are of our opinion herein, Saint <hi>Damaſcen.</hi> ſer. <hi>1.

               <p>We ſay that Chriſt gave commiſsion to his Diſciples to forgive ſins, you deny it; and ſay, that God only can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins: we have Scripture for it, <hi>John 20. 23.

               <p>We hold, that we ought to confeſſe our ſinnes unto our Ghoſtly Father: this ye deny, ſaying, that ye ought not to confeſſe your ſinnes but unto God alone, this we prove out of

Scripture: <hi>Mat. 3. 5, 6.

               </p>
               <p>The Fathers affirm the ſame; S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>9.

               </p>
               <p>We hold, that men may doe works of ſupererogation, this you deny: This we prove by Scripture, <hi>Mat. 19. 12.</hi> viz. <hi>There be</hi> Eunuches <hi>which have made themſelves</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches <hi>for the Kingdome of Heaven: he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</hi> This is more then a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as Saint <hi>Aug:</hi> obſerves upon the place, <hi>ſer. lib. de temp:</hi> for of precepts it is not ſaid, <hi>keep them, who is able,</hi> but keep them abſolutely.</p>

               <p>We ſay, faith cannot juſtifie without works: yee ſay good works are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: we have Scripture for what we ſay, <hi>1 Cor. 13. 2. Though I have all faith, and have no charity, I am nothing:</hi> and <hi>James 2. 24. By works a man is juſtified and not by faith onely.</hi>

               <p>This opinion of yours Saint <hi>Aug: lib. de fide &amp; oper:</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi> ſaith, was an old hereſie, in the Apoſtles time; and in the preface of his Comment: upon the <hi>32.

               </p>
               <p>We hold, good works to be meritorious; you deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Mat. 6. 27. He ſhall reward every</hi>

                  <hi>man according to his works.</hi> Mat. <hi>5. 12. Great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Reward at the end, preſuppoſes merit in the worke: the diſtinction of <hi>ſecundum,</hi> and <hi>propter opera;</hi> is too nice to make ſuch a diviſion in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Fathers were of our opinion. <hi>S. Amb: de Apolog: David. cap. 6. S. Hier: lib. 3. Cont: Pelag: S. Aug: de Spiritu &amp; lit. cap. ult.</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>We hold, that faith once had, may be loſt, if we have not care to preſerve it: You ſay it cannot; we have Scripture for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Luke <hi>8. 13. They on the rock, are they, which when they hear, receive the word with joy: which, for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. So 1</hi> Tim. <hi>1. 18, 19. Which ſome having put away, have made ſhipwrack of their faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is frequently affirmed amongſt the Fathers, <hi>ſee S. Aug: de gratia, &amp; lib. arbit. de correp. &amp; gratia, &amp; ad articulos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold, that God did never inevitably damn any man before he was born: or as you ſay, from all eternity; you ſay, he did: we have Scripture for what we ſay, <hi>Wiſ: 1. 13. God made not death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the living. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>2. 34. God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who will have all men to be ſaved. 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3. 9. The Lord is not willing that any ſhould die, but that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> and if you will not believe, when he ſaies ſo, believe him when he ſwears it: <hi>As I live,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I doe not delight in the death of a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers are of our opinion, <hi>S. Aug. lib. 1. Civit. Dei. Tertul. Orat. cap. 8. Saint Cypr. lib. 4. Epiſt. 2.</hi> and <hi>Saint Amb. lib. 2. de Cani &amp; Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold, that no man ought, infallibly, to aſſure himſelfe of his ſalvation: you ſay he ought, the Scripture ſaith we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40220:40"/>
ought not, <hi>1 Cor. 9. 27. S. Paul</hi> was not aſſured, but that <hi>whilſt he preached unto others,</hi> he himſelfe might become a caſt-away.</p>
               <p>Rom. <hi>11. 20. Thou ſtandeſt in the faith: be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear, &amp;c. leaſt thou alſo maiſt be cut off.</hi> Phil. <hi>2. 12. Worke out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers are of our opinion: <hi>Amb: Ser. 5.</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 118. S. Baſil.</hi> in <hi>Conſtil. Monaſt. chap. 2. S. Hier: lib. 2. Adverſ. Pelagian: S. Cryſoſt.

               </p>
               <p>We ſay that every man hath an Angel guardian; you ſay he hath not; we have Scripture for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Mat. <hi>18. 10. Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay unto you, that in heaven, their Angels doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies behold the face of my Father.</hi> Acts <hi>12. 13. S. Peter</hi> knocking at the door, they ſay, <hi>it is his Angel;</hi> they believed this in the Apoſtles time: the Fathers believed it along. <hi>S. Greg. Dial. lib. 4. cap. 58. S.

Jer.</hi> upon theſe words, <hi>Their Angels,</hi> Mat <hi>17. 10.</hi> calls it a great dignity, which every one hath from his Nativity.</p>
               <p>We ſay, the Angels pray for us, knowing our thoughts, and deeds; you deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Zach. 1. 9, 10, 11, 12. Then the Angel of the Lord, anſwered, and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the Cities of Judah, againſt whom thou haſt had indignation, theſe three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten years?</hi> Apoc. <hi>8. 4.

                  <hi>incenſe of the prayers of the Saints, aſcended from the hand of the Angel before the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place was ſo underſtood by <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 34.</hi> and <hi>S.

Amb. lib. de viduis, Victor. utic. lib. 3. de perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione Vandalorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold it lawfull to pray unto them; you not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Gen. 48. 16. The Angel which redeemed me from all evill, bleſſe theſe lads, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſea <hi>12. 4. He had power over the Angel, and prevailed: he wept and made ſupplications unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expounding theſe words of <hi>Job 19. 21. Have pitty upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of the Lord is upon me,</hi> ſaith, that holy <hi>Job</hi> addreſſed himſelfe to the Angels.</p>
               <p>We hold, that the Saints deceaſed, know what paſſeth here on earth; you ſay they know not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Luke 16. 29.</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that there were <hi>Moſes and the Prophets</hi> Books here on earth, which he himſelfe had never ſeen when he was alive.</p>
               <p>The Fathers ſay as much, <hi>Euſeb. Ser. de Ann. S. Hier.</hi> in <hi>Epit. Paulae. S. Maxim. Ser. de S. Agnete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay, they pray for us; you not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Apoc. 5. 8. The twenty four Elders fell downe before the Lambe, having every one of them Harpes, and golden Viols, full of odours, which are the prayers of the Saints.</hi> Baruch <hi>3. 4. O Lord Almighty, thou God of Iſrael, hear now the prayers of the dead Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers were of this opinion, <hi>S. Aug. Ser. 15. de verbis Apoſt. S. Hilar.</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 129. S. Damaſ. lib. 4. de fide cap. 16.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40220:41"/>
We hold that we may pray to them; you not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Luke 16. 24. Father Abraham have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, and ſend Lazarus, &amp;c.</hi> You bid us ſhew one proof, for the lawfulneſſe hereof, when here are two Saints pray'd unto in one verſe: and though <hi>Dives</hi> were in Hell, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> in Heaven would not have expoſtulated with him ſo much, without a <hi>non nobis Domine,</hi> if it had been in it ſelfe, a thing not lawfull: You will ſay it is a parable; yet a jury of ten Fathers, of the grand inqueſt, as <hi>Theophil. Tertul. Clem. Alex. S. Chryſ. S. Jer. S. Amb. S. Aug. S. Greg. Euthem.</hi> and Ven. <hi>Beda,</hi> give their verdict, that it was a true Hiſtory: but ſuppoſe it were a parable; yet every parable is either true in the perſons named, or elſe may be true in ſome others: The Holy Ghoſt tells no lies, nor fables, nor ſpeaks not to us in parables, conſiſting either of impoſsibilities, or things improbable, <hi>Job 5. 1. Call now, if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi> It had been a frivolous thing in <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> to have asked <hi>Job</hi> the question; if invocation of Saints had not been the practiſe of that time.</p>
               <p>The Fathers affirme the ſame, <hi>S. Diony. c. 7. S. Athan. Ser. de Anunt. S. Baſil. Orat. 44. in Mat. S. Chryſ. Hom. 66. ad Popul. S. Hier.</hi> pray'd to <hi>S.

               <p>We hold, Confirmation neceſſary; you not: we have Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, <hi>Acts 8. 14. Peter and John prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Ghoſt (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them; onely they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of the Lord Jeſus) Then laid they their hands on them; and they received the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Where we ſee the holy Ghoſt was given in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40220:42"/>
which was not given in Baptiſme: alſo <hi>Heb. 6. 1. Therefore leaving the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto perfection, not laying againe the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith, towards God, of Baptiſme, and of Laying on of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers affirme the ſame. <hi>Tert. lib. de Reſurrect. Carn. S. Pacian. lib. de Bapt. S. Amb. lib. de Sac. S. Hier. Cont. Lucif. S. Cypr. lib. 2. Ep. 1.</hi> ſpeaking both of Baptiſme, and Confirmation, ſaith, <hi>Then they may be ſanctified and be the ſons of God, if they be borne in both Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold it ſufficient to communicate in one kind; you not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>John 6. 15. If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever.</hi> If everlaſting life be ſufficient, then is it alſo ſufficient to communicate under one kind: So <hi>Acts 2. 42. And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip</hi> (or communion) <hi>and in breaking of bread and prayer:</hi> where is no mention of the cup, and yet they remained ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Luke 24. 30. 8. 35.</hi> where Chriſt communicated his <hi>two Diſciples</hi> under one kind.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Theophylact, lib. de Conſenſ. Evang. cap. 25.</hi> expound this place of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>S. Chryſ. Hom. 17. oper. imperfecti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold, that Chriſt offered up unto his Father, in the Sacrifice of the Maſſe (as an expiation for the ſins of the people) is a true and proper Sacrifice; this you deny: this we prove by Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Malach. <hi>1. 11. From the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun, unto the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles: and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered to my name, and a pure offering:</hi> This could not be meant of the figurative offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40220:42"/>
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe it was ſpoken of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> neither can it be underſtood, of the reall Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe; becauſe that was done but in one place, and at one time, and then, and there, not among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> neither: which could be no other, but the daily Sacrifice of the Maſſe; which is, and ever was, from Eaſt to Weſt, a pure and daily Sacrifice, <hi>Luke 22. 19. This is my body, which is given for you:</hi> not to you; therefore a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>The Fathers are of this opinion: <hi>S. Clem. Apoſt. Conſt. lib. 6. cap. 23.</hi> who calleth it a reaſonable, unbloudy, and Myſticall Sacrament, <hi>S. Aug. lib. 1. Cont. adverſ. leg. &amp; proph. cap. 18. 19.</hi> calleth it a ſingular, and moſt excellent Sacrifice. <hi>S. Chryſ. Hom. in Pſal. 95.</hi> calleth it a pure and unbloudy hoſt, a heavenly, and moſt reverend Sacrifice. <hi>S. Greg. Nicen. Orat. 4. de Reſurrect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay that the Sacrament of Orders, confers grace upon thoſe, on whom the hands of the Presbytery are impoſed; you both deny it to be a Sacrament, notwithſtanding the holy Ghoſt is given unto them thereby; and alſo you deny, that it confers any inferiour grace at all upon them: we have Scripture for what we hold, <hi>viz. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>4. 14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and with the laying on the hands of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, So 1</hi> Tim. <hi>1. 6. Stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on my hands.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>We hold, that the Prieſt, and other Religious perſons who have vowed chaſtity to God, may not Marry afterwards; you deny, firſt, that it is lawfull to make any ſuch vows:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40220:43"/>
and ſecondly, That thoſe who have made any ſuch vowes, are not bound to keep them; we have Scripture for what we hold, <hi>Deuteronomie 23. 22. When thou ſhalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will require it of thee. So 1</hi> Tim. <hi>5. 11, 12. But the younger widows refuſe, for when they have begun to wax wanton, againſt the Lord, they will marry, having damnation; becauſe they have caſt off their firſt faith.</hi> What can be meant hereby, but the vow of Chaſtity? or by their firſt faith, but ſome promiſe made to Chriſt, in that behalfe? otherwiſe, Marriage could not be damnable: ſo all the antient Fathers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it. Saint <hi>Aug. lib. de bona viduit. cap. 9.</hi> Saint <hi>Athanaſ. lib. de Virginitat.</hi> Saint <hi>Epiph: Hereſ. 48.</hi> Saint <hi>Hier. cont. Jovin. lib. cap. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay, Chriſt deſcended into Hell, and delivered thence the Soules of the Fathers; ye deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Epheſ. <hi>4. 8. When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, &amp;c. Deſcending firſt, into the lower part of the Earth.</hi> This lower part of the Earth, could not be a Grave; for that was the upper part: nor could it have been the place of the damned; for the Devils would have been brought againe into heaven: more clearly, <hi>Acts 2. 27. Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption:</hi> there is hell for his ſoule for a time; and the grave for his body, for a while: plainer yet, <hi>1 Pet. 3. 18, 19. Being put to death in the fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit, by which alſo he went and preached unto the ſpirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> this priſon cannot be heaven, nor hell, as it is the place of the damned; nor the grave, as it is the place of reſt; therefore it muſt be (as Saint <hi>Aug. Epiſt. 99. ad Evod.</hi> ſaith) ſome third place; which third place, the Fathers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40220:43"/>
have called <hi>Limbus patrum:</hi> alſo <hi>Zachary 9. 11. As for thee alſo, by the bloud of thy Covenant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit wherein is water:</hi> by this pit, could not be meant the place of the damned; for they have no ſhare in the Covenant; neither are they Chriſts priſoners, but the devils; neither could this pit be the grave; becauſe Chriſts grave was a new pit, where never any was laid before.</p>
               <p>The Fathers affirme as much; Saint <hi>Hier. in 4. ad Epheſ.</hi> Saint <hi>Greg. lib. 13. Moral. cap. 20.</hi> Saint <hi>Aug: in Pſal. 3. 7.</hi> ver. <hi>1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold purgatory fire, where ſatisfaction ſhall be made for ſinnes after death; you deny it: we have Scripture for it, <hi>1 Cor. 3. 13. 15. The fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is, if any mans work ſhall be burnt he ſhall ſuffer loſſe; but he himſelfe ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>

Is any ſick among you? let him call the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oyle, in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick: and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> Neither any, nor all the Sacraments, were or could be more effectuall, mens good, nor more ſubſtantiall in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor more exquiſite in forme; nor more punctuall in deſignation of its miniſtry: other Sacraments being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the limits of the ſoules onely good; this extends it ſelfe to the good both of ſoule and body: <hi>he ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from his ſickneſſe, and his ſins ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> and yet it is both left out in your practiſe, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Thus moſt Sacred SIR, we have no reaſon to wave the Scriptures umpirage; ſo that you will hear it ſpeak in the mother language, and not produce it, as a witneſſe on your ſide, when the producers tell us nothing, but their owne meaning, in a language unknowne to all the former ages, and then tell us, that ſhe ſaith ſo, and they will have it ſo; becauſe, he that hath a Bible and a ſword, ſhall carry away the meaning from him that hath a Bible, and ne're a ſword: nor is it more blaſphemy, to ſay, that the Scripture is the Churches off ſpring, becauſe it is the word of God, then it is for me to ſay, I am the ſonne of ſuch a man, becauſe God made me inſtrumentally; I am ſo, and ſo was ſhee; for as ſaith Saint <hi>Aug: Evangelio non crederum, niſi me Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae anthoritas commoveret.</hi> I ſhould not believe the Goſpel it ſelfe, unleſſe I were moved by the authority of the Church.

               <p>We grant you, that the Scripture is the Originall of all light: yet we ſee light, before we ſee the Sun; and we know there was a light, when there was no Sun: the one is but the body of the other. We grant you the Scriptures to be the Celeſtiall globe, but we muſt not grant you that every one knows how to uſe it; or that it is neceſſary or poſsible they ſhould. We grant that the Scripture is a light to our feet, and a lanthorne to our paths: then you muſt grant me that it is requiſite that we have a guide, or elſe we may loſe our way in the light, as well as in the darke. We grant you that it is the food of our ſouls, yet there muſt be ſome body that muſt divide, or break the bread. We grant you that it is the

               <p>When we were ſeduced by the <hi>Pope (ſaith Luther)</hi> every man did willingly follow good works: and now every man neither ſaith, nor knoweth any thing, but how to get all to himſelfe, by exactions, pillage, theft, lying, uſury. <note n="u" place="margin">Luth.

               <p>Certainly, to ſpeak the truth, there is many times found Conſcionable, and plainer dealing amongſt moſt Papiſts, then among many Proteſtants.

               </note> no need now to ſay much. Firſt for Univerſality, it is certaine that error may ſpread for a while more univerſally then truth. So did <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> for many ages, it overſpread in a manner the whole World. Onely in <hi>Iudah</hi> was God known, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 1.

            <p>Thirdly, for Viſibility, it is granted that ordinarily the Church is viſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> that there is a viſible company of ſuch as profeſſe the truth, though the places cited by the Marqueſſe doe not evince ſo much. He ſaith, <hi>David</hi> compares the Church to <hi>a Tabernacle in the Sun.</hi> He meanes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4. where indeed according to the vulgar Latine tranſlation it is, <hi>He hath ſet his Tabernacle in the Sun:</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">In ſole poſuit Tabernaculum ſuum. Solem poſuit in Tabernaculo ſuo, <hi>i. e.</hi> in coelis: unde Hebr. Soli poſuit tentorium in eis. <hi>Genebr.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Genebrard</hi> is forced to expound it by an Hypallage
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40220:62"/>
thus, <hi>He hath ſet the Sun in his Tabernacle,</hi> that is, <hi>in the heavens.</hi> For (as he confeſſeth) the Hebrew runs thus, <hi>He hath ſet a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for the Sun in them.</hi> Now what is this to the Viſibility of the Church? or how doth it concerne the Church at all? Neither do I ſee, that (as the Marqueſſe alledgeth) our Saviour compares the Church to a candle in a candleſtick, not under a buſhell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 15. But either (as <hi>Ianſenius</hi> a Romiſh Writer doth expound it) our Saviour there ſpake of his Apoſtles, who as a candle in a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick were to give light unto the dark world by the preaching of the Goſpel. Or elſe in generall he ſhewed the duty of all, <hi>viz.</hi> That in their places and callings they ought to be a means to in-lighten others, eſpecially by their good example. This ſenſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that which follows immediately <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine forth before men,</hi> &amp;c. So when our Saviour ſaith <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>If they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold, he is in the deſert, go not forth: Behold, he is in the ſecret chambers, beleeve it not.</hi> It is nothing to the Churches viſibility, but onely he foreſhews that many ſhould come in his name, pretending themſelves to be Chriſt, and forewarnes to beware of them. Theſe places alledged by the Marqueſſe, are but little to the purpoſe, though (as I ſaid) it is granted, that ordinarily the Church <hi>(i. e.</hi> the company of ſuch as profeſſe the truth) is viſible. Yet nevertheleſſe we hold that ſometimes through perſecution, and prevalencie of error, the Church may be ſo obſcured, as to be ſcarcely viſible. Thus it was in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, when he complained unto God, ſaying, <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>have forſaken thy Covenant, throwne downe thine Altars, and ſlaine thy Prophets with the ſword, and I, even I am</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">I am left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 3.</note> 
               <hi>left, and they ſeeke my life to take it away.</hi> 1 King. 19. 10.

So neither can they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhew that they hold the ſame faith which was delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and therefore though they can ſhew that their Popes doe perſonally ſucceed one another from the very times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it availes nothing. <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. For Unity in doctrine; by which the Marqueſſe proves the Roman Church to be the true Church: I anſwer, that Unity without Verity will not prove it, and the one is not alwayes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily accompanyed with the other. <hi>The words of the Prophets declare good unto the King with one mouth,</hi> ſaid the meſſenger to <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 13. They were about foure hundred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and all of them did agree in one; yet they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed falſly for all that, there was a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all thoſe Prophets, how unanimous ſoever they were, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ſuch unity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as is pretended. The difference betwixt the Dominicans and the Jeſuits about Gods decrees, the concurrence of his grace, and the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans will; this difference (I ſay) betwixt them is as great, and as important as any (I think) that is amongſt Proteſtants. Neither doth it ſuffice to ſay (as the Marqueſſe doth) that the Church hath not determined any thing in theſe points, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch difference about them is not againſt the Churches unity.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40220:63"/>
For if the Popes authority be ſo great, and his judgement ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as they pretend, why hath he not decided the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and ſo put an end to the difference long ere this? Beſides (which the Marqueſſe took no notice of) they of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church differ much about the very head of it, the Pope himſelfe. For ſome will have him to be above a generall councell &amp; others hold the councell to be above the Pope: and this alſo was the determination both of the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of the councell of <hi>Baſill.</hi> Finally, I grant, that unity in the truth is much to be deſired, and ſo much the places cited by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe doe prove, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. &amp; 2. 2. yet we ſee that the Apoſtle doth acknowledge the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> a true Church notwithſtanding the differences and diviſions that were in it, ſo that all diſ-union of people is not enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church them. Neither if the confeſſions of the reformed Churches be conſidered, as they ought to be, wil the differences that are among them (however particular perſons be exorbitant) be found ſo many, and ſo great (though too many, and too great; I grant) as our adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> would make them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, for the converſion of Nations, which the Marqueſſe alſo will have to be a marke of the true Church, and thereby prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is it, and not the Church of Proteſtants; I anſwer, that the Scriptures which hee alledgeth, <hi>viz. Eſay</hi> 49. 23. and 60. 16. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. doe ſhew indeed, that in the time of the Goſpell the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be converted, and joyned to the Church, which the Scripture of the New Teſtament, and experience alſo ſhewes to have been accompliſhed. But they doe not ſhew either that every true Church muſt neceſſarily evidence it ſelfe to be a true Church by working a converſion in infidels, or that every Church that doth worke any converſion in that kind, muſt therefore be acknowledged to be a true Church. The Scribes and Phariſees did make Proſelytes, and were very zealous in it, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe were guilty of groſſe errors, which all were to beware of as moſt pernicious, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. Beſides, there is a converſion as from unbeliefe to faith, ſo from misbeliefe to a right and found faith. And though Proteſtants have done little or nothing it may be in the former kinde of converſion, ſo as to convert meer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40220:64"/>
Infidels, yet in the other kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> in converting miſ-believers, they have done much. This the Marqueſſe <hi>(pag.</hi> 44.) is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call <hi>perverſion</hi> rather then <hi>converſion;</hi> but that muſt be judged by the conſideration of the Doctrines held by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. As for thoſe converſions wrought in the Indies by the Romaniſts, we may well conceive that it was not ſo much the word preached by the Jeſuits, as the ſword brandiſhed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that did worke them. <note n="†" place="margin">Non ſatis liquet mihi an fides Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana fuerit barbaris hactenus ita propoſita, &amp; annuntiata, ut teneantur credere ſub novo peccato.—Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula &amp; ſigna nulla audio, nec exempla vitae adeò religioſa: contrà multa ſcandala, ſeu facinora, &amp; multas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietates; unde non videtur, quod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio Chriſtiana ſatis commodè &amp; piè ſit illis praedicata, ut illi tenean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur acquieſcere; quanquam viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur multi religioſi, &amp; alii Eccleſiaſtici viri, &amp; vitâ, &amp; exemplo, &amp; diligenti praedicatione ſufficienter operam &amp; induſtriam adhibuiſſe in hoc negotio, niſi ab aliis, quibus alia cura eſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediti eſſent. <hi>Franciſe de Victor.

               <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus de Victoria</hi> (a learned Writer among the Papiſts) writing of the Indians, ſaith he did not ſee, that the Chriſtian faith was ſo propounded and declared to them, as that under the guilt of a new ſin they were bound to embrace it. He heard (he ſayes) of no Miracles, and Signes that were wrought, nor of very good examples of life that were given, but on the contrary of many ſcandalous acts, and many impieties. Whereupon he conceiveth, that Chriſtian religion was not ſo conveniently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly preached to that barbarous people, as that they were bound to acquieſce in it, though he grants, that there were many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and other Eccleſiaſticall men, who both by life and example, and alſo by diligent preaching did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently doe their indeavour, but that they were hindred by others, who minded other matters. Thus I have as briefly as I could gone over the markes, which the Marqueſſe aſſigneth of the true Church, and that becauſe he ſaith that his Majeſty did wave them all, whereas indeed his Majeſty did not wholly wave them, though as his occaſions would not ſuffer him to return any anſwer at all to the Marqueſſes reply, ſo neither would they (it's likely) permit him to anſwer the former Paper ſo fully as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would have done. Whereas the Marqueſſe ſaith, that His Majeſty is pleaſed to make recourſe unto the Scriptures, This is ſurely the courſe that all ought to follow, that wil diſcuſſe matters of Religion, they ought to have recourſe to the Scriptures, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> all ſuch matters are to be tried and determined. <hi>To the Law, and to</hi>

Though Hereticks make recourſe unto Scripture, it follows not that therefore this is not the courſe which ought to be followed, or that therefore they are Hereticks that doe it. The Marqueſſe himſelfe did make recourſe unto Scripture in ſetting down the markes of the true Church, and ſo alſo doth he in handling ſundry points in controverſie betwixt Papiſts, and Proteſtants. This courſe therefore, himſelfe being Judge, is not to be condemned: neither certainly is it, however Hereticks may abuſe it. Though Hereticks will alledge Scripture in defence of their Hereſics, yet are they nevertheleſſe to be confuted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p n="2">2. It's true, none may appeal to Scriptures margin'd with their own Notes, ſens'd with their own meaning, and enliven'd with their own private ſpirit. It's to no purpoſe to alledge Scripture, except that ſenſe, in which it is alledged, may be made good by Scripture. The Jewiſh Rabbin (as Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> cites him) ſaith <note place="margin">

               <hi>Your Majeſty was pleaſed to urge the Errours of certain Fathers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Marq: pag. 54.</note> 
               <hi>to the prejudice of their Authority. Which I conceive would have been ſo, had they been all Montaniſts, Rebaptiſts, all Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts, and all of them generally guilty of the faults, wherewith they were ſoverally charged in the particulars: ſeeing that when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Father, we doe not intend to produce a man in whoſe mouth was never found guile; the infallibility being never attributed by us otherwiſe then unto the Church, not unto particular Church men. As your Majeſty hath moſt excellently obſerved in the failings of the holy Apoſtles, who erred after they had received the Holy Ghoſt in ſo ample manner. But when they were all gathered together in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and could ſend about their Edicts with theſe Capitall Letters in the Front,</hi> Viſum eſt Sipritui Sancto, &amp; nobis, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>then I hope your Majeſty cannot ſay, that it was poſſible for them to Erre. So though the Fathers might erre in particulars; yet thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Errours would be ſwallowed up in a Generall Councell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Marqueſſe grants, that the Fathers ſingly and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40220:65"/>
conſidered, may erre, but not if gathered together in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell. But firſt, doth not this invalidate the authority of the Fathers, when they are ſeverally cited, as they are in this Reply frequently by the Marqueſſe? Indeed, here preſently after he addes, <hi>Neither is a particular defection in any man any exception againſt his teſtimony, except it be in the thing wherein he is deficient.</hi> But certainly if a man be liable to errour in one thing, he is ſo in another thing; and therefore his bare teſtimony, except it have ſomething to ſupport it, is not ſufficient to rely upon. <hi>The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lord is ſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. becauſe he can neither deceive, nor be deceived. But man may, and therefore his teſtimony, as his, is not ſure. No, <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyar,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For a generall Councell, why it ſhould neceſſarily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Errour, I ſee nothing here alledged by the Marqueſſe, except it be, that <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us.</hi> But the inference made from that Councell, wherein the Apoſtles themſelves did ſit, and give ſentence, to prove that no generall Councell can Erre, is no better than if one ſhould argue, that a particular Father or Doctor is infallible, becauſe a particular Apoſtle was ſo in that which he either wrote or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For we muſt take heed of entertaining ſuch a thought (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Marqueſſes words do ſeem to imply ſo much) as that each particular Apoſtle might fall into Errour, though all of them together could not. For how then ſhould we be able to build our faith upon thoſe Scriptures, which were compoſed by particular Apoſtles, and not by a whole Councell of them? It's true, (as his Majeſty obſerved, pag. 50.) the Apoſtles were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and erronious in ſome things, but not in any thing that they delivered unto People to believe, and obey, either by word, or writing; for then (as I ſaid) we could have no certainty of the Scriptures, we could not be built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, as Believers are, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.

Indeed, generally the <hi>Pontificians</hi> make little account of a Councel, though otherwiſe never ſo generall, except it be confirmed by the Pope. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes it a clear caſe, and without all difficulty, that <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Concil. lib. 2. cap. 11.</note> Generall Councells may Erre, if the Fathers of the Councell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any thing, when as the Legates of the Pope diſſent from them: or if the Legates themſelves do conſent, but ſo as to go againſt the inſtructions which the Pope gave them. And he further holds, that in caſe the Legates had no certain inſtructions from the Pope, the Councell may Erre, and that before the Popes Confirmation of it, the judgment of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Ego exiſtimo tale concilium poſſe errare, neque eſſe infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile ejus judicium ante con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmationem Pontificis. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. ibid.</hi>
               </note> Councell is not infallible. The Marqueſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>(pag.</hi> 55. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> doth ſeeme to aſſent unto His Majeſty, taxing Generall Councells for committing Errours, but ſome paſſages he hath, which to me ſeeme very ſtrange. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ſhould ſuppoſe them to be Generall, and free Councels, yet they could not be Erronious in any particular mans judgement, untill a like Generall Councell ſhould have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the former to be Erronious.</hi> By this Aſſertion Arrianiſme being confirmed by the Councell of <hi>Ariminum, Athanaſius,</hi> and every particular man ſhould have aſſented to it, untill another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell had determined againſt it; but this is ſuch a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as (I dare ſay) our Romiſh adverſaries themſelves will not allow. Again, <hi>If it ſhould be granted</hi> (ſaith the Marqueſſe) <hi>that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> 
               <hi>the Church had at any time determined amiſſe, the Church cannot be ſaid to have erred, becauſe you muſt not take the particular time for the Catholike Church, becauſe the Church is as well Catholike for time, as territory; except you will make rectification an errour.</hi> But when our adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpeak of the Churches freedome from errour, they underſtand it of the Church repreſentative, a generall Councel. <note n="*" place="margin">Idem eſt ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam non poſſe errare in definiendis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fidei, &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopos non poſſe errare; atqui ſinguli ſeorſim errare poſſunt: igitur congregati in unum errare non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt. <hi>Bellarm. de concil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note>

               <hi>that the Church cannot erre in determining matters of faith, and that Biſhops cannot erre. But ſeverally they may erre, therefore being gathered together they ſhall be free from errour.</hi> So then, if a Generall Councell may erre at any one time, it is ſufficient to overthrow their Tenet, that the Church cannot erre. That the Church (repreſented in a Generall Councell) may after rectifie what before was amiſſe, and that alſo by the determination of a Generall Councell, is ſo farre from proving, that the Church (as they take it) cannot Erre, that on the contrary it proves, that it may Erre. For though rectification be not errour, yet it doth preſuppoſe Errour. Again, <hi>If I recall mine own words</hi> (ſaith the <note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> Marqueſſe) <hi>it is no Errour, but an avoidance of Errour. So where the ſame power Rectifies it ſelf, though ſome things formerly have been Decreed amiſſe, yet that cannot render the Decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels not binding, or incident to Errour,</hi> quoad nos, <hi>though in themſelves,</hi> &amp; pro tempore, <hi>they may be ſo.</hi> I anſwer, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, that for one to recall his words, being Erronious, is no Errour, but a correcting of Errour, yet this doth clearly ſhew a man to be ſubject to Errour. And ſo if the Church at one time in a Generall Councell may Rectifie what at another time in a Generall Councell it had Decreed amiſſe, it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Church in a Generall Councell may Erre. For otherwiſe, what need of Rectification were there, if there had been no Errour? And certainly, if the Decrees of Generall Councells be Erronious (as the Marqueſſe denies not but they may be) they are not binding <hi>Quoad nos,</hi> we are not bound to aſſent unto them, but rather to diſſent from them: For we are not bound to embrace Errour, but to embrace Truth. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. By the Marqueſſes reaſon the Decree of the Councell of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> confirming the Hereſie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> ſhould for the time have been binding; ſo that neither <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor any other, ſhould have preſumed to oppoſe it, or to diſſent from it, untill another Generall Councell had declared againſt it.</p>

Neither doth it appear, that by the Book there mentioned, is meant the Scripture, as the Marqueſſe ſeemeth to ſuppoſe.

The other places (I grant) do ſhew that in the Scriptures there are ſome things obſcure and difficult, at leaſt to ſome; but this is nothing againſt the Scriptures being their own interpreters.

And thus alſo it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. that <hi>the Rock was Chriſt.</hi> How could that be?

To that place concerning Circumciſion he anſwereth, that both Speeches are proper, <hi>viz.

Sect.

But here <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is contrary both to himſelf, and to Reaſon. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelfe, for a little before he ſaith, that theſe words, <note place="margin">Ibid. Sect. Quartò peccat.</note> 
               <hi>Circumciſion is the Token of the Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17. 11. are an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40220:68"/>
of that which went before, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Circumciſion is the Covenant.</hi> Now if the one be an Explication of the other, then needs muſt the word Covenant be taken alike in both. He is alſo contrary unto Reaſon, for it is abſurd to ſay, that a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth properly ſignifie both a Promiſe, and alſo an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the Promiſe is applyed. As well may one ſay, that Chriſts Body doth properly ſignifie both his Body, and alſo the Sacrament of his Body. A Covenant, in the very nature of it, being properly taken, doth ſignifie a Promiſe: and therefore the inſtrument, whereby it is applyed, cannot properly be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but onely the Token, Pledge, and Aſſurance of it. It may as well be ſaid, that a Covenant may have two diverſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct natures, as that a Covenant can be taken two diverſe and diſtinct wayes, and yet be taken properly both the one way, and the other.</p>
            <p>To thoſe words, <hi>It (viz.</hi> the Lamb) <hi>is the Lords paſſeover,</hi> Exod. 12. 11. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that the Speech is not Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <note place="margin">Bellarm.

The Lamb he ſaith was properly the Lords Paſſeover: and mark his Reaſon, <hi>Quia agnus immolabatur in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam illius tranſitus;</hi> that is, <hi>Becauſe the Lamb was ſlain</hi> (or <hi>ſacrificed) in memory of that paſſeover,</hi> or paſſing over. Now what greater abſurdity can there be, then this, which here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth fall into? He alledgeth that as a Reaſon of his aſſertion, which indeed doth quite overthrow it. For if the Lamb were ſlaine, and ſacrificed in memory of the Lords Paſſeover, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over, then was it not properly the Paſſeover it ſelf, but only a Signe and Memoriall of it.</p>

But it is evident, that the Rock ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, was a materiall Rock, a Rock of Stone: For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a Rock which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> drank of; <hi>They drank of that Rock,</hi> ſaith he.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words of that learned Father are very remarkable, that onely for the underſtanding of that particular place of Scripture, but alſo for the determining of the maine Controverſie betwixt us, and our Romane Adverſaries. For he not onely ſaith, that the Rock is ſaid to have been Chriſt, becauſe it did ſignifie Chriſt, ſuppoſing and taking it as granted, that the Apoſtle ſpake of a materiall Rock; but alſo he ſaith, that after a ſort all things ſignifying are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the things ſignified by them, and therefore are called by the ſame names. If our adverſaries would minde this rule, they would ſoon ſee, that they have no cauſe to inſiſt upon thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and to urge the proper ſenſe of them. But for theſe words, <hi>The Rock was Chriſt, Bellarmine</hi> argueth that a materiall Rock is not there meant, becauſe the Apoſtle calleth it <hi>a ſpirituall Rock.</hi> I anſwer, ſo the Apoſtle there calleth Manna ſpirituall meat, yet was Manna a materiall thing, onely it had a ſpirituall ſignification. And ſo alſo was the Rock a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Rock, onely it's called ſpirituall for the ſame reaſon. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects, that a materiall Rock did not follow the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith that the Rock did, which hee ſpeakes of; <hi>for they dranke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of that ſpirituall Rock that followed them.</hi> I anſwer 1.

            <p>This conceit of the <hi>Rabbines</hi> is far from pleaſing me, onely I note how little force <hi>Bellarmines</hi> objection was of with his own copartner <hi>Genebrard.</hi> Indeed this is enough to ſhew the vanity of the objection, that (as <hi>Genebrard</hi> notes) the want of water in <hi>Kadeſh</hi> was 38. years after that in <hi>Rephidim,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes) a little after. But though it had not been one halfe quarter of that time before the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> wanted water againe, yet that is no argument why the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Rock that followed them, ſhould not meane a materiall and viſible Rock; for the materiall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Rock, that is, the water that flowed from it, might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> though but for while, even ſo long as they encamped in <hi>Rephidim:</hi> neither doth the Apoſtle ſay, that it followed them either perpetually, or for any long time, but onely that it followed them.

Indeed, theſe very words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which our Adverſaries pretend to make ſo much for them, are moſt ſtrong againſt them, and enough to throw down Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. For Chriſt ſaying, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> what is meant by the word <hi>This?</hi> They of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot agree about it, but ſome ſay one thing, ſome another, only by no means they will have Bread to be meant by it. For they very well know that ſo their Tranſubſtantiation were quite overthrown. But look into the Scripture, and mind it well, and ſee if any thing elſe but Bread can be meant by the word <hi>This.</hi> It's ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. <hi>Ieſus took Bread and bleſſed it, &amp; brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, This is my Body.</hi> What is here meant by the word <hi>This?</hi> What is it that Chriſt calls his Body? That which he bade the Diſciples take and eate. And what was that? That which he gave unto them. And what was that? That which he brake.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40220:71"/>
And what was that? That which he bleſſed. And what was that? That which he took. And what was that? Bread. For ſo expreſly the Evangeliſt tells us, that <hi>Ieſus took Bread.</hi> So then it was Bread that Chriſt took, and Bread that he bleſſed, and Bread that he brake, and Bread that he gave to the Diſciples, and Bread that he bade them take and eat, and Bread of which he ſpake, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, This Bread which I have taken, and bleſſed, and broken, and given unto you to eat, even this Bread is my Body. Now the word <hi>This</hi> relating unto Bread, the ſpeech muſt needs be Figurative, and cannot be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For properly Bread cannot be Chriſts Body, Bread and Chriſts Body, being things of diverſe and different natures, and ſo it being impoſſible that properly one ſhould be the other. As <note place="margin">Diſparatum de diſparato non poteſt univocè praedicari.</note> when Chriſt called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Serpents and Vipers, the ſpeeches are not Proper, but Figurative; ſo is it when he called Bread his Body, it being no more poſſible that Bread ſhould be the Body of Chriſt in propriety of ſpeech, then that a man ſhould properly be a Fox, a Serpent, a Viper. Beſides, doth not the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſpeaking of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, continually call it Bread, even after Conſecration? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to diſtinguiſh it from ordinary and common Bread, he calls it <hi>This Bread;</hi> but yet ſtill Bread, the ſame in ſubſtance, though not the ſame in uſe, as before. And (which is worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) thus the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>viz. Bread,</hi> when he ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their unworthy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſetting before them the grievouſneſſe of the ſin, and the greatneſſe of the danger that they did incur by it. Now what had been more forcible and effectuall to this end, than for the Apoſtle, if he had been of the Romiſh Faith, to have told them, that now it was not Bread, though it ſeemed unto them to be ſo, but that the ſubſtance of the Bread was gone, and inſtead thereof was come the very ſubſtance of Chriſts Body? He ſaith indeed, That <hi>whoſo eat that Bread, and drink the Cup of the Lord unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, are guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord:</hi> But that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Bread, and that Cup, <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Wine in the Cup) are by the Lords own inſtitution Signes and Seales of the Lords Body and Bloud; ſo that the unworthy receiving of them is an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity done to the things ſignified by them. But to return to the

Marqueſſe, he citeth ſundry paſſages in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeakes of eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, calling himſelfe <hi>Bread, living Bread,</hi> and affirming that <hi>his Fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood drinke indeed.</hi> But all this is farre from proving that reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which the Marqueſſe doth contend for. For, 1. as <hi>Ianſenius</hi> (not to name other of the Marqueſſes own party) hath unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably <note place="margin">

The words of our Saviour <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. if they muſt prove any tranſubſtantiation at all, will ſooner prove the tranſubſtantiation of Chriſts body into Bread, then the tranſubſtantiation of Bread into Chriſts body. <hi>I am the Bread of life,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35. &amp; 48. <hi>I am the living Bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 55. If theſe ſayings bee taken properly, and without a figure, they will prove a converſion, not of Bread into the body of Chriſt, but of the Body of Chriſt into Bread.

And this expoſition, he ſaith, doth confirm their opinion; for that, if Chriſt had not promiſed to give his true Fleſh in the Sacrament, he needed not to prove his power by his Aſcenſion.

is no miracle (ſuch as the Jewes required of Chriſt, <hi>Ioh:</hi> 6. 30, 31.) that common Bread ſhould ſignifie Chriſts Body, or that Chriſts Body ſhould be eaten by Faith. But is this ſo ordinary and eaſie a matter, that common Bread (common for ſubſtance, though not for uſe) ſhould ſo ſignifie the Body of Chriſt, that by the due receiving of it, the very Body of Chriſt ſhould be received, and ſo Chriſt and the Receiver be united together Spiritually, even as Bread, and he that eateth it, are united together Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally?

To remove thoſe offences, and miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevings which the Jewes had about the eating of Chriſts Fleſh, which he ſpake of (they underſtanding his words in a carnall ſenſe) there was need enough of ſo many inculcations and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for we ſee, that after all thoſe inculcations and preſſures yet our Adverſaries will not be taken off from the like Carnall conceit, as the offended and miſ-beleeving Jewes had. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would ſeeme indeed to be far from compliance with thoſe Jewes, becauſe they doe not hold that Chriſts Fleſh is to be eaten by bits, ſo as to be divided one piece from another (as thoſe Jewes ſeeme to have imagined) but that it is to be eaten, though corporally, yet in an inviſible, and indiviſible manner.

               <hi>muſt referre all to the ſpecies</hi> (or <hi>ſhewes) themſelves; for we doe not make any parts of Chriſts Body.</hi> So then to free themſelves from a Capernaiticall manner of eating Chriſts Fleſh, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries hold, that neither Chriſts body, nor bread, but onely the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or ſhewes of bread, as quantity, colour, ſavour, and the like, meere accidents without a ſubſtance, are torne with the teeth, divided and broken. And is this properly to eate Chriſts Body? or is not this eating of Chriſts Fleſh as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable as that of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> whereas the Marqueſſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>a bare memoriall;</hi> 1.

            <p>After the Scriptures, the Marqueſſe cites ſome Fathers, as <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius Epiſt. ad Smyr. Iuſtine Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Cyprian Ser.</hi> 4. <hi>de Lapſ. Ambroſ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The queſtion is not whether Chriſts Fleſh be in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but how it is in it, concerning which theſe Fathers, ſo farre as the Marqueſſe doth ſhew, ſpeake nothing: To ſay, that they ſpeake <hi>of the ſame fleſh, which the Word of God tooke in the Wombe of the Virgin,</hi> is onely to ſhew that they ſpeake of Chriſts fleſh properly ſo called, but it doth not ſhew that they ſpeake of that fleſh being properly in the Sacrament. I know no fleſh of Chriſt properly ſo called, but that, which <hi>the Word made Fleſh (Ioh.</hi> 1. 14) tooke of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> but though it be granted (as it is) that this fleſh of Chriſt is in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſtill the queſtion remaines whether this fleſh of Chriſt be properly, ſubſtantially, and corporally in the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> under the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or ſhewes of bread, as our Adverſaries hold; and to this queſtion the Marqueſſe doth not ſay that the Fathers alledged by him, doe ſpeake any thing: and therefore I
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40220:74"/>
might well let them paſſe without any further anſwer.</p>
            <p>But to conſider them, and their teſtimonies more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. Firſt, <hi>Ignatius</hi> his words (as they are cited by <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> are to this effect, <hi>They</hi> (meaning certaine Hereticks) <hi>doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Euchariſts, and oblations, becauſe they doe not confeſſe the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi>

               <hi>to be the fleſh of our Saviour, which did ſuffer for our ſins, and which the Father of his goodneſſe did raiſe up.</hi> This teſtimony is nothing againſt us, who doe not deny the Euchariſt, that is, the bread in the Euchariſt to be the fleſh of Chriſt, onely wee ſay that it is not his fleſh in a proper, but in a figurative ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> (as <hi>Auſtine</hi> in the words before cited obſerves) the thing ſignifying being called by the name of the thing ſignified. And this muſt be the meaning of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> for hee ſpeakes, not of Chriſts fleſh being in the Euchariſt, but of the Euchariſt being Chriſts Fleſh. Whereby the Euchariſt can be meant nothing but the Sacramentall bread, and that (as I have before demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) by the confeſſion of all cannot properly, but onely figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively be Chriſts Fleſh. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects, that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <note place="margin">Bell. Ibid.</note> ſpoken of by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> denyed Chriſt to have true fleſh, holding that he was but ſeemingly borne, crucified, and raiſed againe. And therefore (hee ſaith) they did not deny the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt to ſignifie the fleſh of Chriſt, but onely to be the Fleſh of Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be forced to admit that Chriſt had true fleſh. But (ſay I) how could thoſe Hereticks yeeld that Euchariſt doth ſignifie the fleſh of Chriſt, and yet deny that Chriſt hath fleſh? For a thing muſt needs firſt be, before there can be truly any ſignification of it. Men (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> may paint bodies, which indeed are not. But who will ſay that theſe Pictures are repreſentations of bodies, and not meere Pictures? And this is all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could make out of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The next Father is <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>our fleſh and bloud is nouriſhed, is the fleſh and bloud of that Ieſus that was incarnate.</hi> But this was ſo far from proving Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that indeed it overthrowes it: For in ſaying that we are nouriſhed by the food, the Bread and the Wine in the Sacrament, he ſaith in effect that the ſubſtance of that food, that Bread and Wine, doth ſtill remaine; for otherwiſe how ſhould we be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by it?

            <p>But (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) Iuſtine</hi> writing an Apology for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and their Religion, was a prevaricatour, and made the Chriſtian Faith moſt odious, by expreſſing himſelf ſo as he did, <note place="margin">

I anſwer, that <hi>Iuſtines</hi> expreſſions are agreeable to our Saviours: 1. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and therefore no more apt to render the Faith of Chriſtians odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the other. Neither was it much to be feared, that the Heathens, to whom he wrote his Apology, ſhould not be able to underſtand the Figure, whereby the ſigne is called that which it ſignifieth; there was no need (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſcoffingly ſpeakes) that for <note place="margin">Opinatur fortaſſe Petrus Martyr Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem illum verſatum fuiſſe in Scholâ Calviniſtarum, ut ſtatim ad tropos omnia revocaret. <hi>Bellar.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40220:75"/>

               <hi>being deſpiſed and contemned, violence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Chriſts Body and Bloud; and they now ſinne againſt the Lord more by their hands and mouth, then they did before when</hi> that <hi>they denyed him.</hi> But what is there in all this to ſhew <hi>Cyprian</hi> held any ſuch preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, as they of the Romiſh Church maintaine? Yes (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Euchar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> for the Marqueſſe onely points at places, but cites no words, much leſſe drawes any argument from them) <hi>Cyprian</hi> did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beleeve Chriſt to be ſo in the Sacrament, or elſe he would never have ſo aggravated the unworthy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to make it a greater ſinne than to deny Chriſt before a perſecutor. But this reaſon is over-weak. For firſt, <hi>Cyprian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Rhetoricall, might a little hyperbolize in his expreſſion. And 2. without any Hyperbole at all the words may be made good, and yet no Tranſubſtantiation, nor any corporall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament be ſuppoſed. For the ſin of denying Chriſt under Perſecution might be (and moſt probably was) of infirmity; and the ſinne of receiving the Sacrament unworthily might be of preſumption, and ſo more hainous in that reſpect than the other. In the ſame place <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo relates ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous puniſhments which were inflicted on ſome that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily received the Sacrament: and hence alſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> infers <note place="margin">Bell. Ibid.</note> that Chriſt is corporally preſent in the Sacrament, for that we doe not read (he ſayes) of any ſuch miracles ſhewed upon thoſe who have unworthily medled with other Signes. I anſwer, yes, we doe; we read of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> ſlain with fire from Heaven, for offering Incenſe with ſtrange Fire, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. and yet that Incenſe, and the Altar on which it was offered, were but Types and Figures. So the Arke was but a Signe of Gods Preſence, and yet many thouſands of the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> were deſtroyed for looking into it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 4. ſo alſo was <hi>Uzza</hi> for preſuming to touch it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Marqueſſe cites, <hi>Ambroſe Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sacram.</hi> but no Chapter is cited by him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites <note place="margin">Accipe que dico, anteriora eſſe myſteria Chriſtianorum quàm Judeorum, &amp; diviniora eſſe Sacramenta. <hi>Ambroſ. de Sacram. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> Chap. 3, 4, and 5. Now all that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, chap. 3. as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40220:76"/>
that way, is but this, That <hi>the Sacraments of Chriſtians are more Divine then thoſe of the Iewes.</hi> Which we grant, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the thing ſignified, <hi>For Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. the ſame Chriſt was ſignified by the Jewiſh Sacraments as by ours: but in reſpect of the manner of ſignifying, Chriſt being more clearly ſignified by our Sacraments, than he was by thoſe which the Jewes had. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But chap. 4. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath ſomething that may ſeem to make more againſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> That <note place="margin">Sed panis iſte, panis eſt ante verba Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ubiacceſſerit conſecratio, de pane fit caro Chriſti. <hi>Ambroſ. de Sacram. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>before Conſecration it is Bread, but when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration commeth, then of Bread it is made the Fleſh of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that theſe words doe not inferre any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. By Conſecration, of Bread is made Chriſts Fleſh, but Sacramentally, not Subſtantially; Figuratively, not Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in thoſe words did intend no ſubſtantiall change of the Bread, appears by his owne words in the ſame Chapter. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Si ergò tanta vis eſt in ſermone Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Jeſu, ut inciperent eſſe, quae non erant; quanto magis operatorius eſt, ut ſint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur? <hi>Ambroſ. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>there was ſuch force in the ſpeech of the Lord Ieſus, that things ſhould begin to be that were not: how much more operative is it, that thoſe things ſhould be, which were, and ſhould withall be changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing?</hi> Therefore in the judgement of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, are what they were, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of ſubſtance, yet by vertue of Chriſts inſtitution are changed, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of ſignification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to evade this teſtimony, firſt ſayes, that <hi>Lanfrancus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bell. ubi ſupra.</note> in his book againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſpeaks of ſome Copies of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Workes, wherein thoſe words were not, <hi>Ut ſint quae erant,</hi> that is, <hi>That thoſe things ſhould be which were.</hi> But no ſuch Copies either Printed, or Manuſcript, it ſeems did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> meet with; for otherwiſe (I doubt not) he would have given us notice of them. Again, with the ſame <hi>Lanfrancus</hi> he anſwers, that thoſe words are thus to be underſtood, that in reſpect of outward ſhew, the things which were, ſtill are, but are changed in reſpect of inward ſubſtance. But how can a thing be ſaid to be what it was, when as there is no ſubſtance of the thing remaining, but onely a ſhew and appearance of it? In the laſt place <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40220:76"/>
addes of his own, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> meant, If Chriſt could make a thing of nothing, why can he not make a thing of ſomething, not by annihilating the thing, but by changing it into that which is better? But if a thing be changed ſubſtantially into another thing, how doth it remain what it was before? But ſo the things doe, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks of. For <hi>Bellarmines</hi> criticiſme is poor in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing betwixt, <hi>Ut ſint id, quod erant, That they ſhould be that which they were,</hi> and <hi>Ut ſint quae erant, That the things ſhould be that were,</hi> as if theſe words did not import that the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſtill remain, as well as the other when Chriſt turned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine, can we ſay, that his Word was operative, and powerfull, <hi>Ut eſſet quod erat, &amp; in aliud mutaretur, That that ſhould be which was, and that withall, it ſhould be changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing?</hi> I confeſſe I cannot ſee how the thing may be ſaid truly and properly to be, which was, if it be ſubſtantially changed into ſome other thing. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> there a little after ſaith, <hi>Tu ipſe eras, ſed eras vetus creatura: poſteaquam conſecratus es, nova crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura eſſe coepiſti. Thou thy ſelf waſt, but thou waſt an old creature: after thou art conſecrated, thou beginneſt to be a new creature:</hi> which cannot be meant of any ſubſtantiall change in us. Chap. 5. the ſame <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> (if it were <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is not very confident that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was the Author of thoſe Books, <hi>De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis)</hi> ſaith indeed, That <hi>before it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, it is Bread, but when the words of</hi>

               <hi>Chriſt are come, it is the Body of Chriſt.</hi> But that it is ſo the Body of Chriſt, as to be no longer Bread he doth not affirme. That he was of another mind, appears by the words before alledged. And ſo much alſo may be gathered from that which he ſaith in this ſame Chapter, <hi>viz. He that did eat Manna,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Manna qui manducavit, mortuus eſt; qui mauducaverit hoc corpus, fiet ei remiſſio peccatorum, &amp; non morietur in aeternum. <hi>Ambroſ. Ibid.</hi>

               <hi>dyed: but whoſe eateth this Body, ſhall have remiſſion of ſins, and ſhall live for ever.</hi> Which cannot be underſtood of a Corporall eating of Chriſts Body, but of a Spirituall eating of it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites ſome other ſayings of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> out of another Work of his, <hi>viz.

That the Apoſtle ſpake of any unwritten tradition, as a rule whereby to interpret Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. can never be made good: by the things, which <hi>Timothy</hi> heard him, and was to commit to faithfull men, &amp;c. hee meant nothing but the Doctrine of the Goſpell, as the forementioned <note n="*" place="margin">Evangelicos ſiquidem ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git dicendo, &amp; quae audiſti à me. <hi>Cajet. in</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Cajetan</hi> doth truly interpret: and that Doctrine, I preſume, is no where to be found, but in the Scripture.

For though the Heretickes, with whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> had to doe, might be convinced otherwiſe then by Scripture, it followes not, that therefore this is not the ordinary way whereby to convince Hereticks. Thus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the <hi>Sadduces</hi> that denied the Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29. &amp;c. thus <hi>Apollos</hi> convinced the Jewes, who denied Jeſus to be the Chriſt: <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 28.

And thus both other Fathers, and even <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> himſelfe doth uſually diſpute againſt Heretickes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But (ſaith the Marqueſſe) <hi>If a Heathen ſhould come by the Bible, as the Eunuch came by the prophecy of</hi> Eſay, <hi>and have no</hi> Philip <hi>to interpret it unto him, hee would find out a Religion rather according to his own fancy, then Divine verity.</hi> Be it ſo, yet here is nothing to prove, that this <hi>Philip,</hi> that is to interpret the Bible, is not to fetch his interpretation from the Bible it ſelfe, but from ſome unwritten tradition. I come to <hi>Vincenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Lirinenſis,</hi> whoſe words produced by the Marqueſſe, run thus, <hi>It is very needfull in regard of ſo many errors proceeding from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of Scriptures, that the line of propheticall and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall expoſition ſhould be directed according to the rule of the Eccleſiaſticall and Catholike ſenſe.</hi> But I ſee not, that in the opinion of <hi>Vincentius, the rule of the Eccleſiasticall and Catholike ſenſe</hi> is any other then the Scripture. He inſiſts much (I am ſure) upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>If wee, or an Angell</hi>

            <p>Indeed, all that <hi>Vincentius</hi> in his Commonitory againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, aimes at, is this, That <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi> (as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaks) might be preſerved. To which end he deſcants <note place="margin">

            <p>Thus the Marqueſſe, but it was from our Saviours meaning,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40220:80"/>
that the people ſhould doe ſimply, and abſolutely, whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſees, who ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, ſhould enjoyn. Our Saviour meant nothing leſſe, for expreſly he bade beware of <hi>the leaven of the Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 16. 6. that is, <hi>of the Doctrine of the Phariſees,</hi> v. 12. Our Saviours meaning therefore was only this, that whiles the Scribes and Phariſees ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, did deliver the Law and Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> people ſhould hear and obey, though otherwiſe they were moſt corrupt both in life &amp; Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Jeſuite <hi>Maldonate</hi> doth thus expound the place, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot with any probability be otherwiſe expounded. <hi>When Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bids obſerve, and doe</hi>

               <hi>what the Scribes and Phariſees ſay, whiles they ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>ſeat, he ſpeaks not of their Doctrine, but of the Doctrine of the Law, and of</hi> Moſes. <hi>For it is as if he ſhould ſay, All things, that the Law, and</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhall ſay unto you, the Scribes and Phariſees rehearſing it, obſerve, and do; but after their workes doe not.</hi> It's true, Chriſt doth tells us, that they that hear his Miniſters, hear him, but that is, when they ſpeak as his Miniſters, when they ſpeak his Word, not their owne. As God ſaid to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Thou ſhalt ſpeak my Words unto them, Ezek.</hi> 2. 7. And to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Speak unto them all that I command thee, Ier.</hi> 1. 17. And ſo Chriſt to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things that I have commanded you, Mat.</hi> 28. 20. So then, we hear Chriſt indeed, when we hear his Word ſpoken by his Miniſters, as well as we read Chriſt, when we read his Word written in the Scriptures. But that which we hear, muſt be tried by that which we read; that which is ſpoken by Miniſters, by that which is written in the Scriptures, as hath been ſhewed before by <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11.</p>

               <hi>good, who build upon the Rock, not of thoſe that build upon the Sand.</hi> As for Errour, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther damnable, or not damnable. Now it is granted, that the inviſible Church cannot erre damnably. For this is that Church which Chriſt ſpeaketh of, and ſaith, That <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, Mat.</hi> 16. 18. But for the Church Viſible, whether our Adverſaries mean the Church Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, whereby they underſtand the Pope, or the Church Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, that is, a Generall Councell, we hold that it may Erre, and that damnably. The Scriptures alledged are not againſt this aſſertion. That <hi>Eſai.</hi> 35. 8. ſpeaks not of the Church, but of a Way, called there, <hi>The Way of Holineſſe;</hi> ſo ſure and ſafe, that <hi>Wayfaring men, though fooles, ſhall not Erre therein.</hi> That <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. onely ſhewes that a member of the Church, being juſtly admoniſhed by the Church, ought to ſubmit to the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of it, or elſe is to be accounted as a Publican or Heathen. But this is farre from proving the Churches infallibility.

            <p>For the Fathers, the firſt, whom the Marqueſſe citeth is <hi>Auſtine,</hi> whom (as before is ſhewed) holdeth Generall Councells lyable to Errour, and ſuch, as that the former may be corrected by the latter.

But I ſee not how <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf could hold the Church to be ſo commended in the Scriptures, as that we muſt ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely doe what the Church pleaſeth. For then, what need of having one Generall Councell to be corrected and amended by another? Our Adverſaries themſelves, when they pleaſe, make no ſcruple of waving and altering that which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held and practiced in the Church. <hi>I let paſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maldonate) the opinion of</hi>

The thing is now declared by the Church, both by the Cuſtome of many Ages, and alſo by the decree of the Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>that it is not onely not neceſſary for them, but alſo that it is not meet to be given unto them. Cyprian, Epiſt.</hi> 55. (who is the next that the Marqueſſe citeth) ſpeaketh indeed of the Authority of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40220:82"/>
Church, but how? ſo as to cenſure and excommunicate thoſe that deſerve it, about that hee writes unto <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this is much ſhort of proving the Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and that it cannot erre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> was far from aſcribing ſo much to the Church, when (as 'tis well known) contrary to what the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church generally did hold, he held the re-baptizing of ſuch as had been baptized by Heretikes. Though <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this did erre, yet his very erring in this, ſhewes that hee thought the Church, the generality of the viſible Church, not onely ſubject to error, but indeed to have erred.</p>
            <p>The laſt Father, whom the Marqueſſe here mentioneth (for though hee ſay <hi>cum multis aliis,</hi> yet hee nameth no more) is <note n="*" place="margin">Non oportet adhuc quaerere aqud alios veritatem, quam facile eſt ab Eccleſiâ ſumere, cum Apoſtoli quaſi in depoſitorium dives, pleniſſimè in eâ contulerint omnia, quae ſint veritatis, uti omnis quicunque velit, ſumat ex eâ potum vitae. <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. where he ſaith, <hi>It is not meet to ſeeke the truth among others, which it is eaſie to take of the Church, ſeeing the Apoſtles did lay in it, as in a rich depoſitory, all things that concerne truth, that every one that will, may out of it receive the drinke of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is gloriouſly ſpoken of the Church, and not Hyperbolically neither; yet doth it not amount to this, that the Church cannot erre. The holy Scriptures, wherein all ſaving truth is contained, are committed to the Church, and the Doctine of ſalvation is ordinarily held forth in, and by the Church; but hence it doth not follow, that the Church, that is, ſuch as beare ſway in it, is not ſubject to error. All that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> ſaith of the Church is no more, if ſo much as that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. that <hi>the Church is the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> which place it may ſeeme ſtrange that the Marqueſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitteth. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſputing this point, brings in thoſe words in the very firſt place, to prove that the Church cannot <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Eccleſ. mili.</hi> 4. <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> erre. And whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> anſwers, that the Church is ſo ſtyled by the Apoſtle, becauſe in it the Scriptures are preſerved and preached, he replies, that thus the Church ſhould rather be compared to a Cheſt, then to a Pillar. But this is a frivolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for the Church doth not keepe the truth cloſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as a thing is kept in a cheſt; but ſo as to profeſſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40220:83"/>
it, and therefore is compared to a Pillar, to which a thing is faſtned, and ſo hangeth, that all may ſee it. But that thoſe words of the Apoſtle do not infer an infallibility of the Church, and an exemption from errour, is cleare by this, that he ſpeakes of a particular viſible Church, namely the Church of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> now that a particular viſible Church may erre, our Adverſaries will not deny, and that very Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> there ſpoken of doth ſufficiently demonſtrate. The Apoſtle therefore in thoſe words doth rather ſhew the duty of the Church then the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it; rather what it ſhould be, then what it alwayes is. As when it is ſaid <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Labia ſacerdotis cuſtodient ſcientiam, The Prieſts lips ſhall keep knowledge,</hi> that is (as our tranſlations rightly render it) <hi>ſhould keepe.</hi> So the Jeſuite <hi>Ribera</hi> doth expound <note place="margin">Cuſtodient, id eſt, cuſtodire debent. <hi>Rib. ad Mal.</hi> 2.</note> it, <hi>ſhall keepe,</hi> that is (ſaith he) ought to keep.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe here comes againe to the viſibility of the Church, and ſome other particulars before handled. That the Church is alwayes viſible, he proves by <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>The light of the World; a City upon a Hill cannot be hid.</hi> But I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before theſe words, <hi>Yee are the light of the world,</hi> to be meant of the Apoſtles, who (as their own <hi>Ianſenius</hi> expounds it) were a light unto the World by their preaching.

That <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. 2. is more to the purpoſe, though not enough neither. It is ſaid that <hi>in the laſt dayes the Mountaine of the Lords Houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the Mountaines, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi> The Prophet there ſheweth, (by metaphoricall expreſſions taken from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Temple ſtood) that by the preaching of the Goſpell, the Church ſhould be increaſed and exalted farre above what it was before. This propheſie was fulfilled by the bringing in of the Gentiles: but the Prophet doth not ſay, that in the times of the Goſpell the Church ſhould alwayes be ſo conſpicuous and viſible. Neither doe the Fathers here alledged by the Marqueſſe, <hi>viz. Origen, Chryſoſtome, Auſtine</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpeake of the perpetuall condition of the Church, but onely as it was in their time. I have proved before by Scriptures, and Fathers, and even by the acknowledgement of our Adverſaries, that the Church is not perpetually viſible.</p>
            <p>After the Viſibility of the Church, the Marqueſſe ſpeaketh of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 62.</note> the Univerſality of it, ſaying that the univerſality of the Church is perpetuall, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch a Church.

Now the former place ſhewes that Chriſt ſhould have the heathen for his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the ends of the Earth for his poſſeſſion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Church ſhould not be confined (as it was

This alſo hath been fulfilled, and yet ſhall be: but hence it doth not follow, that the Church is alwayes ſo univerſally extended throughout the World, but that ſometimes errors and hereſies doe ſo prevaile and overſpread all, that the truth in compariſon can finde no roome. See before <hi>page</hi> 2. The other place, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 1. 8. teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies indeed that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the World: but neither doth the Apoſtle there ſay, neither (ſo farre as I ſee) can it in any congruity be ſaid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> either is, or was a Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ſpread thorough the World. A part, and an eminent part of the Church ſo univerſall it might be, but the whole univerſall Church it could not be. The Apoſtle there ſaith no more of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> then he doth of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. yet (I preſume) our Adverſaries will not therefore admit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> to be univerſall, or ever ſince the Apoſtles time to have continued ſound and Orthodox.

This makes indeed for the ſoundneſſe of the Roman Church, as it was in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, but for the univerſality of it, as if it were the univerſall Church, or a Church univerſally diffuſed, it makes nothing.

For ſo all ſhould be tied to communion with groſſe and notorious Heretikes. They muſt then be underſtood of communicating with all Chriſtians ſo farre forth as they are indeed Chriſtians: but what is this to prove either the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall univerſality of the Church, or that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch a Church? <hi>Auſtine</hi> wrote againſt the Donatiſts, who confined the Church to Affrike, excluding all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides from being of the Church.

                  <hi>Page</hi> 62.</note> the unity of the Church is neceſſary in all points of faith, and proving it firſt by Scriptures, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 35. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. then by fathers, as <hi>Auſtine contra Par. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Cypr. de unit. Eccleſ.</hi> and <hi>Hilar. ad Constant.</hi> Now this unity of the Church hath been ſpoken of before, and it hath beene ſhewed how far it is requiſite, as alſo how little cauſe they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have either to applaud themſelves for it, or to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide the Reformed Churches for want of it. <hi>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. well, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they of the Roman-church have one faith, yet except they have the one faith, this, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, what are they the better? But indeed neither is their faith ſo one, as they pretend, there being many great and weighty points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ one from another. See <hi>Gerard loc. com. de Eccleſ. Sect.</hi> 240 &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide (as I have ſaid before) if the confeſſions of the reformed churches be look't upon rather then particular mens opinions, or perhaps expreſſions, there will no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in points of faith be found amongſt them. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 35. here cited by the Marqueſſe, is not to the purpoſe, as not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of unity of faith, but rather of affection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. the Apoſtle exhorts them to unity, and that there might be no diviſions among them; but becauſe there was not ſuch unity, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40220:85"/>
was meet, but there were diviſions among them, he doth not therefore ſay, that they were no true Church: In a word, both the Scriptures and the Fathers are for the unity of the Church in points of Faith, and ſo are we; that the ſeverall Articles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches deny this Unity, the Marqueſſe affirmeth, but doth not prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We hold</hi> (faith the Marqueſſe) <hi>that every Miniſter of the Church,</hi>

               <hi>eſpecially the ſupreme Miniſter, or Head thereof, ſhould be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of fungifying his Office in Preaching the Goſpell, Adminiſtring the Sacrament, Baptizing, Marrying, and not otherwiſe. This we have Scripture for,</hi> Heb. No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as Aaron was. <hi>This you deny; and not onely ſo, but you ſo deny it, as that your Church hath maintained and practiced it a long time, for a woman to be head, or ſupreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratrix in the Church; when you know that according to the Word of God (in this reſpect) a woman is not onely forbidden to be the head of the man, but to have a tongue in her head,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>Yet ſo hath this been denyed by you, that many have beene hang'd, drawn and quarter'd for not acknowledging it. The Fathers are of our opinion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is but to ſtrike at the Title which hath beene given to <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> our Kings and Queens, <hi>viz.</hi> Supreme Heads, or Governours, and Governeſſes of the Church within their Dominions. We know our Adverſaries have much ſtomack'd, and oppoſed this Title, but we know no juſt cauſe that they have had for it. We never made Kings or Queens Miniſters of the Church, ſo as to diſpenſe the Word, and Sacraments, only we have attributed unto them this Power, to look to, and have a care of the Church, that the Word be Preached, and the Sacraments Adminiſtred by fit perſons, and in a right manner. This is no more then belongs unto Kings and Queens, as both Scriptures and Fathers doe informe us. We ſee in the Scriptures, that the good Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as <hi>Aſia, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> (not to ſpeak of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who were Prophets as well as Kings, and ſo may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt as extraordinary perſons) did put forth their power in ordering the Affaires of the Church, as well as of the Civill State. <hi>Aſa</hi> put down Idolatry, and cauſed the People to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant to ſerve the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> took
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40220:86"/>

            <p>

The exerciſing therefore of this power which we aſcribe to Kings and Queenes, is no taking that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to themſelves, which is ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. Neither is it any teaching, or ſpeaking in the Church, which the Apoſtle will not allow unto a woman, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this croſſe to what the Fathers, whom the Marqueſſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ſay, which amounts to this, that Miniſters are to doe thoſe things which belong unto Miniſters, and that in thoſe things which concern their Miniſtery, all, even Kings and Queens, are ſubject unto them. All this is nothing againſt Kings and Queens having a power over Miniſters, ſo as to ſee them perform the Offices which belong unto them. And it may ſeeme ſtrange that the Marqueſſe ſhould now ſo lately with ſo much eagerneſſe inveigh againſt that Title, and Power, given to that Queen of happy memory, Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as moſt unmeet for her, when as <note n="*" place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> his Conference with <hi>Hart</hi> in the end.</note>

            </p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that the Marqueſſe ſhould ſay, that we deny that <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Chriſt gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples to forgive Sinnes: We confeſſe that the Scripture is clear for it, that he did give them ſuch a Commiſſion; onely the queſtion is, how the Commiſſion is to be underſtood, and what power it is that the Diſciples had, and ſo other Miniſters have to forgive Sinnes? It's true, we hold that God only can forgive ſins, and yet withall, that men may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins. Theſe are not contradictory, the one to the other, becauſe (as all Logitians know) except the propoſitions be underſtood of one and the ſame thing, in one and the ſame reſpect; there is no contradiction. Now when we ſay, that onely God can forgive ſins, it is meant in one reſpect; and when we ſay, that men may forgive ſinnes, it is meant in another reſpect.

               </note> this Queſtion, and ſhewing diverſe Opinions about it, determines thus, <hi>That God only doth remit, and retain ſins, and that yet God hath given power to the Church to bind and looſe. But that God himſelf doth bind and looſe one way, and the Church another way. That God by himſelf alone doth forgive ſinne, ſo as to clenſe the ſoul from ſtaine, and to free it from the guilt of eternall death. That he hath not given this power to Prieſts, to whom yet he hath given power to looſe and bind, that is, to declare men to be looſed, or bound. Whence our Lord firſt by himſelfe made the Leper ſound, and then ſent him to the Prieſts, that they might declare him to be clean.</hi> And hence he inferres, that a Miniſter of the Goſpell hath ſuch <note place="margin">In ſolvendis ergò culpis, vel retinendis ita operatur ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus, ſicut olim legalis in illis, qui contaminati erant Leprâ, quae peccatum ſignat.—Et in remittendis, vel in retinendis culpis id juris atque officii habent Eccleſiaſtici ſacerdotes, quod olim habebant ſub lege legales in curan dis leproſis.

               </note> power in remitting or retaining ſins, as the Prieſt in the Law had in clenſing a Leper. The Prieſt was ſaid to make the Leper clean, or unclean, (ſo the words are in the Originall, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.) when he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40220:88"/>
did pronounce and declare him to be clean or unclean. So <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters remit, or retain ſinnes, when they pronounce and declare that ſins are remitted, or retained of God.</hi> And in this <hi>Lombard</hi> followed <hi>Hierome,</hi> who (as his words cited by <hi>Lombard</hi> doe ſhew) by this very ſimilitude of the Leviticall Prieſt, dealing with a Leper, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and ſets forth the manner how a Miniſter doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or retain ſins.

That the Jewes therefore, when they were baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> confeſſed their ſinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5, 6. is not enough to prove that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which we now diſpute of, although it did appeare that the confeſſion there ſpoken of, was a particular confeſſion, which yet appeares not.

That it was no generall confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in particular, the Marqueſſe ſaith appeares by <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18, 19. But if this confeſſion ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. were in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, doth it follow, that therefore the other mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. was ſo alſo? I ſee no force at all in this conſequence, the confeſſions being made by ſeverall perſons, at ſeverall times, and upon ſeverall occaſions. <note n="*" place="margin">Quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ad Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annis concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebant confitentes peccata ſua, ita modò deſcribuntur confitentes factaſua, procul dubio in genere, aut publica; neutra enim fuit confeſſio Sacramentalis, ſed profeſſio poenitentiae vitae praeteritae. <hi>Cajet. in Act.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>Cajetan</hi> indeed doth parallell theſe two places together, but ſo as that he maketh them both
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40220:89"/>
to ſpeake of a generall confeſſion, or a confeſſion onely of ſuch ſinnes as were publick and notorious. Neither of them (hee ſaith) was a ſacramentall confeſſion, but onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that they did repent of their life paſt. However, theſe places of Scripture can make nothing for Popiſh confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is injoyned, and forced, as without which (they ſay) ſalvation is not to be expected; but this which the Scriptures here ſpeake of, was voluntary and free, the perſons that confeſſed, did it of their own accord. The Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is auricular (as it is called) ſecret, in the eare of a Prieſt; this appeares to have been open and publick. The Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is a particular enumeration of all known ſinnes; this if it were of any particular ſinnes at all (as that mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19. may ſeeme to have been) yet onely of ſuch as more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially did trouble their conſcience, as may be collected from <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 20. and in ſuch a caſe to confeſſe not onely unto God, but alſo unto men, and eſpecially unto Miniſters, Proteſtants doe not condemne, but hold requiſite; onely they condemne that manner of confeſſion, which in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is maintained and practiſed.

Hee cites alſo one <hi>Grilerius,</hi> whom he calles a grave and holy Divine, that was a long time Preacher at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> who (hee ſaith) did often teſtifie among his friends, that according to the late Roman dictates, it is impoſſible to confeſſe, and thereupon did write a Booke in the <hi>German</hi> tongue, which he intituled, <hi>Of the diſeaſe of confeſſion,</hi> then which diſeaſe (ſaith <hi>Rhenanus)</hi> they that are troubled with it, deny that any is more grievous.</p>

But <hi>Auſtines</hi> words are of more force then thus to be evaded. We willingly grant that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaks not of Sacramentall Confeſſion, there being indeed no ſuch Confeſſion to be ſpoken of, as they call Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; no ſuch, I ſay, truly ſo called; and ſo much theſe very words of <hi>Auſtine</hi> doe ſufficiently teſtifie. For Sacramentall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as they call it) is a Confeſſion neceſſarily to be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Prieſt, or elſe no remiſſion of ſin (they ſay) committed after Baptiſme can be obtained, but <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſhewes that ordinarily Confeſſing unto men is not neceſſary.

                  <hi>Bell. de Poenit. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> then Sacramentall Confeſſion was not inſtituted, and therefore 'tis no marvell, if we doe not read of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion. And 'tis very true that Sacramentall Confeſſion neither then had, nor at all hath any divine inſtitution. Again <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes, that Tears (of which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaketh) containe a kind of Confeſſion in them. This indeed is true in reſpect of God, who knowes the heart and affection from whence Tears proceed: and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith that the Lord had heard the voice of his weeping, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 8. which ſhewes, that as the Tongue by ſpeaking, ſo the Eyes by weeping have a voice, which God doth hear.

            <p>And this opinion was maintained by ſome in the Roman

Church above a thouſand years after Chriſt.

               <hi>ſome thought it ſufficient to confeſſe onely unto God.</hi> This Opinion was not accounted a Hereſie by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf untill the time of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, about 1200 years after Chriſt, when in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> it was decreed neceſſary to confeſſe unto a Prieſt, and not unto God only. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who lived a little after <note place="margin">Si quis eſſet modò hujus opinionis, eſſet haereticus judicandus, quoniam in concilio generaſi hoc determinatum eſt ſub Innocentio tertio; ſed ante hanc determinationem hoc non erat haereſis. <hi>Bonav. in Sent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 17. <hi>num.</hi> 50.</note> that Councell, ſpeaking of thoſe who held it ſufficient to confeſſe only unto God, ſaith, that if any now were of that opinion, he were an Heretick, becauſe the contrary was determined in a Generall Councell, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that determination that Opinion was no Hereſie. Thus then we ſee by the acknowledgment of the Romiſh Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the neceſſity of Sacramentall Confeſſion (as they call it) is not fetched either from Scriptures, or Fathers, but from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, and the Councell that was in his time.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point touching Confeſſion, I will only adde one Argument for Confutation of the Romiſh Doctrine in this particular. Such Confeſſion as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> require, <hi>viz.</hi> a particular enumeration of all mortall ſins, with all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall aggravating circumſtances, is not poſſible. And therefore neither is it of divine inſtitution. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that by this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Poenit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note> reaſon it is impoſſible to confeſſe unto God; for that we hold, that Confeſſion made unto God muſt be intire, not of ſome ſins onely, but of all. And if we ſay, that it is ſufficient to confeſſe unto God all, ſo farre forth as we can come to the knowledge of them, adding that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>Who can underſtand his errours? Lord cleanſe me from my ſecret faults: Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that to confeſſe thus to a Prieſt doth ſuffice alſo. But, I ſay, this anſwer will not ſatisfie; for there is not the ſame reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing unto God, and of confeſſing to a Prieſt, as they require it. God knoweth all our ſinnes before we confeſſe, farre better then we our ſelves doe; onely we are to confeſſe unto him, to ſhew our ſelves humble and penitent. But our Adverſaries ſay, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40220:93"/>
particular Confeſſion muſt be made unto a Prieſt, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Poenit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> he cannot tell how to judge, ſo as either to remit ſinnes, or to retain them. Now to this end it is not enough to confeſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Prieſt all that one can find out, but it is neceſſary to confeſſe abſolutely all that one is guilty of. For otherwiſe how ſhall the Prieſt be able to judge of thoſe ſinnes which he knoweth not? If he cannot judge of thoſe ſins which are confeſſed, except they be confeſſed; then neither can he judge of thoſe ſins which are not confeſſed, becauſe they are not confeſſed: there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the one as for the other. If the Prieſt can judge of thoſe ſins, that are not confeſſed, by thoſe that are confeſſed, then may he alſo, by hearing the confeſſion of one or two ſins, judge of all the reſt, though no Confeſſion be made of them. Thus the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which our Adverſaries contend for, is either not poſſible, or at leaſt not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>After Confeſſion the Marqueſſe comes to workes of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 64.</note> which they ſay a man may doe, <hi>viz.</hi> good works, more excellent then thoſe, which the Law of God doth require. And that a man may doe ſuch workes, the Marqueſſe proves, by <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>There be eunuches, that have made themſelves eunuches for the Kingdome of Heaven: he that is able to receive it, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (the Marqueſſe ſaith) is more then a Commandement, as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> obſerves upon the place, <hi>Ser. lib. de temp.</hi> (it ſhould be <hi>Serm.</hi> 61. <hi>de temp.)</hi> for of precepts it is not ſaid, <hi>Keep them who is able,</hi> but keep them abſolutely. I anſwer, it is true of generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſuch as concern all, they are to be kept abſolutely by all; but for ſpeciall precepts, which concern only ſome, they are only to be kept by thoſe whom they do concern. And ſo thoſe words, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,</hi> are a precept, but limited and reſtrained, <hi>viz.</hi> unto ſome certain perſons, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe can, without inconvenience, live a ſingle life; they are required to doe it, not as a thing ſimply neceſſary, but as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them; not as a thing wherein perfection doth conſiſt, but as a means whereby the better to draw towards perfection, <hi>viz. To ſerve the Lord without diſtraction,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 35. Neither doe the Fathers (whom the Marqueſſe citeth) hold any ſuch works of Supererogation, as the Romaniſts plead for, <hi>viz.</hi> works
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40220:93"/>
more excellent and perfect then thoſe which the Law of God preſcribeth. <note n="*" place="margin">Qui praeceptum impleverint, dicere poſſunt, Servi inutiles ſumus, quod debuimus facere, fecimus. Hoc virgo non dicit; non dicit ille, qui bona ſua vendidit. <hi>Ambr. de viduis.</hi>

               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake more then the reſt, and therefore it may be hee is put in the firſt place, though ſome that are cited, are more ancient then hee. <hi>They that have fulfilled the precept</hi> (hee ſaith) <hi>may ſay, Wee are unprofitable ſervants, wee have done what our duty was to doe. This the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſaith not, nor hee that ſold his Goods, viz.</hi> to give to the poore.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> but have not theſe words need of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpretation? For will our adverſaries themſelves ſay, that there are any abſolutely ſo perfect, as that they need not confeſſe unto God, that they are unprofitable ſervants? what they will ſay I cannot tell, but ſure I am that Chriſts Diſciples, who were as perfect as any others, were not ſo perfect. For even to them did Chriſt ſpeake thoſe words, <hi>When yee ſhall have done all theſe things, which are commanded you, ſay, Wee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, wee have done but what was our duty to doe. Luke</hi> 17. 10. It may be our Adverſaries will ſay, true, when they had done all things commanded them, they were to ſay, <hi>we are unprofitable ſervants, &amp;c.</hi> but not when they had done more then was commanded them. But did they ſo? They left all indeed, and followed Chriſt; but did not Chriſt call them to it, and command them to doe it? In this therefore they did no more then their duty was to doe. We muſt diſtinguiſh therefore betwixt generall duties, and ſpeciall duties. All were not bound to forſake all actually, as the Apoſtles did, and to follow Chriſt, becauſe there was no generall precept for it; but the Apoſtles were bound to do it, becauſe they had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall call and command from Chriſt, that did oblige them to it. Thus then <hi>Ambroſes</hi> words muſt be underſtood, that in reſpect of a generall precept obliging all to the thing done, ſome may be ſaid to doe more then their duty was to doe, though ſimply and abſolutely they did not more. For if it were more for Gods glory to doe what they did, then not to doe it, they were bound to doe it. For elſe how did they love God with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, and with all their might? as all

               <hi>Origon</hi> is next cited, who ſaith that ſuch as live in virginity, doe not that which is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but above what is due. But the meaning is, that virginity is not a thing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally commanded, not a duty required of all; yet to ſome, who have the gift, and are called of God to improve it to the greater advancement of his glory, it is a duty; every one is bound to doe that, which doth make moſt for Gods glory, that being the end for which wee ought doe whatſoever wee doe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>

And this is the manner of a perfect life in Chriſtianity. The other kinde of life is more remiſſe, and humane, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in modeſt wedlock, and procreation of children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To ſuch belongeth the ſecond degree of piety.</hi> Thus <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who yet is far from aſſerting ſuch workes of ſupererogation as are now diſputed of. We grant, that to live unmarried ſo as thereby the better and the more freely to ſerve God, is a life of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then to live married, and ſo to be entangled with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the world. But we deny, that they who ſo live unmarried, doe ſupererogate, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they not only do all that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but alſo over and above what is commanded.

            <p>Next comes <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who may ſeeme to ſpeake much, but indeed it is not much to the purpoſe. <hi>Hee</hi> ſaith that <hi>many</hi>

It is not loſt, nor diminiſhed, either by ſinne, or miſery, it is not greater in the Righteous, then in the Sinner; not more full in an Angell, then in Man. For as the conſent of mans will, being by Grace turned unto good, therefore makes a man freely good, and free in that which is good, becauſe he is made volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not drawn againſt his will: So being freely devolved into evill, it makes a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe free, and ſpontaneous in evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by his own will, and not compelled and enforced by any other to be evill.</hi>

            <p>I come now to thoſe Scriptures, and Fathers, which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe doth alledge againſt us. Three places of Scripture are cited for proofe of <hi>Free-will,</hi> ſuch as our Adverſaries maintaine, and wee impugne. Firſt, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37.

But the queſtion is, whether men have ſuch a <hi>Free-will,</hi> as that of themſelves they can receive grace when it is offered. This is that which wee deny, neither doth the place alledged, make any thing for proofe of it.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe ſaith, <hi>There might have been a willingneſſe, as well as an unwillingneſſe,</hi> (ſo it ſhould be, though it be printed, <hi>as well as a willing) or elſe Chriſt had wept in vaine: and to thinke that he did ſo, were to make him an impoſtor.</hi> I grant that there might have been a willingneſſe, but not by the power of <hi>Free-will,</hi> except made free by grace, it being God that doth worke both the will and the deed. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. So the Jewes, of whom Chriſt complained, that they would not come unto him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 40. might have come; but yet of themſelves they could not come, not except it were given unto them of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 65. not except hee did draw them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 44. Whereas the Marqueſſe ſpeakes of Chriſts weeping, his minde was (it ſeemes) upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41, 42. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt drawing nigh to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> beheld it, and <hi>wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:40220:101"/>
But that Chriſt wept, when he ſaid, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, how often would I have gathered thy children, &amp;c.</hi> this we do not find, though the words be recorded both <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 37. and alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that Chriſt had wept, when he ſaid, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> yet had not his weeping been in vaine, though <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had no power of her ſelfe to doe that which there Chriſt ſpeaks of. For yet nevertheleſſe Chriſt ſhewed his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> even as he did towards <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he wept over him as he lay over the grave. <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> ſaid the Jewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 36. yet it is without all queſtion, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> of himſelf could not have come out of the grave, except Chriſt by his Almighty power had raiſed him up. Some perhaps may ſay, But why did Chriſt complain of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe, if it were not in her power to be willing? I anſwer, becauſe both her unwillingneſſe, and alſo her want of power to be willing was from her ſelf; it was her own fault, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was juſtly complained of, and reproved for it.</p>
            <p>But againe, ſome may ſay, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had ſufficient grace whereby ſhe might have been willing, or elſe Chriſt would not have complained that ſhe was unwilling. I anſwer, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had a ſufficiency of the means of Grace, which ſhe ought to have made uſe of, and to have been wrought upon by, but would not, and therefore did Chriſt complain of her. But <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had not a ſufficiency of the Spirit of Grace, without which ſhe could not improve the means, as ſhe ſhould have done; and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the complaint made of her was juſt: For God having given unto man, at firſt, Grace ſufficient to doe whatſoever he ſhould require, and this Grace being loſt by mans own fault, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. God is not bound to reſtore it but when, and where he pleaſeth; and yet may juſtly require the obedience that is due unto him, and complain for want of it, as a man may juſtly demand his debt of a bankrupt, and complain of him for not paying it, though he be not able to pay it. <note n="*" place="margin">Homo non poteſt ſolvere, nec reddere Deo, quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Deo: quia non poteſt Deo reddere totum amorem ſuum, nec timorem, nec honorem, nec obedientiam, nec voluntatem Dei facere, quia corruptus eſt, &amp; mutatus in contrarium ſuae naturae; &amp; ipſemet fecit ſe talem, ut non poſſit Deo facere quod debet: &amp; tamen ſemper debet: &amp; ſi debitum ſemper manet, nec excuſatur, quia tenetur: &amp; ſi non poteſt, ipſemet eſt in cauſa, &amp; in culpâ quare non poteſt, <hi>Raimund, de Sabund.

            <p>After the allegation of theſe places of Scriptures, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe addes, that the Ancient Fathers are of their Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> in point of Free-will, and he cites <hi>Euſeb.

            <p>Now for diverſe of the Antient Fathers, and namely for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> (whom the Marqueſſe alledgeth againſt us, and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is chiefly to be looked at in this Controverſie, as having moſt occaſion to declare himſelf in it, by reaſon of the Pelagian Hereſie which aroſe in his time) I have ſufficiently ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how far they are from compliance with our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>But to come to a particular examination of the Authors and places that are cited. Firſt <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the place mentioned, hath nothing at all (that I can find) about Free-will, the whole Chapter being <hi>de Phoenicum Theologiâ,</hi> about the Divinity of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hilary</hi> is ſo cited, that there is no looking after him; for he wrote twelve books of the Trinity, and here he is onely cited, <hi>de Trin.</hi> 1. of the Trinity, but in which of the twelve Books he ſaith any thing to this purpoſe, is not mentioned.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that which the Marqueſſe (I preſume) inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Simplic. quaeſt.</hi> 2. not <hi>q.</hi> 4. for there are but two Queſtions anſwered in the firſt Book; in the ſecond Book indeed there are more then four Queſtions, but nothing about Free-will. In the firſt Book, and ſecond Queſtion, there is ſomething that may ſeeme to make for the Opinion of the Marqueſſe, but much more is there, which doth indeed make againſt it; indeed, ſo much, that though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cite diverſe paſſages out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> for proof of Free-will, yet he was more cautious (it ſeemes) then to cite any thing out of that which <hi>Auſtine</hi> wrote about it to <hi>Simplicianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:40220:102"/>
Let us hear what <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf, in his Retractations (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did review all his Works) ſaith concerning his books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> and concerning that very Queſtion; in anſwer whereunto he hath much about Free-will: <hi>In the ſolution of which queſtion</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">In cujus quaeſtionis ſolutione labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt quidem pro libero arbitrio vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis humanae, ſed vicit Dei gratia. <hi>Aug. Retract. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> he) <hi>mans Free-will was much laboured for, but the Grace of God did overcome.</hi> And this will clearly appear by peruſing the Book it ſelfe, and the queſtion handled in it. The queſtion is about the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>Iacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated,</hi> and the reſt that follow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Now among other things that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, there is this, which (as I conceive) the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <note place="margin">Noluit ergo Eſau, &amp; non cucurrrit, ſed &amp; ſi voluiſſet, &amp; cucurriſſet, Dei adjutorio perveniflet, qui ei etiam velle, &amp; currere praeſtaret, niſi vocatione contemptâ reprobus fieret. Aliter enim Deus praeſtat ut velimus, aliter quod voluerimus. Ut velimus enim, &amp; ſuum eſſe voluit, &amp; noſtrum; ſuum vocan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, noſtrum ſequendo. Quod autem voluerimus, ſolus praeſtat, id eſt, poſſe benè agere, &amp; ſemper beatè vivere. <hi>Aug. ad Simplic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2.</note> aimed at, <hi>Eſau was not willing, and did not run; but if he had been willing, and had run, by the help of God he had obtained; God would have given him both to will, and to run, except by contemning Gods Call he would be a Reprobate. For God doth otherwiſe give us, that we may will, then he doth give us that which we have willed. For that we may will, God would have both to be his work, and ours: his by Calling, ours by Following when we are called. But that which we have willed, God alone doth give, that is, to be able to do well, and for ever to live happily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, I confeſſe, <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth ſeeme to ſhew himſelf a patron of Free-will, and we could not eaſily judge otherwiſe of him, if we ſhould look meerly upon theſe words, and take them as his poſitive ſentence. But if we conſider what <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith both before, and after, we ſhall ſee that he ſpake thus rather by way of objection, then by way of determination. Before theſe words he ſaith thus, <hi>A wheel doth not therefore run</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Non ideò benè currit rota ut rotunda ſit, ſed quia rotunda eſt: ſic nemo proptereà benè operatur, ut accipiat gratiam, ſed quia accepit. <hi>Ang. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>well, that it may be round, but becauſe it is round. So no man doth therefore work well, that he may receive grace, but becauſe he hath received it. Auſtine</hi> therefore was not of that minde, that <hi>Eſau</hi> of himſelf, by his free-will, could have been willing, and have run; or that any, when he is called, and incited by Grace, can
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40220:102"/>
by the power of Free-will follow, and obey, but it is grace that muſt work this in him.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe againe before the words objected, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtine) Iacob did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Si ergò Jacob ideò crededit, quia vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, non ei Deus donavit fidem, ſed eam ſibi ipſe volendo praeſtitit, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit aliquid, quod non accepit. <hi>Aug. Ibid.</hi>

               <hi>believe, becauſe he would, then God did not beſtow faith on him, but he by willing did afford it unto himſelf, and ſo he had ſomething which he received not.</hi> Which is contrary to the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. But a little after thoſe words that ſeeme to make for Free-will, <hi>Auſtine</hi> expreſſeth himſelf more fully: For having cited that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you, both to will, and to doe of his good pleaſure,</hi> he addes, <hi>The Apostle there ſufficiently ſhewes, that a</hi>

               <hi>good will it ſelf is wrought in us by God. For if therefore only it be ſaid,</hi> (Rom. 9.) <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy, becauſe the will of man alone is not ſufficient, that he may juſtly, and rightly, except it be helped by the mercy of God; then by this reaſon it may be ſaid. It is not of God that ſheweth mercy, but of man that willeth, becauſe the mercy of God alone is not ſufficient, unleſſe the conſent of our will be ad ded. But that is manifeſt, that we will in vain, except God ſhew mercy. This I know not how it can be ſaid, that God doth ſhew mercy in vain, except we be willing. For if God ſhew mercy, then we are willing; ſeeing it belongs to that ſame mercy to make us willing. For it is God that worketh in us both to will, and to doe of his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again a little after, having ſaid by way of objection, <hi>Free-will availeth much;</hi> he <note place="margin">Liberum voluntatis arbitrium pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum valet: imò verò, eſt quidem, ſed in venundatis ſub peccato quid valet? <hi>Aug Ibid.</hi>

               <hi>keepe the Commandements; you ſay it is impoſſible. Wee have Scripture for it.</hi> Luke 1. 6. <hi>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements, and Ordinances of the Lord, blameleſſe. And</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For keeping the Commandements we hold, not that it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply impoſſible, but that according to that meaſure of grace, which God doth ordinarily beſtow upon men here in this life, it is not poſſible to keep them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as not to be guilty of the breach of them. If a man could fully and perfectly keep the Commandements, then he ſhould be without ſin; for ſinne is nothing elſe but a tranſgreſſion of the Law, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> defines it, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 4. But the Scripture ſhewes that no man in this life is ſo perfect as to be without ſinne. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 20. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 John 1. 8. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iames, Iam.</hi> 3. 2.

            <p>But firſt, Veniall ſinnes are againſt the Law, as being tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it; for elſe they are no ſinnes at all, that being the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſinne, to be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 4.</p>

Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8.

            <p>For, 1. when <hi>David</hi> cried out, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, O Lord, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Pſal. 143. 2. hee ſhewes that workes, whatſoever they be, are unable to juſtifie a man in the ſight of God. For it were moſt abſurd and irrationall to imagine that <hi>David</hi> then doth onely deprecate Gods entring into judgement with him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Works, which hee did without the aſſiſtance of Gods grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle proves that juſtification is by Faith without Workes, by that of <hi>David, Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered: Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſinne.</hi> Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Now the beſt man</hi>

that is upon Earth, hath need of this; that his iniquities may be forgiven, his ſinnes covered, and his tranſgreſſions not imputed unto him, ſeeing there is no man (as I have ſhewed before) but iniquities, ſinnes and tranſgreſſions are found in him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though a man be regenerate and ſanctified, yet his workes are not ſuch, as that he can be juſtified by them.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Beſides, the Scripture oppoſeth juſtification to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſheweth that to juſtifie is as much as to abſolve and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit from guilt, to account and pronounce righteous. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt; even they both are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> There to juſtifie and to condemne are oppoſed-one to the other; and to juſtifie is to repute juſt, not to make juſt; for ſo it ſhould be no abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to juſtifie the wicked, but a very good worke. <hi>For hee which converteth a ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a</hi>

            <p>The other place, <hi>viz.</hi> Jam. 2. 24. doth ſeeme to make againſt us, but indeed it doth not. For S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaying that <hi>a man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Workes, and not by Faith onely,</hi> meanes onely thus, as <note n="*" place="margin">Non fide ſterili, ſed faecundâ operibus juſtificamur. <hi>Cajetan: in Iac.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Cajetan</hi> himſelfe doth expound it, that we are not juſtified by a barren Faith, but by a Faith, which is fruitfull in good Workes.</p>
            <p>This appeares to be his meaning by his whole diſcourſe from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee bends himſelfe againſt thoſe, who preſume of ſuch a faith as is without workes: and more ſpecially, it may appeare by the verſes immediately preceding, wherein hee ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by workes, when hee offered up <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and that Faith wrought with his workes, and by workes was Faith made perfect: and the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Now this clearly ſhewes that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Faith, and not by workes, onely his workes did ſhew, that his Faith was a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40220:111"/>
true juſtifying Faith indeed, and not, as it is in many that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and profeſſe Faith, a vaine ſhew of Faith, and a meere ſhadow of it. For that, which S. <hi>Iames</hi> citeth, <hi>Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> was, as appeares by the ſtory in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> long before that <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and by thoſe very words Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that wee are juſtified by Faith, and not by Workes. Therefore when S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith that by <hi>Abrahams</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up of <hi>Iſaac</hi> that Scripture was fulfilled, the meaning is, that thereby it did appeare that it was truly ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee believed God, and it was counted unto him For righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, his readineſſe in that worke to obey God, did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that hee believed God indeed, and that his faith was of a right ſtampe. Thus alſo is it ſaid, that by workes faith was made perfect, <hi>viz.</hi> even as the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Paul, My ſtrength is made perfect in weakeneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9. that is, Gods ſtrength doth exerciſe it ſelfe, and ſhew how great it is, in mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

But this is nothing to us, who are farre from holding ſuch a Faith as that ſufficient. But in the ſame place <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath this for our purpoſe, that when the Apoſtle ſaith that a Man is juſtified by Faith without the Workes of the Law, hee did not intend that the Workes

               </note> that every one ſhould know, that hee may be juſtified by faith, though the workes of the Law did not goe before.

If it be rendered according to workes, how ſhall it be accounted mercy? But it is one thing to render according</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:40220:113"/>
               <hi>to workes, and another thing to render, becauſe of the workes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In that there is a rendring according to workes, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of workes is conſidered, ſo as that whoſe workes are found to be good, his reward alſo ſhall be glorious. For unto that bleſſed life, in which wee live with God, and of God, no labour can be equall, no workes comparable, eſpecially when as the Apostle ſaith, The ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy of that glory, which ſhall be revealed in us. Beſides alſo in this reſpect it may be juſtly called mercy, becauſe it is given for thoſe workes, which none can attaine unto without the prevention of Gods mercy.</hi> Thus <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who above a thouſand yeeres agoe was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> both argues for us, and alſo by a diſtinction anſwers that which is objected againſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth render to all according to their workes. And for the word <hi>reward,</hi> which the Scripture often uſeth, it doth not preſuppoſe merit; for a reward may proceede from the bounty of the giver, not from the merit of the receiver. They that wrought but one houre in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, though they received a penny, as much as they that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured all the day, though (I ſay) they received this as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their labour, yet did they not merit it by their labour. This very parable doth <hi>Proſper</hi> (or who ever was the Author of the Booke <hi>de vocatione gentium,)</hi> apply in this manner; <hi>without doubt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they that were ſent into the Vineyard at the eleventh houre, and were</hi>

But that theſe ſeducers or ſeduced ones, were ever ſuch believers, as that they were indued with juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, neither can it be proved; <hi>Tertullian</hi> was of another minde, as appeares by his words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited. Yea, ſo was S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe words to this purpoſe both <hi>Tertullian</hi> and other Fathers (as I have ſhewed) have made uſe of, when hee ſaith, ſpeaking of ſuch as thoſe, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 19. Or they ſpeak of an Hiſtoricall Faith, whereby one doth aſſent unto the truth of the Goſpell, and is ſomewhat affected with it, but it doth not take roote in the heart, as it is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>yet hath hee not roote in himſelfe:</hi> and therefore this is not ſuch a Faith, as wee ſpeake of, when wee ſay, that Faith cannot be loſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a Faith, whereby Chriſt is received, and doth dwell in the heart. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. For all that Faith, which is ſpoken of <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. a man is but chaffe ſtill, and not true wheat whatſoever hee ſeeme either to himſelfe or others. They compared to the thorny ground, who <hi>for a while believe,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from ſuch as have <hi>a good and honest heart,</hi> Luke 8. 13. 15. Therefore thoſe temporary believers are no ſound and ſincere Believers: <hi>their heart is not right with God, and therefore they are not ſtedfast in his Covenant.</hi> Pſal. 78. 37.</p>

But ſome may, and indeed doe ſay, <hi>Gods repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is not the cauſe of any mans damnation, but mans own ſinne is the proper cauſe both of reprobation and damnation.</hi> But though this be aſſerted by ſome of our adverſaries, yet others of that party will not approve of it.

               <hi>two acts,</hi> &amp; <hi>c. For firſt God hath not a will of ſaving them</hi> (viz. the Reprobate) <hi>And then he hath a will of damning them.

on him but for ſinne. Yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that which hee ſaith, is not ſo accurate as hee might be; For <hi>non habere voluntatem ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandi,</hi> not to have a will to ſave a man, or not to will a mans ſalvation, is properly no act, but rather a negation of an act, and therefore indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calles it <hi>actum negativum</hi> a <note place="margin">Bellar.

And therefore <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> maketh the firſt act of Reprobation <note place="margin">Reprobatio Dei aeterna includit actum poſitivum, quo voluit quoſdam non admittere ad vitam aeternam—Deus n. verè non reprobavit homines vel angelos poſſibiles, qui nunquam erunt; &amp; tamen circa illos ſe habuit negativè, non ordinando eos ad vitam aeternam.

It's one thing not to have a will to ſave; and another thing to have a will not to ſave; the former is meerly negative, but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is poſitive. And hee proves that Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation doth include a poſitive act, becauſe the meere negative of not ordaining unto life eternall is even in reſpect of men and angells that onely may be, but never ſhall be.

               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:40220:123"/>
               <hi>whole lumpe is depraved by ſinne, &amp;c. but he anſwers ſo, as that he refers as well the Reprobation of theſe, as the election of thoſe, unto the ſole Will of God, and ſo repreſſes the curious inquirer, O man, who art thou, &amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>That compariſon of a Potter of the ſame lumpe making one veſſell unto honour, and another unto diſhonour, doth exclude the ſuppoſition of a corrupt lumpe. For here verily is nothing ſuppoſed in the lumpe, but that it is indifferent, and may be faſhioned both the one way, and the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this learned Papiſt goes as farre in the point both of Election and of Reprobation as any Proteſtant (that I know) whatſoever. Neither would he have us thinke that he goes alone; for hee cites many, as <hi>Lombard, Hugo de S. Victore, Aquinas, Cajetan, Lyra, Titleman,</hi> and <hi>Pererius,</hi> as being of the ſame opinion with him, and interpreting the words of the Apoſtle in the ſame manner. And this (I ſuppoſe) may ſuffice to vindicate the Doctrine of Proteſtants (even ſuch as goe higheſt in this point) as touching Reprobation.</p>

               <hi>Alvarez</hi> relates, is, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>Gods antecedent will.</hi> Thus (hee ſaith) <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth expound it in diverſe places, and for this Expoſition hee alſo cites <hi>Damaſcene, Proſper, Theophylaot, Oecumenius, Aquinas,</hi> as alſo <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and ſaith that it is common among the Doctors. Now in the next Diſputation hee tels us that <hi>Gods antecedent Will</hi> is that, which reſpects the object ſimply conſidered, and by it ſelfe: and that this will is called <hi>antecedent,</hi> not becauſe it goes before the good, or ill uſe of our will, as ſome thinke, but becauſe it goes before that will, whereby God reſpects the object conſidered with ſome adjunct, which is the conſequent, and latter conſideration of it. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the ſalvation of the Reprobate be conſidered ſimply by it ſelfe, ſo God doth will it: but if it be conſidered, as it hath adjoyned the privation, or want of a greater good, to wit, the univerſall good of manifeſting Gods Iuſtice in the Reprobate, and of cauſing his Mercy the more to ſhine forth in the Elect, ſo God doth not will it. And in this reſpect were affirmed, that God by a conſequent will doth not will that all ſhall be ſaved, but only ſuch as are predeſtinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now take any of all theſe foure Explications of the Apoſtles words, wherein hee ſaith, that <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved</hi> (as for my part I like beſt either the ſecond, or the laſt) take any of them, I ſay, and the Apoſtles words are nothing againſt that which Proteſtants hold concerning Reprobation. As for that of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe expounds both it, and the former place, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. of that <note place="margin">Verum eſt, Deum velle omnes ſalvos fieri voluntate illâ, quam rectè Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi antecedentem vocant. <hi>Bell. de grat. &amp; lib. arb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> Will of God, which Divines call <hi>Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent will.</hi> Now what that <hi>Antecedent</hi>

               </note> ſay, <hi>It is moſt true, that all are not ſaved, becauſe they will not: for if they would, God would not be wanting unto them.</hi> Yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hee addes, <hi>But none can have a will to be ſaved, except God by preventing and preparing the will, make him to will it. And why God doth not make all to will this, who hath knowne the mind of the Lord? and who hath been his Counſellour?</hi> (Rom. 11. 34.) The laſt place of Scripture, which the Marqueſſe objecteth, is Ezech. 33. 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I delight not in the death of a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this alſo we have <hi>Alvarez</hi> to anſwer for us, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt that it is meant of ſpirituall death, which is by ſinne. Which <note place="margin">Intelligitur de morte ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali, quae eſt per peccatum. Hanc enim non vult Deus ſed ſolùm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligitur haec ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textu: ait enim, ſed magis ut convertatur, &amp; vivat. Si autem explicetur de morte ſecundâ, ſcil. de damnatione aeternâ, dicendum eſt, quòd Deus non vult hanc mortem alicui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, niſi ſuppoſito peccato, ut diſp. 109. &amp; 110. patebit. <hi>Alvar. de Auxil. diſp.</hi> 33. <hi>num.</hi> 5.</note> God doth only permit, but doth not delight in it. And this Explication hee ſaith, is confirmed by the words following, <hi>but rather that he be converted, and live.</hi> And if it be expounded of the ſecond death, which is eternall damnation, the meaning, hee ſaith, is, that God will not inflict this upon any but for ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:40220:125"/>
But though God will not inflict damnation upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but for ſinne; yet this ſame <hi>Alvarez</hi> (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly before) and ſo other Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe tell us, that God by his eternall Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his meere Will, and Pleaſure, doth determine to ſuffer the Reprobate to ſinne, and ſo to damne them for it. And thus now I have made it appeare (I hope) ſufficiently, that by the conſent of the Romaniſts themſelves the Scriptures alledged are not repugnant to the Doctrine of Proteſtants concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: neither (I thinke) will the Fathers, whom the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe citeth, be againſt it. The firſt of them is <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who (as hath before been ſhewed) is as much for us as we neede deſire. He is here produced againſt us, but ſo as that I know not eaſily how to finde what he ſaith. For onely <hi>li.</hi> 1. <hi>de Civit. Dei.</hi> is cited, but no Chapter, whereas there are no leſſe then 36. in that booke: this is a ſtrange kinde of citing Authors, but the fault may be in the Printer, or in ſome other, and not in the Marqueſſe. As for <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who is next cited, I ſee not any thing in the place pointed at, which is to this purpoſe, except this, <hi>Seeing it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nam cum Scriptum ſit, Deus mortem non fecit, nec laetatur in perditione vivorum, utique qui neminem vult perire, cupit peccatores poenitentiam agere, &amp; per poenitentiam denuò ad vitam redire. <hi>Cypr. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>vel edit.

               <hi>God made not death, nor doth he rejoyce in the deſtruction of the living, ſurely he that would not have any to periſh, deſires that ſinners may come to Repentance, and that by Repentance they may returne unto life againe.</hi> Now that which <hi>Cyprian</hi> here alledgeth, <hi>viz.

unto ſome, and not to others, as hee pleaſeth; which I have alſo ſhewed to be acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine, Alvarez, Eſtius,</hi> and others of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it is moſt cleare by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If God peradventure will give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25. and that, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardneth.</hi> Rom. 9. 18.</p>

And that therefore according to <hi>Auſtine</hi> (whoſe words are cited before) the prime and ſupreme cauſe why ſome are not ſaved,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40220:126"/>
is not becauſe they will not, but becauſe God will not.

            <p>Thus both Scriptures and Fathers teſtifie that Chriſtians may be aſſured of their ſalvation.

Now that he may be aſſured of his being in the ſtate of grace ſome of the Romiſh Church, and that ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> time, have maintained, as namely <hi>Catharinus,</hi> and the Author of the Booke called <hi>Enchiridium Colonienſe,</hi> both which are mentioned in this reſpect

            <p>And therefore here hee muſt be underſtood as intending only to prevent ſecurity, and a caſting off all care for the future. For ſo immediately hee goes on, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall:</hi>

            <p>Now for the two places of Scripture, which the Marqueſſe objecteth, one of them is already anſwered from <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> And the ſame anſwer alſo belongs to the other place, <hi>viz.</hi> Hoſ. 12. 4. the Angell there ſpoken of is not a created Angell,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40220:137"/>
but God himſelfe, as appeares by the words immediately going before v. 3. <hi>He had power with God;</hi> then followes v. 4. <hi>yea he had power over the Angell, and prevailed; he wept alſo, and made ſupplications unto him.</hi> This ſhewes that God and the Angell there mentioned are one and the ſame. This which the Prophet ſpeaketh of <hi>Iacobs</hi> making ſupplications to the Angell, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that Gen. 32. 26. <hi>I will not let thee go except thou bleſſe me,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the place obſerveth. Now if <hi>Iacob</hi> would not deſire a bleſſing for his Nephewes from a created Angell (and wee have ſeene that in the judgement of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hee would not) then ſurely neither was it ſuch an Angell of whom he himſelfe did ſeeke to be bleſſed. And <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the words of <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Roboratus benedictionibus Angeli, qui ipſe eſt Deus. <hi>Hicron. in Hoſ.</hi> 12.</note> plainly that this angell is God. None of the Fathers are here alledged againſt us, but onely <hi>Auſtine,</hi> whom I have ſhewed to teſtifie abundantly for us. That which hee <note place="margin">Angelos videtur poſtulare, ut pro eo deprecentur, aut certè ſanctos, ut pro paenitente orent. <hi>Aug. in Job.</hi> 19. 21.</note> ſaith in the place quoted, is that <hi>Iob</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deſire the angels to intreat for him, or elſe ſome of the Saints.

I anſwer, firſt <hi>Auſtine</hi> here maketh as well againſt them, as againſt us. For he ſpeakes as much of <hi>Iobs</hi> praying unto Saints, as unto angells: now our adverſaries hold (as I ſhall ſhew more hereafter) that in thoſe times before Chriſts comming the Saints were not to be prayed unto. Again, <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth not ſay, that <hi>Iob</hi> did pray either to Saints or angels, but that hee deſired, yea onely that hee ſeemeth to have deſired, that they might pray for him. Thirdly for one place, wherein <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh obſcurely and doubtfully for praying to angels, wee have many plaine and evident teſtimonies of his againſt it, as before I have ſhewed.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40220:138"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes that <hi>Gregory</hi> upon the place doth anſwer, that <note place="margin">

               <hi>the ſoules of the dead are; ſo they that are dead, know not how they live that are after them.</hi> Indeed hee addes preſently after, <hi>This yet is not to be thought of the holy ſoules, becauſe they that ſee the brightneſſe of Almighty God, are by no meanes to be thought ignorant of any thing beſides.</hi> Therefore he underſtands <hi>Iob</hi> as ſpeaking onely of ſuch dead perſons, as are unholy, whereas indeed <hi>Iobs</hi> words are indefinite, and indifferently to be underſtood of all that are dead, except by ſpeciall Revelation any thing done here below be made known unto them. <hi>Thou deſtroyeſt the hope of man,</hi> v. 19. <hi>viz.</hi> his hope of continuing here in this life. <hi>Thou changeſt his countenance, and ſendest him away,</hi> v. 20.

So that the coherence of the words ſhews, that they are meant generally of all that are deceaſed. And that which <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith of the Saints, that ſeeing God, in him they ſee all things, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe (it ſeemes) did thinke too laviſh, and therefore he limits it to all things which concerne them, or belong unto them.

               </note> by our adverſaries owne confeſſion, they have no certainty of this, that the Saints in Heaven are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly acquainted with things here on Earth. Some may ſay, that they are certaine that it is ſo, though they be uncertain how it comes to be ſo. I anſwer, indeed if the Scripture did affirme that ſo it is, then wee might and ought to be aſſured of it, though wee could not ſee why it is ſo. But the Scripture is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40220:139"/>
ſo farre from affirming it, that it denies it, as I have ſhewed; and therefore they that maintaine it, muſt both anſwer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where it is denied, and alſo by Scripture prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſſertion, which they neither doe, nor can doe. That place cited by the Marqueſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Luke 16. 29. is not of force to prove it. For 1. Some Romiſh Expoſitors, and namely <hi>Ianſenius</hi> doth confeſſe that it is doubtfull whether that which is ſpoken of the rich <note place="margin">Dubium eſt, an hoc exemplum ſit tantum parabola, &amp;c. <hi>Janſen.

Certum eſt enim divitem in inferno non locutum eſſe linguâ, nec oculis corporalibus vidiſſe <hi>Abraham, &amp;c. Jan. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> yet this (hee ſaith) muſt needs be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that all things did not happen ſo as they are related. For that it is certaine that the rich man being in Hell, did not ſpeake with a Tongue, nor with bodily Eyes did ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome, nor did complaine of the ſcorching of his Tongue, nor did deſire water to cole it. Therefore (hee ſaith) Chriſt did accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himſelfe to our capacity, and declare the things of the life to come after the manner of the things of this life, ſo that thoſe <note place="margin">Ita ut corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, quae poſt hanc vitam commemoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſint alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricè &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiter accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda, ſive ſit nuda parabola, ſive vera Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria. <hi>Janſen.

               </note> things are to be underſtood allegorically and ſpiritually, whether it be a bare Parable, or a true Hiſtory. And for the words ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, he ſheweth that they are more eaſie to be underſtood, if this part of Scripture be taken not for a Hiſtory, but onely for a Parable. For then it may be ſaid, that Chriſt did feigne theſe things, which were not done indeed, onely to inſtruct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh thoſe that are alive, that they ſhould not think to excuſe their impenitency by this, that they were never informed of the eſtate of the life to come by any that did returne from it. That men might not thinke thus, he ſaith, that Chriſt did bring in the <note place="margin">Si autem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum hoc non Hiſtoria eſſe dicatur, ſed parabola tantùm, facilior erit quaeſtionis explicatio.

For <hi>Abraham</hi> confuting that opinion of the common ſort of people anſwered, <hi>If they heare not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they believe, although one ſhould ariſe from the dead.</hi> Thus then that place doth not evince, that <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that the Jewes had the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Prophets. 2. Suppoſe that part of Scripture to be a Hiſtory, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> did indeed know that the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were upon the Earth, yet it doth not therefore follow that hee knew all the ſeverall things done amongſt men. What God would pleaſe to reveale, hee might know, but how much that is, who can tell? yea the Romaniſts themſelves do hold that neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor any other, during the time of the old <note place="margin">Reſponderi poteſt, Abrahamum, Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, &amp; alios Patres veteris Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti non cognoviſſe poſteros ſuos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventes, quia nondum beati erant, &amp;c. <hi>Bellarm, de Sanct. beatit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> Teſtament, did underſtand the eſtate of men here alive.

By the thred of his own Expoſition it appeares, that his argument is of no force why the 24. Elders may not ſignifie the whole Church. And although hee make it to be without doubt, that the 24.

But how ever it be, thus much may ſufficiently appeare by what hath beene ſaid, that the Romaniſts can evince nothing from this Scripture as to this point, that the Saints in Heaven doe underſtand the particular eſtate of men here upon Earth, and pray for them.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This point of praying to Saints, the Marqueſſe (it ſeemes) made great account of, in that he beſtowed ſo many words about it: but the unlawfulneſſe of this practice is cleare enough by that which I have ſaid before about praying unto Angels. For I have demonſtrated both by authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40220:142"/>
and alſo by teſtimony of Fathers, that prayer is to be made unto God onely. And if the Saints doe not know our affaires here below (as I have ſhewed that they doe not) then it muſt needs be abſurd and irrationall to pray unto them. Yea, although we ſhould but onely deſire them to pray for us, as here we deſire the prayers one of another. But whatever our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſometimes may pretend, yet they are farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves with this liberty, though it be more then is allowed them. Their praying unto the Saints, is a worſhipping of them, as I have ſhewed before by their own confeſſion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo tells us, that when they ſay, the Saints are onely <note place="margin">Notandum, cum dicimus, non debere peti à ſanctis, niſi ut orent pro nobis, nos non agere de Verbis, ſed de ſenſu verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. Nam quantum ad verba, licet dicere, S. Petre miſerere mei, ſalva me, aperi mihi aditum caeli, item da mihi ſanitatem corporis, da patientiam, da mihi fortitudinem, &amp;c. dummodo intelligamus, ſalva me, &amp; miſerere mei orando pro me, da mihi hoc &amp; illud tuis precibus, &amp; meritis. <hi>Bellar. dc ſanct. beat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> to be requeſted to pray for us, they doe not meane but that we may ſay, S. <hi>Peter have mercy on me, ſave me, open an entrance into Heaven for me: give me health of body, give me patience, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, &amp;c.</hi> So that we underſtand it thus, <hi>Save me, and have mercy on me by praying for me: give me this or that by thy prayers and merits.</hi> But what is this, but to diſplace Chriſt, and to ſet up Saints in his roome?</p>
            <p>Their Pope <hi>Leo</hi> cited by their <hi>Caſſander,</hi> concerning this ſame point, hath taught a <note place="margin">Accepere ſancti, non dedere coronas; &amp; de fortitudine fidelium exempla nota ſunt patientiae, non dona juſtitiae. <hi>Leo apud Caſſand. conſult. de merit. &amp; interceſſ. ſanct.</hi>
               </note> better leſſon, ſaying, <hi>The Saints have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not given crownes: and by the fortitude of Believers we have examples of patience, not gifts of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Caſſander</hi> cites, ſhewing how ill it ſuites with the Romiſh practice, which hee (although a Romaniſt) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of as too exorbitant. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes it very ill that <hi>Calvine</hi> ſayes they pray unto the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to command her Sonne: with great <note place="margin">Dicit nos rogare Virginem, ut fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jubeat facere quod petimus.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture plainly ſhewes, that our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Sacrament of his Supper, took, and bleſſed, and gave the Cup as well as the bread, and commanded that to be drunk as well as this to be eaten in remembrance of him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

And he bids <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that Bread, and drinke of that Cup.</hi> Proteſtants therefore have good reaſon to hold it neceſſary to communicate in both kindes, and that it is utterly unlawfull to withhold the Cup from people, as they in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do.

But 1. by this reaſon they may as well withhold the bread alſo from the people, and ſo deprive them of the whole ſacrament. For when Chriſt gave the Bread, and bad <hi>take, eate,</hi> he ſpake onely to the Apoſtles, as well as when hee gave the cup, and bad that all ſhould drinke of it. 2.

               <hi>the Sacrifice of the Maſſe (as an expiation for the ſinnes of the people) is a true and proper Sacrifice. This you deny: this we prove by Scripture, viz.</hi> Mal. 1. 11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sunne to the</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:40220:151"/>
               <hi>going downe of the ſame, my Name ſhall be great among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and in every place Incenſe ſhall be offered to my Name, and a pure offering. This could not be meant of the figurative offerings of the Iewes; becauſe it was ſpoken of the Gentiles: neither can it be understood of the reall ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe; becauſe that was done but in one place, and at one time, and then, and there, not among the Gentiles neither. Which could be no other but the daily ſacrifice of the Maſſe; which is, and ever was, from Eaſt, to Weſt, a pure and daily ſacrifice. Luke</hi> 22. 19. <hi>This is my body, which is given for you, not to you: therefore a ſacrifice. The Fathers are of this opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Chriſt is offered up in the Euchariſt a Sacrifice truly and properly ſo called, Proteſtants have good cauſe to deny. For the Euchariſt is a Sacrament, to be received by us; not a ſacrifice, to be offered unto God. Chriſt inſtituting the Sacrament, gave it to his Diſciples; hee did not offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as then unto his Father. The Scripture tells us, that <hi>Wee are ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Ieſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> Heb. 10. 10. And immediately after there it followes, that whereas the Leviticall Prieſts did <hi>often offer the ſame ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Chriſt having offered one Sacrifice for ſinnes, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26, 27, 28. the Apoſtle proves that Chriſt was not to be offered often, becauſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was his ſuffering; ſo that if hee ſhould have been offered often, then he ſhould alſo have ſuffered often. But (ſaith he) <hi>as it is appointed unto men to die once, &amp;c. So Chriſt was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, &amp;c. Bellarmine</hi> alſo averres, that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true ſacrifice it is required, that the thing,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ad verum ſacrificium requiritur, ut id quod offertur Deo in ſacrificium, planè deſtruatur, id eſt, ita mutetur, ut deſinat eſſe id, quod antè erat. <hi>Bell. de Miſs. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>which is offered unto God for a ſacrifice, be plainly deſtroyed, that is, that it ceaſe to be what it was before.</hi> So that if Chriſt bee offered up in the Euchariſt, a true and proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, then hee muſt be deſtroyed, hee muſt ceaſe to be what he was before. Whether or no it be blaſphemy to affirme this of Chriſt, let all judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed afterward indeavours to anſwer this argument; Let us ſee what he <note place="margin">Hoſtiam, quae offertur, occidi &amp; mactari neceſſe eſt: Ergo ſi Chriſtus ſingulis Miſſis ſacrificatur, eum ſingulis momentis mille in locis cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliter interfici oportet.—Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo, Sacrificium Miſſae eſſe veriſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſacrificium, &amp; tamen non exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere veram hoſtiae occiſionem.

At cum forma ſacrificii eſt rei inanimae, ut Panis, Vini, Thuris, &amp; ſimilium, non poteſt requiri occiſio, ſed ſolum conſumptio rei illi conveniens. In Miſſâ igitur offertur quidem Chriſtus, qui eſt res vivens, &amp; offertur in formâ rei viventis, quantum ad repraeſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, ubi ſolum requiritur mors Repraeſentata, non autem mors reip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſà: ſed ut eſt ſacrificum reale, &amp; propriè dictum, offertur in formâ panis &amp; vini, juxta ordine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Melchiſedech, &amp; proinde in formâ rei inanimae.—Quarè conſumptio hujus ſacrificii non debet eſſe occiſio, ſed manducatio. <hi>Bell. de Miſſâ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> ſaith. The argument hee propounds thus,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40220:151"/>
               <hi>The ſacrifice, that is offered, must be ſlaine. Therefore if Chriſt be ſacrificed in every Maſſe, he muſt every moment in a thouſand places be cruelly ſlaine.</hi> To this hee anſwers thus, <hi>The ſacrifice of the Maſſe is a moſt true ſacrifice, and yet doth not require the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that which is offered. For killing is only required in the offering of a thing that hath life, and which is offered in the forme of a thing that hath life, as when Lambes, Calves, Birds, and the like are offered, whoſe deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſts in death. But when the forme of the ſacrifice is of a thing without life, as of Bread, Wine, Frankincenſe, and the like, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot be required, but only ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of the thing as is agreeable to it. In the Maſſe therefore Chriſt is indeed offered, who is a thing having life; and he is offered in the forme of a thing having life, in reſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, where onely a death repreſentative is required, but not death indeed. But as he is a reall and properly ſo called ſacrifice, he is offered in the forme of Bread and Wine, according to the order of Melchiſedech, and therefore in the forme of a thing without life.—Wherefore the conſuming of this ſacrifice ought not to be Killing, but Eating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have rehearſed his words at large, that ſo his anſwer may be ſeene at full. But though there be many wordes, which hee uſeth, yet it is ſomewhat hard to know what hee meaneth. Certainly this is a very ſtrange kinde of ſacrifice, that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of. Chriſt is offered up a ſacrifice both in the forme of a thing that hath life, and alſo in the forme of a thing that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. And as hee is offered in the forme of a thing that hath life, hee is onely offered in reſpect of repreſentation; but as he is offered in the forme of a thing that is without life, hee is really and indeed offered. So that Chriſt being offered in the forme of a thing that hath life, his death is repreſented; but he being offered in the forme of a thing that is without life, his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40220:152"/>
death is not repreſented, and much leſſe is it really executed, and yet Chriſt is ſo really and properly ſacrificed. Theſe things do but very unhandſomely hang together. But whereas hee ſaith, that <hi>the conſuming of this ſacrifice is the eating of it,</hi> I demand, is Chriſts Body ſo eaten, as that it ceaſeth to be what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If it be not, (as certainly it is not, Chriſts Body being now glorified, and ſo free from all mutation) then is it not truly and properly ſacrificed, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe telling us (as I have ſhewed before) that whatſoever is truly and properly ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is ſo deſtroyed, as that it ceaſeth to be what it was before. To talke here of conſuming the <hi>species</hi> or forme of bread, ſo that it ceaſeth to be what it was before, is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for they maintaine, that <hi>the Body and Blood of the Lord are that ſacrifice,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Corpus &amp; ſanguis Domini ſunt id ſacrificium, quod in Miſſâ propriè offertur, &amp; ſacrificatur. <hi>Bell. de Miſſ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> 
               <hi>which is properly offered and ſacrificed in the Maſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo ſpeaketh of Chriſts being offered in the forme of Bread and Wine, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of Melchiſedech,</hi> I deſire to know by whom CHRIST is ſo offered? For either by himſelfe, or by the Prieſt that ſaith Maſſe. Not by himſelfe; for here we ſpeak of Chriſts being offered in the Euchariſt, which is not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by Chriſt, hee being now in Heaven. Nor by the Prieſt on Earth, there being no Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> but Chriſt only. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 15, &amp;c. And thus indeed there is no Prieſt upon Earth, that is properly ſo called; and conſequently there is no true and proper ſacrifice to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. For every ſacrifice preſuppoſeth a Prieſt to offer it; and ſuch as the ſacrifice is, ſuch alſo muſt the Prieſt be; hee muſt be a Prieſt properly ſo called, if it be a ſacrifice properly ſo called. But there is no ſuch Prieſt upon Earth; there being none (as I have ſhewed) after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> nor yet any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for that order is aboliſhed, as all the Leviticall ſacrifices are. And of any other order beſides theſe we read not in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Againe, in a ſacrifice properly ſo called, it muſt be ſome ſenſible thing, (as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries <note place="margin">Sacrificium eſt oblatio, &amp;c. quâ res a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua ſenſibilis, &amp; permanens ritu my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtico conſecratur, &amp; tranſmutatur. <hi>Bell. de Miſſ lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> themſelves acknowledge) that is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40220:152"/>
offered. But Chriſt is not ſenſible in the Euchariſt; for by what ſenſe is hee there diſcerned? And therefore neither is hee there truly and properly ſacrificed. Neither was this Doctrine <hi>(viz.</hi> that Chriſt is properly ſacrificed in the Euchariſt) received in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for more then 1100 years after Chriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Maſter of the Sentences, <note n="*" place="margin">Poſt haec quaeritur, ſi quod gerit ſacerdos, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè dicatur ſacrificium vel immolatio, &amp; ſi Chriſtus quotidiè im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moletur, vel ſemel tantùm immolatus ſit.

               <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> who propounds the queſtion, <hi>whether that which the Prieſt doth, be properly a ſacrifice, and whether Chriſt be ſacrificed daily, or were only once ſacrificed.</hi> And to this hee anſwers that, <hi>that which is offered and conſecrated by the Prieſt, is called a ſacrifice, and an offering, becauſe it it a memoriall, and repreſentation of the true ſacrifice, and holy immolation, that was made in the Altar of the Croſſe. And Chriſt died once on the croſſe, and was there ſacrificed in himſelfe; but he is daily ſacrificed in the Sacrament, becauſe in the Sacrament there is a remembrance of that which was done once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we plainly ſee that he determines, that Chriſt is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſacrificed in the Sacrament, but improperly, in that his ſacrificing of himſelfe upon the croſſe is remembred and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Sacrament, which is no more then the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſts death is ſhewed forth in the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.

Wee know and believe that Chriſts Body was given, and his Blood ſhed for us on the croſſe, in remembrance whereof according to Chriſts inſtitution wee receive the Sacrament: but doth it therefore follow, that Chriſt is properly offered and ſacrificed in the Sacrament? The ground <note place="margin">Illa verba tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris praeſentis, &amp;c. <hi>Bell. Ibid.</hi>

For that the cauſes, which moved them in former times to make that conſtitution, are not onely now ceaſed, but even turned quite contrary. That by this decree chaſtity and continency is ſo far from being confirmed, that thereby a window may ſeeme to be ſet open unto all kinde of luſt and lewdneſſe. And that it fares ſo now with ſome Prieſts, that the ſociety of their godly wives is not onely no hinderance, but it is a helpe and furtherance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in reſpect of their Eccleſiaſticall functions and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> teſtifies of his parents.</p>

But ſurely both Scripture and reaſon ſhewes this as lawfull as the other. And to returne to <hi>Caſſander,</hi> hee teſtifies that marrying after Ordination is onely forbidden by humane ſtatute; and that ancient examples doe ſhew that ſuch Statutes are not preciſely obſerved, but that when the neceſſity of the Church doth require it, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with; and therefore ſo it ought to be now (hee ſaith) in this caſe, there being ſo great neede of it. And hee gives this reaſon why they that are ordained ſhould be permitted to marry, becauſe not onely no offence, but much benefit is to be expected by it. For that ſcarce one of a hundred is to be found, who doth wholly abſtaine from women, and the people are ſo affected, that if a Prieſt be a fornicatour, or keepe a concubine,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40220:159"/>
they will either altogether condemne his Miniſtery, or make leſſe account of it, and will rather ſuffer a Prieſt that is married, it being now known even to the people, that <hi>Marriage is honorable in all, and that Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Wherefore (he ſaith) if ever it were time to change an ancient <note place="margin">Quarè ſi un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam tempus fuit antiquae alicujus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudinis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutandae, certè haec tempora hujus quamvis priſci moris immutationem aliquam effla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, cum optimi quique, &amp; religioſiſſimi ſacerdotes, infirmitatem ſuam agnoſcentes, &amp; perpetuae ſcortationis faeditatem exhorreſcentes, ſi publice non audent, certè privatim conjugium ineunt, &amp;c.

               </note> cuſtome, then certainly theſe times call for a change of this cuſtome, though it be ancient, when as all moſt good and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Prieſts, acknowledging their weakeneſſe, and abhorring the filthineſſe of continuall Fornication, if they dare not doe it publikly, yet privately doe marry. Hee concludes, that the matter being brought almoſt to this, that a Prieſt muſt either be married, or have a concubine, every one muſt needs ſee, that though there be ſome inconvenience in this Marriage, yet it is to be choſen as a leſſe evill then the other.</p>
            <p>This was the judgement of <hi>Caſſander,</hi> a man of ſuch <hi>note</hi> and eminency in his time, that two Emperours, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>Now whereas the Marqueſſe ſaith, that Proteſtants hold it unlawfull to make vowes of chaſtity; it is true, ſuch vowes of chaſtity as are made &amp; maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which (as hath beene ſhewed by the teſtimony of <hi>Caſſander)</hi> prove ſnares, and occaſions of much unchaſtity, ſuch vowes (I ſay) Proteſtants doe indeed, and that moſt juſtly, hold unlawfull.

What neede was there for ſuch Widdowes to vow continency, when as none of them were to be under 60. years old? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, that the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>Let not a Widdow be choſen under threeſcore</hi>

But there is ſcarce any thing ſound in all this, ſave that it is true indeed, the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the vow of continency, there being no ſuch vowing in thoſe times: but it is evident, that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a kinde of profeſſion of continency. For therefore he bids refuſe the yonger Widdowes, becauſe of their inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; <hi>But the yonger Widdowes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>refuſe: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Chriſt, they will marry.</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 11.

the Apoſtle would have the younger Widdowes refuſed, and none admitted but ſuch as were threeſcore years old, or more.

               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, the Apoſtle reproves theſe of whom hee ſpeakes, for that they begin to wax wanton againſt Chriſt, and will marry, which argues, that they had vowed, or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed continency; for elſe why might they not marry? <hi>The wife is bound by the Law ſo long as her husband liveth: but if her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead, ſhe is at liberty to be married to whom ſhe will, only in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant, that thoſe Widdowes, though they did not vow, yet by the very courſe of life which they entred upon, did profeſſe continency, marriage and that courſe being inconſiſtent. And juſtly might they be reproved both for their raſhneſſe in taking upon them that profeſſion, and for their lightneſſe in falling off from it when there was no juſt cauſe for it. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not ſimply condemne them for having a minde to marry, but becauſe out of wantonneſſe they would needs marry. And it might be called wantonneſſe againſt Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had addicted themſelves to the ſervice of Chriſt in his Church and Members, which ſervice they did deſert by their wantonneſſe. And in this ſenſe, by <hi>their firſt faith</hi> may be meant the promiſe, either formall, or virtuall, which thoſe Widdowes did make unto the church, that they would remaine Widdowes, and not marry; which promiſe they breaking meerely out of wantonneſſe, well might the Apoſtle ſay that they had damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. But all this proves not that it is ſinfull and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any that have vowed continency, afterwards to marry. Though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will by no meanes endure that thoſe words <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Mon lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.</note> of the Apoſtle, <hi>I will therefore that the younger Widdowes marry, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 14. be underſtood of ſuch as had profeſſed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, as if the Apoſtle would have ſuch to marry, if they could not containe. So alſo <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place, who ſaith, that otherwiſe the Apoſtle ſhould <note place="margin">Non hoc dicit Apoſt. de junioribus illis viduis, quae jam voverant ſe non amplius nupturas.

hee would have none admitted under 60. years old; yet <hi>Estius</hi> his reaſon is not valid.

Therefore they were ſaved by Chriſt, as well as we now are ſaved by him: and conſequently the faithfull then through <hi>Christ</hi> did goe to Heaven, as well as now they doe. 2. It is ſaid of the faithfull of the old Teſtament, that <hi>they confeſſed that they</hi>

The ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Angels; and therefore it ſhould rather be Heaven then Hell. 2. It was a place of comfort, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25.

               <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth not reject it. And (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> alſo obſerves) the argument which the Apoſtle uſeth in thoſe words, <hi>This that hee aſcended, what is it, but that he deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the Earth,</hi> this argument, I ſay, doth much favour that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. <hi>This conſequence is more eaſie</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſtius) if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Earth abſolutely, then if any thing elſe: becauſe Chriſts aſcenſion from Earth to Heaven is here underſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (ſay I) before Chriſt could aſcend from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as hee did, it was neceſſary that hee ſhould deſcend from Heaven to Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Incarnation: but there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his deſcending to <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> before his aſcending into Heaven; for hee might well enough aſcend thither, though he did never deſcend into the other place, ſuppoſe ſuch a place to have beene. <hi>Eſtius</hi> alſo notes that ſome expound there <hi>the lower parts of the Earth</hi> to <note place="margin">Alii de ſepuſchro exponunt, juxta illud quod Dominus de ſe dicit Mat. 12.

               </note> certaine, that there by <hi>the lower parts of the Earth,</hi> is meant a certaine Region of Hell, although hee thinke that Expoſition more probable then the other. But that it hath any ſuch probability in it, his reaſons doe not evince. For 1. It is not ſo, as he ſaith, that the lower parts of the Earth doe moſt fitly ſignifie Hell, either as they take it here for <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or as uſually it is taken for the place of torment. I have ſhewed out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 32. 18. how the phraſe is otherwiſe uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Grave.

Neither (which hee urgeth alſo) doe thoſe words, prove it, <hi>that hee might fill</hi> (or <hi>fulfill) all things.</hi> For thoſe words (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> himſelfe doth ſhew) are diverſely expounded. Some underſtand it of <hi>Chriſts</hi> fulfilling all things, that were written of him. Others expound it thus, that hee might fill all kinds of men <note place="margin">Ut impleret omnia, de ſe ſcripta, ut quidam exponunt.

            <p>The other place which is next cited, <hi>viz.

Some by <hi>Hell</hi> there underſtand the Hell of the damned. Thus <note place="margin">Aug.

And therefore contrary to the opinion <note place="margin">Aquinas 3. p. q. 52. art. 2. docet Chriſtum per realem preſentiam ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùm deſcendiſſe ad Limbum Patrum, &amp;c.

               </note> of other Romaniſts, hee thinkes it probable, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soule did deſcend to all the parts of Hell.

If therefore hee deſcended into the Hell of the damned (which yet I doe not ſay, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he did) then not into that Hell, which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> 2. Thoſe words <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell,</hi> as ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 16. and commented upon by <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 2. thoſe words, I ſay, doe ſhew that <hi>Hell</hi> there mentioned could neither be the Hell of the damned, nor <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or at leaſt that there is no neceſſity to expound it of either. For 1. It is ſpoken of as a great benefit, a matter of joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soule was not left in Hell. <hi>Therefore my Heart is glad, and my glory</hi> (or <hi>Tongue) rejoyced, &amp;c.

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that it was a benefit to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soule, that it was quickly joyned againe unto the Body, even as it was evill to the Soule to be ſeparated from the Body. <hi>And thus</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>it was a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit unto him to be delivered from Hell, not in reſpect of the place, but in reſpect of ſeparation from the body.</hi> But who ſeeth not, that by this reaſon <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soule might as well be in Heaven, as either in <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or the Hell of the damned? For though <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſoule were in heaven, yet it was a benefit unto it to be delivered out of that eſtate of ſeparation, which it was in. 2. Thoſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell,</hi> were meant of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Reſurrection, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40220:169"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 31. But <hi>Chriſts</hi> Reſurrection, though it did preſuppoſe his being in Hell, either as Hell is taken for the grave, or for the ſtate of death, yet not as it is taken either for <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or for the place of torment: Chriſt might well enough riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and yet never be in any ſuch Hell as one of theſe is, and the other is ſuppoſed to have beene. 3. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewes, that <hi>David</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell,</hi> ſpake not of himſelfe, but of Chriſt; for that the words being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>David,</hi> were not true, but moſt true, as underſtood of <hi>Chriſt. Men and Brethren, let mee freely ſpeake unto you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Patriarch David, that hee is both dead and buried, and his Sepulcher remaineth with us to this day. Therefore being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 2. 29, 30, 31. Here by <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulcher remaning with them unto that day, hee meanes, that <hi>David</hi> was left in that Hell of which he ſpeakes, and ſo did not ſpeake of himſelf, but of ſome other, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was not left in it. Thus alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> having cited the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> hee alſo to prove that this was meant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not of <hi>David,</hi> addes, <hi>For David after he had ſerved his own Generation by the Will of God, fell aſleepe and was laid with his Fathers, and ſaw corruption: But he, whom God raiſed up, ſaw no corruption.</hi> Acts 13. 35, 36, 37. <hi>David</hi> ſpake not of himſelfe, but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption;</hi> becauſe <hi>David</hi> did ſee corruption, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſee. So <hi>David</hi> ſpake not of himſelfe, but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell;</hi> becauſe <hi>Davids</hi> Soule was left in Hell, where <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soule was not left. This is the Apoſtles argument; and herce it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followes, that by Hell cannot be meant either the place of torment, or yet <hi>Limbus Patrum:</hi> Not the place of torment; for <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule was not left in that Hell, it never came in it. Nor yet can that <hi>Limbus</hi> be meant; for even the Romaniſts themſelves doe hold that it was quite emptied before that time that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake; and therefore <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule was not in it then, whereas yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifies, that then it was in that Hell, of which hee ſpake.

               </note> it cannot be ſaid but improperly that hee went.

               </note> purpoſe ſpeake improperly and obſcurely. I anſwer, according to <hi>Bezaes</hi> Expoſition, (which in his particular doth differ from <hi>Auſtines,</hi> and is the more probable) not living men, but the ſoules of men ſeparated from their bodies, are termed <hi>ſpirits in priſon,</hi> as being in the priſon of Hell when <hi>Peter</hi> wrote of them; though they were not ſo, but were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their bodies, and ſo both ſoules and bodies joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were living men, when Chriſt preached unto them. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> further objects that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 6. where it is ſaid, that <note place="margin">Bell. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>the Goſpell was preached to the dead,</hi> which hee will have ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as that men being dead, and departed out of this life, the Goſpell was Preached unto them. But the true and genuine meaning of the words rather is this, that the Goſpell was Preached to them, that are now dead; though they were not dead, but alive when the Goſpell was preached unto them. Even as in the verſe immediately going before it is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>will judge both the quick and the dead,</hi> that is, thoſe that are now alive, or ſhall be alive at Chriſts comming; and thoſe that are now dead, or ſhall be dead at Chriſts comming; who
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40220:175"/>
yet ſhall not be judged whiles they are dead, but they ſhall be raiſed up, and made alive, and ſo be judged. As therefore <hi>Peter</hi> calles them dead, becauſe ſo they are now, and were, when hee wrote of them, though they ſhall not be dead, but alive, when they ſhall be judged. So for the ſame reaſon hee calles them dead, to whom the Goſpell was preached, though when the Goſpell was preached unto them they were alive, and not dead. And in like manner hee calles them <hi>ſpirits in priſon,</hi> to whom Chriſt went and Preached, becauſe ſo they were when hee wrote, though they were not ſo when Chriſt went and preached unto them.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40220:176"/>
a little after, that the rich man ſpoken of <hi>Luke</hi> 16. was in that pit, which was ſo void of all water of comfort, that hee deſired <hi>Lazarus</hi> might but dip the tip of his finger in water to coole his Tongue. Here it is evident, that <hi>Hierome</hi> by <hi>the pit without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> underſtands the Hell of the damned, which is without all comfort, though the Marqueſſe ſay that place cannot here be meant. Now whereas <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Paſſion did deliver thoſe that were bound in that priſon, I ſuppoſe hee did not meane, that any being once in Hell, as that rich man that he mentioneth, were afterwards delivered out of it; himſelf ſeemes to exclude that ſence, when hee ſaith, that <hi>in that priſon there is no mercy, viz.</hi> to be obtained: but his meaning was, that ſuch, as by reaſon of ſinne were in the ſtate of damnation, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did deliver by his Paſſion. But thus neither this place of <hi>Zachary,</hi> nor any other place of Scripture doth prove a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or that <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended into Hell in that ſenſe as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaine.

from Hell, which otherwiſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſinne was the place that did belong unto them. Thus a little before upon thoſe words, <hi>when hee aſcended up on high, hee led captivity captive, Hierome</hi> doth expreſſe himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Wee, who now believe in Christ, were taken captive by the Devill, and were delivered over to his officers. Therefore our Lord Ieſus Chriſt came, bringing with him the veſſels of captivity, and preached remiſſion to thoſe that were taken, and deliverance to thoſe that were bound; and delivered us from the Chaines, and Fetters of our enemies. And having deliver'd us, and by a new captivity brought us out of our old captivity, he carried us with him into Heaven.</hi> Hee cannot here meane, that we were actually in Hell, and then from thence, delivered, and carried up with Chriſt into Heaven. But his meaning muſt needs be this, that whereas ſinne had brought us under condemnation, ſo that nothing but Hell did remaine for us, Chriſt by his death delivered us, and made a way for us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, into which otherwiſe wee could finde no entrance. After the ſame manner very well may the other words be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſo as to import no ſuch place as they call <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</hi> However hee meant, yet it appeares ſufficiently by the words of <hi>Auſtine</hi> before cited, that the opinion of <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> was not generally received in that time wherein <hi>Hierome</hi> lived, <hi>Auſtine</hi> and hee being contemporaries.

Yea, he cites <hi>Bede,</hi> who lived about 900 years agoe, telling of one, to whom was ſhewed the paines of Purgatory, and it was told him, that all the Soules in Purgatory ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and ſaved in the day of judgement, &amp;c. whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that according to <hi>Bede</hi> ſome now dead (yea that were dead many hundred years agoe) muſt abide in Purgatory untill the day of judgement. And will any call ſuch bleſſed? will any ſay that ſuch reſt from their labours? In a word, the Scripture tels us but of two places appointed for ſuch as depart out of this life, the one a place of comfort, and the other a place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and withall it tells us, that betwixt theſe two places there is ſuch a great gulfe fixed, that they that are in the one, cannot paſſe unto the other. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25, 26.</p>

               </note> that the fire there mentioned, is the fire of Gods ſevere and juſt judgement, which is not a purging and afflicting, but a proving and examining fire.

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates, and confutes, as juſtly he may, that being indeed the true Expoſition, which hee embraceth, but doth not extend farre enough, <hi>viz.</hi> that by fire is meant Gods Severe and juſt judgement, whereby the workes of all muſt be tried, as it were by fire; though the Apoſtle there ſpeake peculiarly of Miniſters, and of their Doctrine: and ſo as it were by fire ſhall they be ſaved, that adhere to the foundation Chriſt, though their workes be found like wood, hay and ſtubble, vaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, ſo that they ſuffer loſſe in that reſpect, as having no reward nor benefit of thoſe workes.

Here hee makes it a queſtion whether it be ſo, or no, and the moſt that hee ſaith is, That it is not incredible, which is farre <note place="margin">Bell. ubi ſupra.</note> from aſſerting it as a thing that ought to be believed. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith that <hi>Auſtine</hi> here only doubts, whether after this life ſoules be burnt with the fire of griefe for the loſſe of temporall things, as here they uſe to be when they are forced to want things, which they moſt deſire. But beſides that the words of <hi>Auſtine</hi> (which here alſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did prudently omit) doe plainly refuſe this gloſſe, there is no ſenſe at all (that I can ſee) in it. For how ſhould ſoules after this life grieve for the loſſe of temporall things? Is there any uſe of temporall things after this life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?

For thou ſayeſt, that it is written in Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Let the ſinners faile from the Earth, and the unjuſt, that they be no more.—He doth not ſay, that they ſhall be burnt with everlaſting fire, but that they faile from the Earth, and oeaſe to be unjuſt. For it is one thing for them to ceaſe from ſin, and from iniquity; and another thing for them to periſh for ever, and to be burnt with everlaſting fire. Hierome</hi> ſeemes not to be ſo cleare in the other words for this, that ſome are puniſhed after this life, and yet ſaved; as hee is in theſe words for this, that ſome ſhall be puniſhed after the day of judgement, ſo as thereby to ceaſe from ſinne and iniquity (to be purged from it) but not ſo as to periſh for ever and to be burnt with everlaſting fire. Our adverſaries therefore (ſo farre as I can ſee) muſt relinquiſh <hi>Hieromes</hi> teſtimony, who either ſaith nothing at all for them, or more then they would have.

What doe our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries now gaine by <hi>Gregory?</hi> Hee takes away one principall place, that they build upon for Purgatory: he alledgeth many places, from which by his own confeſſion ſo much is evinced as indeed cannot conſiſt with Purgatory: hee builds upon a place, which both in the judgement of other Fathers profeſſedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon it, and alſo by diverſe reaſons appeares to make nothing for Purgatory: and concerning that Purgatory, which he doth hold, he comes ſhort of the opinion of our adverſaries; all which things conſidered, they can get little by his teſtimony. The next and laſt Father objected againſt us is <hi>Origen,</hi> whoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, if it were moſt cleare for a Purgatory after this life, yet it were of ſmall force, he being cenſured (as I have ſhewed before) by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as erroneous in this point, holding that there ſhall be a Purgatory even after the day of judgement.

               <hi>Origen,</hi> that neither in theſe words, nor in the other before cited, Purgatory is meant by that fire and fornace whith he ſpeakes of, but affliction. <hi>As the fornace</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doth try Gold, ſo doth affliction the righteous.</hi> And ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He was not ſo great, nor ſuch an one as that he had no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of lead in him.

I am confident, they will not ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> had neede of this Purgatory, yet hee had of that which <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeakes of, and ſo all whoſoever they be, it being afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which here in this life even the beſt are tried and alſo purified.

            </p>
            <p>As for extreme Unction, as they call it, that is, the anointing <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of the ſick with oyl, as the manner is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do not acknowledge it to be either a Sacrament, or a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe they ſee no ground in Scripture either for the one, or for the other. The Scripture indeed in two places, <hi>viz.</hi> that which the Marqueſſe citeth, and <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 13. doth ſpeak of anointing the ſick with oyle: But that anointing was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, peculiar to thoſe times, when there was, as other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts beſtowed upon men, ſo, the gift of healing, which is mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1, 8. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 30. in which places of Scripture this gift is ranked with caſting out devills, ſpeaking with ſtrange tongues, and working of miracles. And ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 13. It is ſaid of the Apoſtles, <hi>They caſt out many devils, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyle many that were ſick, and healed them.</hi> It is plain, that this anointing with oyle was of like nature with caſting out of devils, that is, that it was a miraculous cure wrought by the Apoſtles. And that in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was of the ſame kinde with this in Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew anon. But now the gift of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that manner being ceaſed, we ſay that the ceremony is to ceaſe alſo, and not to be uſed. The Marqueſſe inſiſteth much upon the words of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> as being very clear and full to prove both that this anointing is a duty, and alſo that it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And ſo the Romaniſts muſt hold, becauſe the Councell of Trent hath determined, that <hi>the holy anointing of the ſick was inſtituted by Chriſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Inſtituta eſt ſacra haec unctio infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum, tanquam verè, &amp; propriè Sacramentum <hi>N. T.</hi> à Chriſto <hi>D.

               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:40220:186"/>
pronounce them accurſed. But there being two places of Scripture, which mention this anointing with oyle, it may ſeem ſtrange that the Marqueſſe ſhould alledge only the one, and wholly wave the other: wee ſhall ſee (I hope) by and by that this is as much as to quit both places, they being both to one and the ſame purpoſe. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (we ſee) thought good to make uſe of both, yet ſo as to lay the more weight upon that in <hi>Iames,</hi> ſaying only that the Sacrament of anointing is inſinuated in the other. And ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de extr. Unct lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> mainly build upon the words of <hi>Iames,</hi> yet ſo as that he will have the words of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> to contain in them a figure and adumbration of this Sacrament, which they call <hi>extreme Unction.</hi> Let us take what they grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that the anointing mentioned <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. was not properly ſacramentall. So much the Marqueſſe tacitely doth acknowledge, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expreſly, citing for <note place="margin">Bell. Ibid.</note> this opinion <hi>Ruardus, Ianſenius, Dominicus à Soto,</hi> and others, yea confirming it by diverſe arguments. 1. Becauſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, which the Apoſtles uſed, was referred onely or chiefly to the cure of the body, as is manifeſt by the words of Saint <hi>Mark;</hi> but Sacraments directly concern the ſoul, and the body only by accident. 2. The Apoſtles as then were not Prieſts; and therefore could not adminiſter Sacraments. Though they did baptize, yet (he ſaith) that is nothing, becauſe it is not ſo of the eſſence of Baptiſme, as it is of extreme Unction, that he ſhould be a Prieſt that doth adminiſter it. 3. The Apoſtles did promiſcuouſly anoint all that were diſeaſed, the blinde, and the lame, &amp;c. but the Sacrament of Unction (they hold) is only for thoſe that lie ſick, and are like to die. 4. The Apoſtles did not enquire whether they whom they did anoint were baptized, or no, and it is altogether probable, that many were anointed by them, that were meer infidels. But neither extreme unction, nor any other Sacrament, (they ſay) belongs unto thoſe that are not baptized. By theſe reaſons <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth that the anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we read of <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. was not the Sacrament of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction. Now if this Sacrament be not meant in <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. neither is it in <hi>Iam</hi> 5. For by the teſtimony both of antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and alſo of modern Romaniſts, the anointing which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of, is the ſame with that which Saint <hi>Mark</hi>

               </note> was uſed for the healing of all diſeaſes; and becauſe the Apoſtles were not to uſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſeeing it was not Phyſick, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which they profeſſed. But this is of no force; for they whom <hi>Maldonate</hi> oppoſeth, acknowledge that the oile, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles anointed with, did not naturally cure the diſeaſed, nor was uſed as a naturall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and they prove it by <hi>Maldonates</hi> own argument, becauſe naturally one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine cannot cure all diſeaſes. But they ſay, that by Chriſts inſtitution upon this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with oile, the ſick were healed. <hi>Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> would take away this anſwer, ſaying, <note place="margin">Quid ejuſmodi opus erat ſigno, quum ſecura ſtatim ſanitas fidem faceret? quam poterat quidem oleum non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, ſed abrogare, &amp;c. <hi>Maldon. loc. cit.</hi>
               </note> that there was no need of any ſign, ſeeing that the cure which was wrought would work beliefe; and that the uſing of oil, would rather hinder faith; for that thereby people might think that the cure was wrought by the naturall vertue of the oile, and not by divine power. But the reaſon, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alledgeth, would hold off people from any ſuch conceit, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they might ſee that all manner of diſeaſes were healed with one and the ſame oile, and that therefore it could not be by the naturall vertue of it. Beſides, that immediately upon the anointing with oile, the ſick were healed, whereas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſome time would have been ſpent before the cure was wrought; Yet was not the anointing with oile ſuperfluous, no more then the laying on of hands, which was uſed both for the healing of the ſick, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 18. and alſo for the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. though naturally that ceremony had as little vertue in that kinde as the other. Thus then whiles ſome of our adverſaries ſay, that extreme Unction is not that which Saint <hi>Mark</hi> treateth of; and others of them ſay, that Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doe both ſpeake of one and the ſame Unction, and that if extreme Unction be not ſpoken of <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. we know not where to finde it in the Scripture; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both wee may ſafely conclude, that this Sacrament
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40220:188"/>
of theirs hath no firme foundation. But becauſe the Marqueſſe onely, and others mainly build upon the words of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> this is to be added, that Cardinall <hi>Cajetane</hi> in his Commentary upon <hi>Iames</hi> doth not only <note place="margin">Nec ex verbis, nec ex effectu verba haec loquuntur de Sacramentali Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one extremae Unctionis; ſed magis de unctione, quam Dominus Jeſus inſtituit in Evangelio, à diſcipulis exercendam in aegrotis. Textus enim non dicit, infirmatur quis ad mortem, ſed abſolute, infirmatur quis? Et effectum dicit infirmi alleviationem: &amp; de remiſſione peccatorum non niſi conditionaliter loquitur: quum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema unctio non niſi prope articulum mortis detur, &amp; directè (ut ejus forma ſonat) tendit ad remiſſionem peccatorum.

Becauſe 1. The Text doth not ſay, <hi>Is any ſick unto death?</hi> but abſolutely, <hi>Is any ſick?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as extreme unction, as they uſe it in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is onely for thoſe of whoſe life there is no hope. 2. The effect of S. <hi>Iames</hi> his anointing is the raiſing up (the bodily amendment) of the ſick; neither is any thing ſpoken but conditionally of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. Whereas extreme unction (as the forme of it doth ſhew) tends directly to the remiſſion of ſinnes. 3. <hi>Iames</hi> bids ſend for many Elders to one ſick perſon, both to pray for him, and to anoint him, which is different from the manner of extreme unction. Thus wee ſee how many of our adverſaries by conſequence, and ſome of them directly grant, that there is nothing in the Scripture for that extreme Unction, which they uſe, and maintaine to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>Now for the humane teſtimonies, which the Marqueſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, the firſt is <hi>Origens,</hi> who in the place mentioned hath nothing to the purpoſe. He <note place="margin">Cum non erubeſcit ſacerdoti Domini indicare peccatum ſuum, &amp; quaerere medicinam, &amp;c. In quo impletur &amp; illud, quod Apoſt. dicit, Si quis autem infirmatur, <hi>Orig. Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>in Levit.</hi>
               </note> cites indeed the words of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which ſpeake of anointing with Oile, but it is not in reſpect of Unction, but in reſpect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſinne that hee doth cite-them. After him is cited <hi>Auſtine in Speculo;</hi> but there being 33. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Booke, which of them is meant, wee cannot tell.

be the Authour of the Booke, takes no notice of the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt it, though hee confeſſe that ſome doe doubt of it. In the other place of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> which is pointed at, I finde indeed, that hee doth <note place="margin">Infirmatur aliquis, inducat presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros, &amp;c.

               </note> cite the words of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> but yet ſo as that our adverſaries gaine litle by it. For hee referreth thoſe words of anointing with Oile, &amp;c. unto bodily health; and ſo inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt thoſe that by Charmes, and Spels, and the like ſuperſtitious and ungodly practices bring upon themſelves manifold miſeries. Now bodily health is a thing, which the Romaniſts have no reſpect unto in their Unction, but uſe it directly for the good of the Soule, even as they doe Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. And this alſo takes off the teſtimony of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who ſhewing what benefit people have by Miniſters, or (as hee calles them) Prieſts, <note place="margin">Parentes ne corporalem quidem inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum à liberis amoliri poſſunt, neque ingruentem morbum propulſare; cum hi <hi>(ſacerdotes)</hi> laborantem, ac morti jam jam propinquam animam iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem ſervarint, aliis remiſſiorem paenam infligentes, alios prorſus labi non permittentes, non Doctrinae ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùm, atque commonitionis, ſed etiam precum ſubſidio. <hi>Chryſ. l.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſacerd.</hi>

And then hee cites that <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. <hi>Is any ſick among you? Let him ſend for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.</hi> All this is nothing to the Romiſh Unction; for beſides that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth not at all ſpeake of Prieſts anointing, but of their teaching, admoniſhing, and praying, and in this reſpect doth bring in the words of S. <hi>Iames;</hi> beſides this, I ſay, it is directly a corporall benefit, which hee inſiſteth on, as freedome from ſickneſſe, mitigation of paine, deliverance from Death; and therefore that which hee ſaith, makes nothing for extreme Unction, which they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay, was inſtituted of God to this end, that wee departing out of this mortall

               </note> And therefore they call it <hi>the Sacrament of ſuch as goe out of this World.</hi> What is this Sacrament then concerned in the words of <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> who ſpeakes onely of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving life and health here in this World?

And thus alſo it appeares, that he doth not ſpeake of the Sacrament of extreme Vnction. <note n="*" place="margin">Olim haec unctio non, ut hodiè ferè fit, ad extremum uſque vitae pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudinem jam deploratam dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferebatur, ſed graviore aliquo morbo inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentehujuſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di orationes, &amp; unctiones per ſeptem aliqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Caſſander</hi> alſo confeſſeth, that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they have now departed from antiquity. 1. In this, that in more antient times they did not uſe (as now they do) to defer this anointing, untill life were even in extreme danger, and there was no hope of recovery. 2. In this, that antiently they uſed after this anointing, if there were danger, to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts Body and Blood; whereas now they have no ſuch cuſtome. Yea, the Carechiſme of the Councell of Trent ſaith, that before extreme Vnction, the Sacrament of Penance and of the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred; and that this is the perpetuall cuſtome of the Catholike Church; which is directly contrary to that which <hi>Caſſander</hi> affirmeth. But this (I hope) may be enough to ſhew that the Romiſh Sacrament of extreme Vnction hath no ſupport either from the Scriptures, or from the antient Fathers.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe having waded thorough all the forementioned parts of controverſie, and (as he ſuppoſeth) proved the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be on their ſide, now ſings as it were an <hi>Epinicion,</hi> or a ſong of victory, ſaying, <hi>Thus, moſt ſacred Sir, we have no reaſon to</hi>

            <p>But how litle the Scriptures Umpirage doth favour them <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> let the Reader judge by what hath
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40220:190"/>
been ſaid on both ſides, the Scripture being underſtood in that ſenſe, which it ſelfe doth make out, and to which alſo the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers and Doctors have ſubſcribed, which (I ſuppoſe) the Marqueſſe doth mean by the Scriptures Mother-language. As for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it hath long ſhewed it ſelfe the Scriptures ſtep-mother, keeping it ſhut up in an unknown tongue, or not permitting Chriſtians the liberty to make uſe of it, excepting ſuch as can obtain a ſpeciall diſpenſation for it; yea in many things going directly contrary to the Scripture, and even in a manner caſting off the authority of it. Here preſently after the Marqueſſe brings in the ſaying of <hi>Auſtine, Evangelio non crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, niſi me Eccleſiae authoritas commoveret,</hi> I ſhould not beleeve the Goſpel it ſelfe, unleſſe I were moved by the authority of the Church; as if, were it not for the authority of the Church, the Scripture were of no force, neither could deſerve any credit. So the Romaniſts do frequently pervert thoſe words of <hi>Austine;</hi> but <hi>Auſtines</hi> meaning was only this, that the Churches authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by way of introduction was a means to bring him to beleeve the Goſpel, by propounding and commending the Goſpel unto him, as a thing to be beleeved, whereas otherwiſe he ſhould not have given heed to it, nor taken notice of it; not as if he did final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt in the authority of the Church, and reſolve his faith into it. No; for (as I have ſhewed before) he would have the Church it ſelfe ſought in the Scripture, and proved by it. Had not the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> told thoſe, among whom ſhe lived, of Chriſt, they had not come to the knowledge of him, much leſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him; yet having heard Chriſt himſelfe, they did not reſt in the teſtimony of the woman, but ſaid unto her, <hi>Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not becauſe of thy ſaying; for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, and the Saviour of the world.</hi> Joh. 4. 42. So ſhould not the Church hold out unto us the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we ſhould not know, much leſſe beleeve them; but at length (God by his Spirit opening our underſtandings that we may underſtand the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45.) we come to be convinced by the Scriptures themſelves, that they are the Oracles of God, and of divine authority. <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> a learned Writer of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> holds that the formall reaſon of our faith is not the authority of <note place="margin">Cui &amp; tertium ſubjiciendum eſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem formalem noſtrae fidei non eſſe Eccleſiae auctoritatem, h. e. fidei ultiman reſolutionem non fieri in Eccleſiae teſtimonium.—Eorum hîc errorem diſſimulare non poſſum, qui aſſerunt, fidem noſtram eo, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in ultimam credendi cauſam, reducendam eſſe.—Huc enim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet illud <hi>Ioannis</hi> 4.

And he ſaith, that he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their errour, who hold that our faith is to be reduced thither, as to the utmoſt cauſe of beleeving. For the confuting of this errour, he ſaith belongs that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. <hi>Now we beleeve not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we our ſelves have heard him, and know,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame authour averres, that <hi>the authority of the Church is not a reaſon by it ſelfe moving to beleeve, but only a cauſe</hi> (or meanes) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we ſhould not beleeve,</hi> viz. Becauſe (as he addes) the Church doth propound unto us that the Scripture is the word of God, and except the Church did ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, we ſhould never (ordinarily) come to beleeve it; yet we doe not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Scripture to be Gods word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church doth ſay it, but becauſe God doth reveal it. <hi>If the Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth make way for us to know ſuch ſacred books, we muſt not therefore reſt there, but we muſt goe further, and muſt relye on Gods ſolid truth.</hi> And then he brings in that very ſpeech of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and ſhewes what he meant by it. <hi>Hereby is underſtood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what</hi> Auſtine <hi>meant, when he ſaid, I ſhould not beleeve the Goſpell, except the authority of the Church did move me. And again, By the Catholikes I had beleeved the Goſpell. For</hi> Auſtine <hi>had to doe with the</hi> Manichees, <hi>who without diſpute would have a certain Goſpell of theirs beleeved, and ſo would eſtabliſh the faith of the</hi> Manichees. Auſtine <hi>therefore askes them what they would doe, if they did light upon a man, who did not beleeve ſo much as the Goſpell; what kind of</hi>

               <hi>perſwaſion they would uſe to bring him to their opinion. He affirmes, that himſelfe could not be otherwiſe brought to embrace the Goſpell, but that the authority of the Church did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. He doth not therefore teach, that the faith of the Goſpell is grounded upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches authority, but only that there is no certain way, whereby either infidels, or novices in the faith, may have entrance to the holy books, but one and the ſame conſent of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. This he himſelfe hath ſufficiently explicated in the fourth Chapter of that Epiſtle, and in his book to</hi> Honoratus <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the benefit of beleeving.</hi> I have thus largely cited the words of this learned Romaniſt, becauſe no Proteſtant can ſpeak more clearly, and more fully to the purpoſe. That which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe after addeth, is nothing againſt us, <hi>viz. That there was a Church, before there was any Scripture; that though the Scripture be a light, yet we have need of ſome to guide us; though it be the food of our ſoules, yet there muſt be ſome to adminiſter it unto us; though it be an antidote againſt the infection of the devill, yet it is not for every one to be a compounder of the ingredients; that though it be the onely ſword and buckler to defend the Church from her Ghoſtly enemies, yet this doth not exclude the noble army of Martyrs, and the holy Church, which through all the world doth acknowledg Chriſt.</hi> All this, I ſay, is nothing at all againſt us, who do ſo aſſert the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture, as that we doe not evacuate the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches miniſtery. <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt preach; but it is the word <hi>(viz.</hi> of God contained in the Scriptures) which he muſt preach. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>If any man ſpeak</hi> (for the inſtructing of others) <hi>he muſt ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 11. He muſt confirm that, which he doth ſpeak, by the Scriptures. And ſo on the other ſide they that hear, <hi>must take heed how, and what they hear.</hi> Luke 8. 18. Mark 4. 24. They muſt <hi>not beleeve every Spirit, but muſt try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</hi> 1 John 4. 1. <hi>They muſt to the Law, and to the Teſtimony; for that if any ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe they have no light in them.</hi> Iſai 8. 20.

the Goſpels written by the other three Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> are not as true as that written by <hi>John.</hi> But I finde that which doth ſufficiently evince the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> in the fifth volume of his Works, hath An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon the firſt ſeventeen Chapters of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel; and that in his Notes upon the firſt Chapter, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times calls both <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> Evangeliſts, or publiſhers of the Goſpel.</p>

But he ſpeaks of <hi>Moſes</hi> onely as contradiſtinct to Chriſt, as a <note place="margin">Breerl. ubi ſup.</note> meer Law-giver. <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. So <hi>Moſes</hi> his miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7. and <hi>the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of condemnation,</hi> v. 9. The Law ſimply conſidered, doth convince of ſinne, and condemn for ſinne. <hi>For by the Law is the knowledge of ſinne,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. And it ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Now no man doth, or can perform this, and therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe.</hi> And ſo <hi>the Law worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. This is not through any fault of the Law, but by reaſon of ſinne, <hi>which is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. and ſo makes liable to the curſe and condemnation, which by the Law belongs to thoſe that tranſgreſſe. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe) is not wrath, but it worketh wrath,</hi>

               </note> is not to be objected againſt him: For that many, and thoſe moſt excellent men did not receive it, and that <hi>Hierome</hi> wiſhed it were aboliſhed.

I confeſſe that <hi>Luther</hi> in this ſeemeth to me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as men are apt to do in favour of that cauſe which they proſecute.

But, 1. This is not like the other: For here he ſaith, <hi>Luthers</hi> works were altered by his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but there he ſaith, they were altered by his adverſaries. 2. As I have ſhewed the other to be improbable, ſo alſo is this. For <hi>Luther</hi> died <hi>anno</hi> 1546. ſo that the Edition which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sleidan. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. lib.</hi> 16.</note> was <hi>anno</hi> 1551. was five years after <hi>Luthers</hi> death; and ſurely by that time <hi>Luthers</hi> Scholars had leiſure enough to make ſuch an alteration, as Mr. <hi>Breerly</hi> ſpeaks of, in <hi>Luthers</hi> works,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40220:195"/>
if they had been ſo minded. I cannot therefore but take this as a trick of Mr. <hi>Breerley's,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Campians</hi> quotation of <hi>Luther</hi> confuted by Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> to pretend ſome former Edition of <hi>Luthers</hi> Works, as having it ſo as <hi>Campian</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And this is the more apparent, in that <hi>Dureus</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly taking upon him the defence of <hi>Campian</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> never ſo much as takes notice of that which the Doctor ſaith againſt <hi>Campian</hi> for falſifying the words of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſo far was he from knowing of that pretended Edition <hi>anno</hi> 1551. which ſhould have it (forſooth) juſt ſo as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> quoted it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Luther</hi> (as the Marqueſſe telleth us) <hi>affirmed, that Chriſt was from all eternity, even according to his humane nature.</hi> For <note place="margin">Obj.</note> proof hereof onely <hi>Zuinglius</hi> is cited.</p>
            <p>But (as I noted before) <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his teſtimony is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to make good a charge againſt <hi>Luther.</hi> Let <hi>Luthers</hi> words be produced, and then it will appeare that he is juſtly charged.</p>

And truly thus it is indeed; for we muſt needs confeſſe, This Perſon (Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pointed at) doth ſuffer and dye. But this Perſon is true God, Therefore it is rightly ſaid, The Son of God doth ſuffer.

One of <hi>Luthers</hi> books, wherein he is ſaid to ſpeak thus, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I finde among his Works, <hi>(viz. de ſervo arbit.)</hi> But the Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being diverſe from this here mentioned, I cannot finde the words that are objected.

But though God be not the author of mens wicked works as they are wicked, yet is he the orderer and diſpoſer of them.

not have his doctrine to be judged either by Men or Angels; that is, he being aſſured of its truth, and agreeableneſſe to Gods word, he would not refer it to the cenſure either of Men or Angels, ſo as to ſubmit unto them if they ſhould condemn it.

               <hi>anſwer is eaſie,</hi> &amp;c.

This is a peece of the ſtrangeſt dealing that ever I met with. I do not finde that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe had theſe allegations from any, as many of the reſt (I ſee) he had: neither can I think him to have been of ſuch an ignoble diſpoſition, as wittingly and wilfully ſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a mans words and meaning. Therefore I ſuppoſe it was his immoderate deſire to finde any thing in <hi>Calvin,</hi> that might be liable to exception, which made him haſtily take hold of that which did occur, never conſidering the true ſenſe and meaning of it. But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Calvin</hi> (ſaith the Marqueſſe) <hi>ſaith, that Chriſt refuſed and denied, as much as lay in him, to perform the office of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It's true, <hi>Calvin</hi> hath theſe words, but they alſo are part of an objection. For the very next word is, <hi>Reſpondeo,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> So that I might have joyned this with thoſe other <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calv. ad Mat.</hi> 26. 39.</note> paſſages immediately before mentioned; though there ſeems indeed ſome more colour for this allegation then for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40220:204"/>
other, yet is there no juſt ground for this neither.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The next charge againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> is, that he ſaith, That <note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt manifeſted his own effeminateneſſe, by his ſhunning of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo is of like nature with the former. <hi>Calvin</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> upon thoſe words, Joh. 12. 27. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith, that <note place="margin">Videtur initio ſententia haec multum diſerepare à proximo ſermone.

For that there Chriſt ſhewed great courage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting his Diſciples not only to ſuffer death, but to ſuffer it willingly and defirouſly, if the caſe ſo require; but now by ſhunning death, he confeſſeth his weakneſſe (or ſoftneſſe) of ſpirit. Then he addes by way of anſwer, that yet here is nothing which doth not very well agree. That it was expedient and neceſſary for our ſalvation that the Son of God ſhould be ſo affected. And that hence we are to know, that Chriſts death was no ſport or play unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then the word <hi>mollities</hi> (which the Marqueſſe rendreth <hi>effeminateneſſe,</hi> and not unfitly, I confeſſe, for it properly ſignifieth <hi>ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and is uſed for <hi>ſoftneſſe of ſpirit)</hi> that word, I ſay, is here applied to Chriſt in a way of <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> objection, though <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> doth poſitively aver, that Chriſt was deeply affected with the horror of his approaching death; and that he was ſo indeed, is moſt evident both by this, and other places of the Evangelical hiſtory.</p>

I acknowledge that <hi>Calvin</hi> hath theſe words in the ſame <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> place, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39. neither do I much approve of them: yet, by what hath been ſaid already, it may appeare that <hi>Calvins</hi> meaning was good, only ſo to ſet forth the anxiety of Chriſts ſoul, as yet to exempt him from whatſoever is evil and ſinful. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, though he rake up, and rack <hi>Calvins</hi> ſayings, to <note place="margin">Dicit (Calvinus) Chriſti naturam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe perfectum, &amp; nullam in eo fuiſſe paſſionum inordinationem. <hi>Bellar. de Christ. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> make them odious, yet confeſſeth that he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſts nature was perfect, and that there was no inordinacie of affections in him.</hi> But I will make uſe of the words of learned Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> who hath anſwered theſe objections againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> long ago.</p>

            <p n="15">15.

            </p>
            <p>Surely all that have any ſpark of Chriſtianity in them, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> muſt needs aſſent to <hi>Calvin</hi> in this, that Chriſts paſſion, as the Evangeliſts relate it, was not fained nor acted upon a ſtage; though (it ſeems) <note place="margin">Nec verò fictc vel theatricè conqueritur ſe à Patre relictum. <hi>Calv. ad Mat.</hi> 27. 46.</note> they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on Good Friday (as they call it) uſe to make a kind of Stage-play of it.

But any that look into the place alleadged, may ſee that <hi>Calvin</hi> is far from this blaſphemy. That which he ſaith, is this, that the wicked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, by Satans inſtigation, deriding him when he cried, <hi>Eli, Eli,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40220:206"/>
did labour to overwhelm him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, and to make him ceaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, which had been as much as to renounce ſalvation.</p>
            <p>As before <hi>Calvin</hi> was made poſitively <note place="margin">Caeterum ſi hodiè tam conductitii An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſti rabulae, quàm domeſtiei etiam nebulones, quae à nobis rectè dicta ſunt, ſuis calumniis indignè depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ne miremur idem nobis quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capiti noſtrò accidere. <hi>Calvin. ibid.</hi>
               </note> to aver that, which hee brought in by way of objection; ſo here that is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as ſpoken by him, which he only ſpeaks of Chriſts enemies. But it is worthy to be obſerved, that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after thoſe words, which are ſo pitifully perverted, <hi>Calvin</hi> comforts himſelf and others with this conſideration, that if our words, which are right and good, be depraved and ſlandered, it is no marvel, ſeeing Chriſt himſelf was thus dealt with. But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Calvin</hi> (as is alleadged) ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt in his ſoul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
               <hi>ſuffered the terrible torments of a damned and forſaken man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This allegation is true, and ſo alſo is that, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in the next paſſage but two, and I note it here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of the ſame nature. <hi>It is no marvel, if it be ſaid that Chriſt went down into hell, ſince he ſuffered that death, wherewith God in wrath ſtriketh wicked doers. Calvin</hi> hath theſe ſayings in the place alleadged, <hi>viz.</hi> Inſtit. lib. 2. cap. 16. ſect. 10. I am not <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. on Pſal.</hi> 16. 10.</note> of <hi>Calvins</hi> mind for the meaning of the article about Chriſts deſcent into hell, as I have elſewhere ſhewed. And peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Calvin</hi> might go too far in exaggerating the ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul, as others in this may be too remiſſe. But when <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaketh of Chriſt ſuffering the torments of a damned man, he means ſuch torments as are without all mixture of ſin, for that he alwayes removes far from Chriſt, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>And that Chriſt did ſuffer the torments of a forſaken man, his own words upon the croſſe do ſhew, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Chriſt had ſpeciall cauſe (as <hi>Janſenius</hi> obſerves) to complaine, that he was forſaken of his God, in <note place="margin">Propriâ quâdam ratione Chriſtus ſe derelictum à Deo ſuo conqueri potuit, qui cum unitam ſibi haberet divinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ejus tamen conſolationem in carne non ſenſit diffuſam. <hi>Janſen. concord. cap.</hi> 143.</note> that he had the divine nature united to him, and his humane nature did not

feel any comfort of it. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it may be ſaid, that Chriſt ſuffered that death, wherewith God in wrath doth ſtrike wicked doers, though in other reſpects there was great difference.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Calvin</hi> is charged with this ſaying, <hi>In the death of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvins</hi> meaning will eaſily appear to any that look upon <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> his words as they are in the place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He ſpeaks of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nunc dum in Chriſti morte ſpectacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum deſperationis plenum occurrit, quod etiam viriles animos frangere poſſet, unde illi repertè tam generoſa animoſitas, ut inter ſummos tetrores nihil metuens, longiùs quàm rebus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis progredi nón dubitet? <hi>Calv. in Mat.</hi> 27. 57.</note> his courage in begging of <hi>Pilate</hi> Chriſts body to bury it, ſaying, <hi>Now when in Chriſts death occurs a ſpectacle full of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which might have been able to break a ſtout heart, whence hath he on the ſudden ſuch a generous ſpirit, that in the midſt of terrors fearing nothing, he ſhould not doubt to proceed further then when all was quiet?</hi> Any may here plainly ſee, that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks not of any deſperation that Chriſt in his death did fall into; but his meaning is, that a natural man, yea one that had but a ſmall meaſure of faith, could have apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing in Chriſts death but matter of deſperation. And ſurely this appears by the words of the two Diſciples (not to ſpeak of the deportment of the Apoſtles) <hi>We truſted that it had been he that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> Luke 24. 21.</p>
            <p>Another ſentence is here immediately after cited out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> viz. <hi>In this ſpectacle there was nothing but matter of extreme deſpair.</hi> The very words ſhew it to carry the ſame ſenſe with the former, though otherwiſe I can ſay nothing to it, the place from which it is taken being miſ-cited; for on <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6 <hi>Calvin</hi> hath no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Marqueſſe taxeth <hi>Calvin</hi> for ſaying, <hi>Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of his Father, holds but a ſecond degree with him in</hi>

And ſurely this is moſt true, it belonging unto Chriſt as man, to ſit at the right hand of God, (as the Councel of <hi>Trents</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ad explicandum Chriſti gloriam, quam ut homo prae caeteris omnibus adeptus eſt, eum in Patris dextrâ eſſe confite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. <hi>Catechiſ. Coucil. Trident.</hi>
               </note> Catechiſme doth teach) the honour and dignity which that ſitting imports, though otherwiſe it be moſt great, yet muſt needs be inferior to that, which belongs to the Father and ſo alſo to Chriſt, as he is one and the ſame God with the Father.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>Laſtly</hi> (ſaith the Marqueſſe) <hi>Calvin holds it abſurd, that Chriſt</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It may ſeem wonderful, that mens words and writings ſhould be thus depraved. Two places of <hi>Calvin</hi> are cited for proof of this which is alleadged againſt him. Now in the <note place="margin">Anſw</note> former place, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. he ſaith thus. <hi>Here Chriſt doth challenge to himſelf</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="21">21. The next and laſt charge againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> is little or <note place="margin">Obj.</note> nothing different from that immediately preceding, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>Our ſinnes are not only by Gods</hi>

complaining of thoſe that do charge him with them. He ſhews that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was not the author of that war, which was betwixt the <hi>Tigurines</hi> and their neighbours. It was the faſhion (he ſaith) among the <hi>Tigurines,</hi> when they went to war in behalf of their country, to have their Miniſters along with them. And ſo <hi>Zuinglius</hi> went out to battel, and died in it, and that armed; yet not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as chief Commander, or Enſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, but only as a good Citizen, and faithful Paſtor, who might not leave his people in ſuch an exigence. And whereas the Marqueſs ſpeaks of <hi>Gualterus</hi> his inſtancing in <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his ſtrange at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the <hi>Tigurines,</hi> &amp;c. it was a great overſight in him: For <hi>Gualterus</hi> only taxeth them, who ſay, <hi>Zuinglius Tigurinis novi &amp; exquiſitifacinoris contra ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios audendi author fuerit, vt videl. victus inopiâ &amp; famis neceſſitate eos in ſuas partes concedere cogeret,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>That</hi> Zuinglius <hi>cauſed the</hi> Tigurines <hi>to attempt a ſtrange enterpriſe againſt their companions, (other</hi> Helvetians <hi>that were their confederates) ſo as by want and famine to force them to joyn with them,</hi> &amp;c. Thus all this great charge brought againſt <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> is built meerly upon miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The next that the Marqueſſe falls upon, is <hi>Beza,</hi> upon whom is caſt a moſt foul aſperfion, <q>That in his <hi>Epigrams</hi> he <note place="margin">

            <p>

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urging alſo ſome of theſe teſtimonies, proceeds ſo farre in his cenſure, as to ſay, that though among them of the Church of <note place="margin">Quod verò attiner ad populum, ſunt quidem in Eccleſiâ Catholicâ plurimi mali, ſed ex haereticis nullus eſt bonus; &amp; quanquam res ipſa notiſſima eſt, <hi>&amp;c.

               <hi>Rome</hi> (for that he means by the <hi>Catholike Church)</hi> there be many bad, yet among Proteſtants (whom after his manner he terms <hi>Hereticks)</hi> there is none good; and this (he ſaith) is notorious. <note place="margin">Of the people proſeſſing the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But if both Miniſters and people were bad, as their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pretend, yet might their doctrine and profeſſion be good for all that. It was the Apoſtles complaint in his time, <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> Phil. 2. 21. Yet the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which they preached and profeſſed, was never a whit the worſe for all this, though with ſome it might be worſe accounted of. In like manner the Prophets frequently complain of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews, whoſe Religion nevertheleſſe was the only true Religion in the world. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. 2. &amp; 9. 2. &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 2. &amp;c. and ſo many other places. And that the Proteſtant doctrine is not to blame, what ever the Preachers and profeſſors of it be, may appear by thoſe very teſtimonies which the Marqueſſe and other alledge. For in that (as they ſhew) Miniſters tax and reprove people for being ſo bad, it argues that the doctrine delivered unto them, is good, though they make no good uſe of it. But that Proteſtants are ſo univerſally bad, as that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould ſay there is none good among them, is too groſſe an aſperſion; and <note place="margin">Sedillud apud Genevates laudabile, ſi quid uſquam gentium, quodque Rempub. efficit, ſi non opibus, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii magnitudine, certè vitrutibus ac pietate florentem: illa ſcil.

things that concerne <hi>Calvin</hi> of this nature.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>Breerley</hi> (and ſo other Romaniſts) could think there was juſt cauſe to except againſt the teſtimonies of <note place="margin">

Beſides, that <hi>Bolſecus</hi> the firſt deviſer of theſe calumnies, was one of their own party.

            <p>And the other particular about <hi>Calvins</hi> being ſtigmatized, is clearly and fully refuted by <hi>Andreas Rivetus</hi> in his <hi>Jeſuita Vapulans,</hi> where he produceth the very Records of that <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <q>The Marqueſſe ſaith, That of old the Church did offer prayers for the dead, both publike and private, to the end <note place="margin">

            <p>Prayer for the dead, as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> now uſe it, is grounded upon Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. <hi>It is certain</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi>

For God doth require us to do thoſe things that are written, ſaying to</hi> Joſhua, <hi>The book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Joſ. 1. 8. <hi>And when Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles, he bade them baptize all Nations, and teach them to obſerve whatſoever he commanded,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. 20. <hi>If therefore it be commanded in the Goſpel, or contained either in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, or in the Acts of the Apoſtles, then let it be obſerved as a divine and holy tradition.</hi> Now in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which the Marqueſſe alleadgeth, <hi>Cyprian</hi> proveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Aquarians</hi> (ſuch as did uſe only water in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt) that Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Sacrament uſed wine; this he proves by that which is written Mat. 26. 29. <hi>I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the Vine,</hi> &amp;c. but that Chriſt alſo did uſe water, he doth not prove, neither can it be proved by the Scripture.

               <hi>that is to ſay, at the places wherein their bodies were laid, (which were the Churches, whereunto the Chriſtians did in thoſe times uſually reſort) prayers were ordinarily offered up unto God, for whoſe cauſe they laid down their lives.</hi> But this is no argument, that they then prayed to the Martyrs, though that errour might take occaſion (afterwards) to creep in by this meanes.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe taxeth <hi>Calvin</hi> for holding, that Chriſts ſoule was ſubject to ignorance. To what I have already ſaid in anſwer to this charge, I adde, that in this particular <hi>Fulgentius</hi> was of the ſame minde with <hi>Calvin.</hi> For confuting thoſe that held <note place="margin">Si anima vel incellectus naturae in Chriſto defuiſſe credetur humanae, quid in infante bonum malúmqne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur ignoraſſe? <hi>(citat</hi> Iſa. 7. 16. <hi>atque addit)</hi> Anima igitur humana, quae ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis capax naturaliter facta eſt, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num malúmque in infante Chriſto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciiſſe dicitur, quae ſecundum Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam veritatem in puero Jeſu ſapientiâ &amp; gratiâ profeciſſe narratur. <hi>Fulgent. ad Traſim. lib.</hi> 1.</note> Chriſt to have no humane ſoul, he ſaith thus: <hi>If we muſt believe that the humane nature in Chriſt wanted a ſoul, what is it, that in Chriſt being an Infant, is ſaid not to have known good and evil?</hi> (Then he cites <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 16. expounding it of Chriſt, and addes) <hi>Therefore the humane ſoule, which is naturally made capable of reaſon, in Chriſt being an Infant, is ſaid not to have known good and evil; which according to the truth of the Goſpel, in Chriſt being a child, is related to have increaſed in wiſdome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

To that alſo that hath been ſaid before concerning <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> death, let this be added: How far <hi>Calvin</hi> was from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing at his death, as the Marqueſſe doth object, may appear by what he wrote to his dear friend <hi>Farel,</hi> when he looked for death every moment. <hi>I hardly breath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and expect conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi>

               <hi>that breath ſhould fail me. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I live and dye to Chriſt, who to thoſe that are his is both in life and death ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> This (as appears by the date of the Epiſtle). <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote at <hi>Geneva</hi> the ſecond day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1564. and (as <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> in his Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy notes out of <hi>Beza)</hi> the twenty ſeventh day of the ſame moneth he dyed.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe, page 99. ſpeaks of Marriage as anciently held by the Church to be a true and proper Sacrament. This particular I omitted, having ſpoken of the reſt which he there mentioneth, to wit, Confirmation, Orders, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, in anſwer to that which elſewhere he ſaith of them. For Marriage therefore, 1. There is nothing in the Scripture to prove it a Sacrament properly ſo called. That of the Apoſtle <note place="margin">Non habes ex hoc loco prudens Lector à Paulo conjugium eſſe Sacramentum. <hi>Cajetan. in Epheſ.</hi> 5. 32.</note> ſo much inſiſted on, <hi>This is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 32. Their own Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Cajetane</hi> upon the place confeſſeth to make nothing to the purpoſe. 2. That the Fathers call Marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not evince that they thought it to be of the ſame nature with Baptiſme and the Lords Supper. For (as I have before ſhewed) they often uſe the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> largely, and apply it to divers things, which even in our Adverſaries account properly are no Sacraments. 3. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> an acute and learned School-man, who lived about the year 1320. doth hold, that though Marriage be a ſign of a holy thing (to <note place="margin">Argumenta prima probant, quòd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium non eſt ſacramentum ſtrictè &amp; proprie dictum, ſicut alia ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta novae Legis; ſed non probant quin ſit ſacrae rei ſignum, &amp; ſic largo modo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum. <hi>Durand. in Sent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 26. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 15.</note> wit, the conjunction of Chriſt and the Church) and ſo in a large ſenſe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet it is no Sacrament ſtrictly and properly ſo called, nor of the ſame
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40220:232"/>
nature with the other Sacraments of the New Teſtament, to wit, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: and this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms by divers arguments. I know <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeavours to anſwer <hi>Durandus</hi> his arguments; but his anſwers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted by <hi>Ameſius</hi> and others, and therefore I will not ſtand about them. I will only prove from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, that Marriage is properly no Sacrament. Every Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, is adminiſtred by ſome other, and not by the ſame party, to <note place="margin">
                  <p>Commune eſt omnibus Sacramentis, ut ab alio dentur, ab alio accipiantur: neque ullus ſibi ipſe Sacramentum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtret. <hi>Bellar. de Miſſa lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>in initio.</hi>

               </note> whom it is adminiſtred. But Marriage is not adminiſtred by ſome other, but by parties themſelves that are married, whiles they mutually expreſſe their conſent one to the other: Therefore Marriage is no Sacrament properly ſo called. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth own both the Propoſition and the Aſſumption, and therefore he may not deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. This is <hi>argumentum ad hominem</hi> (as they call it) of force againſt <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:</hi> I do not ſee what he could, or any holding his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can anſwer to it. But to make the argument ſimply and abſolutely convincing, I will frame it otherwiſe. For indeed the Propoſition laid down by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is not ſimply and abſolutely true, to wit, <hi>Every Sacrament properly ſo called is adminiſtred by ſome other, and not by the ſame party to whom it is adminiſtred.</hi> This is not eſſential to a Sacrament; for then the Lords Supper ſhould be no Sacrament to the Miniſter himſelfe, but only to thoſe that communicate with him. And ſo if <hi>Abraham</hi> did circumciſe himſelfe, (as is probable he did) his Circumciſion ſhould have been no Sacrament unto him, which is moſt abſurd. Thus therefore I frame the argument: Every Sacrament of the New Teſtament is to be administred by ſuch as are peculiarly appointed of God to be Miniſters of his holy things. But Marriage is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by ſuch; Therefore it is not a Sacrament of the New Teſtament. In the Propoſition I ſay, <hi>Every Sacrament of the New Teſtament,</hi> becauſe whether it were ſo in reſpect of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40220:233"/>
Circumciſion, the ſtory of <hi>Zippordh,</hi> and ſome other places of Scripture perhaps may make it queſtionable. But for the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, our Saviour hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained thoſe that are Miniſters of the word to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of them alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And the Apoſtle bids, <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the myſteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. The Sacraments therefore being the myſteries of God, only the Miniſters of Chriſt are now the ſtewards and diſpencers of them. But this is not neceſſarily requiſite in the point of Marriage, that a Miniſter <note place="margin">Quanquam requiritur ex decreto Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Miniſter Eccleſiaſticus, qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſum conjugum exquirat, &amp; eundem approbet &amp; declaret, &amp; benedictione Sacerdotali confirmet; tamen propriè qui Matrimonii Sacramentum efficiunt ipſi conjuges ſunt. <hi>Bell. de Matr. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect. Neque abſurdum.</hi>
               </note> ſhould diſpence it. Though ordinarily a Miniſter be imployed in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage, for the inſtructing and exhorting of the parties married, and for praying unto God for his bleſſing upon them; yet this is not by Chriſts peculiar appointment, but only (as our Adverſaries confeſſe) by the Churches order, and therefore not ſimply neceſſary; Marriage were every way compleat, though no Miniſter were imployed in it, though in divers reſpects that is expedient; but howſoever properly the parties themſelves that are married, are they by whom Marriage is adminiſtred, whiles they give themſelves each to other.</p>
