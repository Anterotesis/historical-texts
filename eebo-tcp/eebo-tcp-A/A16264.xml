            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Company or Corporation of Polititians, sets

that they might set

priuiledges for <hi>Politians,</hi> was the last
week fully concluded and established.
And euen yesterday, in the great Market-place, they made a

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:6615:8"/>
And euen as <hi>Menante</hi> will not thinke his labour ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to giue you notice of the chiefest of them; so is hee
perswaded, that some honest man will not disdaine to reade
them. First then, there is to be sold in that admirable <hi>Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi>
great store of stuffing, or (as some call it) quilting,
which though it be of no esteeme among the base and vulgar
sort of men, yet is it valued and bought vp at a very high
rate of many wise and vnderstanding men, namely, of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi>
who haue discouered, that it is the shearings or nap of
those rich clothes of <hi>Prudence,</hi> which wise men weaue with
the fine wooll of <hi>Patience,</hi> and serues to boulster or fill vp the
pads of seruitude, or pack-sadles of bondage, to the end they
may fit the more easie vpon the backes of wretched <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi>
and hide those lothsome bloudy gallings and festered
sores, which seem most vgly in such men, who albeit they be
knowne for capitall enemies vnto all paines and labour, are
not notwithstanding induced to serue &amp; follow the <hi>Courts,</hi>
with an assured hope, there to liue an idle merry life, and
proudly to command others. It hath by diuers beene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
(as a thing regardfull) that many young men, who
though they may liue well in their own Fathers houses, haue
neuerthelesse bought vp good store of that precious stuffing,
and haue therwith quilted certaine petty boulsters, vnto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
they enure themselues in the seruice of priuate houses, only
that they may not come into <hi>Courts,</hi> as vnbroken colts, and
in receiuing the first time the boistrous heauy pack-saddle of
<hi>Court seruitude,</hi> assure themselues not to commit those fond
actions, and fantasticke prankes, which enforce house-ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and hall-vshers (who are the rough house-breakers
of young <hi>Courtiers</hi>) to giue them some lashes of bitter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastes,
thereby to bring them vnto the patient toleration of
that irkesome and toilesome thraldome. There is also sold in
the said Ware-house great store of most excellent Pencils for
those <hi>Princes,</hi> who in their vrgent occasions, are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to paint white for blacke vnto their people. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this be a merchandize only fit for <hi>Princes,</hi> yet doe
those false-hearted men make great prouision of them, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6615:8"/>
relying on the traffique of apparances, apply themselues to
nothing more, than to the infamous profession to leere and
laugh in ones face, and vnderhand craftily to deceiue him,
and to winde about the silly credulons people with fawning
faire words, and foule tainted deeds. They haue likewise an
infinite quantity of <hi>spectacles</hi> of admirable and sundry ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
Some of which serue to giue light vnto those salacious
and beastly luxurious men, whose sight doth so faile them
in the fury of their vnbridled and libidinous lust, that they
cannot discerne Honour from Infamie, nor know a friend
from a foe, a stranger from a kinsman, nor any other thing
worthy of respect.</p>
               <p>So great is the riddance, that those <hi>Politicke merchants</hi> do
hourely make of such <hi>spectacles,</hi> as all may euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that few or none are those men, that in carnall things
haue a good or cleare sight.</p>
               <p>They haue besides a kinde of <hi>spectacles,</hi> which serue to
dimme all light, and shorten all sight: and the <hi>Politicians</hi>
themselues affirme, that albeit these <hi>spectacles</hi> are more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoouefull
vnto all sorts of men, than those that extend the
sight farre off, yet are they most needfull vnto <hi>Courtiers,</hi> by
reason, that there doe often present themselues most loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and nastie things vnto the sight of honest men.</p>
               <p>And for so much as to turne ones backe towards them
may breed displeasure, yea and anger in mightie men or
<hi>great Lords:</hi> and to looke vpon them is a torment and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto an honest minde: And therefore for a man vpon
any such occasion to put so strange <hi>spectacles</hi> vpon his nose,
he is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the troublous molestation to see the lothsome
and abominable things of this fil the corrupted world, and
the vulgar silly multitude is induced to thinke, that a man
viewes them with more heedie curiositie.</p>
               <p>There are also other <hi>spectacles</hi> very good to preserue the
sight of those vnkinde and vnthankfull men, which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first day of any new dignitie receiued, waxeth so dim and
misty, as it reacheth euen to the bounds of Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Politicians</hi> that keepe the shop and fell them, say
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6615:9"/>
that they are made with the precious stuffe of the fast-holding
memory of benefits receiued, and of the remembrance of
fore-passed friendship.</p>
               <p>But most wondrous are those <hi>spectacles</hi> framed with such
skilfull art, that they cause to those that haue them on, <hi>Pleas
to seem: Elephants, and Pigmeys Giants.</hi> These are greedily
bought vp by certaine great men, who putting them vpon
the noses of their vnfortunate attendants, do so alter and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
their sight, as if their <hi>Lord</hi> doe but once lay his hand
vpon their shoulder, or looke vpon them with a smile,
though artificiall, and perhaps forced, they deeme it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of fiue hundred crownes a yeere.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>spectacles</hi> lately inuented in the <hi>Low-countries</hi> are
likewise bought vp at a very deare rate by <hi>great Lords,</hi> and
distributed among their <hi>Courtiers,</hi> which being vsed by
them, they cause those offices and rewards, to which their
sight shall neuer attaine, not perhaps their age reach, to seeme
neare at hand.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there are to be sold in the said <hi>Ware-house</hi> (but
at a most excessiue rate) humane eyes, which are of admirable
vertue, since it is impossible to thinke, how infinitely a man
bettereth his owne things, when he viewes them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eyes: yea the very <hi>Politicians</hi> themselues protest vpon
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences, that with no other, or better instrument, may
a man sooner attaine vnto the happinesse, to purchase that
thrice <hi>excellent vertue,</hi> so ambitiously aimed at, and sought
after by great men, of NOSCE TE IPSVM.</p>
               <p>There are also sold in that shop, certaine <hi>Compasses,</hi> not
made of siluer, of brasse, or of steele, but of the pure interesse
of the most fine <hi>reputation,</hi> that may be found in all the Mine
of Honour: And they are most admirable to measure a mans
owne proper actions, since experience hath manifestly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all men to know, that <hi>Compasses</hi> framed of the base stuffe
of fantasticke conceit, of selfe-will, or of meere interresse, do
seldome proue iust and true to those, who in their owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
desire to draw their liues parallel. Moreouer, such
<hi>Compasses</hi> proue most excellent to those, that doe exactly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6615:9"/>
possesse the skill and art to vse them, to take the iust measure
of the latitude of those ditches, which for their credit and
reputation they are compelled to leape cleane ouer, and not
runne in danger to fall or stumble in the middle of them, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mefully bury themselues aliue in the puddle of folly and
vnheedinesse: Nor can those lauish waste-goods, and spend-thrifts,
whose purses being but shallow and poore, will
waste and spend like <hi>Princes,</hi> with any other instrument, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
learne the most necessary vertue to make the step answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the leg, than with these Compasses.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Politicians</hi> doe likewise sell a numberlesse quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of <hi>boxes</hi> or <hi>leather-cases full of Mathematicall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
such as Surueyors or Land-Meters doe vse, which are
more than necessarie, exactly to measure, and in all dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to square out those with whom a man is to treat about
graue affaires, and important negotiations, or to confer and
impart weighty secrets.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>warehouse</hi> hath also great vtterance of certaine
<hi>Iron-tooles,</hi> which resemble those, that <hi>Chirurgions</hi> or tooth-drawers
vse, and call <hi>Barbicans.</hi> They serue to open and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the chaps of those vnhappy <hi>Courtiers,</hi> which being to
make a vertue of necessitie, are often compelled to swallow
huge great pumpions in stead of small mastick pills.</p>
               <p>They haue likewise great store of <hi>Beesoms, made of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,</hi>
whereof warie <hi>Courtiens</hi> make good prouision
aforehand, that they may euery morning and euening dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
sweepe from off the staires, which they daily goe vp
and downe, perilous hard Peasen scattered vpon them by

which whilome was so frequented by the

that it seemeth to be the house of desolation. Whereupon,
on the 18. day of this present moneth, the honourable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

<hi>Apollo</hi> was no sooner aduertised of so important a case, but

which the vertuous <hi>Inhabitants of Parnassus</hi> vnderstanding,
they presently put themselues into mourning weeds, sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

in him those very same effects of inward sorrow, which
he publikely made demonstration of, at what time the waile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

caused presently certaine <hi>Edicts</hi> to be proclaimed, wherein
(both to the ignorant, and to all others incapable of the most

some notable affront by <hi>Fraud,</hi> absolutely denide to

the oath of Fidelitie or Allegeance, which indissolubly they
owe vnto their Princes; and likewise loose from the bond
of that sincere loue, with which they are fast tied vnto their
priuate friends, became so fell in perfidiousnesse, so brutish in
seditions, as making euery most detestable wickednesse to

manner of perfidious and execrable confusion. Besides, the
iust grieuances and complaints of Princes did continually
molest <hi>Apollo's</hi> minde; which Princes did openly protest,
that by the damnable infidelitie of their subiects, they were
inforced to abandon the gouernance of Mankind: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Apollo,</hi> to finde out some conuenient remedie against
so notorious a mischiefe, thought it expedient to intimate
the high <hi>Court of Parlament</hi> of all the generall Estates,
against the twentieth of the last moneth, vnto which hee
summoned the Poet-princes, and the Deputies of all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nations. All which being in great diligence appeared
on the prefixed day, there were discouered in many people
great hatreds against their Princes, all which protested open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that not by the vice of Infidelitie, but vrged and euen
compelled by desperation, they had for euer banished from
out their hearts that Fidelitie, which, as most hurtfull and
preiudiciall to them, they were resolutely determined neuer
to acknowledge and re-admit: forsomuch as shee was most
foulely abused by many Princes. And whereas in former
times, the <hi>Fidelitie</hi> of Subiects, hauing euer serued as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to induce Princes, to counterchange the awe and
seruice of their people with gentle and courteous vsages,
they now clearely perceiued, that the vertue of a base and
prostrate obedience, was reputed but the basenesse of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
minde, and the merit of a voluntarie and vntainted
faithfulnesse, a necessitie to serue; by reason of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceeding, publike mischiefes and disorders were
vncontroledly gone so farre, that many people had beene
compelled to vndertake the resolution, which the world
now saw; onely to the end, that humorous and capricious
Princes should come to the perfect knowledge, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to sway and command may easily be lost, when the
outrages, ingratitudes, and misusages, daily vsed towards
subiects, hauing surmounted all humane patience, brought
all nations (naturally inclined to dutifull obedience) euen
vnto desperation; and neuer any more to liue in subiection
of Masters; with an obstinate resolution, rather to wrach
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6615:13"/>
on a free gouernment, than to be continually contemned,
abused, flaied, hurried and molested vnder Principalities.
Although the rage and disdaine of Princes towards their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
were great, and the distaste of the people greater, the
soueraigne Muses neuerthelesse, with the assistance of the
thrice-excellent heroick Vertues, who effectually labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bring a businesse of so great consequence to some
good end, with the dexteritie of their wit, in the end they
somewhat calmed and asswaged the minds of the angry Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and instigated the proud hearts of the enraged people:
And the Court of Parlament was dissolued, with the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
of this atonement, that the people should solemnly
vow and promise forthwith to readmit into their breasts the
excellent vertue Fidelitie, which they should sweare to make
absolute Mistris of their hearts. And that Princes should be
strictly bound, to banish and expell from out their hearts,
Auarice and Crueltie; and in lieu of them, yeeld the free
possession of their mindes vnto the Soueraigne Vertues,
Liberalitie, Bountie, and Clemencie, who were they, that

At these irefull and exorbitant speeches of <hi>Apollo, Lipsius</hi>
stood amazed, as one halfe dead and distracted, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
euen in the vtmost abashment and consternation
of minde, pulling vp a good heart, and taking breath, most
submissiuely begged pardon of his Maiestie for any fault hee
might haue committed; then boldly told him, that such and
so infinite were his awfull obligations towards his beloued
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> and so great was the honour, which among his
Countrymen the <hi>Flemings,</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> the
<hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> his bosome-minion,
and most dearely beloued Author <hi>Tacitus</hi> had purchased
him; whom though he acknowledged to loue most entirely,
and to honour as his terrestriall God; yet, to attaine vnto
a superlatiue degree of due satisfaction of his bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and with exactnesse to accomplish the duty of true grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he thought all he could doe to be nothing, in respect
of his vnualuable merits.</p>
               <p>His reason was, that hauing published and left vnto the
world, diuers ordinary labours and compositions, his onely
workes vpon <hi>Tacitus</hi> were they, that had made him to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
an abode and mansion in <hi>Pernassus,</hi> and an honourable
and immortall renowne among many Nations: and that if
he, who with other mens money exercised the trafficke of
trading and rich merchandizing, was easily pardoned his
errour, if hee did euen worship and adore him, that at his
pleasure might make him breake and turne begger: How
much more then did he deserue of his <hi>Maiestie</hi> to be, if not
commended, yet at least excused, if in louing and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his deare dearest <hi>Tacitus,</hi> he exceeded all bounds of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of decorum, or of dignity, sithence in &amp; vpon him only
was grounded the whole fabricke of all the credit and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that he had purchased among the vertuous. And that
hee, euer since his first ingresse into <hi>Pernassus,</hi> had of all the
learned bin so beloued, cherished, courted, and reuerenced,
that his house was no otherwise frequented, then that of the
most famous writers.</p>
               <p>But that after hee fell into the errour to make <hi>Tacitus</hi> his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6615:18"/>
enemie, <hi>statim relictum illius limen, nemo adire, nemo solari:</hi>
and therefore rather than hee would any whit diminish his
veneration, and awfull respect toward that prime Author
of his, he was well pleased to hate himselfe, and to lose his
life, deeming the losse of the same farre lesse, than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the fame, vnto which by meanes of <hi>Tacitus</hi> he had
attained.</p>
               <p>So highly did these words of <hi>Lipsius</hi> offend <hi>Apollo's</hi> mind,
that more and more enraged with fierce wrath, he vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complained, that euen before his awfull presence with so
impudent asseueration, hee had rather manifestly made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of a wilfull stubbornnesse to perseuere in his
stiffe opinion of so hainous an excesse, than humilitie to
yeeld vnto penitence, and for his fault to craue p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rdon. And
aboue any other demerit of so obstinate a man, his <hi>Maiestie</hi>
could by no meanes endure, that he had entitled the impiety
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> with the stile of honourable gratitude; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obstinacie, with the title of a constant and vncorrupted
truth.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he suddenly commanded the foresaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
of the Lyricke Poets, presently to drag him out of his
presence, as one most vnworthy to looke his Maiestie in the
face, whom he had so capitally offended to the quicke.</p>
               <p>And that hauing stripped him of such good letters as he
possessed, they should publikely proclaime him to be a most
shamelesse ignorant Asse; and after burne him aliue, as a
most wicked and detestable idolater.</p>
               <p>Forthwith was poore <hi>Lipsius</hi> brought, and haled vnto the
place of so great infamie, where his friends most earnestly
perswaded him to aduise himselfe, and at once, humbly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for mercy at his <hi>Maiesties</hi> hands, endeauour to saue both
his life and reputation.</p>
               <p>In the very moment of desperation of so horrible and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
a plunge, it was manifestly perceiued, that at the
apprehension thereof, there appeared in <hi>Lipsius</hi> such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted
constancie, and an vndismaid boldnesse of a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
minde against the terrors of death, that he thus answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Apollo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6615:18"/>
And let his will be done: for, he cannot die ignorant, that
can perfectly demonstrate to possesse Gratitude, which is the
<hi>Soueraigne Queene</hi> of all humane vertues.</p>
               <p>And therefore, the flames that were prepared to consume
him, would yeeld a farre brighter splendor of Glory, than of
Fire: and that euen in the last instant of his dying-life, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protested, that he would in no wise acknowledge the
crime wherewith he was charged, to haue ouer-much loued
or superstitiously honoured his beloued <hi>Tacitus</hi> to be true.
And that by reason of the infinite bonds, wherewith he stood
tied vnto him, and for the respectfull loue he bare him; the
griefe and molestation that he felt in remembring, that hee
died vngratefull vnto him, did more excruciate and torment
him, than the rigor or paines or death: and that the agony,
in which they all saw him, proceeded not from the fright
or terror hee felt, that hee must die, but from the inward
pangs, and hearts griefe, which vexed him, in as much, that
he had heard his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> name and pronounce <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to
be a wicked <hi>Atheist.</hi> An iniurie, which had it beene vttered
of so excellent and wise an Author by any other man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
then by his sacred <hi>Maiestie</hi> (euen in that last gaspe of
life) he would neuer haue left it vnreuenged, at least with the
weapons of his tongue. And that with the same libertie,
which is so proper vnto such as care not to liue, hee made it
knowne vnto all men, that the reall truth was, that <hi>Tacitus</hi>
had so much knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> that he alone, among all the
Heathen Writers, with his profound and exact knowledge,
hauing attained perfectly to know of what worth and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
(touching matters of Religion) faith is of those things,
which are not seene, or cannot by humane reason be proued,
had boldly said, <hi>Sanctiusque ac reuerentius visum de actis
Deorum credere, quam scire:</hi> Words most sacred, and well
worthy to be considered by those Diuines, who in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
had lost themselues in their Sophisticall subtilities, and
Logicall nicities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> hauing heard these things, as one possessed with
wonderment, and full of admiration, presently caused <hi>Lipsius</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:6615:19"/>
to be loosed, and most affectionatly embracing him, he thus
bespake him; Oh my dearely beloued and vertuous <hi>Lipsius,</hi>
with what comfort to me, and auailefull gaine to thee, haue I
tempted thy patience, and made triall of thy most vertuous
constancie? And by the bitter detractions, which I haue
vttered against <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which are but those with which they
accuse him, that either neuer reade him, or vnderstand him
not, I haue throughly made proofe of thy zealous deuotion
towards that most excellent Historian, whom I deeme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

               <p>And by that, which I haue now heard from thee, I doe
euidently perceiue, that thou hast read him with delight, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
him with profit, and learnt him to thy great aduantage;
for I know that the stout defence, which to thy immortall
glory, thou hast made in his behalfe, is not thine owne, but
drawne from thine and mine <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This said and done, <hi>Apollo</hi> turned himselfe towards the
vertuous, who for curiositie, and to heare the successe of that
great accident, were in great troupes flocked into the Hall,
he thus said vnto them:</p>
               <p>

And neuer forget that the credit and power of him, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the good grace and fauour of his <hi>Prince,</hi> doth more
easily ruine, and precipitate, than doe the houses, whose

caused, both to his reputation, and to the generall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
of his vertuous followers, by framing all that anew,
which at this day is wanting in his most excellent workes. At
this request, which seemed both vertuous and reasonable,
contrary to the opinion of all men, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> was much
offended, and with manifest alteration of minde, he framed
this answer: Oh you my ignorantly-learned friends, doth it
not then seeme vnto you, that the Princes of this world are
already ouer-cunning Statists, but that you wish them to be
more perfect Doctors in that Science, in which for your last
misery, they offend in being ouer-skilfull in the same? Since

diuulged, that this hath happened by reason of some
complaints exhibited against him by certaine most potent
Princes, who haue grieuously complained and aggrauated,
that <hi>Tacitus</hi> with the seditious argument of his <hi>Annals,</hi> and
of his Histories, hath framed a kinde of spectacles, that work
most pernitious effects for Princes; for so much as being put
vpon the noses of silly and simple people, they so refine and
sharpen their sight, as they make them see and prie into the
most hidden and secret thoughts of others, yea euen into the
centre of their hearts: and they protest, that they nor can,
nor will euer by any meanes endure they should make appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
demonstration vnto all men of the pure essence and
qualitie of the mindes and purposes of Princes, what they
are inwardly, and not what with their trickes and artifices
(necessary for to rule and raigne) they endeuour to appeare
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6615:22"/>
outwardly. Yesterday morning the Atturney Generall of
the greatest Monarks, now resident in <hi>Parnassus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> appeared
before the right honourable Lords Censors, among whom,
in regard of the reputation of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his person, who was
to be arraigned and adiudged, <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe came and sate
among them.</p>
               <p>This Aduocate or Atturney Generall with exaggerated
words gaue them to vnderstand, that it was full well known
to all the best vnderstanders of State-matters, that for the
peace and tranquillitie of kingdoms, Princes are often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to commit actions not greatly to be commended,
which (to maintaine themselues in the peoples opinion, to
be honest and vpright Princes, in which conceit, hee that
reigneth must necessarily labour, and endeuour to keepe
himselfe) they were wont to shadow and blanch ouer with
the specious and precious pretexts of an holy and vndefiled
intention, and of an honest, hearty, and affectionate zeale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the common good. All which tricks, deuices, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices,
they can no longer put in practise or make vse of, if
the true sense or meaning of their designes shall at any time
come to the knowledge of the vulgar.</p>
               <p>And that if it were possible, that the people (without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subiect to others Empirie) might be gouerned of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
then would Princes most willingly renounce the
Royall titles, and authoritie of commanding; forsomuch as
they are now fully resolued, that Kingdoms and Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are but insupportable burdens, subiects full-fraught
with crabbed difficulties, and of so infinite dangers, as at
their owne richly-sumptuous tables (so much enuied them
by Gluttons and greedy Gourmands) they should neuer
taste morsell, that would not relish of Arsenike. But if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
had made the world to know, that the sway and
gouernment of Humane-kinde, without the presence of a
wise and Politicke Prince, to rule and direct the same, would
ere long be filled and ouer-run with wailfull and tragicall
confusions.</p>
               <p>It is likewise conuenient, that all these iust and lawfull
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6615:22"/>
meanes be granted them as are requisite and behouefull vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
to gouerne their subiects: For, if to manure and till
the fields, the Husbandman is not denide to haue his oxen,
his plough, and his mattock: If the Taylor (to cut out and
sew his garment) haue allowed him, both needle, thimble,
and sheares; and the Smith, his hammer and his tongs;
why shall Monarchs be depriued of meanes, and barred of
power, hereafter to cast dust in their subiects eyes, which is
the readiest benefit, the most excellent, and necessariest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
that euer any Politician could inuent, or finde in
all the volume of State-reason (though most excellent) right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to gouerne Empires? All which things, Princes (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the seditious inuention of <hi>Tacitus</hi>) could no longer
effect, or bring to passe: it being most euident, that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
spectacles, framed by that euer-factious and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, besides the first qualitie (as hath beene said, to
subtilize and sharpen the sight of the vulgar people) they
produce also a second most pernicious effect, that is, to be so
well and fitly fastned to the noses of all men, as it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
possible for Princes, (as heretofore they haue done, with
no lesse facilitie, than profit to themselues) to cast dust into
their subiects eyes, though it were of the most artificiall, and
superfinest, that possibly could be, without plainly discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that they are cheated, cozened and deceiued.</p>
               <p>The complaints and grieuances of the Monarchies
seemed most true both to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and to the venerable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Censors. And therefore they deemed them
worthy to be maturely considered.</p>
               <p>Now by the long discourses and debatements, that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
among them, conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rning a businesse of so great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
it seemed, that their opinion was likely to preuaile,
who consured, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> together with his scandalous
Annales, and his seditious Histories, should for euer be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
the society and conuersation of all men.</p>
               <p>But his Maiestie, vnwilling so much to vilifie or embase
the Prince of all Politicall Historians, or to distaste honest
Students, by depriuing them of their bosome-delights, was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6615:23"/>
contented, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> should be giuen to vnderstand from
his Maiestie, how his pleasure was, that of those spectacles
(in very deed preiudiciall vnto Princes) he should frame as
few as possibly could be. And that aboue all things, hee
should vigilantly take great heed, not to disperse any abroad,
except vnto choise and excellent men, vnto Secretaries, and
vnto Priuy Counsellers of State to Princes, to the end they
might serue to facilitate vnto them the good and vpright
gouernment of their people. And that aboue all, (euen as
he tendred or loued his Maiesties good fauour) he should take
especiall care, neuer to impart or communicate any vnto
those turbulent or factious spirits, which in seditious and

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6615:23"/>
by diuers great Princes) but hauing infinitely enriched him

               <p>This so worthy <hi>Duke,</hi> by those who enuie the greatnesse

after he had tauntingly vpbraided him with the foule

to haue liued vertuously, and vprightly in all my actions,
as I am more than certaine to haue demerited nothing of
your <hi>Maiestie.</hi> Nor doth your indignation, nor this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous

vncorrupted Tribunals, as this is, is of power to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and bring into so dangerous hazards, the reputation
of men of my ranke and qualitie.</p>
               <p>But I quiet my selfe in the will of God, who hath euer
willed, that the gold of others innocencie, should be refined
in the fire of false calumnies, and in the test of persecutions.
I freely confesse vnto your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> to haue exalted my
friend more than my maleuolent enemies haue reported

hath beene pourtraid so hainous, this only grieueth mee,
that (in mine opinion) I haue not throughly performed all

of an abiect minde, borne in the foule sinke of sottishnesse,
to serue seruants, when they see a Courtier well-beloued or

to be blinded by malice, by passion, or by enuie, but with a

name that a vertuous life, which they entitle vitious prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie;
dutie of gratitude those gifts, which they call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate;
and a vertuous affection, the infamie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

But it is not a profession fitting vulgar or ordinarie men, to
diue or pierce into <hi>Abditos Principis sensus, &amp; si quid occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6615:24"/>
infamie of great men, fall into so grosse errors, as they stile
the vertuous proceeding of a gratefull man, to be a vice of
an abiect minde.</p>
               <p>The Principalitie of the <hi>Laconians</hi> (as your <hi>Maiestie</hi> well

euer beene of greater power, than he that ruled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the same: not onely for the end and scope, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all electiue Princes, after their death, to procure vnto
their blood and kinsfolks, potent friends, but for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herences,
which foraigne Princes, for important respects,
haue with the Senators or Peeres, that enioy the prerogatiue
to elect a new Prince: the dependance and traine of whom
they endeuour to acquire, and procure with those arts and
tricks, as are already too well knowne to all men. Moreouer,
your <hi>Maiestie</hi> knoweth, that the Prince of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
with his plots and practises had gotten so great authoritie in
my State, and was so ouer-growne in forces aboue all the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, as he was not only the absolute arbitrator
of all <hi>Greece,</hi> but openly aspired vnto an vniuersall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is not vnknowne to your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> that the
said Prince of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> vnder colour of amitie, and the
protection of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Laconia,</hi> with vndermining pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
sought euer their ruine and ouerthrow. And forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the power of the Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi> hindred him from
being able to compasse so high ends, he, to remoue, or at
least, to frustrate, or to weaken so strong an obstacle, more
with machinations of gold, and with secret conspiracies,
than with open force of Armes, he caused those insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the people, and those rebellions in <hi>Epirus,</hi> that haue
so much impaired the State thereof.</p>
               <p>And (as a thing too too well knowne to the world) I will
not now call to your memories, how that my most prudent
Predecessor, fore-knowing that the depression of <hi>Epirus,</hi>
was a manifest preparation for the ruine of the <hi>Laconian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
to assure the same from the ambition of so mighty an

aide and support the afflicted State of <hi>Epirus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how that good Prince died in the pursuit of his wise
resolution, not without vehement suspition of poyson mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
vnto him by expresse order from the Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia;</hi>
as he, who neither could, nor would endure, that
the diuision of <hi>Epirus</hi> (by him accounted so secure) should
be hindred by him.</p>
               <p>In this vnhappy state of things, I was aduanced to the
Dignitie: And to auoid the disastrous end of my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
in the first months of my Principalitie, I shewed my selfe
to be of a remisse genius, and altogether incapable of great
affaires of State.</p>
               <p>I did wholly apply my selfe to reforme the Magistrates
of my Dominion, and correct the abuses and vices of my
subiects, openly professing to be a capitall enemie to the
Prince of <hi>Epirus;</hi> but in my heart, ful wel knowing wherunto
the secret machinations, and plots of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prince
aimed: and knowing also, that each losse of the Prince of
<hi>Epirus,</hi> would proue my ouerthrow; I, to establish my State,
reduced vnto so apparent dangers, resolued with my selfe,
to afford him all the aid I could.</p>
               <p>But, to assure mine owne life for those disastrous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
in which my Predecessor perished, it behoued me, in
so strait and difficult a deliberation, to proceed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
caution and secrecie.</p>
               <p>And obseruing (as no doubt your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> and all these
Right Honourable Iudges know full well) that amongst the
numberlesse imperfections incident vnto Electiue States,
the greatest is, that, lesse than any whatsoeuer Principalities,
they finde or enioy that most important, and vnualuable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of secrecie in their Ministers: forsomuch as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of men are so depraued, as their Senators and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
proue often greedy Merchants, or Brokers of their
Dignities and Offices; out of which they labour and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
to extract and reape the greatest commoditie, that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they can: Now therefore, euen in the beginning of my
Principalitie, seeing my selfe engaged, yea and engulfed in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6615:25"/>
so many anguishes and perplexities: And knowing, that
I must needs wracke, and vtterly perish vpon the rocke of
Infidelitie, if in a businesse of so maine consequence, I made
vse of those ordinarie Secretaries, whom I knew to haue
long before fore-stalled and bribed by foraigne Princes: The
great God (from whose only benignitie, and not from any
else, I acknowledge this great benefit) inlightned my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And hee it was, that first proposed vnto mee,
this mine, I will not say seruant; for by the matchlesse
vertue, which I haue found and experienced in him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
not to be stiled with so meane, or with so base a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
but most deare-deare friend. And to him, who in
the quality of a bosome seruant, had most faithfully serued
me the space of full eight yeeres, I freely vnfolded that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of my heart, which had it but falne into my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I would haue deemed it most dangerous for me. And
then it was, that I perceiued, how that the excellencie and
high worth of a Secretarie consists not (as many thinke) in
the speaking with elegancie, but in being secretly silent with
fidelitie. This I say, because with so happy successe of the
important businesse, which I had in hand, I vsed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
this my trustie seruant, as I most successefully came
to beguile and countermine the wilie-wise Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia;</hi>
which no subtle or craftie wit was yet euer able
to doe.</p>
               <p>And by the meanes of this my so faithfull Secretary, my
affaires haue bin so carried, as no man could euer diue into,
or so much as guesse at my designes. And I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
aided and supported that Prince my friend, whom I
openly professed to hate and persecute: and haue prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
practised the trade, at once to laugh and to deceiue,
with those who make publike ostentation to bee the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Doctors of that Art. And with so vertuous a deceit
haue I reduced the affaires of <hi>Epirus</hi> (whilome so imbroiled,
as they were generally held desperate) vnto the state the
world seeth. Since that from the most deplorable misery that
could be, I haue raised the same to be the sole Arbitrator of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6615:26"/>
all Greece. And the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who had chimera'd and
ideated vnto themselues vniuersall Monarchies; and that in
lesse than a moneth they should bee able to swallow downe
all other mens states: from their highest hopes are so tumbled
downe into a precipice of lamentable desperations, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vtterly renounced their ambitious cepricios, to vsurpe
other mens Estates, as with much adoe they keepe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo,</hi> hauing attentiuely listened vnto those things, all
ioyfull ranne to embrace the Duke of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of heart said thus vnto him.</p>
               <p>Oh Duke of that thrice noble Nation, which in few
words expresseth many things, right vertuously and honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hast thou dealt with a man of so incomparable worth and
vertue. And I tell thee plainely, that in thy most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Laconian Senate, there are but few other Senatours to be
found equall in merit to this thy friend, to whom hadst thou
giuen all thine Estate, yet shouldest thou dye vngracefull to
him, and in his debt; sith in these vnhappy times, wherein
euen in the open market of the perfidiousnesse of many, the
secrets of Princes are at port-sale, sold to him that offereth
most. That Secretary, who in important affaires proueth
faithfull, and continueth trusty vnto his Prince, cannot so
highly bee honoured, nor so bountifully be rewarded by
him, but that he hath deserued much much more.</p>

               <p>THE deplorable wracks, which diuers learned men
so often suffer in the Courts of great Princes, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>Apollo</hi> daily more and more to the very heart,
who with continuall labour and toilesome sweats,
of the most famous Sciences (hoping by them to merit the
good fauour and grace of Princes) hauing fraighted the
Ship of their minds with them, are afterwards seene vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately

               <p>No riches of infinite vertues being of force to free them
from so deplorable calamities: He, I say, would needs at

whereby hee might rest assured, that in all Courts
(but especially in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> placed in so tempestuous a
Climate) the nauigation of his beloued vertuous attendants
might be reduced vnto all possibe security; and all for the
benefit of good letters, which doe much empaire their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when others see that they so little aduance or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

Now <hi>Apollo</hi> seriously discoursing with himselfe, that if the

and the <hi>Zelander</hi> Pilots, onely with a little obseruing of
the Starres, the Moone and the Sunne, with a little stone in
their hand, could and were able to curb and command the
vast and dreadfull Ocean, which they so freely, and euery
way, and at all seasons furrowed and waded through, as they
had thereon plotted out high-waies and watlin-streets, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and from all Coasts.</p>
               <p>How it could bee that his vertuous, with the powerfull
helpe of Astronomy, of Cosmographie, of the Mathematiks,
of the Meteors, but chiefly with their quaint wits, sharpned
on the whetstone of continuall reading of Bookes, could
not inuent as easie and secure a nauigation by land, as the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
of the forenamed Nations had found out by sea. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to assure (as farre as the vertue and strength of good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
can extend vnto) the nauigation by land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> did not many moneths since institute a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, selected out from all the Sciences necessary
for so maine a businesse, appointing as chiefe and president
thereof, <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> the Prince of Cosmographers, vnto
whom he allotted great <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as companion in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
<hi>Euclide</hi> for the Mathematicks, <hi>Guido Bonatti</hi> for Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie:
And to these he added as Coadiutor, Count <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar
Castilion,</hi> a man well skil'd and practised in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
seas of the Courts.</p>
               <p>And for the better security of all that which he intended
to establish for the happy successe of a businesse of so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a consequence, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> commanded, that famous
<hi>Annon</hi> of Carthage, <hi>Palinurus, Columbus, Cortese, Ferrante
Magellanes, Amerigo Vespucci, Vasco di Gama</hi> should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Congregation, as they, who haue beene the
prime &amp; chiefest Pilots that euer the nauigation by Sea had.</p>
               <p>First then (as it was conuenient) there was by that right
excellent man <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> framed a most exquisite Card to
saile by Land, which with singular cunning was euery way
lineated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:6615:27"/>
And to come to the perfect knowledge of the true eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the merits of Courtiers, and longitude of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
with which their seruices should be acknowledged,
there were not onely inuented diuers and most learned
<hi>Astrolabs,</hi> but a new and most artificiall <hi>Quadrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is that that excellent man <hi>Guido Bonatti,</hi> with all
his profound Astronomie, laboured exceeding hard to finde
out the true altitude of the pole of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi>
nor was it euer possible, either for him or for any other of
the most sufficient of the whole Congregation, with any
<hi>Astrolabe</hi> whatsoeuer, to euen or leuell and adiust the course
of the Sunne of the phantasticke braine, and giddy humour
of a selfe-conceited Prince.</p>
               <p>For the genius of Princes being the true and safe
North-Starre, which nauigating Courtiers ought heedily to
obserue in the nauigations by land.</p>
               <p>Those worthy men were much amazed, and wondred
how a Starre so certaine and infallible in Sea nauigations,
should in Land nauigation be found not onely vnstable and
wauering, but was perpetually turned and gired about, by
the two contrary motions of priuate interesse, and selfe-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
from which two difficulties, many most dangerous
turbulencies arising, they were often the causes of foule and
horrible wracks.</p>
               <p>But greater difficulties and incumberances were discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the most vncertaine motions of the wandring Stars,
of the Ministers and Officers of Princes, since (as it should
haue bin) they were not so much rapt by the first impetuous
Mouer of the good seruice due to their Prince, vnto which
they were often manifestly seene to be retrograde.</p>
               <p>And that which exceeded all wonder, was the amazement
whereinto the Congregation fell, when by a certaine obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
it perceiued, that the inferiour heauens of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
with the course of their priuate passions towards their
owne interesse or selfe-respects, did often draw and rap the
said <hi>primum mobile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by these strange accidents, the businesse was so
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6615:28"/>
intricate and full of confusion, as those Lords could neuer
possibly come to the perfect knowledge of the regular and
true motion of so many sphears, as was necessary to those
that were to publish infallible rules of them. The rubs and
impediments increased when they came to the act to note
and set downe the winds in the guide-ship compasse, which
they found to be neither certaine, nor limited in number, as
we see they are in all Sea-cards, but were little lesse than infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
for, besides the foure master winds of the Princes will,
of his childrens desires, of his Brethrens prerogatiue, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes of the blood's preheminence, and the seuerall
opinions of priuie Councellors, there were discouered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of quarter-winds, or side winds, of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Officers of the Court, of Mignons and Fauourits
to the Prince, of vnder-Secretaries, of Buffons, of Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
of Parasites, of Fidlers, yea, and of Panders, all so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular,
so voluble, so vnconstant, and in some occasions, so
stormy, so boistrous, so high and furious, as in the compasse
which they were a framing, they bred so inextricable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
as made those famous Pilots to condole the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition of nauigating Courtiers, who in their land-sailing
must bee enforced to fit and adapt the sailes of their
wits to such a multitude of seuerall winds as appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
               <p>All which difficulties notwithstanding (though insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
those notable Pilots neuer fainted or gaue ouer. Nay
rather, though they discouered the immense and vast Ocean
of the Courts to be all ouer full of flats, shelues, shallows,
quicksands, crags, rocks, gulfs, whirl-pools, sirts, Scilla's and
Carybdis of enuious, emulous, malicious, seditious, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent,

                  </gap>ers, slanderers, railers, grudgers, persecutors, finde-faults,
fantastick-humors, and heteroclit-wits, by so much
the more did their courage increase to surmount so hard a
taske, and so intricate a businesse, and to bring it to some
good passe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:6615:28"/>
Their <hi>Astrolabs</hi> being framed, and the <hi>Quadrant</hi> finished,
and the Ship-guide compasse reduced vnto the best perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they could, the Congregation determined to come
vnto the act of experience, whereupon hauing made choise
of eight quaint, smug, and spruce Courtiers, all compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stored with patience (the most necessary biscuit, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
prouision, and needfull sustenance for those that haue
the heart to lanch into, and furrow the tempestuous Ocean
of the Courts) who, whilest they diligently prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
for their voyage, hauing hoised their sailes, and onely
expecting a fauourable wind, a chance befell impossible to
be beleeued; which was, that a most propitious North-gale
blowing, to which all the eight Courtiers, suddenly hoised
and spread the sailes of all their hopes, onely those of one
were seene to appeare full swolne, and prosperously to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his voyage, whilest the other seuen neuer budged from
their stations.</p>
               <p>Which the Lords of the Congregation perceiuing, they
were much distracted, especially when they obserued, that
in a Land-nauigation the fauourable winds of the Princes
good grace and opinion did not blow equally in all the sailes
of his Courtiers, though all of equall merit and worth.</p>
               <p>And greater was their wonder, when the said fauourable
winde, blowing a new faire stiffe gale, some Courtiers, who
were prepared for a bon-voyage, speedily hoised, and spread
all their sheeting, they might perceiue one who had neither
mast, nor saile, nor tackling, of any merit, but lay there idly
hulling in the hauen, to learne some practise of the Court,
before he would aduenture himselfe into the dangers of so
troublous and hazardous a nauigation, by the force of that
propitious winde, was driuen out of the port of his restfull
ease, and blowne roomeward into the deepe of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
beyond his skill or sufficiency; and with a most suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull
nauigation, end the voyage, with the purchase of
great reuennues, of rich offices, of eminent honors,
and of sublime titles: A nouelty that seemed so rare and
strange to all the Pilots, that <hi>Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lanes,</hi> as one confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6615:29"/>
with wonder, said thus;</p>
               <p>My honourable good Lords, I would neuer haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
there should bee so great a difference betweene the Sea-nauigation,
and the Land-sailing.</p>
               <p>And these extrauagant nouelties which now I see, seeme
so strange to me, as they make me greatly to doubt of any
happy issue of this our enterprise. But, for as much as all
arduous difficulties may at last bee ouercome with a constant
patience in the pursuit of them, let vs boldly proceed.</p>
               <p>By this time another right vertuous Courtier, displaied
the sailes of his faithfull seruice, at a faire westerly gale of the
good fauour of his Prince, and by the quality of the sailes
full puft, with the gracious demonstrations of words, which
he receiued from his Lord, imagining that he had gone a far
iourney, after a long-long voyage, hauing calculated the
course of his nauigation, hee found himselfe riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in the very same place, whence hee hoised saile in the
long voyage of his assiduous seruice: The silly and vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
wretch, hauing continually bin fed with diuers hopes of
fallacious expectations, without substance of any good.</p>
               <p>But a stranger accident presented it selfe vnto those Lords,
when they saw at one same instant a stiffe gust to blow both
South and North so ragingly, from the adle braine of a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticke
Prince, that the vnfortunate Courtiers, tossed to
&amp; fro by two so contrary winds, could not resolue to which
they were best to addresse their sailes, so that diuers vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
good men perished in that tempestuous storme. At
which strange case <hi>Celumbus</hi> exclaimed and said; Now I
plainly perceiue (my Lords) that the nauigation by Sea,
wherein these extrauagances are neuer seene, is a businesse so
safe, as it may be compared vnto such iournies as men go by
land in Horse-litters <hi>Columbus</hi> had no sooner vttred these
words, but the Lords of the Congregation perceiued, that
certaine right vertuous Courtiers, who rode in the hauen,
were in great danger to be cast away; the Sea of the Court
wrought so, and was beyond it's custome so risen, and the
surges mounted so high, as they threatned a generall nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6615:29"/>
The biggest Cables of the most exquisite Court-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
although right strong and tough, did rend in sunder;
so that all was wrackfull ruine. All which notwithstanding
the skie of the Princes countenance was calme, and his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
cleare, nor did any other winde blow, but the gentle
<hi>Zephirus,</hi> or West of the Princes quietnesse. The mischiefe
was apparent; the breath of the Princes indignation was not
felt, and yet the miserable nauigating Courtiers perished in
the harbour</p>
               <p>All this raging storme notwithstanding, an hardy and
couragious Courtier, who dared to heaue Anchor, &amp; come
out of the hauen; and (as euery man thought) was not only
nor drowned nor ouerwhelmed; for, that blustring tempest
which would haue endangered or wrack't any whatsoeuer
best practis'd and skilfull Sea-man, serued him in steed of so
prosperous a gale, as in a short time it brought him vnto an
hauen of high and honourable dignities.</p>
               <p>An accident (in truth) worthy of infinite admiration, and
which caused great wonderment and amazement in all the
Lords of the Congregation. It seeming very strang vnto
them, that in the Land nauigation, those stormy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
serued some in lieu of fauonrable winds, which in
most safe and quiet hauens were the dismall destruction
of many.</p>
               <p>But another thing seemed more wondrous vnto them,
when in a calme skie, cleare welkin, and faire season; no
clouds, no lightning, no thunder, nor any signe of foule
weather appearing, there were suddenly seene certaine thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts
to fall, which vtterly consumed and burnt two
most vnfortunate Courtiers. At which vnwonted accident,
the Lords of the Congregation were much affrighted, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
how the thunder-darts, hurled by an irefull Prince,
were not accompanied with those fore-going Lightning-flashes
and thunder-claps, as those be, which by the All-powerfull
hand of the great <hi>God</hi> are hurled at Mankind, and
which forewarne all Courtiers to auoid them.</p>
               <p>A little while after, they saw a Courtier assailed by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6615:30"/>
storme of persecutions; who after he had long strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and stoutly defended himselfe against the muddie fury of
the swolne Sea of his Princes wrathfull indignation, and
from the furious blasts of cruell and malicious detractions,
lest he should sinke and be swallowed vp, hee was forced to
fling all his goods and merchandize ouer-board. And the
miserable wretch had already lost the maine mast of his
hopes, and his merits had a great leake, and drew in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of water of desperation, when loe his vessell rushed
and split against the marble rock of the ingratitude of a most
vnthankfull Prince.</p>
               <p>Then followed a most strange thing, which was, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so disastrous an encounter, the vessell of that Courtiers
seruice being split, wrackt and sunke, the storme of Court-persecutions
ceased, the Sea of the Princes indignation was
calmed, and the rocke (which had caused that miserable
wracke) was conuerted into a most safe hauen: the Courtiers
vessell but ere-while ouerwhelmed, of it selfe start vp out of
the waues, more faire, more strong, and in better plight,
than euer it had beene before. And the merchandize of his
merits of it selfe was laded againe, which not long after, he
vttered and vented at a very deare rate; trucking and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the same for great dignities, eminent titles, and rich
reuenues.</p>
               <p>This accident seemed very strange vnto the Lords Pilots,
and vnto all the Congregation, nor could they sufficiently
wonder how it could be possible, that in the land-nauigation
the most vnhappie wrackes of some, might serue as great fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
to others.</p>
               <p>Now the Congregation continuing in trying of new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
enioyned a sly-witty Courtier to hoise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
the sailes of his talent towards a wind that blew from
South, and happily sailing, and keeping towards the North,
after many dayes sayling the Pilot-courtier desirous to see
where he was, he with his Astrolabe measured the altitude
of the Pole of his merit; and to his great wonderment found,
that hauing continually kept the prow of his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6615:30"/>
towards the North of his Princes interresse, hee had
made his voyage Southward. Of so strange a disorder, the
Courtier at first accused himselfe, that (as hee should haue
done) he had not steered the helme of his faithfull minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North of his Princes good seruice. But when both
with his sailing-card, and with his ship-guide compasse in his
hand, he assured himselfe, that he had euermore guided the
ship of his actions in an euen and honest line, he plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
that the errour or mistaking of his vnluckie voyage
proceeded so, because the North of his Princes affection had
suffered it selfe to to be turned towards the South, by certain
wicked and maleuolent whisperers, which he hath alwaies
about him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Vespucci, Gama,</hi> and other Pilots, besought the
Lords of the Congregation, to giue ouer the businesse, as a
desperate cure: and said, that nothing yeelded the nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by sea more sure or safe, than the immutabilitie of the
North-starre.</p>
               <p>And that by the last most vnfortunate experience, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
euidently appeared, that the mindes of Princes (which
are the infallible North-starre of land-nauigation) suffering
themselues so often and so easily to be turned, remoued, and
circumgired by lewd and wicked people of the Court: to
aduenture to saile the tempestuous Ocean of the Courts, was
a resolution not fitting wise men, but desperate persons.</p>
               <p>In this interim the Lords of the Congregation might see
a most elegant spruce Courtier, who for the space of more
than threescore yeares had so happily sailed, both in the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in others, that he had not only surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
outragious storms of ruthlesse blasts and boistrous winds
of persecutions, but had euen shiuered and broken the very
same huge rocks, on which he had split &amp; wrackt his vessel;
but that afterwards, when with a most pleasant gale, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
wind, on the height of his felicitie, he pursued his
course, onely for that he vnfortunately hit vpon a rush of an
impertinencie of a base Catch-pole, he was vtterly cast away.
An accident which caused such distraction in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6615:31"/>
that the Lords ioyntly resolued, to haue but one triall
more made (and then be quiet) by a Courtier, that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to set saile; and him they commanded to hoise and
spread all his sailes: But so it happened, that whilest he held
on his course in a coast, deemed of all men, most safe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerlesse,
his ship vnheedily, or by chance, hit vpon a rocke,
and was wholly split and wrackt, which the Lords of the
Congregation seeing, they all bitterly bewailed the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and vnheedinesse of the Courtier; for so much as hee
could not auoid that rocke. But he made manifest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
to them all, that it was not marked in the sailing-card.
Whereupon all the Pilots casting their eyes vpon great <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey,</hi>
as if they silently accused him of ignorance, hauing
omitted that rocke, which so well deserued to be marked in
his Card, and had been the cause of so disastrous a mischiefe.
But <hi>Ptolomey</hi> hauing first well viewed the place, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the countrey thereabout, did euidently demonstrate
vnto the Lords, that no man liuing had euer before that time
seene any shelfe or rocke in that place, and therefore he had
not marked it in his Card; but that it suddenly grew and
started vp in the very instant, that the vpfortunate Courtier
hit and ranne vpon it.</p>
               <p>Now the Lords of the Congregation perceiuing, that in
the nauigation by land, huge rockes did euery hand-while
spring vp and grow in a moment, euen in the middest of
fields and other places supposed most safe to be nauigated in
the darkest night, they concluded their businesse to bee des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
and their attempt impossible. And therefore dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Congregation, they straitly commanded, that in the
perillous Land-nauigation, no man should dare to goe a
iourney, except at high noone, and withall, euery man should
carry a great Lanterne of wisdome, with a burning Taper
therein in the prow of his proceeding; morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with his bare knees on the ground, and hands heaued
vp to heauen, humbly beseeching the Maiesty of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing
God, to send them good successe, since that for one
to bring the Ship of his hopes into a Court, as into a safe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6615:31"/>
heauen, doth rather depend from the immediate aide and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of God, than from any humane wisdome what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>

               <head type="sub">Rag. 28. 1 Part.</head>
               <p>THE Right Reuerend Lord, <hi>Iohn de la Casa,</hi> who
(as wee wrote vnto you by our last) was with great
solemnity admitted into <hi>Parnassus,</hi> where after he
had visited these illustrious Poets, and complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the learned Princes of this Court, hee presented
his right quaint and profitable Booke of <hi>Galateo</hi> vnto <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
which his Maiestie did so highly commend, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
he strictly commanded, it should inuiolably be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
by all Nations: And at the same instant enioyned
the said Lord to compose a <hi>Galatea,</hi> since it was manifestly
knowne, that the Ladies of these moderne times, haue as
much need to be corrected in their euill and depraued man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as men. Which Edict caused great alteration in the
people subiect vnto <hi>Apollo</hi>'s dominion: For, it was neuer
possible, neither by entreaties, nor by menaces, to induce
the <hi>Marquesans</hi> to be pleased to receiue it; and they boldly
protested, that they were rather resolued to renounce their
Countrey, and forsake their children, than to leaue their most
laudable custome, to honour their Lords and Masters with
all sincerity of heart: to loue their friends with purity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:6615:32"/>

                  </gap>ing coursies, and with such
other Court-ceremonies learn'd by rote.</p>
               <p>There were also found greater difficulties among Princes,
because the most mighty Monarchie of France would neuer
subiect it selfe to the nice obseruations of the strict rules of
<hi>Galateo, Nisi si, &amp; in quantum,</hi> her owne tast and liking did
accord vnto, which (she said boldly) she would rather attend,
than on affected faire creances, which she should neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
but with a certaine outward apparence.</p>
               <p>The Soueraigne Monarchie of Spaine swore solemnely,
that she would submit her selfe vnto <hi>Galateo</hi>'s rules, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the Lord <hi>De la Casa</hi> would remoue but one Chapter
out of it, which was, that being at a Table with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
shee would not haue it counted ill manners in her, if
seeing a good morsell in her companions dish, she did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
lay hold on it, and conuey the same vpon her owne
trenchar. Moreouer shee would not be noted to be ouer-gluttonous,
if by chance shee should eat and deuoure all
her neighbours part. The Venetian Magnificoes affirmed,
that they would willingly allow of <hi>Galateo,</hi> prouided alwaies
that the Lord <hi>De la Casa</hi> would declare therein, that with all
diligence to pry into, and seek to know other mens matters,
businesses, and secrets, was no point of ill manners, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
point of State-policy.</p>
               <p>Then all the Princes of Italy applauded and embraced
<hi>Galateo,</hi> onely they said, that without being accounted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
they would bee allowed to chew on both sides.
But the Dutch mutined, and were like to cause some hurly-burly:
for they did not onely vtterly refuse to binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the Italian sobricty in drinking, but did obstinately
require, that it should be enacted and recorded in <hi>Galateo,</hi>
that the Dutchmens excessiue quaffing, and continuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drunken, and Cup-shotten, was one of the chiefest ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
could be found in men of their Nation, and one of the
first requisits that Princes and Common-wealths, for the
safety and welfare of their States, could wish for, or desire
in their Subiects, which request of theirs was by all the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6615:32"/>
learned of <hi>Parnassus</hi> reiected and impugned, as impertinent
and abominable.</p>
               <p>And therefore touching that particular of sobriety in
drinking, the Dutch were earnestly intreated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to submit themselues vnto the rules of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo,</hi>
since that by reason of their custome of immoderate bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
and so often being fox't, they were by the best Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Europe pointed at as gazing-stocks.</p>
               <p>To these obiections the Dutchmen answered stoutly, that
those sober men deserued rightly to be stiled foul drunkards,
who liuing vnder the bondage and seruitude of Princes, by
the phantasticke humour, or toyish conceit of one man,
strangely passionate and giddy headed, they were daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
vpon, oppressed, hurried, and extortioned in liues,
lands, and goods: And that those drunken Germanes should
bee reputed perfectly sober, who had the wit to vindicate
themselues; and had likewise the heart and grace to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themselues in liberty: adding moreouer, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
them bedlam fooles, who did not beleeue, that the
drunkennesse of the Germane people was the true foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and establishment of so many famous Republiks as were
now seene among them. For the safety of a State, and the
vniuersall peace of the people, depending onely on the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the ministers of Princes and Republiks, and on the
well-meaning plainnesse and sincerity of euery mans mind:
what other more precious iewell could bee desired in the
world, then continually to see in Germany by vertue of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
quaffing of Wine, to vomit forth the inwardest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
and most hidden cogitations of the minds of men.</p>
               <p>The Germanes added moreouer, that by long experience
they had plainly discouered, that they did most exquisitely
well aduise &amp; counsell their countrey, who by means of the
good store of wine that they had drunke, hauing therein
drowned all priuate interesses, and smothered all foule dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation,
which sobriety is wont to beget in others minds;
the open-hearted Dutch spake alwaies with a single free
heart, and not as the Italians, and other Nations, yea, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6615:33"/>
sobrest are commonly wont, onely with their mouth, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
full of guile and leasings.</p>
               <p>They said likewise, that so ambitiously affecting the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
name of braue men at armes, as was well knowne to
all the world, they could not with patience listen vnto the
counsels and deliberations of sober men, who are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
full of timidity, and of a vicious circumspection, vailed
with the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le of prudence; but because they would haue
them to be generous and couragious, they would not allow,
that any man should vndertake to counsell his Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fasting, but after hee had first swilled downe good store
of grape-liquor, and enflamed his heart with generosity, it
being the proper quality of good wine rather to expell timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
from the heart, than remoue iudgement from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore the Germanes with great reason,</hi> De recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliandis
inuicem inimicis, &amp; iungendis affinitatibus, &amp; adsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendis
Principibus, de pace denique ac bello, plerumque in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuijs
consuitant, tanquam nullo magis tempore ad simplices co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitationes
pateat animus, aut ad magnas incalescat.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they said, That if the Italian vicious sobriety
were introduced among the Germanes, that most faithfull
and sincere Nation, would therewithall begin to abound
with those double hearts, false minds, secret thoughts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
sleights, handy-dandy, or turne-coat spirits, fraught
with treasons, treacheries, conspiracies, and machinations,
full of vntrue and forged affections, masked with secret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
with faigned and dissembled friendship, and with all
manner of foisting, whereof those Nations that glory to be
sober are most abundant Cicilies and fruitfull Egypts, a thing
so true, that the French, who for the vnspottednesse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their free and single hearted minds, in the excellent
vertue to be euer most faithfull &amp; loyall to their Kings, haue
at all times bin most glorious and renowmed in the world,
since diuers of them haue left the most commendable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to quaffe merily, and to bee drunken after the good
Dutch fashion, haue suffered themselues to bee drawne into
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6615:33"/>
those most felonious actions that the world knowes full
well. And if that little window in a mans breast, was by
the wisest of former ages deemed a thing so necessary, and
esteemed as an vnualuable benefit vnto mankinde, because
through it a man might visibly see and view the hearts of
certaine slie cunny catching companions, who, within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most vgly deuils, imploy the vtmost of their endeauours
to bee reputed faire Angels; With what ground of good
reason can any man blame the right laudable and precious
custome to quaffe merily, and to be drunke? it being most
palpable and euident, that drinking of much wine hath the
vertue to make bodies diaphaned or transparent. For which
solid reasons, which by <hi>Apollo</hi> were both allowed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for militant, it was resolued, that concerning the
particular point of drinking moderately and soberly, the
excellent and farre renowmed Dutch Nation should not bee
subiect vnto the strict precepts of <hi>Galateo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vse of drunkennesse being among the Germanes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an artifice of the Publike, than a vice of priuate men;
It being manifestly knowne, that both in times of peace and
of warre, those nations are best aduised that doe as the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;

that the Doctors of the Lawes were greatly moued
and vexed at this iniunction, who earnestly recommended
the indemnitie of their reputation vnto his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that if they should not obtaine the fauour to haue the

which of all other people were held in so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
for they verily beleeued, that without the

for any man to say or doe any thing well or honestly. And
that by so much the more, they besought his <hi>Maiestie</hi> to

made of the indemnitie of the thrice-sacred Liberall Arts,

               <p>So that the last weeke, after the collection of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
in a generall Congregation, the vertuous concluded
to beg six graces at <hi>Apollo's</hi> hands, all which were set downe
in a note or memoriall, that should be presented to him,
when as the quaint Classis or wittie forme of the Politike-vertuous
aduertised the Congregation, that in the occasions
of begging sutes, boones, or graces from Princes for any
merit a man may pretend, it was necessarie to auoid the error
of demanding ouer many things at once, not only because
the multitude of graces which Sutors crau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and molest Princes, who commonly are easily distasted
vpon occasions to pay bonds or duties; but because hee
that beggeth pluralitie of requests, is commonly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and satisfied with the slightest and worst of them:
And therefore it would proue a wise resolution, in such
a case, to bee very earnest and circumspect for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of one onely good sute. Alwaies prouided it bee
of good worth and consequence, and which without a
note of much ingratitude may not be refused or denied by
the Prince.</p>
               <p>This aduertisement of the Polititians, was by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Vertuous, applauded, commended and followed.
Whereupon the very next day, there were sent vnto his
<hi>Maiestie</hi> the Right Excellent <hi>Bernardino Viperio,</hi> and <hi>Tiberio
Serpentino,</hi> both Aduocates for the Vniuersitie of the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

dispatched by some Princes to the Lake of

               <p>BEtweene the confines of <hi>Pindo</hi> and <hi>Libetrum,</hi> on
Monday night last, was an extraordinarie Poste
rob'd, whom certaine mighty Princes had in great
diligence dispatched towards the Lake <hi>Auerno.</hi>
And forsomuch as the Currier had no hurt done him in
his bodie; it is suspected, that the robbery hath beene
committed to none other end, than to seize on his letters, as
indeed it followed: for they onely tooke a packet from
him, which he had about him, directed to the Infernall Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6615:37"/>
                  <hi>Alecto, Thesifon</hi> and <hi>Megera,</hi> by which letters (and
truly with great scandall) it hath beene disconered, that
certaine Princes doe wage and stipend the said Furies, to
the end, that not onely among diuers Nations, but often
among the subiects of one same Prince, they may sowe and
nourish perpetuall strifes, and neuer-ending discords. And
to fill vp the measure of distastes, there was a letter found
in the said packet, of ten thousand duckats, to bee paied
them for the arrerages of six moneths past. The subiects
of those Princes, that haue written the letters, by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
haue caused them to be presented vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> to
whom they haue grieuously exclaimed, and bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that their Princes, who ought vigilantly to heed
nothing so much, as the perpetuall peace and vnanimous

all other Nations besides, should with ready money pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

And that vntill now, they neuer came to the knowledge,
how by the meere artifices, tricks, plots, and machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Princes, those diuisions, factions, grudges,
vnkindnesses, distasts, discords, and vnnaturall hatreds,
were seene so to abound among diuers Nations; and
to bee the source and root of those calamitous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mischiefes, that so much oppresse and afflict man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
               <p>All outrages, excesses, abuses, and pollutions of that

               <p>Whilst these Deputies were thus discoursing, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
that from <hi>Apollo's</hi> eyes, through the great compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of what he heard, there gushed forth abundance of
sad teares. Whereupon the by standers supposed verily,
that his <hi>Maiestie</hi> would in raging passion burst forth into
some bitter termes against those Princes, that were charged
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6615:38"/>
and accused of so hainous crimes, when thus he said: Oh
you my faithfull friends, your complaints are as grieuous,
as they be true; but know, that the enormities whereof
you complaine, proceed not so much from the bad or
waiward nature of Princes, as they are occasioned by the
turbulent humors and seditious deuises of the peeuish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who with their sicklenesse and instabilitie doe so worke,
as it is impossible to purchase and obtaine the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
peace of mankind with any other instrument, than
with sowing those discords, diuisions, seditions, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
among Nations, whereof you so much, and so
grieuously complaine: for long experience hath made
Princes to know, that the huge and vnweldie machine of
raigning securely, is all built and reared vpon the firme
foundation of equally-contributing and iustly-distributing.
And it is a thing most manifest, that the people without
Princes to sway and gouerne them, would of themselues
precipitate into more cruell seditions and bloudy quarrels,
than those, which for the publike peace, and generall good
of all, others sowe and breed among them. All mischiefs
(oh you my most beloued) very necessarie. Although
it grieuously grieueth mee to see, that the infirmitie of
those vniuersall iarrings, and discords, which now reigne
in mankinde cannot be cured with any more soueraigne

               <head>The Monarchie of Spaine is much agrieued, that
her falshoods and treacheries are discouered.</head>
               <head type="sub">Rag. 2. 3 Part.</head>
               <p>IT is not yet well knowne, whether it were by chance,
or by the malice of some Frenchmen, or (as many haue
vehemently suspected) by the machination of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is so implacable an enemy vnto the French,
some few yeares since, a fire tooke hold of the Royall Palace
of the Monarchie of France; and so great was the flame, and
so dreadfull the blaze, that the neighbouring Monarchies
entred into feareful suspition, that so huge a fire could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be quenched, but with the ruine of their states: so that
euery man, for the safety of his owne, ranne speedily to
quench the fire in an others house. The English, albeit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
enemies vnto the French, with all diligence brought
thither the waters of their <hi>Thames.</hi> The Germanes, those
of <hi>Mose</hi> and <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Venetians did in a manner empty
all their Fennes and Marishes. The prudent Dukes of Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canie,
in great haste ran with all sorts of weapons, to helpe to
extinguish that consuming flame, which wise men greatly
feared, was likely to end in an vniuersall desolation.</p>
               <p>And truely it was wondrous strange to see that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of Spaine, knowne to be so deadly an enemy vnto
the French, shee also among the chiefe friends of France la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6615:39"/>
with might and maine to extinquish that fire, at
which most men supposed, that she would rather run merily
to warme her selfe, whereat all men stood amazed, especially
when they saw, that shee with all solicitude, and externall
charity brought vnto it, not onely the waters of her golden
<hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Iberus,</hi> but also of the vast Ocean, of which when
the English and the Hollanders please, shee is absolute
Mistris.</p>
               <p>Since those Politicians sinisterly interpreting the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
charity, declared publikely, that it was a most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing in the necessities of the French, to admit the aides
of those Spaniards, who being knowne to be eternall foes,
&amp; capitall enemies vnto France, ought rather to be esteemed
the Architects of the vtter ruine of the French, than zealous
of the greatnesse and prosperitie of their kingdome: as they
who measuring all the Actions and proceedings of those
which reigne among Princes, by the onely compasse of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
interesse, doe seldome admit any manner of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, much lesse of charity towards men.</p>
               <p>And so much the more were such Polititians become abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
to most Nations, as it manifestly appeares, that the
Spaniards in their forwardnesse, diligence, and charity, to
bring water vnto that fire, did not equall onely, but exceed
whatsoeuer best friend vnto the French. And that which
increased the wonder, and that among the simpler sort, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
great reputation vnto the Monarchy of Spaine, was, that
Flanders and Austria her ancient Patrimonies, burning in a
most cruell combustion of warre, she had preferred the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and safety of the French, before the charity of her owne
preseruation.</p>
               <p>But for so much as no humane endeuour, nor store of
water was sufficient to quench the least sparkle of so fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a fire: And that notwithstanding all the diligence and
remedies that were vsed, the deuouring flames of those most
fierce and bloody ciuill warres, increasing daily more and
more, the wel-meaning and best affected simpler sort of men
began to listen vnto the Polititians aduertisements, and to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6615:40"/>
suspect, that the charity of the Spanish Monarchy was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
priuate interesse, and peculiar Spanish charity;
which made them resolue, no longer to giue credit vnto
outward apparences, but inwardly to view what matter the
Spaniards brought in their Caske, and found, that in lieu of
water to quench fire, they had filled them with pitch, tarre,
rosen, oile, and turpentine, and also with diabolicall dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to foment and increase the same. Which treachery
was likewise found to bee fauoured by certaine French Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
who more than others professing to bee charitable,
made vse both of the barrels, and of the matter lent them
by the Spaniards. Whereupon they were by the iust disdaine
of the French Monarchy presently put to death, and burnt
in the very same flames, which with so great sedition, and
treacherous infidelitie, they nourished in the heart of their
owne Countrey.</p>
               <p>And the Spaniards were not only chased from that worke,
but by sound of Trumpet publikely proclaimed to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of false hearted hypocrites. And by an especiall Edict
of the French Monarchy, all men were giuen to vnderstand,
that if euer there were any man found that would beleeue,
that any sparke of charity towards the French could lodge
in the breast of a Spaniard, he should be held, esteemed, and
reputed an egregious Gull.</p>
               <p>And that if after the first warning he should persist in his
errour, he should be tossed in a blanket, as a factious and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
fellow.</p>
               <p>It was a thing worthy of admiration to see, that so soone
as the Spaniards and the foresaid vnnaturall French gaue
ouer their worke, that fire which before was so great, that
the most iudicious doe affirme, it was in all humane reason
inextinguible, on a sudden ceased of it selfe: Whereupon
the eternall and farre renowmed <hi>Flower de Luces,</hi> whilom
so hurried and trampled vnder foot, sprung vp againe, more
gloriously flourishing and resplendent than euer they were.</p>
               <p>And France, which through the immoderate ambition
of some turbulent spirits, had most barbarously bin tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6615:40"/>
and molested more than full forty years, to the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment
of all, in the twinkling of an eye became quiet and
in peace.</p>
               <p>Whereby all the world came to know, that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
had beene the first Authors of that euer deplorable
French combustion, which they vnder most specious shewes
and pretences of Religion, and christian Charity, had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make the world beleeue that they sought to quench.
Some report that the Spanish Monarchy vpon this retired
her selfe into her royall Palace, and that for many daies, shee
would not admit any body to see her, hauing giuen her selfe
ouer vnto so great melancholy, that with floods of teares
trilling downe her blubred cheeks, shee loudly exclaimed,
that shee would much rather haue lost two of her best king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
than to see those her holy and hypocriticall pretexts
so scoft at, so derided, and so laid open to all the world,
wherewith she remembred to haue diuers times (to her infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

in stead of Muske, Ziuet, and Amber-greece: It seeming
vnto her to be depriued of her richest treasure, and to haue
lost her inexhaust mynes of gold and siluer in Peru, yea, and
of the new world besides, seeing her selfe so vnluckily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of the hope and benefit, to be at any time more able
to depaint vnto the silly credulous people, white for blacke,
or chalke for cheese; deeming it a very hard case to see her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
brought vnto the wretched and dreadfull condition, in
which she hath euer seene the French, to be inforced to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
kingdomes and dominions with the onely force of the
point and dint of the Sword; and not as heretofore she hath
done with the onely semblances of her false-holy pretexts,
which haue sometimes stood her in stead of flourishing and
strong Armies. She knowes that she hath put the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
combustion, and hath euer loued to fish in troubled
waters.</p>
               <p>And it grieueth her beyond measure, that she hath so lost
the good opinion of most Nations, that shee is in some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that none will hereafter beleeue her though she chance

which solemnity (for some vrgent occasions) was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
but two daies since.</p>
               <p>The reason is, because she hath spent the full time of foure

as also in agreeing about the manner how to receiue

               <p>The consideration whereof hath made all the vertuous of

hard condition of these moderne times, infected with the
contagion of so many complemental vanities. And the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances
of the vertuous were so much the more increased,
for so much as diuers learned Princes openly refused to bee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6615:41"/>

               <p>And although that so potent a Monarchie (to the great
admiration of all) hath shewed her selfe much more nigardly,
in giuing others satisfaction of Titles, than in distributing

these Poet Princes, and from all vertuous Potentates (who

and all his ceremonials, since hee seemed not to know, how

               <p>But he accidents of matters, and secrets of State, affirme
most assuredly, that she cannot grow much greater. And
that in her tendrest yeares shee is sprung vp vnto that height
of bodie, vnto which shee may in any long time attaine:
which is euidently perceiued by this infallible argument,
that in these daies, shee groweth but halfe an inch with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficultie than in former times she did two handfull.</p>
               <p>This potent Lady is of so swarthy an hue, that shee
drawes neere vnto the Moore or Affrican.</p>
               <p>And therefore are her comporiments rather disdainfull
and proud, than serious and graue and in all her actions she
sheweth her selfe more cruell than seuere. And for as much
as she could yet neuer learne the Art so necessary vnto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6615:42"/>
to pardon, it is the vndoubted opinion of many, that
it will proue some hindrance to her greatnesse: for glorying
in nothing more, than to be called the Doctoresse of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in the Science to be implacably-resolute, in knowing
how to cut off the tops of those haughtie and luxurian Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
which in the gardens of her States doe proudly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top
others, she greatly reioyceth that it be said, how in this
Art, she hath excelled that great <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> that was the first
inuentor of so mysterious a secret.</p>
               <p>She being then so hardie and resolute in committing of
seuerities, she is much perplexed in conferring of fauours,
which are seldome seene to proceed from her. And those
few that she bestoweth come from her with such an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
haughtinesse, that they are not very acceptable. And
yet in exterior semblance shee is all affabilitie, and wholly
spends herselfe in complements. But he that with the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
of State-policie can prie into the inmost of her heart,
shall easily perceiue, that shee is all Pride, all Auarice, all
Crueltie. So that all they that haue any long time treated or
negotiated with her, report, that none receiue from any
other Princes more milde-honied words, and more bitter
deeds. Whence it is, that as a friend she doth greatly allure
men, and as a mistris much insult vpon, and terrifie them.</p>
               <p>Her hands are beyond all due proportion long, which
shee extendeth farre and neere, as occasions serue, without
distinguishing of friends from foes, or stranger from kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Her nailes are like an Harpies, and most griping. Her
fingers are of so hard and fast-hold, that what once comes
into her clutches, shee neuer lets goe againe. Her eyes are
blacke, and a most sharpe piercing sight. Her looke is squint,
with which wishly beholding one, she fixedly looketh vpon
another.</p>
               <p>A thing of great danger vnto Princes; for of late daies,
hauing bent her face towards <hi>Algiers,</hi> no man suspecting it,
she had earnestly fixed her looke towards <hi>Marseilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her eyes is plainly discouered a most greedy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiate
desire, since that there is nothing that shee fixeth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6615:43"/>
them vpon, but shee most greedily wisheth and coueteth
the same with all her heart, and that's the reason, that our
obseruing Speculants say, that this Queene doth immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
thirst after others goods, and that as yet she neuer had
friend, but with her tricks, and wilie-beguilies, she hath in
the end made her slaue.</p>
               <p>All which things discouer plainly vnto the world, that
she is rather fit to gouerne slaues than free men. For there
is no other Princesse whatsoeuer, that more ambitiously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to ingrosse and forestall all seruice into her hands,
not onely from her owne subiects, but from her best friends.</p>
               <p>She obserues so punctuall a forme of State, that she doth
not so much as vouchsafe to goe meet good occasions, which
infinite times haue sought her in her owne house.</p>
               <p>She farre excelleth all other Queenes, both present and
past in knowing, how vnder her rich robe of cloth of gold
to paliate her priuate interesse, be it neuer so diabolicall.</p>
               <p>And although she be daily seene to commit most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
actions, she makes no greater ostentation of any thing
than of her conscience; whereby the <hi>French,</hi> who vnder
colour of her holy and religious pretexts, haue so often
beene ouer-reached, haue at last (to their no small cost)
learn'd to arme themselues, and to get on horsebacke, when
with a Crowne in her hand, they see her propose, or treat
affaires full of religious pretexts, and sacred charitie, towards
her best beloued neighbours.</p>
               <p>She is so cunning in the exercise of riding, that she hath
not onely successefully tamed and broken the generous
Coursers of <hi>Naples,</hi> but also the rough and skittish Mules
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which by a naturall instinct are wont to kick, to
whinze, and bite at all men.</p>
               <p>She is of all other Queenes of so mistrustfull a <hi>Genius,</hi>
that, except her owne Nation, she hath declared all others
(though subiect vnto her) to be of no confidence, albeit she
haue diuers times, and in all occasions found them right
trustie and faithfull; which point is so preiudiciall vnto
her, that the most skilfull in the worlds affaires, doe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6615:43"/>
conclude, that by reason of this one most important
defect, it is impossible she should grow bigger. The reason
is, because there is no other Queene, that careth lesse to be
beloued of her people, than she, and that endeuoureth more
to be feared.</p>
               <p>And therefore doe our Polititians note this in her as a
kinde of notorious follie, that shee confidently beleeueth,
that with misusing and hurring all men, shee shall induce
them to adore her, and with such hatefull deportments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
all Nations to serue her: For the great store of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
is the forcible Adamant, which violently attracts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it the mindes of some, who vtterly abhorring her, are
bound to seeke, and by all meanes procure her declination.</p>
               <p>She is most curious and accurate in matters of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereas in weighty and important affaires, no other
Queene hath more easily suffered herselfe to be supplanted
and ouer-reached.</p>
               <p>In her discourses, and in resoluing of most important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses,
she sheweth admirable wisdome, and circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but whether it be through her naturall tarditie, or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of her officers, who are all most greedy merchants of
great negotiations; or because she is of opinion, that no
resolution is done with <hi>decorum,</hi> that is not long a doing,
and with tedious delayes expected of all men.</p>
               <p>Shee executeth her determined resolutions with such
slownesse, that the face of affaires changing with the times,
her resolutions determined with great wisdome, doe often
proue vnhappy.</p>
               <p>And therefore doe all conclude, that shee is more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in the skill of plotting machinations, than in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
how to manage Armes, in which she sheweth to haue
an vndanted heart, a resolute constancie, and an vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sufferance of all crosses and inconueniences; but so
weake in resolutions, that her extraordinarie circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath many times the semblance of timiditie. Whence
it followeth, that shee seemeth more apt to maintaine States,
than to acquire them. Diuers notable men laugh at her, to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6615:44"/>
see her addresse and gouerne all her actions by the compasse
of certaine solid and mature Counsels, without euer refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them into the hands of that Fate or Chance, which
hath so greatly fauoured the <hi>French,</hi> and yeelded them
so glorious, when in their actions and managements, they
haue gouerned themselues with much valour and little
braine.</p>
               <p>There be some that thinke this hapneth, onely because
she is as sparing of her owne bloud, as she is thirstie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiate
of other mens. And therefore doe the expertest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of warre mocke and gibe at her, to see her aspire at the
Empirie of the whole Vniuerse without euer fighting.</p>
               <p>The reason whereof is, because this most potent Queene,
being of long time accustomed to purchase great Estates
by Alliances and Mariages, she abhorreth the dreadfull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the <hi>French,</hi> to conquer kingdoms with the price
and hazard of their owne dearest bloud.</p>
               <p>She being then more wittily-warie than boldly couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
it followeth, that she is more mischieuous vnto her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in times of peace, than warre: whence it is, that the
<hi>French,</hi> who hitherto haue liued with her in a supine or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
carelesnesse, after so many calamities endured, haue at
last learnt to double the barres of their doores, when they
haue concluded peace with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is most carelesse and lauish of her owne riches, but
so greedy of other mens, that shee careth not to desolate
her Patrimoniall Estates, so shee may make conquest of
others.</p>
               <p>She is of so secret and hidden thoughts, and of a minde
so abstruse and vnsearchable, that there is no wit, artifice, or
skill of man able to looke into her drifts. Nay, <hi>Linx</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his through-piercing sight, cannot penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, no not so much as the outside of them: whereas
men of a glimmering or short sight, may plainly see into the
very bowels of the <hi>French</hi> and other Nations.</p>
               <p>For he that shall with with iudgement goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the <hi>Genius</hi> and customes of so great a Princesse, must
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6615:44"/>
confidently beleeue, that in all the managements she hath
in hand, and in all the affaires that others negotiate with
her, shee is inwardly cleane contrary to that shee appeareth
without.</p>
               <p>And although that among the foresaid vertues, shee be
full fraught with so enormous vices, notwithstanding by
reason of her prodigious fortune, all of them are interpreted
and admired in her as vertues, whence it followeth, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
great Princes take it as an honour to imitate her in her
vices.</p>
               <p>She is of a most sturdie and robust complexion, whereby
all iudge her to be long-liued.</p>
               <p>She onely languisheth of the indisposition, to haue her
limbs much distracted, which doth much debilitate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of so huge a bulke.</p>
               <p>And although that with the helpe of the libertie of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi>
and of the alliance shee hath with the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi>
shee vseth diuers meanes and artifices to contract them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
by reason of the diuersitie of the interesses of
these Potentates, she makes no great vse of them.</p>
               <p>This mighty Princesse receiueth no greater damage
from any, than from her chiefe Spanish Officers, whom
alone she imployeth in great charges, all which are by them
exercised with such, and intolerable surquedrie, as they
will not onely be honoured as men, but adored as Gods.
An impertinencie so great, as it hath stirred vp a loathing,
and nastinesse of the Spanish Dominion, not onely in the
Italians, and in the Flemmings, but in the Spaniards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>One thing hath caused great wonderment in all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
so potent a Queene, which is, that her whole bodie is
full of horse leeches (for the most part of <hi>Genoa</hi>) some of
which are so big and fat, as they appeare to be of those great
Ecles that come out of Holland, or those big Lampreis that
breed in Seuerne It is not knowne whether it be through
impotencie, or negligence, or through a destinie fatall vnto
great Princes, whose vitall bloud these noysome creatures
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6615:45"/>
seeke euermore to sucke, that shee endeuours not to shake
them off, and be freed from them.</p>
               <p>This most mighty Queene then, being entred into the
Royall Palace before <hi>Apollos</hi> Imperiall Maiestie, stretched
forth her left arme, causing her seruants to vnswathe the
same, and so naked, shewing it vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> and to the whole
sacred Colledge of the learned, she thus bespake.</p>
               <p>Imperiall Sir, and gratious father of all good letters:
This which your <hi>Maiestie</hi> seeth; yea euen this is that stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cauterie, and loathsome issue of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which the
<hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and some <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, that now
friendly faune vpon me, together with the helpe of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Virago, and transmarine Renegada made in this
mine arme, for the distrust or suspition they had of me. I
acknowledge that the Princes forenamed had iust cause to
be iealous of my power, when after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the
second, they saw <hi>France</hi> falne into the wretched calamitie
of Infant-Kings, and that I, in their minoritie, sought to
sowe discords in that goodly kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now that these suspitions are vanished, and that (ay me,
why doe I not blush to speake it?) the contention, which
I haue had with the <hi>French,</hi> and particularly with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted
limbe of the Deuill, the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> is now
ended, and that I haue at last beene condemned my selfe in
all costs and charges: My humble request vnto your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi>
is, that this grieuous and fasheux cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erie be healed,
and closed vp. For most men are of opinion, that for the
infinite number of humors, that haue runne vnto it, it is now
become so festred and enraged a cankre, as I feare (which
God a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ert) it will proue the losse of my arme.</p>
               <p>I did not passe into <hi>Italie</hi> through mine owne ambition,
or vnquenchable thirst, wholly to sway the same, as mine
enemies report. It is well knowne to all the world, that I
was vntimely called thereunto, and euen haled vnto it by
the Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> themselues, to free them from the great
feare they were in of the <hi>French.</hi> And there is no man liuing
in <hi>Europe,</hi> but knowes how that in the States that I possesse
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6615:45"/>
in <hi>Italie,</hi> I imploy so large a share of my stock and free-hold,
as they rather serue to further my weaknesse, and keepe me
still oppressed. And thrice-happy were my <hi>Spanish</hi> home,
which I might ere now haue couered with tiles of pure sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and states of massie gold, had I neuer had intelligence,
or dealings with the <hi>Italian</hi> nation, so double-hearted, so
full of fallacies, so anxious of priuate interesses, and onely
good to embarke her neighbours into dangerous affaires
without bisket; and then vpon the least occasion, shake
them off, and leaue them in the lurch, or in the midst of
their greatest danger; as shee, that openly professeth the
tricke and skill to plucke creuises out of their holes with
others hands, and not with her owne.</p>
               <p>And I haue often wondred, how <hi>Italie,</hi> which (as all the
world knowes) hath suffred herselfe to be broken, sadled,
and backt, and ridden by all strange Nations, will now stand
vpon such nice punctillios of chastitie with me, who if she
but see me stirre (be it neuer so little) shee presently entreth
into suspition, that I goe about to rauish her of her honour
and liberty.</p>
               <p>And howbeit, the greatnesse wherein the kingdome of
<hi>France</hi> doth now finde it selfe, may assure <hi>Italie,</hi> and all the
forenamed Princes from the feare they haue conceiued of
my power; I am neuerthelesse (if it bee your <hi>Maiesties</hi>
pleasure) ready to giue all men good caution and surety <hi>De
non offendendo:</hi> on condition, that this to me so loathsome
and irksome issue be healed and closed vp.</p>
               <p>By the expresse appointment of his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> the cauterie
was with all diligence viewed and considered by the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
Physitians, who after long and mature consultation of
the whole Colledge of them, they vnanimously concluded,
that it most euidently appearing, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy
is continually troubled with an vncessant thirst, to sway and
dominere, she stands in need of that running issue, by which
those grosse and peccant humors, which from <hi>Peru</hi> distill
into her stomacke, may be purged and euacuated; for they
are the cause of her vnquenchable and hydropicall thirst.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:6615:46"/>
Those excellent Physitians did likewise consider, that if
the said Monarchie had not that Cauterie, there were most
euident danger, that the pernicious humors of <hi>Peru,</hi> might
ascend into the head of <hi>Italie,</hi> to the manifest ruine of
those principall members, which yet are left sound in her;
and that the said Monarchie of <hi>Spaine</hi> might easily fall into
an incurable Dropsie of an vniuersall Monarchie; against
which dangerous inconueniences they affirmed, there is
good prouision made with the Cauterie of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
which ought to be kept open, so long as <hi>Peru</hi> (so stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a member) doth subminister those pernicious humors
vnto the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchie. This resolution did mightily
displease her, wherefore in great passion and perturbation of
minde, thus she brake forth: Sir, if through the spight and
malignitie of others, I must so fouly languish and consume
my selfe in continuall prouiding and applying vnguent for
this corroding cankre, which mine enemies call a Diuertiue
Font<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and plaisters vnto it.</p>
               <p>Her quip was presently vnderstood by the <hi>English,</hi> by the
<hi>French,</hi> and by the <hi>Italians,</hi> who replied, that they nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
nor doubted of any thing; since they sent nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Low Countries, but the garbage, the offals, the filths
and sweepings of their States; whereas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did
there waste pure gold and consume vitall bloud. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
both the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Germanes,</hi> to

of my wit, by the mighty vertue of my coyne, and by the

sow so infinite seditions, and raised so turbalent warres in the

               <p>After so dolefull an answer, the Spanish Monarchie, full
of spight and anguish came forth of the Temple, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with amazement when shee saw the Monarchy of
France present her selfe before her, whom (hauing first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with some ordinary complements) shee tooke by
the hand, drew her apart, and friendly imparted vnto her the
answer that the Oracle had giuen her.</p>
               <p>And how the vniuersall Monarchie was by diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
like to return vnto the Italian nation; which thing
succeeding, France should finde and feele new <hi>Iulius Caesars,</hi>
as Spaine second <hi>Scipioes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that to secure and settle their affaires, shee thought
there was no better way than to share and diuide Italy equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betweene them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer she offered to teach her the secret that she most
successefully had experimented in the Indies, by vertue of
which, they might both assure themselues of the Italian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in such sort as there should no memorie be left in the
world of so wicked a race of men but the bare name. Vnto
whom the French Monarchie framed this answer;</p>
               <p>Oh Spaine, first suffer me to forget that most vnfortunate
diuision of the Kingdome of Naples, which my King <hi>Lewis</hi>
the twelfth made with thee, and then we will confer of this
matter. For, know Spaine, it is not so easie a thing to consen
and iniurie the French the second time, as I see you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
your selfe.</p>
               <p>Then as touching the secret you propose vnto mee, how
wee may assure our selues of the Italians, I pray you doe you
attempt it and put the same in execution, since to desart and
desolate the world of people (as you haue done and practised
in the Indies) and to dominere ouer a bare land void of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
is a certaine politicke precept that is not found
in the Register of the French reason of State. For, I haue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6615:48"/>
(and that to mine owne cost) learnt to bee contented with a
little so it be good.</p>
               <p>And therefore doe I found my greatnesse more on the
multitude of good subiects, than on the wide extent of a
Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And so that my French Nation may liue at ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
in this world, I am well pleased to admit of other
Nations therein.</p>
               <p>The negotiation of the concord of Italy is long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and you know by good experience, that purges giuen
to assure a man from a disease he feareth, do many times ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
the same.</p>
               <p>I will not omit with the Genuine liberty, that is proper
to my nature, confidently to tell you, how that the enterprize
to subdue all Italy, is not so easie a taske as I perceiue you
apprehend to your selfe. For, when I had such toyes in my
head, which to me proued most pernicious, and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
will proue no better to you, I thought as you thinke
now: and I haue manifestly discouered, that the Italians
are a kinde of creatures that are euer more warily vigilant
how to escape our hands, and who can neuer bee tamed, or
brought vnder the yoake of strangers bondage. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
as most subtle Apes, and crafty Monkies, they easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transforme themselues into the customes and fashions of
those Nations that sway them, yet doe they euer keepe fixed
in their hearts their ancient malice and hatred.</p>
               <p>They are great Merchants of their seruitude, which they
trafficke and trucke so cunningly, that if they but once put
on a paire of Breeches after the cut of <hi>Madrill,</hi> they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you to beleeue that they are become true and perfect
Spaniards; and if they weare but a great Folio ruffe of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke,
we presently thinke them to bee turned into right
French-men.</p>
               <p>But come once to the close or vpshot of any businesse
with them, they will then shew you more teeth than can be
found in fifty bundles of handsawes, or a thousand combes.</p>
               <p>And Italy doth iustly resemble those greedy and couetous
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6615:48"/>
Dames, who with the strong and sharpe lye of their blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishments
scald their vnheedy louers, but neuer let them
come to the iouissance and fruition of that which they most
desire.</p>
               <p>And therefore beleeue me (who haue to my no small cost
made tryall of it) concerning the conquest of Italy, you
shall in the end reape nothing but losse and shame.</p>

Court, could not before yesterday bee admitted to
make his publike and solemne entrance. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath bin, because that in certaine triumphant Pageants
which the Spanish Nation hath with royall magnificence
erected vnto him, there were fairely written, these words;</p>
               <p>Philippo secundo Hispaniarum; vtriusque Siciliae, &amp; India<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<hi>Regi Catholico, Italiae pacis Auctorifoelicissimo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which words, for so much as they were somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastfull
vnto most of the Italian Princes, they instantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
that they might be cancelled and blotted out, saying,
that (vpon no tearms) they would neuer acknowledge that
peace of Italy from the Spaniards, which themselues so dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with such vast summes of ready money purchased
of the Hollanders and Zelanders.</p>
               <p>This Aromaticall contestation was long debated and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uast
to and fro. And although the Italian Princes did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludingly
prooue in iudgment, that the present peace of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:6615:49"/>
Italy did not directly proceed from any well-meaning since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Spaniards, who if they might haue had their wils,
would haue enthralled the same, had not that great diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bin made to them, but ought wholly to be acknowledged
from the warres in the Low-Countries.</p>
               <p>Now in the greatest heat of this controuersie, the Queene
of Italy, with her wonted wisdome, interposing her selfe,
appeased the same, who hauing conuoked all her Princes,
she exhorted them to leaue all vaine ostentations and spungy
vauntings vnto the Spaniards, and meditating on reall and
substantiall subiects, continue to feed them with vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
smoke.</p>
               <p>The Horse-troope, both for the quality and number of
the Princes that concurred to fauour, to court, to attend, and
to serue so great a King, was the most numerous and the
most honourable that euer was seene in <hi>Parnassus.</hi> So was
this mighty King ranked among those Monarchs, which in
the world haue bin more famous for their wisdome and saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
than for their courage or valour in warre. Moreouer,
the Impresa which hee caried in his royall Standard made
all the learned of this Court to wonder, which was a faire
painted Writing-pen, by vertue of which it did euidently
appeare by the testimony of some Historians, that both in
the most potent Kingdome of France and elsewhere, where
any fit occasion had beene offered vnto him to make vse of
it, hee had caused and stirred vp more and greater ruines,
spoiles, rapines, wracks, and hauocks, than euer his Father
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift could cause or effect with the greatest part of
the Cannons of Europe.</p>
               <p>The Impresa was highly commended by the sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the vertuous: All Writers taking it for a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
vnto themselues; that a Pen in the hand of one that had
knowne how to vse it, had archieued and effected so memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and remarkable actions.</p>
               <p>This great King hath still bin most royally entertained
in <hi>Parnassus;</hi> for, euen the chiefe and most eminent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narkes
in Europe haue held it as an honourable reputation,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6615:49"/>
to be able to attend and serue him.</p>
               <p>So that euen the next day after his ingresse into this Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
being disposed to be trimmed, &amp; to commit himselfe
into the hands of a Barber, the great Queene of England
disdained not all the while to hold the Bason vnder his
Chinne.</p>
               <p>And the most renowmed martiall King of France, <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, surnamed the Great, tooke it for a matchlesse glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to himselfe to be admitted to wash his head, which hee
performed with so exquisite skill and artificiall dexterity,
as he seemed to bee borne in that exercise, and brought vp
Prentise in that trade.</p>
               <p>Although some enuious detractors haue giuen out, that
he did it without any Sope or Washing-ball, but with strong
scalding Lye alone.</p>
               <p>This mighty Monarke hath bin presented by all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

               <p>For so much as hee was informed that it was iudiciously

               <p>ON the night of the twelfth of this present, about

               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> had no sooner read the letters, but he fell into a

to trickle downe his cheeks; which was taken for a most

iudged, that the Post had brought very bad newes.</p>
               <p>Now whilest all the Court was full of all sorts of learned

the cause of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> publike sadnesse; after sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
clattrings of thunder, and infinite flashings of lightnings,
which they heard and saw, there was heard an horrible and
dreadfull voice, which said:</p>
               <p>Oh you, that inhabit the Earth; fast, macerate, and cloath
your selues with haire-cloth; sprinkle your selues with
ashes; eat your bread with teares; endeuour with humble

his infinite mercy, he will vouchsafe, to deliuer all humane-kinde,

wounding affliction that they felt in their hearts, fell downe
in a swoune, thinking verily that the <hi>West Indies</hi> had beene

intreatings and groanes besought <hi>Apollo,</hi> that hee
would daigne to impart vnto his deuout subiects, what those
mischiefes were, from which they should intreat the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

               <p>Then from the aforesaid Court of his <hi>Maiestie</hi> was heard
a second voice, which gaue all men to vnderstand, that the
dogs which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had transported into the <hi>Indies</hi>
for the safegard of their flocks of sheepe, were all become
such rauenous wolues, that in worrying and deuouring of

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:6615:51"/>
After so drearie and vnhappy tidings, all the learned in
<hi>Parnassus</hi> burst forth into wailfull cries, and lamentable
skreeks, dolefully complaining, that if the dogs, which were
placed for the guard &amp; safetie of the sheepe, became wolues,
so rauenous, as they deuoured whole flocks; vnto what
Gardians night Shepherds hereafter recommend the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and safe custodie of their sheepe?</p>
               <p>And their flocks being now destitute of the protection
of dogs, who haue alwaies beene so faithfull vnto their
Masters and Shepherds, how could it be possible, but that
the whole Genus and kinde of sheepe must needs decay and
perish through all the world, and become the most vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
creatures of all others, since they must be a prey both
to the Wolues their enemies, and to the Dogs their friends?</p>
               <p>Whilest all the Nations of <hi>Parnassus</hi> (surprised by so
great terror) were all dismaid, fainting, swouning, and
groueling on the ground, onely the <hi>Flemmings</hi> and the
people of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> were seene all dreadlesse and
vndismaid, to runne leaping vp and downe <hi>Parnassus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
all men to pull vp a good heart, to be of good

which by an vndaunted resolution, and resolute

               <p>And with lond acclamation they gaue all men to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that euen in their owne Countries, those dogs and

of the <hi>Flemmish</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> flocks, were transformed into
such rauenous wolues, as with their fierce immanitie, and

this they would haue woorried the whole race and flocks of
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> if by the resentment of that bold and
couragious determination (now famous through all the

therefore, if those mischiefs should befall the old world,

of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And forsomuch as the strange and
vnseasonable houre, made the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and
other Potentates, who liue in continuall iealousie of the
greatnesse of so formidable a Princesse, to suspect some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
there was speedy search and diligent inquirie made,
to know the mysterie of so strange prouision; and whether
vnder that hay, the carts might be laden with any vnlawfull
and forbidden goods.</p>
               <p>Whereupon many Spies were set a worke about it, who
found out, and reported, that vnder the hay there were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and stowed certaine chests full of mattocks, spades,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6615:53"/>
pick-axes, and shouels. And because these are instruments
and tooles belonging to Pioners, Sappers, Diggers, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring-men,
the <hi>French</hi> presently resolued to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
And the <hi>Venetians</hi> were about to lanch their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
from out their Arsenall into the Sea; when by some
Polititians it was aduised, before they should discouer their
intention, to finde out, whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had at any
time before made prouision of such tooles or implements,
&amp; whether they expected to receiue any more else-whence.
But they were vndoubtedly assured, that before that time
they had neuer receiued any, nor did hereafter looke for
any more.</p>
               <p>The said did besides certifie vnto them, that so soone as
the said chests were vnladen, they were not caried into the
royall Armorie or common Magazin, but that all the
Grandes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the chiefe Officers of so potent a
Monarchie, did presently diuide those spades, mattocks,
scoopes, shouels, pick-axes among themselues; with which
the very next day very early they began to dig ditches, to
draw rills, to conuey riuelets, to direct gullets, to reare
banks, to frame scluses, and to fill the country with aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
and water-pipes, with such labour, paine, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
(euery man drawing all the water he could procure to
his owne mill) as they had brought all publike matters, and
the whole State to such miserie, and calamitie, that the mills
of the communitie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for want of water, could nor
goe, nor worke, nor grinde.</p>

Two weekes are now past since one of these varlets, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bin accused vnto the Magistrate, was presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
and laid vp, who by many euidences being found
foule and guilty, was laid vpon the racke, where he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all the horrible tricks, shifts, wiles, circumuentions,
masks, and detestable iuglings, that he had vsed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
not onely to induce his Master to become his slaue, but
euen to adore and worship him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> hauing read and considered the processe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement
against that monstrous villaine, fell into a strange
amazement, how those Princes (who are so greedy of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
that they often fall into moody iealousies, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
suspitions, not onely of strangers, but of their own
children) may or can (either through their owne gullish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or monstrous fraud of others) fall into that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
infamie, to become vassals, and euen slaues vnto a base
rascally seruant of theirs.</p>
               <p>And hee thought it a most portentous case, that there
should bee found both Sonnes and Nephews vnto Princes,
who to obtaine the goale, to dominere ouer their fathers, and
to Lord it ouer their Vncles, had shewed spirits full of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and minds extremely thirsty, to sway and command,
and by cunning policies, and politike mysteries, had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the garland of their desires, the very same men short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

metamorphosis, to forgoe their domination purchased
with so great care, anguish, wiles, and sweat, and make one
their superiour, that is so farre their inferiour.</p>
               <p>A wonder so rare and extrauagant, as humane wit can no

he imployed all possible industrie to prouide him with most

afterwards, vnder diuers pretexts and sundry colours, he had
industriously laboured, that all those vertuous, honest, and
honourable seruants about the Prince, whom he knew or
suspected might reclaime him vnto a debonaire and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

had blinded with false and surmised offices, places, titles,

               <p>And had in their places aduanced and substituted some of
his owne creatures, dependants and confidents, who were
all deeply plunged into all manner of carnall sensuality and

preuailed with him that their important charges and offices
were all conferred vpon men without iudgement, without
wisdome, without honesty, or without charity towards their
Princes welfare, or priuate interesse; hauing in recompence
required nothing at their hands but confidence, secrecie, and
a strict adherence to his owne affaires; by whose meanes hee
had so beset, besotted, and circumgired his Lord and Master,
that it was neuer possible afterward for truth (which as the
shadow to the body should perpetually and inseparably bee
vnited vnto a Prince) to come to his notice or eares, by the
relation of any well meaning or faithfull friend to him or,
the State.</p>
               <p>And that afterwards to the end he alone might absolutely
rule, and vncontrouledly sway the State, hee had so fairely
allured him to sloth and idlenesse, that hee brought him to
be plunged euen vp to the eyes in pleasures of Gardens, in
recreations of countrey houses, and in sports of hunting
and hauking: nay, he had so far preuailed with him, that he
abhorred as things most hatefull to heare of State-matters,
or of his proper interesses.</p>
               <p>And had besides induced him to beleeue that his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
plots and practises to make him fall out with his owne
Sonne, and other Princes of his blood, was an vnfaigned
zeale of inward loue and hearty affection towards him: a
spotlesse charity towards the publike benefit of his people:
and that by his quaint artifices and iugling trickes, hee had
brought him to be so stolide, so stupid, &amp; so gullish, that the
manifest and insolent tyranny of his base seruant (knowne
&amp; abhorred by the simplest of his state) was by the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Prince, named to be a vigilant regard to his seruice, an
easing of him from paines, a disburthening of him from
cares, and a charity towards the Common-weale; and that
sloth, idlenesse, lithernesse, and carelesse negligence was an
honourable rest and quiet repose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:6615:55"/>
And moreouer, to the end his Prince might neuer awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

laethe-sleepe, and by opening his eyes, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his owne stolidity, idiotisme, and gullishnesse, and

and commended his silly vnaptnesse to bee a matchlesse
valour: the generall hatred of his people, to be a louing and

to be right honorable labours, diligent endeuours, and
politicke gouernment. All these perfidious treacheries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confessed by that false wretch, so amazed and terrified
those Princes that heard them, that with a loud voice they
all cride out, that, to become most rigorously cruell against
so impious and wicked a villaine, with Gallows, Gibbets,
Rackes, Wheeles, Halters, Axen, Tortures, Flames, and
bloody weapons, were true and charitable piety and pitty.
And therefore they should all ioyntly become Suiters vnto

not depriue him of life; to the end there might neuer more
be found a man that durst dare to commit so hainous and
outragious villanies. And all the Princes were so moued
with the foulenesse of that enditement, as vnanimously they
all besought his Maiestie to shew some extraordinary rigors
against those, who by the fraudulent wiles and exorbitant
trickes of their seruants, suffer themselues to so vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now for so much as by this vertuous instance intimated
by those Princes vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> his Maiesties minde was so
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6615:56"/>
moued to compunction, that teares were seene to trickle
downe his cheekes, some Idiots that stood by, deemed this
to proceed from the excessiue contentation which <hi>Apollo</hi>
felt, to heare the great horrour, whereby Princes had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and fostered that vice, which his Maiesty so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
they should shun and detest. But the wisest and best of
the Vertuous that were present at that act, knew very well,
that <hi>Apollo</hi> wept and bewailed the vnhappy blindnesse of
those inebriated and infatuated Princes, who abhorring
their owne excesses in others, did most instantly require, that
those vices into which the greatest number of them were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly,
and at vnawares plunged ouer head and eares,
might with some extraordinary and rigorous seuerity be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
So mischieuous and pernicious is that reproachfull
and detestable vice in Princes to idolatrize <hi>Mignons,</hi> which
they exactly perceiuing, and extreamly blaming in others,

               <p>THE whole Race or Corporation of Sheepe haue
sent foure Ambassadors to this Court, which this

to haue a royall audience. Whereupon a great
and goodly Magistrall <hi>Ram</hi> of Lincolne-shire, in an articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
bleating voice vttered these words;</p>
               <p>That the Sheepe knew very well, that that God, who had
created all things, had vsed so great charity and impartiall
iustice towards all sorts of liuing creatures, as he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
the defects and imperfections of some with other
equiualent endowments of vse and vertue. So that in so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
a multitude of bruit Animals, there was not one that
might iustly complaine to haue in its creation receiued any
wrong at his diuine Maiesties hands.</p>
               <p>But yet it seemed vnto them that (as a step-sire) hee had
shewed great partiality onely with the Sheepe, forsomuch as
hauing created them with diuers imperfections, it did not
appeare that hee had endowed them with any equiualent
vertue by or with which they might (if not assure their state)
yet at least bee able to liue in this world with that safety and
quietnesse that other creatures did.</p>
               <p>For although his diuine Maiestie had created the Hare
with wondrous timidity, with sharpe teeth, and without a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6615:57"/>
heart to bite, he had necerthelesse endowed her with so swift
a foot as did assure her from the tushes or fangs of the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
beast.</p>
               <p>And that the Fox could not iustly find her selfe agrieued
to haue beene created slow of foot, his Maiesty hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
her with such sagacity of wit, as shee could with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
auoid the wiles, the snares or ambushes of any wild
beast. And that hee had so recompenced the slownesse of
the Wolues running with so hardy an heart, with so keene a
tooth, with so circumspect a genius, as being a terrour to all
beasts, hee makes himselfe to bee awed and respected of
men.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it euidently appeared, that his Maiesty had vsed
the same charity vnto the Fowle and birds of the aire, since
that vnto those to whom hee had denied the speedy vse of
their feet, he had in recompence giuen them larger wings,
and a swifter flight, namely to Pheasants, to Partridges, and
to Quailes, who in requitall of their short wings and traine
feathers had the nimblenesse of their feet. And that the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sheepe onely, hauing bin created with so blockish a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of wit, heartlesse, slow-footed, and without those
keen biting teeth, with which other beasts make themselues
to be awed and respected.</p>
               <p>They thought themselues forsaken and reiected by that
diuine Maiesty and charity that had manifested so great dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and louingnesse, euen vnto wild, fierce, and hurtfull
Beasts.</p>
               <p>The said goodly tall <hi>Ram</hi> added moreouer, that to fill vp
the measure of the incomparable calamity of the harmlesse
and disarmed sheepe, his Maiesty had allotted the Lions, the
Tigres, the Beares, the Wolues, (being the most cruell and
blood-thirsty Beasts that wander vpon earth) to bee their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and implacable enemies.</p>
               <p>So that it seemed that the poore Sheepe were created only
to feed and to be a prey to those enraged and furious beasts,
that know not what satiety meaneth. Hee said moreouer,
that vnto the vnsupportable iniuries which the Sheep recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6615:57"/>
daily from their enemies, were likewise added the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
and misusages which their owne Shepheards continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
heaped vpon them; all which proceeded because they
were so disarmed &amp; weaponles: For, if they might be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as but once in ten yeares, if not for reuenge, at least for
correction, vpon certaine occasions, to haue teeth allowed
them to bite certaine cruell and indiscreet Shepheards, who
milke them without charity, and sheare them without discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
peraduenture they should bee more kindly and better
dealt withall. And their Shearers, or rather Shauers, would
more gently handle their Sheares, and not hurt or teare
their skinne.</p>
               <p>And therefore the whole kinde or race of Sheepe, that
they may no longer bee the load-stone or subiect of most
wailefull oppressions, doe most instantly beseech his sacred
Maiesty, to haue long teeth and sharpe hornes granted them
to bite &amp; gore their enemies, that so they may become more
respected and better esteemed.</p>
               <p>To this rammish request <hi>Apollo</hi> answered with a blith and
chearefull countenance, that the Sheepe had made a request
suitable and worthy their silly simplicity, since they know
not how among all the foure-footed Creatures that liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, no one can be found more fauoured and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
than they; for, whereas others are with number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
cares and infinite dangers enforced to shift and sharke
for food, diuers of which are constrained to imploy the night
(ordained for sleep and rest) to feed and sustaine themselues,
as not daring to beseene by day; only for the Sheep, euen by
men (who are Lords ouer all wild beasts, and possessors of
the earth) Pastures and Fields are prouided, reserued, and
with carefulnesse and labour hired, purchased, and manured
at excessiue and deare rates.</p>
               <p>And that in darke and stormy nights, in foule weather,
and at all times, they alone were carefully prouided for, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
fed, tenderly watched, and diligently guarded in their
folds, yea, and desended from their hurtfull foes. And
whereas other creatures were continually hunted, chased,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6615:58"/>
and pursued by many sorts of other rauenous wilde beasts,
and entrapped by the wiles and deuises of men; for whose
destruction infinite people apply themselues to nothing
more than to weaue nets, to frame toiles, to lay springes, to
set traps, to hide ginnes, to dig pit-falls, and to breed, to
teach, and to feed dogs.</p>
               <p>Onely the Sheepe by an especiall grace and prerogatiue,
enioyed the noble priuiledge, to haue men labour so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
for them, and to shield them from so infinit dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and that the Creator of this vniuerse had made demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of especiall predilection towards the whole race of
Sheepe, who in lieu of rauenous teeth, goring hornes, and
swift legs, had graciously granted them the powerfull and
subduing weapons of rich wooll, of nourishing milke, of
dainty cheese, and of diuers other sorts of vnualuable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with which they so forestalled and possessed the loue
of men, that for the endeared charity that they beare to all
Sheepe, they vncessantly hunt, chase, pursue, and destroy
Wolues, Tigres, Beares, Foxes, Lions, and all other wild
and rauenous beasts, which loue not Sheepe, with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of armes, rapine, or bloody cruelty.</p>
               <p>And how by reason of the singular gifts and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefits that Sheepe bring to all mankinde, being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the onely deliciousnesse, delight, and wealth of man, it
came to passe that they were the most numerous race or kind
of creatures that liue vpon the earth; so that the Sheepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nourished, fed, cherished, guarded and defended by the
vigilancy, care, cost, paines, &amp; charity of their Shepheards,
they shewed themselues very simple and foolish in desiring
to haue deuouring sharpe teeth, and long goring hornes.
And at last <hi>Apollo</hi> said, That concerning the seuerity of some
Shepheards in milking and shearing of them, they ought
to vse no other weapons to reuenge themselues, than those
of dutifull obedience and humility, with yeelding them
store of wooll, plenty of milke, abundance of cheese; and

(according to her terrible genius, borne vnto insolencies)
dared to presume to preceed <hi>Reputation,</hi> who, if in that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

affront.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:6615:59"/>
She was neuerthelesse much offended at the foule petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
offered her by her capitall enemy, whereupon the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
euer much deuoted vnto so excelse a Princesse, ceased
not to encourage her, exhorting her by no meanes to pocket
vp the insolency of her temerity. And moreouer, bade her
to remember, that she was the right arme of all Potentates,
and the sole instrument wherwith Princes Lorded and
swaied the world. And therefore willed her to pull vp a
good heart, and resolue to confront that fondly rash Dame,
whom with the only Maiesty of her countenance she would
at the first encounter so daunt and abate her pride, that (as a
thousand times it had come to passe) shee might with great
facility suppresse and bring vnder.</p>
               <p>With wondrous reposednesse of minde, and gentle words,
Reputation answered those vertuous men her louing friends
who so comforted her, that shee exceedingly valued and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the ready good will, which she perceiued in them all;
but she could neither commend nor follow the counsell they
gaue her. And that they should call to minde, that the whole
of the power of her authoritie and greatnesse being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
not on the forces of strong-armed Armies, nor on the
strength and securitie of inexpugnable cittadels, but on the
bare opinion of men; a thing most inconstant and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So as it behoued her, in this her aduersitie, to proceed
with great caution, and admirable dexteritie. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
her, and Force, there was a monstrous great dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
for if Force were once vanquished, shee might easily
recouer her selfe, and with greater impetuofitie attempt a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
battell, so much the more dangerous for her; for to
her ordinarie power shee might ioyne the violence of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and the shame of her first ouerthrow. But if it should
happen, that at the first shock shee did not quell her enemy,
either with the maiestie of her presence, or with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of her looke, so that as an Elephant, which being once
fallen to the gound can neuer rise againe, she might destroy
her, shee should wholly be depriued of that greatnesse and
awfull respect, which the publike veneration of the common
people bred in her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:6615:59"/>
Considerations so much the more necessarie in her, as
she had experienced, that nothing is more perillous for her,
than by force of Armes to seeke to maintaine that auctoritie
great, and that reputation on foot, which shee seeth to bee
founded but on the bare opinion of the vulgar popular.
And that shee hoped to prouide for the indemnitie of her
authoritie with her wonted remedies, and would with her
accustomed weapons buckle with Force, not doubting but
to conquer her.</p>
               <p>She said moreouer, that Force did now vse those extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
termes of insolencie towards her, not because her
power was any whit increased, but by reason of some disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of hers, shee perceiued the ancient decorum, her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
maiestie, and the peoples veneration towards her to be
greatly diminished.</p>
               <p>Reputation hauing vttered these kinde words, went away,
and shortly after retired her selfe into her lodging; whence
for diuers moneths space shee was neuer seene to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but with great seueritie gaue her selfe to reforme and
correct her selfe, for euer banishing all self-respects and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
interesses; to which, because shee had yeelded ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
and too openly abandoned her selfe, shee euidently
perceiued her honour and credit to be much impaired. And
then with the beesom of a rigid reformation in her selfe, she
wholly imployd her time in cleansing her house and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

from all manner of filthinesse, pollution, and basenesse;
from which she also chased and expelled griping Auarice,
daring Ambition, and all other priuate, dishonest, vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or scandalous passions.</p>
               <p>This Princesse hauing thus reformed her priuate disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
being one morning to be present at some solemne and
publike Act, she extraordinarily embellished and adorned
her selfe all ouer with honestie of minde, with vprightnesse

a grauitie, where shee was expected by all the other most
excellent Vertues, in whom shee stirred vp so great respect,
and regardfull veneration, that euen the Lady Force her

whereunto many ambitious Princes haue since in vaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
it hath beene a generall receiued opinion, That that
Potentate, who in State and Forces is suffered to grow vnto
such greatnesse, that he findeth no other Prince able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyze

after it became Commander ouer <hi>Italy,</hi> cannot possibly bee

Whereupon those Empires and Kingdomes, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
framed out of the pieces of the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi>
to auoyd those calamities and dissolutions, which fell vpon
such Potentates as were oppressed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, out
of most wholesome, and almost diuine counsell agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that euery fifteenth yeare, all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>
should assemble into one place; where each ones Forces
should be seuerally weighed; and thereupon fit counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyze,
and due mortification be giuen vnto him, that was
found to be growen to any greatnesse, which might be odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and dangerous to his Competitor.</p>
               <p>Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that
honourable charge of gouerning the Scales; but for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeres past or thereabout, they were managed by the

the Great. Which prerogatiue, although to many it seemed

of the Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> euen ballanced, yet with a
maruellous consent of all the Historians the gouernment of
the Scales was giuen into the hands of Signior <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
The first day of <hi>August,</hi> then all the Princes and Potentates
of <hi>Europe,</hi> assembled in <hi>Phocis,</hi> not onely to meet with so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a businesse as the perfect knowledge of their owne
affaires, but that also of others, which in matter of State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
much more. Whereupon by an ancient and just
prerogatiue, the first that came to be weighed, was the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall
Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Apostolike Sea;</hi> whose temporall
State was put into the Scale; and because the weight of the
last fifteenth yeere was but sixe Millions of pounds, and now
was found to amount vnto seuen and an halfe, euery
one knew, that the addition of the noble Duchy of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
had caused that increase. The next that was put into the
Scale, was the State of the seuen Princes <hi>Electors</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

that lusty complexion, which made it euermore redoubted,
was so spoyled, that it fell into those dangerous and foule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
which after a long Quartane, found end in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticke
Feuer, that hath now so consumed it, as our age behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it left with nothing but very skinne and bone. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
though it be so much decreased in State, yet the great
bulke it hath of body, maketh it in shew very goodly to look
vpon; the rather, because the intrinsecall imperfections are
not discouered: for many good persons with the ancient
Titles of the Empire, and Maiesticall name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> haue
beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to
be weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not
being so light, as the name of a Prince without authority is
vaine: whence it is that the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> proued so weake,
as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peeres of
<hi>France</hi> brought vnto the Scale the flourishing and warlike
<hi>French Monarchy;</hi> a square of fiue hundreth and fifty miles
euery way, replenished with an infinite Noblesse, armed on
horsebacke, which not onely maintaineth peace at home, but
maketh so great a King formidable to all the Nations of the
earth; besides a world of learned men which adorne it; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
and Trades which enrich it; Tillage and Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
which make it plentifull, and abounding with euery
good thing. The ancient weight of so famous a <hi>Monarchy</hi>
was twenty Millions of pounds; but in the last fifteenth
yeeres weight, by reason of the horrible calamities, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(by the disloyalty of some of her Barons) she was thrown,
it did not arriue to twelue Millions; howbeit, now it not
onely equalled, but went farre beyond the weight of the best
ancient times; for it came to fiue and twenty Millions; a
matter of such maruel to euery one, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got on
their Spectacles, and very narrowly obserued, whether the
Weights were right or no.</p>
               <p>To the ancient Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> was added the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6615:64"/>
of <hi>Bresse</hi> giuen vp by the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> which in
regard it was so aduantagious to the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the weight of it aboue a Million. Next were the many
Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine</hi> put into the Scale by the <hi>Spanish
Grandes,</hi> and to the great wonder of those ancient men, that
could remember, how an hundreth and twenty yeares since,
they were held in a poore and vile account, the weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to twenty Millions. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> remained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well satisfied with this weight of their <hi>Spaine:</hi> and
assured themselues, that with the addition of so many other
States, they had besides to put into the Scale, not onely to
equall, but farre to exceed the fiue and twenty Millions of
the <hi>French Monarchy.</hi> Wherefore instantly they put into the
Scale the flourishing Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which euery one
thinking would increase the weight at least 2 Millions more,
it appeareth, that then it weighed lesse by one and an halfe: at
this strange accident the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being much amazed,
said, That either <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had vsed some fraud in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or that of necessity the Scales were not euen; because it
was a monstrous thing, that the addition of matter should
abate of the weight. Whereunto <hi>Lorenzo</hi> coldly answered;
That his Scales were euen, but that neither the <hi>Indiaes</hi> void
of Inhabitants, nor the <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> &amp; <hi>Milanese,</hi> which were
so farre distant from the Forces of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and replenished
with a people, which so vnwillingly supported the command
of strangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the loue and
multitude of subiects, the fertility and vnion of States, that
giue weight, and turne the Scale.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Spaniards added the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the scale, which in like manner abated a million of the
weight; whereat also the Spaniards were so much astonied,
that they would not put <hi>Flanders</hi> into the Scale, fearing to
receiue a greater distaste and affront. Howbeit some said, that
if they had put in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> they might haue wrought
some good effect, but not those miracles which certaine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish
tongues haue deliuered; who with the same facility
talke of milions of Crownes that the Furnace men make of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6615:65"/>
very bricke and tyle. Then came the <hi>English</hi> Lords, who
put into the Scale their Kingdome, so much redoubted for
the strength of the wonderfull situation thereof; for the
continued mountaines which compasse it about, seruing for
walls, made by the very powerfull hand of God in forme of
bulwarks, and the Ocean for most profound Dit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it a Kingdome feared, in regard of the commodity it hath
to assaile others; and the insuperable difficulties which they
shall finde that offer to attempt it. The weight of this
Kingdome was answerable to that of the last fifteenth yeare
which amounted to sixteene Millions. But the <hi>English,</hi> to
giue more weight to their Kingdome, would haue put the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the Scale when the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with drawne swords in their hands opposed themselues;
freely protesting, that they would neuer suffer their countrey
to be annexed to the kingdom of the <hi>English;</hi> for yet fresh was
the lamentable example of the miseries of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who
when she saw her Earls become Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> foolishly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
that she should command ouer the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> whereas
soone after, not <hi>Spain</hi> was sacked by the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> but <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
by the couetous and cruell <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that which
made vp their misery, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Emperour, and
King <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, by their continuall residence in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
of <hi>Flemmings</hi> became <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The vnfortunate <hi>Flemmings</hi>
by loosing their Prince, of naturall subiects, grew to bee
esteemed strangers, and men of little faith. And so <hi>Flanders,</hi>
the naturall Countrey of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Patrimony
of King <hi>Philip,</hi> became (according to the termes of modern
policy) a State of fiue States, and began to bee gouerned by
Strangers; with those iealousies, and with those oppressions
of customes, taxes, contributions, and donatiues, as begat
those bad humours, those ill satisfactions, from whence since
hath proceeded that ciuill warre, which after an vnspeakable
profusion of gold, an infinite effusion of blood, an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
losse of honour to the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> was conuerted into a
couetous merchandise of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Therefore the
<hi>Scots</hi> by such lamentable miseries haue learned, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6615:65"/>
their King, vpon any termes whatsoeuer, to abandon
the royall Seat of his ancient kingdome, for to place it in
a greater, newly fallen vnto him: in which case the <hi>Scots</hi>
should vnder their cruell enemies the <hi>English,</hi> be sure to suffer
all the calamities, which inferiour Nations are wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
at the hands of the superiour.</p>
               <p>Some that were present at this Act, report, how the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
told the King of <hi>England,</hi> that those <hi>Scots</hi> which had
spoken so arrogantly in the presence of his Maiesty, were to
be seuerely chastised; to whom the King of <hi>England</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought not to giue that counsell vnto
others, which had proued so pernitious to themselues:
and thereupon hauing commanded the stay of weighing
their Kingdome, he assured his <hi>Scots,</hi> that ere long he would
giue them all possible satisfaction.</p>
               <p>After this, the vast <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire was put into the
Scale; which the last fifteenth yeare arriued to the summe
of two and thirty Millions, but now was found to bee lesse
than sixteene; the strangnesse whereof made all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
very much to maruell; and particularly the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
who could not beleeue such a fall; whereupon they desired,
that wich more diligence it might be reweighed, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
how in that little time running betweene the first
and this second weighing, it had fallen eight hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and two pounds: whereby it was manifest, that the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Empire, heretofore so terrible to the world, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
with luxury, couetousnesse, and idlenesse, runneth
headlong to his ruine, which gaue great contentment to all
those Princes. Neuerthelesse it was obserued by some of
the wisest there present, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not so glad
of it as the rest; out of a doubt they had, that the depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Turke,</hi> would bee the exaltation of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
State. Then came the <hi>Polach</hi> Senators, and put into the
Scale their Kingdome, which in regard of the small autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the King hath there, &amp; the too much command, which
the <hi>Palatines</hi> arrogate vnto themselues, made but a poore
reckoning, for it did not amount to six millions of pounds,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6615:66"/>
whereas in times past it alwaies exceeded twelue. After them
the Signory of the Councell of <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> put into the Scale the
flourishing Estate of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Common-wealth, most
admirable for the greatnesse thereof, and opportunity of situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
fitting for all great enterprises, which went beyond
all expectation in the weight, for it came to eight Millions;
the cause whereof was said to bee the huge masse of Gold,
which those wise <hi>Senators</hi> in so long a time of peace had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together into their Treasury. Next came the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi>
the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and other free people of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
brought their Common-weals to the Scale. Howbeit the
Princes required, that they might be weighed each one seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by it selfe, wherewith the <hi>Germanes</hi> were well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so that it might be done. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hauing put the
Common-wealth of <hi>Basil</hi> into the Scale, it appeared, that
the greater part of the other Common-weales of <hi>Germany</hi>
were all so linked together, that it was impossible to separate
them one from another, which put a many of ambitious
Princes there in a sweat. Then the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> caused
his State to be put into the Scale by his noble Knights of the
<hi>Annonciata,</hi> which equalled the weight of the last fifteenth
yeere; but <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hauing added into the Scale that most
noble prerogatiue of Title, which the said Duke <hi>Charles
Emanuell</hi> enioyeth of the prime Souldier of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was
seene to aggrauate the weight a Million foure hundreth and
twenty pounds. After this, with a pompe and Maiesty
matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of <hi>Lorraine;</hi> whose
State, though little, equalled the weight of great Kingdoms;
and it was considered that it fell out to bee so by a certaine
good fortune which that Prince had, to haue his States so
happily seated, that hee could easily put the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
into grieuous difficulties, by impeaching the passage of
those succours which the Spaniards conduct thither out of
Italy, whereby he hath growne into such reputation, that
to the most offerer he selleth for ready gold the merchandise
of that his adhering: in such sort, that after he had dreyned

the holy League whatsoeuer, siding afterwards with the
<hi>French,</hi> hee knew so well how to change his coppy, that a
King of <hi>France,</hi> such as was <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the great
Duke of <hi>Toscan,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> were glad of his
alliance. And fully to make vp the <hi>Spaniards</hi> iealousie, the
famous <hi>Venetian</hi> Common-wealth drew into her pay a
Prince of that House with such affection, that if that great
Lady had not made a vow of perpetuall chastity, and her
nature (according to the custome of some <hi>Indians</hi>) had not
beene stitched vp the first day she was born by the <hi>Venetian
Signory,</hi> most iealous of her honour, it was verily beleeued
by many, that she would haue taken him to husband. It was
obserued, that the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> enuied much the felicity
of this Prince, because hee finding himselfe also seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> as the Duke
of <hi>Loraine</hi> was betweene the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> in stead of so many benefits, and so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as fell vpon the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> hee had receiued
most cruell kicks, not onely from the <hi>French,</hi> then his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> his friends, so that it was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> did now plainly see, how that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of his with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was most pernicious for him.
Then came the <hi>Otto di Balia,</hi> and put into the scale the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
State of the great Dukes of <hi>Tos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the excellent wits of the Inhabitants, perpetuall plenty,
continuall peace, and quiet security it enioyeth, answered in
weight to many Kingdomes. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> greatly reioyced,
when he saw how vpon the foundations of those Churches
and Hospitals, which he and his Predecessors in the time of
the <hi>Florentine</hi> liberty had laid in their Countrey, their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
according to the modell left them by <hi>Cosimo</hi> the
Great, had afterwards found meanes to erect strong Cytta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;
whereupon <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> to make a glorious shew of the
worth and wisdome of the Princes of his house, added into
the Scale the admirable vnderstanding of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the
Great, with the excessiue weight whereof it was so ouer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that the huge chayne whereby it hung brake in two, so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6615:67"/>
that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales so bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
was an hindrance that other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
could not be weighed; whereupon it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that comming according to the ancient custome, to lay
all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> in ballance against
the Monarchy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> out of the vniuersall weight of the
<hi>Italian</hi> Princes, each ones particular would easily appeare.
Into the midst of the great Hall then was brought an huge
and euen paire of Balance, whereinto on the one part was
put all the Kingdomes of the Monarchy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and into
the other all the Principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and it was seene that
they stood in equall ballance; a matter of great trouble to all
the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes: but whilest they continued in this ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
it was noted how the mighty <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, with
one onely louing looke which shee gaue to that Ballance,
wherein the <hi>Italian</hi> Principalities lay, made it suddenly to
turne on that side. It may not be omitted, how the <hi>Spaniards</hi>

               <p>THe famous King of <hi>Moores, Almansor,</hi> he that
many yeares together raigned in <hi>Spaine</hi> ouer the
noble Realme of <hi>Granada,</hi> met yesterday with the
Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and falling in talke with
him, after hee had for a good space obserued the chaine,
which the said Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> wore fastned about his
legge, he told him, that the manufacture thereof being <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resco,</hi>
he verily thought that he had many times seene, and
handled it somewhere else; and a little while after with a
shew of great maruell he affirmed, that he knew it well; and
how it was the very same, wherewithall both he, and the
<hi>Moorish</hi> Kings his Predecessors had for the space of seuen
hundreth yeares held many Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> in seruitude;
and therefore he earnestly intreated him, to let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
how, by whom, and when he was chained in that
manner. A very good eye, and an excellent memory hast
thou, <hi>Almansor,</hi> (answered then the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi>)
for this vnluckie chaine, which thou seest about my legge,
was brought out of <hi>Spaine</hi> by <hi>Gonsaluo Corduba,</hi> called the
great Captaine, and therefore it is very likely to be the same
thou speakest of. And now it is an hundreth yeares, since
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6615:68"/>
first I found my selfe in the miserable seruitude, wherein
thou beholdest me, and from which I know not whether
euer I shall be freed; for in regard of the mighty power,
whereunto I see the forces of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> arriued, hauing
vtterly lost all hope of assistance, that may be expected from
men, I know that my ancient liberty standeth wholly in
the powerfull hand of God, who had need to renue in me
the miracles of the Red Sea, if my deliuerance shall follow.
The yeares (replied <hi>Almansor</hi>) confront well; for a little
before the time of thy seruitude, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vndid this
my chaine from about the leg of the Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi>
wherewithall afterwards they bound thee. But let it not
displease thee, O Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> to declare vnto me,
how it could come to passe, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should make
themselues Masters of such a Kingdome as thou art, so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and so far distant from their Forces. By fraud <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mansor,</hi>
(said the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdome) did the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
get into <hi>Italy,</hi> for by open force they had neuer beene able
to make such notable acquests; and as thou saidst well, so
disproportionable to their Forces, which were so far off.
But heare, and wonder at the large and grosse conscience of
a King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in matters of State, although he vsed much
Art to seeme vnto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shalt
come vnto the knowledge of a Tragedy, according to the
rules of my Christian Religion, most wicked and cruell;
but according to the termes of moderne Policie, the most
aduised that euer any Nation represented vpon the stage of
the world. <hi>Alfonso</hi> my King, to his vtter, and my chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

mariage did my displantation take beginning) to <hi>Iohn Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazzo,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> for wife. The minoritie first, and
then the vnspeakable silly weaknesse of so infortunate a
Prince incouraged <hi>Lodouico Sforza</hi> to vsurpe the State vpon
his Nephew; <hi>Alfonso,</hi> as it behoued him, sought to hinder
that Tyrannie; whereof <hi>Lodouico</hi> being aware, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that without the ruine of my Kings, it was not possible
for him to arriue vnto the end of his most iniust desire, hee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6615:68"/>
fell into that resolution, which afterwards both to himselfe,
to me, and to all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> proued so fatall, of
drawing the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the conquest of me. My
Kings to defend themselues from such mighty enemies, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to their aide that holy soule of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
their Cousin, who shewed himselfe so kinde a kinsman,
and such a faithfull friend, that in stead of chasing away the

them, he forced them to returne full of shame, and losse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

without any scruple at all of conscience became my absolute

Peace, peace, <hi>Almansor</hi> (said then the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdom)
for after thou wert chased out of <hi>Spaine</hi> by the ambitious
<hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, the Popes vnderwent such miseries, that it
may be truly said, how with ready money they bought those
extreme calamities, wherewithall afterwards they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
for though the Sea Apostolicall were well contented
to see the <hi>Moores</hi> driuen out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet that satisfaction
was much distasted with my seruitude, which followed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
vpon it, the Popes hauing neuer had any thing in
greater feare, than that I should fall into the hands of a
mighty Prince, who might make them liue in those perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
iealousies, wherein finding themselues drowned euen
vp to the very eyes, many of them, and particularly those,
that haue a greater knowledge of things of the world, doe
not alwaies make quiet sleeps. A cleare testimonie of the
truth which I speake, was the lamentable and wicked sacke
of <hi>Rome,</hi> perpetrated by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a little after my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude;
with which ingratitude they paid the Apostolike
Sea for all they were debtors vnto it, as well for the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Tribute of <hi>Naples,</hi> as for the other succors, which
they receiued in the warre of <hi>Granada.</hi> A calamitie, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
past the termes of most grieuous miseries, hath in such
manner opened the eyes euen of men of the drowsiest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that euery one commeth clearly to know, what
it is to vnchaine the Lion out of a zeale of pietie; for the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> no sooner saw themselues freed from the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6615:69"/>
of the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> but that through the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which they shewed in desiring to command ouer the
whole Vniuerse, not onely in <hi>Italie,</hi> but throughout all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
most important iealousies of State, and most grieuous
interests of Religion discouered themselues, insomuch, that
I haue often heard it discoursed by men of most vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in affaires of the world, how peraduenture it would
haue beene lesse preiudiciall for many Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
that thou hadst raigned still in <hi>Granada,</hi> than that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
should haue passed into <hi>Italy,</hi> to acquire such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
States, as at this day they possesse there.</p>
               <p>Hereunto may be added the preiudices both publike and
priuate, which my ruine hath brought, and continually
doth bring vnto the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and more particularly
to the Popes, because the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> had no sooner
fastened this chaine about my leg, but presently they began
to aspire vnto the dominion of all <hi>Italy;</hi> and the quicklier to
arriue thereunto, they knew very excellently how to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse
themselues in the differences, which at that time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
betweene the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> about
the possession of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> wherein that top of
man, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth caried himselfe in such sort, that hee
made himselfe to bee knowne the worthy Nephew of his
Grandfather by the Mothers side: for hauing with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, chased the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
in stead of restoring the <hi>Sforzi</hi> to the State, as it was agreed
betwixt him, and the confederate Princes, with the fraud of
a thousand Turkish quarrels pickt of purpose, which he well
knew how to inuent against the <hi>Sforzi,</hi> he made himselfe
absolute Master of that so important a Dutchie. Stay, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Naples;</hi> and making a point here, (said <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>)
satisfie me in this: Seeing the noble State of <hi>Milan</hi>
was fallen into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> what hindred
them from running precipitously to the acquisition of all
<hi>Italie?</hi> and seeing thy seruitude doth manifest vnto the
world, that the aids and succours of Princes, serue more
for the benefit of him that giueth them, than for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6615:70"/>
of him that receiueth them, why would not the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Princes rather suffer, that <hi>Milan</hi> should bee vnder
the Dominion of the <hi>French,</hi> than by receiuing aide from
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> runne the danger of letting that Dutchy (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so important a member of <hi>Italy</hi>) fall into the hands, as
thou saidst it did, of the Kings of <hi>Spaine?</hi> The power of the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> (answered the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdome) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth
that remnant of Liberty which remaineth in <hi>Italy,</hi>
from the ambition of <hi>Spaine:</hi> for those glorious Kings out
of the interest of their greatnesse will not endure, that the
Dominion of all <hi>Italy</hi> should fall into the power of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, which cannot extinguish the ardent
thirst they haue of commanding, neither with the Conquest
of all the new World discouered by them, nor with so great
a part which they possesse in the old.</p>
               <p>Besides, the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, who know the great perill
(wherein they finde they are) of a dangerous and miserable
seruitude, haue so vnited themselues together, that although
they be many in number, yet make they but one Body;
and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who haue vsed, and doe vse all possible
deuices to disunite them, euidently perceiue, that they wash
a Black-Moore.</p>
               <p>But touching the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> thou must know, how
it was iudged more secure for the publike Liberty of <hi>Italie,</hi>
that that Dutchie should fall into the power of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
than that it should remaine in the hands of the <hi>French;</hi>
who for that they were ioyning to <hi>Italie,</hi> when therein they
should possesse any little part, there would haue beene mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
danger, that they would haue made themselues absolute
Lords of the whole: but in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> it would fall out
cleane contrary; for their Forces, albeit very great, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so far off, that by so long a tract of Sea, they
could with much difficultie transport out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
Forces, that were able to maintaine the acquests they had
made, not that they could be sufficient to subdue the whole.</p>
               <p>Thou speakest the truth, (said then <hi>Almansor</hi>) but goe on,
and declare vnto me the prejudices, which thy falling into
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6615:70"/>
the hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought vnto the Popes. Know
then, (replyed the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi>) that whereas before,
the Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happeneth to
be cleane otherwise; for they liue in a very great agony, lest
the Vnion of <hi>Milan</hi> with <hi>Naples</hi> should one day follow; to
which marke, they obserue, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue directed the
scope of all their thought; whereupon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose
proper nature it is to make good vse of the feare, whereinto
they see they haue put the Princes their neighbours, haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues such authority in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the most
important matters which there are handled. Moreouer, when
the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> were not Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Popes
with euery little menace of denying the inuestiture, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of my Kings, Principalities, Duchies, Earledomes, and
other great States in gift, buying their friendships also with
marriages, and many other sorts of liberalitie; but now the
feare being ceased, if the Popes will make their kinred great
with titles of important States, they must be glad to buy
them with their ready money, and the aduised Kings of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> besides the precious Gold of intreaties, which
at any hand they will bee sure shall precede for a first
payment, sell them vnto them throughly sawced. Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
interests, and grieuous disorders are these (said <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>)
which thou hast recounted vnto me; but how commeth
it that thou, Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which art the Magazine
of Silkes, the Granary of <hi>Italy,</hi> shouldest goe so ragged, and
be so leane? Seeing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that come naked out of
<hi>Spaine</hi> [answered the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi>] after they haue
been three or foure dayes in my house, will needs couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
all ouer with gold, it is no maruell if I be spoyled, to
clothe so many Raggedemuffins: besides, if thou sawest the
rapacitie of the Vice-royes, that to recouer themselues are
sent vnto me, or if thou knewest the rapines of Secretaries, of
thousand Officers, and other Courtiers, which they bring
along with them, all thirsty of my bloud, thou wouldest

and greedy swallow of so many hunger-starued wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
As for the little flesh thou seest on my backe, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
affirme, that in the booke of a certaine <hi>Florentine,</hi> who
hath giuen rules of the cruell moderne Policie, they find
written, that being a Kindome conquered, after the manner
of those horses which are kept onely for races, I ought to bee
maintained low in the flesh.</p>
               <p>I but (said <hi>Almonsor</hi> then) the <hi>Milanesi</hi> how are they

this difference is betwixt vs, that in <hi>Milan</hi> are drops, in my

which, although with great words, it hath bin often deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>The Colledge of the Learned, hearing these particulars,
said, That they much desired to haue these questions dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the speciall <hi>hypothesis,</hi> which the violence of the sword
hath vsurped ouer others States: Whether a Principalitie,
that by Armes and fraud, is forcibly taken from another
Prince, may be held by one that hath the true feare of God:
Whether that course of ruling a Kingdome, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
onely to the end to impouerish and waste it, that
so it may be gouerned without jealousie, may be practised by
one that is borne in the Christian Faith: Whether the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Reason of State</hi> to such an height, that it should tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnder feet, as at this present it doth, all Lawes diuine and
humane, be not a more detestable and execrable Idolatry,
then worshipping <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> Image, or the golden
Calfe. And lastly, the Colledge said, That then their desires
would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a
Diuine so much fearing God, that with his Writings durst
fright Princes as much from doing euill, as many others with
their great Volumes had terrified priuate men; for it seemed
a strange thing vnto them, that infinite learned Diuines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

forth one by one, the publike <hi>censor</hi> of politicall matters
should (in the presence of the sacred Colledge of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
record the disorders, which he had obserued in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of their States; whereupon those Princes were
bound either incontinently with satisfying reasons to defend
such things as were obiected against them, or else within a
Moneth to reforme them.</p>
               <p>An institution no doubt very noble and holy; for it hath
effected, that in the progresse of so many ages, since first it
was vsed, Princes haue corrected an infinitie of errours: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
knowing that they are to bee called to so strict an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
it maketh them endeauour to liue so vertuously, that
in the presence of so many Princes they neede not to blush.
Vpon the day appointed then, most of the Potentates of the
World appeared before <hi>Apollo:</hi> And Count <hi>Baldazar Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiglione</hi>
the <hi>Politicall Censor,</hi> said vnto the reuerend Lord
<hi>Giouanni dalla Casa,</hi> Nuntio for the Sea Apostolicall in this
State, which was first drawne out of the Vrne; That it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnto him a most scandalous matter, and indeed vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Greatnesse and Maiesty of the Popes, that in <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:6615:74"/>
should be seene some potent Families, vnto whom it serued
in stead of a rich patrimony to bee dependant on forraigne
Princes, not very well affected to the greatnesse of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke
Sea, which in euery occasion were apt with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of their Factions to giue the Popes much trouble; and
that he might truly say, how in all his time he had not seene
a more foule and execrable thing, than that which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did, when with the noble Charge
of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> he rewarded the cruell seditions,
and shamefull treacheries, which the Cardinall <hi>Pompeo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi>
vsed against the high Bishop <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth.
Then the Lord <hi>Giouanni</hi> demanded of the Count, how long
it was since hee had conuersed in the <hi>Romane</hi> Court; who
answering, Some seuenty yeares past: the Nuncio replyed,
that returning thither now he should find, how by reason of
the abundance of vertjuyce, which the <hi>Pompei, Fabritij, Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peri,
Ascanij</hi> of the family of <hi>Colonna;</hi> the <hi>Virginij,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more principall Barons of the House of <hi>Orsina</hi> had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
the teeth of their Nephews and Grand-children were
so set on edge, that they could hardly chaw their broth: for
the Popes which had tyed those exorbitances about their
fingers, knew so excellently how to practise the <hi>Tarquini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
precept, that they haue reduced those Poppies, which
heretofore were as high as Cedars, to the humble stature of
ridiculous dwarffes.</p>
               <p>This answere satisfied the Count, who turning to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Empire, next drawne out of the Vrne, hee said vnto
him, That the present disorders which were seene not only
in the great patrimony of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> but in all
<hi>Germany,</hi> proceeded from the negligence of the present Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Rodolphus,</hi> and therefore hee much desired, that that
Maiesty would with more care embrace the gouernment of
his so many States; remembring, that Princes, rulers of
mankind, bore vpon their shoulders the heauiest weight, and
had in their hands the most laborious worke that any the
painfullest day-labourer whatsoeuer could exercise. The <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>
was exceedingly thanked by the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire for this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6615:75"/>
aduice; whereunto with much grauity he answered, That it
was a disgrace common with all Princes, to be accused of
negligence, when scandals arose in their States, although it
notoriously appeared, that in regard they were occasioned
by the practises of more mighty enemies, they could not
possibly be auoyded by an vnderstanding Prince.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it was to be considered, That the monstrous
felicities, which the most mighty House of <hi>Austria</hi> haue had
by inheriting with their Matches, the States of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the
Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of <hi>Naples, Sicilia, Bohemia, Hungary,</hi>
and <hi>Portugall,</hi> haue giuen all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and of <hi>Europe</hi> such diobolicall jealousies, that they haue
caused both the passed and present ruines, now beheld in
their ancient patrimony: Whereunto the Emperors, which
haue raigned since <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first of famous memory,
albeit they were reputed most valorous and prudent Princes,
could neuer after apply any salue, that did not infinitely exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
the sore of the disorders of <hi>Germany,</hi> wherin had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
such abundance of malignant humours, that it might
truly be said, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
what small authority the moderne Emperors haue had
in <hi>Germany,</hi> so that it were not onely a discourtesie, but open
injustice to will one, that hath his hands fast bound behind
him to performe the acts of <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ando.</hi> Moreouer, the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Empire was to be regarded, which being electiue,
they that serued, had more authority in it, then they that
commanded. Besides the present weaknesse of the house
of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> from whom (with the seditions of
Religion) the hearts of their subiects are stollen; a theft so
important, that they may well abandon those States as lost,
wherein such dangerous seed is sowen. Whereupon the
present Emperour seeing himselfe depriued of the obedience
of his subiects, desireth euery one to reflect vpon the quality
of the Cousins, which the House of <hi>Austria</hi> hath in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
and they shall find that the people of <hi>Almaine</hi> borne for
their libertie, to secure themselues from the monstrous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of such a Family, take impious and wrongfull reuenges
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6615:75"/>
euen on those, which shal not be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seruitude of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> if for the sins of men they euer arriue to that point
of commanding ouer the World; from which (by the meere
goodnesse and mercy of God) they are put off as farre, as by
their many deuices they haue laboured to come neere it. That
also it was to be thought vpon, how the first that in <hi>Italie,</hi>
and abroad, disinherited with all kinde of irreuerence, and
disrespect, the Maiestie of the Empire, were those their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as clearely appeared by the vsurpation of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi>
and other Imperiall feudes by them possessed. All
which things, mouing dangerous humors without dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them afterwards, doe cause the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> to be cruelly scourged by most powerfull enemies,
whilest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their only menaces seeke to put
the whole world into suspition and distate. And for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
he desired all the sacred Colledge to consider, that
to the miserable sterilitie of children, which is seene in the
present Emperor, is adioyned a lamentable fertilitie of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
one of which incited by the most violent spurre of
ambition, hath not doubted at last to goe about to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
his owne House, which is ready to fall. All accidents
so vnhappy, that they would make euen <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe
seeme to the World a very foole.</p>
               <p>These replies, which to all the Assistants seemed very
weighty, satisfied the <hi>Censor,</hi> who turning him to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>French Monarchie,</hi> said vnto her; How all the <hi>Vertuous</hi>
of <hi>Parnassus</hi> much desired of her, that shee would rule the
furious, vnquiet, capricious, and exceeding impetuous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of her <hi>French,</hi> reducing them to those termes of
prudence, aduisednesse, and stayednesse of minde, which are
seene in the noble <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Nations; and how
it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdome of
<hi>France,</hi> which holdeth a first place amongst the most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Monarchies of the World, should be inhabited by
men so infinitely rash. To this aduertisement the <hi>French
Monarchie</hi> replied, That the <hi>Censor</hi> not well informed of
the interests of her Kingdome, had censured for defects the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6615:76"/>
chiefest vertues, which she loued in her <hi>French.</hi> Folly, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
vnaduisednesse, and a precipitous nature were they,
which had made her so feared, and formidable a Queene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
her <hi>French</hi> with vnspeakable alacritie and forwardnes,
would vpon the least nod of hers, expose themselues to
those perils, whereunto other Princes could not with the
rope, the cudgell, and the cruellest kinds of punishment
compell their wise, aduised, and circumspect subiects: And
that in the many warres, which she had held with most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Nations, she had learned to know, how an Armie
framed of souldiers, which had little braine, and much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
so that they are led by a valiant, and discreet Generall,
doth carry away the victorie from those people, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
more circumspection, and wisdome. This answer of
the Monarchie of <hi>France,</hi> was so much the more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of <hi>Castiglione,</hi> by how much, regarding the qualitie of
a mighty Kingdome, he knew that the <hi>French</hi> possessed all
those endowments and vertues, which were requisite in
a Nation, for to found, amplifie, and maintaine a great
Empire.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Censor</hi> turning to the powerfull Monarchie of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> said vnto her, how it was euident, nothing gaue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
satisfaction to all people in generall, but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to those which were subiect to strange Nations, than the
humanitie, and affable cariage of such as gouerned them;
whereas she sending to the gouernments of <hi>Naples, Milan,</hi>
and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> none but her owne <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they with their
ordinarie <hi>Castilian</hi> statelinesse, and insupportable <hi>Spanish</hi>
pride, without all comparison far exceeding that, which
the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> themselues either could, or would haue
vsed in those States, did so exasperate euen their good and
faithfull subiects, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominion was growne
infinitely odious: And that further, both in weighty, and
sleight affaires, hee desired more quicke expeditions from
her, seeing that by her too much delay, and perplexitie in
the deliberation of important matters, shee had lost many
faire occasions, that had presented themselues vnto her, for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6615:76"/>
the inlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of <hi>Spaine</hi> very
much thanked the <hi>Censor</hi> for the aduertisements he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
her, and in her excuse answered, how that honourable
Gentleman, which had a young wife, beyond all expression
faire, but of a disposition inclined to lasciuiousnesse, should
shew himselfe very discreet, if he desired, that a proper han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
seruant, whom he kept in his house, should be rather
extremely hated, than any whit affected by his wife: and
that vnto the delay in the resolution of her affaires, which she
knew to be vitious and preiudiciall, it lay not in her power
to giue remedie: for almighty God hauing not without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
occasions created her <hi>Spaniards</hi> wholly, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quite different in disposition from the <hi>French,</hi> whilest
they in the deliberation of businesses, were rather precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
than executiue, she in her being so slow and irresolute,
obeyed the will of God, who would haue it so.</p>
               <p>The next drawne out of the Vrne was the Monarchie of
<hi>Poland;</hi> vnto whom Count <hi>Baldasar</hi> said, How all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Europe</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d haue wished, that the present King <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismond</hi>
had vsed towards those seditious Nobles, which last
rebelled against him, some seueritie worthy so grieuous a
fault, only to the end, that by their example, other Lords
might haue beene deterred from committing the like. To
this the <hi>Polach</hi> Monarchy answered, That those chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
giuen to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State
would be commodious, haue alwaies proued in her electiue
Kingdome preiudiciall: And how that Kingdome, which
another receiueth in gift from a Nobility, in whose power
is the election of the King, cannot without euident perill
of falling from his greatnesse. be gouerned with that rigour,
which in other hereditary States is necessary; for that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
which out of an election of loue giueth another a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
if it be prouoked by the powerfull passion of hate,
knoweth also how to reassume it, in regard well-aduised Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
are wont to reserue vnto themselues those necessary
instruments, whereby vpon euery occasion of euill satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they may recall their vsed liberalitie: And that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6615:77"/>
King <hi>Sigismond</hi> being the first of his House, which had
raigned in <hi>Poland,</hi> hee was to direct the aime of all his
thoughts to no other scope so much, as by an extraordinary
indulgence to win the hearts of the Nobilitie of his State,
that so with a gratefull memory of his clemency, he might
perpetuate the succession of such a Kingdome in his Bloud.
An aduertisement most necessary for <hi>Sigismond</hi> his King, by
reason the <hi>Polachs,</hi> although their King be electiue, doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
defraud the Royall Bloud of the succession, if hee that
raigneth, can tell how to get the generall loue of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
For the <hi>Polonians</hi> being a Nation, that know not how
to liue in an absolute liberty, doe so abhor all manner of
seruitude, that that King among them (a matter common
to all electiue princes) shall be most oculatiue, and vigilant
in the matters of his State, that least seemeth either to see or
know any thing. Not only the <hi>Censor,</hi> but the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Vertuous,</hi> admitted the iustification of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi>
Monarchy for excellent.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Count turning himselfe to the vast <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Empire, said vnto him, That the cruelty which hee
vsed, onely vpon light suspitions, against his chiefest mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
was held by all the world to be a bloudy course; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a receiued opinion, that men of extraordinary valour
and merit, should not be laid hands on, but for great and
proued offences: And that when the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes did
euen iustly take away the liues of their ministers, the custome
of seizing vpon their Estates to their owne vse, and thereof
vtterly depriuing the children, did scandalize all good iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
because it seemed, that with such cruell rigour, the
Estates, rather than the faults of the delinquents, wee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after. To this so open a correction, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
answered with admirable grauity, That he was growne
to that greatnesse wherein he was seene, by the onely two
most powerfull meanes of reward without measure, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
without end: And that the sole foundation of the
quiet of euery State, being placed in the fidelity of the most
important ministers, Princes were not to seeke any thing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6615:77"/>
with more care, than with immense rewards to allure them
vnto faithfulnesse, and with infinite punishments to terrifie
them from trecheries: That those ministers which haue in
their power, the Forces, Command, and Gouernments of
States, not being able to erre, but in most important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it were the counsell of a foolish Prince, vpon suspitions
of that moment, to arraigne, accuse, and heare the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the offender; but in such a case, the Prince which
will runne no danger, ought to endeuour to surprise his
minister vpon the sudden, and to deale so securely, that the
execution of the punishment may precede euen the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it selfe: That many times it had fallen out, that he with
a sudden chastisement had preuented the consummation of
most foule treasons: Which resolution, though he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be most seuere, yet he knew it had so wrought,
that there were neuer seene in his State any Counts S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Guise, d'Aumale, du Maine,
de Mercure,</hi> and other foule monsters of disloyaltie, which,
with the shame of those Princes, that with halters, poynards,
and axes, knew not how to preuent such dangerous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
haue beene seene otherwhere: It being a rule in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State as common, as secure, That that minister, which
giueth to his Prince the least shadow of suspition of his faith,
incurreth a capitall paine, because those Captaines which
haue the care of Armies in their power, are bound, like the
wiues of Honourable personages, to liue with such puritie
of minde, that they be free not only from blame, but from
the least suspition of a blame-worthy thought. That touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the seizure of his <hi>Bashawes</hi> estates after their death, he
thought he might truly say, that the entertainments, gifts,
and wealth, wherewithall other Princes rewarded their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
in comparison of those inexhaustible riches which
he bestowed on his well-deseruing Officers, were vile, and
poore, as those Royall Treasures, which <hi>Ruften, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
Ibrahin,</hi> and infinite others left behind them after
their decease, haue fully testified: That the greatest regard
which a Prince ought to haue in rewarding his ministers,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6615:78"/>
consisteth in prouiding, that the vnmeasurable riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he bought of them infinite fidelitie, may not possibly
at any time be conuerted to the prejudice of him, that vsed
the liberalitie: That from the grieuous disorders fallen out
in the States of other Potentates, he had found it to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
most pernitious vnto Princes, that the extraordinary ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
left by a deseruing Minister, should passe vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
not hauing first deserued it (by their vertue, valour,
and fathers said fidelitie) of the Prince: That he had not out
of couetousnesse, as many misiudged, confiscated the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances
of his <hi>Bashawes,</hi> but that by the commoditie
thereof, those subiects should not be idle, and consequently
vicious, which being descended of fathers of notable valour,
gaue the Prince assured hope they would imitate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of their Progenitors: That the gate of his Treasure stood
perpetually open to the heires of his Ministers, to restore
them their fathers inheritances twice doubled, when they
with their fidelitie and valour should deserue them; and how
much the riches of men vicious, and subiect to ambition,
were apt to disturbe the peace of any Kingdome, how great
soeuer, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had
seene both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire spake in this manner, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
that the renouned <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of her head, seemed to declare, that she no way appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
those reasons: whereupon somewhat the more moued,
he said thus: Mighty Queene, my custome in seizing vpon
the estates of my <hi>Bashawes,</hi> is profitable for the greatnesse,
and quiet of my State; and in regard of the friendship that
is betwixt vs, I would to God, the same course were obserued
in your <hi>France;</hi> for you know full well, to what vse <hi>Henry</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> conuerted the exceeding riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
the liberall Kings <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
rewarded the merits of Duke <hi>Francis</hi> his father. You,
and I, and all those that raigne doe know, how the sweetest
bait that can allure men, is a Crowne, and there being no
man, which for to taste neuer so little of it, but would hold it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6615:78"/>
a great pleasure for to expose euen his life to manifest danger
of losing it, Princes ought to be most vigilant in keeping with
extremest seueritie the passages thereunto closed vp against
all men: nay, they ought to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate their affaires in such
sort, that no priuate man whatsoeuer should once hope to
taste of so sweet a thing: And I tell you freely, that if your
Duke of <hi>Guiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> had in my State but onely thought that,
which with such publike scandall he boldly put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in your Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> I would the very first day
haue giuen him that blow, whereunto your King <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, although he were incited vnto it by the greater part of
the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> could neuer be drawne, vntill the very
last houre of his shamefull disgraces, and euen at that instant,
when the sort of the <hi>French</hi> vprores was become an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vlcer; for where ambition raigneth among Nobles, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are constrained to shew themselues all seueritie, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
keeping scaffolds in readines, &amp; prepared, to punish the
seditious and rebellious; and their Treasury open, to reward
the quiet, and the loyall; that Prince being vnworthy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that hath not the vnderstanding how to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
be obeyed; neither can there be a more scandalous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seene, not met withall in a State, then that the Prince
should liue in jealousie of an Officer, which ought to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before him. But it is the propertie of you the Princes of
Christendome, making profession of Learning, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
your selues by rules of policie, to call me Barbarous, and
my secure way of proceeding, Tyrannicall, whilst in the
meane time, yee suffer your selues to be reduced by your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycall
vertues of clemencie, and gentlenesse, to shamefull
tearmes of enduring vnworthy things.</p>
               <p>It is not possible to deliuer, how much the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
offended all the <hi>Vertuous</hi> of the sacred Colledge with
his discourse, who standing vp, told him in great disdaine,
how they could proue with present reasons, that all which
he had said, were most wicked conceipts, vnworthy to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by any person that had a soule, or to be heard of men,
that made profession of honour. Whereunto the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:6615:79"/>
Empire answered, smiling, That others in the gouernment
of Kingdomes might haue regard to <hi>Vertue,</hi> and I know not
what, but for his part he would neuer be perswaded, but that
the quiet and peace of States ought to be preferred before
all other humane interests whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Censor,</hi> to cut off so odious a dispute, turning to
the great Duchie of <hi>Moscouy,</hi> said vnto him, That the most
noble perogatiue of raigning ouer people, which were louers
of Learning, and excellently <hi>Vertuous,</hi> was the second
amongst the greatnesses of a Prince: Whereas he by so ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
to bring vp his subjects in a grosse ignorance, reaped
no small blame, if not much disreputation; because euery
one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous liberall
Arts out of his State, he had onely permitted his people to
learne the benefit of writing and reading. To this Censure
the Duchie of <hi>Moscouy</hi> answered, That the dreadfull fire,
which he had obserued Learning had euer kindled in those
States, where it had been admitted, had made him resolue
not to suffer in any sort, that so scandalous a Cockle should be
sowed in his Duchie; for men being the heards of Princes,
as sheepe the flocks of priuate persons, it were extreme folly
to arme those gentle sheepe their subiects with the malice,
which Learning engraffeth into their dispositions, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto it; whereas otherwise, in regard of that harmelesse
simplicitie, wherewith Almighty God hath created them,
they may be commodiously ruled and gouerned, be they
neuer so many in number, by one Prince alone: And how
he held for infallible truth, that if the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
had been maintained by their Princes in the simplicitie
of their ancient ignorance, and withall it had been prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the pure minde of those Nations might not haue
beene contaminated with the plague of <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
learning, without all doubt they had neuer had the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with such a ruine of their old Religion, and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many Princes, that before ruled ouer those Prouinces,
to know how to frame those perfect formes of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales
in their countries, whereunto neither the wit of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:6615:79"/>
the wisedome of <hi>Plato,</hi> nor all the Philosophy of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
could euer arriue.</p>
               <p>This answere so moued the <hi>Censor,</hi> and all the sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Learned, that with threatning lookes they said,
how the reasons alledged by the Great Dutchy of <hi>Moscouy,</hi>
were open blasphemies; and it seemed the Learned were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to make good their words with deeds, when the greater
part of the mightiest Monarchies were seene to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to their weapons, for defence of the <hi>Moscouite;</hi> who
growing more audacious vpon the forward assistance of so
many Potentates, boldly said, If any one would deny, that
Learning did not infinitly disturbe the quiet, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of States; and that a prince might not with more
facilitie rule a Million of ignorants, then an hundreth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that were made to command, and not to obey, he lyed in
his throat. The <hi>Vertuous</hi> vpon this daring defiance grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
incensed, and stoutly replyed, That the <hi>Moscouite</hi>
had spoken with an insolence, worthy of an ignorant, and
how they could also proue vnto him, that men without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
were Asses and Calues with two legs.</p>
               <p>Now were they almost ready to goe together by the eares,
when the <hi>Censor</hi> cryed out, Forbeare, and carry due respect
to this place, where we are assembled to amend disorders,
and not to commit scandals; whereupon such was the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
euery one bare to the Maiestie of the <hi>Censor,</hi> that both
the Princes, and the Learned, although they were transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with anger and disdaine, became sodainely pacified.</p>
               <p>All being quiet, then the <hi>Censor</hi> said vnto the famous
<hi>Venetian</hi> Libertie, which next was drawen out of the Vrne,
That the hardest matter to be found in an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> as
she well knew, was to restraine the young Nobilitie, who
with their licentiousnesse distasting the better sort of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
had many times occasioned the ruine of most famous
Common-weales; And that he to his great griefe had heard,
how the yong Nobilitie of <hi>Venice</hi> with their proud demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had offended many honourable Citizens of that State;
who exceedingly complained, that whilest the insolency of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6615:80"/>
the Nobilitie encreased, the chastisements for it decreased;
And that therefore heremembred her, that it was a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
point in an Aristocracie, when those which were to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for that they were farre from those dangers, whereunto
such are subiect, as are to obey the humour of a Prince, be
heard to complaine, that they are oppressed by many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.
Hereunto the <hi>Venetian</hi> Libertie answered, That the
disorder recounted by the <hi>Censor</hi> was true, and withall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
but that the authoritie of commanding, was so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to pride and insolencie, that they seemed to be borne
both at one birth: And that the licenciousnesse, which the
Nobilitie of all Aristocracies vseth towards the Citizens,
was by all the greatest men, that haue discoursed of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales,
reputed a desperate cure; for although it was
most necessary, that insolencies should be restrained with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
paines, yet on the other side, an Aristocracie was to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
as much as possibly might be from publike punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Noblemen, albeit seditious; to the end that their
shamefull suffering might not be an occasion to disinherit
the whole Nobilitie it selfe of that respect which is due to
them from the people; for hauing the gouernment of the
State in their hands, the interest of the publike conseruation
thereof requireth, that they be held in highest reputation:
And although in her <hi>Venice,</hi> disobedient and insolent No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
were not seene to be so often punished, betweene the
two pillars in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> as it seemeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
desired, yet by the great Councell the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and other supremer Magistrates, that dispence the
publike Charges, those seditious Noblemen, which were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
to carry a tyrannicall minde, were cruelly afflicted
with the torment of shamefull repulses: And that many
subjects of most Noble Houses are seene in <hi>Venice,</hi> whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reputation for their demerits was maimed by Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
charged with bullets of paper; and that being struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
downe with such kind of shot, they could neuer rise
since to honours and dignities; things wherein consisteth
the life of the Noblemen of an Aristocracie: And that to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6615:80"/>
excruciate a body, a greater torture could not be deuised,
no not by <hi>Perillus</hi> himselfe, then that which once a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Venice</hi> experienced, when in a concurrence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablest
charges, he saw one yonger then himselfe passe
before him, onely because he was knowne to the Senate to be
more deseruing. <hi>Castiglione</hi> did not onely admit the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Libertie, but also did infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the circumspection and seueritie which shee vsed in
punishing her Nobilitie, vpon occasion of any demerit or
defect.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Censor</hi> said vnto the Duchy of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> That
his State being seated in the Confines of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
he was necessited with all carefulnesse to maintaine himselfe
neutrall betweene those Princes, with whom hee confined;
but in those last rumors of <hi>France,</hi> by discouering himselfe
openly to be wholly <hi>Spanish</hi> he had put, not onely his owne,
but the States of all the Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> in great trouble:
And that whilst with the bellowes of his forces he blew the
fire of the <hi>French</hi> vprores, kindled by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee ought to beleeue, that that flame was to burne vp
friends and kinred, before euer it could get to the other <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Potentates that were enemies. The Duchy of <hi>Sauoy</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the <hi>Censor</hi> very readily, That the adherence of his
last Duke to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was true, but the faire occasion hee
had of three seuens in his hand, euen forced him to set vp his
rest, hoping to encounter the most famous <hi>Primiera,</hi> that
euer any other Prince whatsoeuer had at Cards; to which
venture he was the rather carryed, because he was assured hee
could loose but that money, which at that game he had won
before: That afterwards, though by his ill lucke the fourth
Card, which was dealt him, proued to be a Coat of affront,
wherewith he had made the worst hir, that could be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
on the whole pack of Cards, neuerthelesse he knew, that
the brauest mindes would confesse, that albeit the resolution
was very dangerous, yet not to wrong the Cards, they would
haue played no otherwise themselues. The <hi>Censor</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the Metaphor, very much commended the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6615:81"/>
resolution of that Duke; who, for that hee might
from a small feauer haue receiued in gift the Empire of the
greater part of the world, not only without any note of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
but to his infinit glory, at such time as so resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he cast the Dye of all the greatnesse of his fortune vpon the
Table of Chance, he might well speake those famous words
anew, <hi>Or Caes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, or nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Censer</hi> turned him to the Noble great Dutchy
of <hi>Toscan,</hi> and sharply reprehending him, for going with
his Galleyes as it were prouoking of Waspes, hee recorded
vnto him, the misery and calamities which the Knights
of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> suffered at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that lastly they ranne at <hi>Malta,</hi> onely because they would
imprudently haue tyed squibbes to the Buls taile; And that
euerywise Christian Prince ought rather to fauour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
carelesnesse of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> then to waken them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of little profit; nay, such as brought others much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and necessite them to apply their mindes anew vnto
maritime affaires, which in these times they had euen aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
Also he remembred him, how infinite people daily
complained, for that, by his hindering <hi>Italy</hi> of the trade of
the commodities of the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vant,</hi> all drugges that came from
beyond the Seas, were growne to an excessiue rate. To this
correction the great Dutchy of <hi>Toscan</hi> answered, That the
power of a Prince could not be termed perfect, which with
a number of armed Vessels had not some Dominion on the
Sea: And that his Galleyes were not onely very necessary
for the <hi>Toscan</hi> greatnesse, but also for the securitie of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of all <hi>Italy,</hi> as seruing for a Schoole of Mariners, for a
Seminary of Captaines and Souldiers at Sea: That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the dammage, which they did to the Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,
but withall, he desired it might be considered, that
the mysterie of Warre, either by Land or by Sea, could not
be learned by Souldiers, nor exercised by Princes without
prejudice to others: And that <hi>Toscan</hi> breeding much filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of fantasticall vnquiet braines, and extrauagant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
he had therefore great occasion for those Gallies, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6615:81"/>
might serue, as it were, to carry forth all the filth of his State,
and thereby keepe it cleane, imploying such onely for Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-slaues
in them, as had done euill before, and that in regard
of their vnquiet nature, were like to doe worse after.</p>
               <p>This excuse of the Great Dutchy of <hi>Toscan</hi> was approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
both by the <hi>Censor,</hi> and all the sacred Colledge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the Count said vnto the Libertie of <hi>Geneua,</hi> who was
last drawne out of the Vrne, That the excessiue vse of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,
which shee permitted vnto her Nobilitie, caused
that great disorder of inriching the priuate, and withall of
impouerishing the publike, whose reuenues would haue risen
to huge summes of Gold, if the reall riches of her Nobilitie
had beene imployed in a iust Trade of Merchandise.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genouese</hi> Libertie with a readinesse, that gaue a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
gust to all the Learned, answered, How it was true, that
Exchanges doe worke that effect, which the <hi>Censer</hi> had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and therefore were most pernicious in any Monarchy
whatsoeuer; howbeit that notwithstanding they might bee
permitted in a well-ordered Common-wealth, without any
prejudice of the publike interests; because the richest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curest
Treasures of a free State, are the riches of the Nobility,
and Citizens together; a matter which falleth not out in a
Monarchy, where betweene the commings in of the Prince;
and the meanes of priuate men, there runneth a long wall of
eight Stories high built by <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine:</hi> Further, that in
a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly followeth
with little or no prejudice to the people, onely changing the
name of <hi>Matthew,</hi> to that of <hi>Martin;</hi> but in the subuersions
of Common-weales, where liberty is changed into seruitude,
there the proper substance of priuate men, is the publike trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for then will they profusely spend all that euer they
haue, for to defend their owne libertie euen to the last gaspe.</p>

had preferred a Complaint, how that for certaine matters

was an Edict of <hi>Apollo</hi> very rigorously obserued in <hi>Parnassus,</hi>
whereby that Prince, or priuate man, was declared to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
which durst offer any wrong to any Historian, or

it hapned, that amongst the other Princes, and Captaines,

that the Duke made a publike profession of being
the disciple, follower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and imitator of his slow, but sure way
of making warre. Howbeit, a strange and troublesome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
fell out in this visitation; for at the first meeting, the
Duke hauing giuen the Lord <hi>Prospero</hi> the Title of <hi>your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
he was so incensed with disdaine, that taking himselfe
to be highly wronged by so vile a title, with an angry voice
he said; Duke, I had thought thou wert come hither, to
honour one that is greater than thy selfe, not to vndervalue
him; but because it is the fashion of the <hi>Colonesi</hi> to answer
the iniuries of words with deeds, goe out of this house, and
in the street (with my sword in mine hand) I will proue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, that all those, which vse such base termes to men
of my ranke, deserue not to be admitted into the company
of honourable persons. The Duke remained much astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
to see that great Captaine take the matter so hainously
at his hands; and going to withstand the Lord <hi>Prospero,</hi>
who offered to thrust him out of the chamber, they fell to
grapple one with another: And because the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
which were in company with the Duke, seeing him in such
termes with <hi>Colonna,</hi> entred into the chamber to assist him,
the <hi>Italians</hi> which belonged vnto the Lord <hi>Prospero</hi> did the
like; whereupon in regard of the number of persons in so
strait a place, there ensued a cruell fray; the noise whereof
comming into the street, was the cause that the newes of so
dangerous an accident was suddenly carried to <hi>Apollo;</hi> who
in all haste dispatched thither the Regent of the <hi>Vicaria</hi> with
the guard of Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6615:84"/>
                  <hi>Prosperoes</hi> hands: and the vprore being quieted, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that had beene very ill handled, to
returne home to their houses; Thereupon the Lord <hi>Prospero,</hi>
to preuent any sinister information that might haue beene
giuen against him, presented himselfe before <hi>Apollo,</hi> vnto
whom (the same goeth) with a troubled countenance hee
vsed these words: Sir, it is well knowne, that men of the
family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> of the quality I am of, haue alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
the title of Excellencie, <hi>Antequam Abraham fieret,</hi>
and ere the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were <hi>in rerum natura;</hi> wherefore for
that Nation to abuse a man of my ranke, as the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi>
did me but now, is most insupportable; for if the vilenesse
of him that offended, doth infinitely aggrauate the iniurie
with him that is offended, how is it possible, that an <hi>Italian</hi>
Baron of my quality, should containe himselfe within the
bounds of modestie, seeing himselfe vndervalued by that
Nation, whose miseries, not aboue foure daies agoe to speake
of, so moued the whole World to compassion, that thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Churches they were recommended to the charitie
of well-disposed Christians, of whom almes were gathered,
to free them from the miserable seruitude, wherein they
were so grieuously oppressed by the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada.</hi>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> enioy the dominion of the greater part of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
where, by such as I am, notwithstanding that daily they
threaten it with a cruell, and vniuersall seruitude, they are
loued, honoured, and euen serued. With their prodigious
auarice they haue depriued vs of our wealth; and in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
sacke of <hi>Rome</hi> with their vnexpressable lust they
violated the honour of our chastest Matrons. And now, in
exchange of so abiect a patience, they would also take from
vs this little honour of breath we enioy, and these misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Titles, the vnhappy remaines, and deplorable reliques
of the <hi>Italian</hi> reputation: Which is a matter so hard to bee
digested, that by euery honourable <hi>Italian</hi> Baron it ought
to be reuenged, not with complaining words, as I doe, but
with daggers points.</p>
               <p>It is reported by them that were then present, how all the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6615:85"/>
while the Lord <hi>Prospero</hi> was speaking, <hi>Apollo</hi> did nothing
but smile, and that when vpon his conclusion he burst out
into those words, how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abuses towards the
<hi>Italians</hi> were to be reuenged with daggers points, he fell to
laughing out-right, and said, <hi>Prospero,</hi> thou art, and euer
wert too much giuen ouer to choller: and I am inforced
to tell thee, how it infinitely mislikes me, that such a one as
thou, who hast alwaies made a particular profession of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
shouldst maruell, that slaues, which for twenty yeares

Mancher, should fill their bellies till they are ready to cracke
againe: Whereas that raging appetite of theirs, and euery
other dishonest act, which they vse, to asswage their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ought to be so farre from seeming odious vnto honest
men which behold it, that it should rather moue them to
pitie. Therefore doe yee <hi>Italians</hi> likewise permit, that the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> men but new in this World, and lately got out of
the seruitude of the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> may glut themselues
with meat so delicate to their taste, as are the honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
which they haue found in <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for I assure thee, that
when they shall be cloyed with such vanities they also will
become, as the <hi>French</hi> are, such courteous Gallanes, that they
will willingly giue the Title of <hi>Excellency</hi> euen to their
horse-boyes, much more to such as thou art. And I tell thee,
that if thou hadst that prudence, and that perfect knowledge
of the World, as I wish thou haddest, thou wouldest very
well perceiue, that those exorbitances, and that so odious
manner of proceeding, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vse in <hi>Italie,</hi>
whereof thou so complainest, is euen as so much sweet su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
for you <hi>Italians,</hi> and bitter poyson for the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
who if to their valour to their aduisednesse, and vnspeakable
ambition which they haue to raigne, they had affable and
courteous manners annexed, with the vtter destruction of
that remnant of Libertie, which is yet out of the Lions

World. All which are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereunto it is not possible she can arriue with the

               <p>With this answer <hi>Apollo</hi> returned the Lord <hi>Prospero</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seemed not so blacke, as ordinarily those

interrupting the complaint which the Duke was about to

you from thence; who if they could be assured, that after
your ruine, they should not fall into the power of the <hi>French,</hi>
ye should quickly know, that only with a little disturbance,
which they could giue you in the Port of <hi>Genoua,</hi> they would
put you into a thousand intricate difficulties: all matters that
should admonish you to giue satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at least wise in words,
to them, whom in regard of your interests in <hi>Italy,</hi> yee are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

receiued from the Lord <hi>Prospero,</hi> I tell you plainly, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
affront shall be done you vpon any such like Titular
occasion, I will not only be insensible of it, but I will thinke
you haue desirously sought it. Then the Duke would haue
excused himselfe with saying, that from his King he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
how to carry himselfe towards the <hi>Italian</hi> Barons
in the particular of Titles, when <hi>Apollo</hi> told him, that the
<hi>Spanish</hi> abuses to the <hi>Italians</hi> were not to extend but only to
the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and <hi>Milanesi;</hi> and his Maiestie also added,
That if too much passion did not blind the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they
might easily see, how their <hi>Grandes,</hi> whom <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe
could not containe, and that in <hi>Italy,</hi> would play the Giants,
compared with the <hi>Romane</hi> Barons; and those of meane sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<hi>Apollo,</hi> the Priests that were about him perceiued how his

on the ground, and with the rest, the Duke and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6615:86"/>
out of that hollow cloud proceeded the diuine
voice of his Maiestie, which with a pleasing sound spake in
this sort: I foretell vnto you <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that with your
rough and odious manner of proceeding, yee will one day
compell the <hi>Italian</hi> Nobilitie, which is the Mistris of the
cruell <hi>Sicilian Vespres,</hi> to plot some bloudy <hi>Neapolitan Euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song</hi>
against you; it being the proper custome of the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
with greater rage to reuenge the abuses of words, than
the offences of blowes; as they that hauing short patience,
and long hands, are borne not only with an heart most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to great resolutions, but that doe not vse to reuenge
iniuries with all kinde of cruelty, before they are quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by those that did them. And with your owne ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
you will then finde them, with swords in their

               <p>THese Papers comming by chance into my hands,
I perceiued there was something in them that I
could not perceiue; wherefore I thought best to
communicate them with better vnderstandings; for
my part I could see no hurt in them, but did imagine by that
little good which I saw, there was much more that I could
not see, and therefore iudged them fit for all mens eyes. Yet
finding the names of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> or <hi>Austria</hi> and
<hi>Spaine,</hi> (pardon me, politicke Reader, for I am not certaine
which should haue prioritie; and I know in such Catholike
points, a little error is deadly) so often inserted, I durst not be
too bold with sacred things. For I well saw those two names
iointly considered, are now growne of such estimation, as all
Nations &amp; Kings bend their knees, &amp; doff their bonnets at
the naming of them, more superstitiously for destroying, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
reuerently at the Name of Iesus for sauing. Therefore I could
not resolue, whether it were treason or sacriledge, or I wot
not what greater sin, to touch sacred things profanely with
common and vnwasht hands; especially when I saw all such
as had done the like, or lesse then thus, made miserable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of disobedience, as if they had offended <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or a house miraculously raised vp by God, or rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
created in nature, to rule ouer all the world in <hi>Adams</hi>
stead; and that to be the son of a King, could not protect an
offendor in this kind from punishment, yea, from being cast
out of his paradise. O (thought I) when I saw this, how
worthy is he, that doth thus to be counted only the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
King: for he is a King of Kings indeed, fit to be
the executioner of his Holinesse diuine Decrees, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

all with Lightning, where the sacred fulminations
went before. Tremble all Princes, and looke to your
Crownes; especially you petty ones in <hi>Germany,</hi> that are
but fatted to be swallowed one after another, as his stomack
can digest, or your turne comes to be serued vp. You see it
is safer being his seruant, than the sonne of any Potentate
besides. Therefore striue for place and preferment there,
and helpe with all the speed yee may, to betray one another
to ruine. Your that are <hi>Protestants</hi> or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Religion; hold some the stirrop, and let others lift
<hi>Spaine</hi> into the saddle, to ride one another like Poste-horses
by turnes. You see how honourably he deales with that
Prince, whose peaceable patents made him easie entrance;
and how fauourably with the <hi>Palätinate,</hi> whom he rides in
bloud, and spur-galls on both sides, whilst you stand laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Thus I thought, and thought withall to be silent, and to
keep these papers from flying abroad, for feare of hauing my
owne wings clipt. But when I saw in defect of greater, God
had raised vp petty Princes to defend the Faith, and put
that spirit into the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> which he had taken from <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and others, it made me resume courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the immediate hand of God in this worke, and to
thinke, surely God will haue all the glory to himselfe, that
he imployes such instruments, whose estates, in comparison,
are but drops to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ocean: I will not therefore be
guilty of so much cowardise, as to reserue my selfe, where
these men fight, and seeme prodigall of their owne liues;
or at least, not of so much dishonestie, as to conceale
what God hath sent into my hands, perhaps

Colts should not be put to be tamed by knauish house brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;
and it is worth the obseruation, that in so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

disability: and on the contrary, that they had excluded those
which for the quicknesse and viuacity of their wits, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

others. And it is thought the reason was, because that wise
men, which are promoted to businesses of examinations and
trialls of wits doe firmely beleeue, that those wits which are

hauing great need themselues of a curbing-bit, and a head-straine

it being also manifest by long experience, that these by

               <p>After the Oath thus ministred, the said <hi>Salust</hi> tooke aside
the Gouernour of <hi>Libethrum,</hi> a Fauorite of his, and gaue
him these admonitions. First, to begin his Gouernment
with a kinde of carelesnesse, and to continue it with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by degrees, entring in as a Lambe, and playing the
Lyon towards the end, but alwaies generously inclined,
remembring that Principle of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus, Acribus
initiis incurioso fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that in all causes betweene the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he should doe most exact Iustice without exception of
persons: but in suits arising among the Nobler sort
hee should mingle with the rigour of Iustice the dexterity
of a wary iudgement, remembring alwayes, that the
accusations of great persons were so odious to Princes
that they laid vpon Officers Gownes an aspersion, like
the tainting spots of corrupted Oile which could neuer bee
washt away with the purest sope of innocence. Therefore
among those great spirited men, a Iudge had need with the
sword of Iustice, to imploy like a wise Fencer, the target of a
nimble wit and a cautelous care, that neither of the one side
nor of the other, he be exclaimed vpon for any distasteful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For Princes hauing cause to vse their helpe for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
force, or purses, they desire to hold them well satisfied.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6615:90"/>
And therefore in controuersies falling out among them, a
Iudge had need to learne some easie way to draw out rotten
teeth, and with the hand of dexterity to fill vp the place with
the finest Cotten wooll.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a Iudge must enforce himselfe to know all things,
but not to execute al which he knowes. <hi>Omnia scire non omnia
exequi.</hi> For to attempt needlesse and brabling matters, were
to goe about to set straight the leg of a Dog, or to lose his
braine in the Alchymie of Fooles. And in this corrupt Age it
is good counsel for an Officer to tolerate in people some stale
disorder, then with any ill satisfaction to the generalitie to
torment himselfe to seeke to bring in that, which he cannot
execute without commotions and heart-burnings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that with other Iudges and officers subiect to
the same Prince, he should not contend nor contest for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of preheminence or right, nor looke to be his owne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
or to right himselfe in his Court by vsing any strict
course with inferiour officers for matters of prerogatiue of
Courts, but either to acquaint the Prince himselfe, or to
winke at the affront, if another Court seemes to iustifie the
subiect, or els to take in hand the weapons of a gowned man,
the pen. But if the Iudges authoritie stretch to the Confines
of another Prince, hee must not seeke differences, nor auoid
them. But if they proceed from Souldiers or Pyrats, he must
defend his Borders and Iurisdiction with Armes. Yet so, that
towards all princes subiects in league and amitie with his
Prince, he behaue himselfe as temperately regardfull, as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
affected to his owne Princes honour.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that in some occasions he preferre the publicke
peace of his gouernment before that strictnesse of Iustice,
which is mentioned in Bookes.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that for any impertinent thing, which hee sees or
heares, which be not extraordinarily altered in mind or
countenance; and that if he cannot doe this, yet that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
himselfe from speaking of it, and in any case to beware
that he deliberate not, nor study for reuenge or reformation
in heat or anger, but in cold blood after a long times delay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:6615:91"/>
Seuenthly, that in supreme and waighty matters hee take
heed of making any shew of vndaunted, of a fiery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
mind, but rather that he content himselfe to hunt
Waspes and Hornets out of their holes, with the hand of the
Prince armed with the gauntlet of a higher authority; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
an Officer findes that he hath ability and power
enough to execute a greater enterprise, yet for feare of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Court, or some casuall blocke in his way, which the
wisest man could not foresee, oftentimes it is not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to put in execution all that which his authority might
warrant him.</p>
               <p>Eightly, that he deale in all ordinary matters concerning
ordinary men, entring into strict friendship with no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
within the precincts of his command, but to beware
of that wresting and wiredrawing occasions, which might
reach vnto the hatred and hindrance of another, and to
auoid domesticall familiaritie, which causeth contempt. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
let him vse that decent grauity which may procure respect
and an awfull loue. But in any case, that he shunne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
of base and riotous persons, and that he keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
for the most with men of his owne ranke, yet so, that
he make not any man so endeared and so bosome a friend
vnto him, who might afterwards by prying into his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and diuing into his secrets, turne to be his capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For sometimes contemptible persons, not suspected for
craft, may in the twinkling of an eye, of low and earth cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
mushromes, become tall Cedars at least in their owne
ouerwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning conceit.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that he force his noble nature to endure the stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
pride of Lawyers, although most odious to God and all
good men, and to beare with their impertinent discourses,
and wrangling bawling, who take vpon them to become
Lambes at home and Lyons abroad, onely to maintaine the
glory and reputation of the Bench, but commonly it is to
fill their owne purses with the ruines and spoyles of honester
men than themselues. Wherein I wish him to remember
that golden saying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that it is a most profitable, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

               </p>
               <p>Tenth, that he take heed with great circumspection he fall
not into the other extremity in seeking to auoid the defect of
his predecessor, as a certaine Prince very heedlesly did, who
perceiuing that wise men fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d fault with the late Prince for
too much lenity, turned an odious Tyrant. The golden
Meane is euer best.</p>
               <p>Eleuenth, that with extraordinary seuerity he take more
care to bridle the disorders of his own house, then the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the common people; for the immodest and vnciuill
carriage of a Magistrates domesticke gentlemen, whom some
call Countrey-Courtiers, is a farre greater blemish and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
to their Master, then the brutish insolence of rude
Clownes and ill-bred Swaines.</p>
               <p>Twelth, that he hate, as the horrour of Hell, all kind of
fore-stalling and engrossing of commodities, and that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as the Capitall enemy of his reputation such detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gaines. But specially, that diuelish gaine, which is in these
dayes much practised, and one of the chiefe causes of our
Creators anger towards many States, by the sale of Offices.
A most perillous Charybdis, a rocke so dangerous in the Sea
of worldly businesse, that Iustice being fled backe into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
these petty Chapmen, who neuer dreame of another
world but this earthly one, turne all things topsie turuy to
make themselues sauers for their dear-bought places. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a noble spirit should firmely beleeue, that the Merchandise
of a Christian is ingenuous simplicity and plain dealing, and
being honestly called to beare office in his countrey, then his
richest lucre worthy of an honourable Officer is to ingulfe
himselfe in the Trade of honour and vprightnesse of Iustice,
which being by the trumpet of Fame blowne into his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
eares in a short time, God inspiring the heart of the
Prince, he shall be preferred from Office to Office, vntill hee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6615:92"/>
arriue to a contented fortune correspondent to his Heroycall
worth and magnanimous minde.</p>
               <p>Thirteenth, that perpetually he haue his eyes fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> on his
vnder-Iudges hands, and that he looke as narrowly to them,
as if he held a biting serpent in his owne hand, that iniustice
being a very dangerous member which hazards his credit
by the Diuels temptations to blurre his masters honour by
playing the base Mechanicke in the sacred seat of Iustice.
And because no Iudge receiues bribes but sinisterly by his
wise, seruant, or without witnesse, sauing the party himselfe,
his supreme Iudge or Prince ought to proclaime rewards to
the discouerers, and vpon the least euidence to remoue such
theeues of the Deity; seeing that Iustice is one of the prime
Diuine Attributes.</p>
               <p>Fourteenth, that he accommodate his Genius &amp; Nature to
the nature of his prouincials, shewing himselfe mild to the
peaceable, and seuere to the seditious. And to take speciall
care to weed out idle persons; if they refuse conuenient labor,
which he ought to see them put vnto; and if any Drones be
found with honey, to examine them from whose hiue they
stole the same.</p>
               <p>Fifteenth, that to the end his Prince may conceiue well of
his worth, he acquaint not his highnesse with slight occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
nor trifling matters, which fall out in his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Nor yet must he refraine to certifie vnto him all the
most important affaires, chiefly, all proiects tending to his
honour or profit.</p>
               <p>Sixteenth, that he beleeue how the penalties and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the power of a wary Iudge, consists more in threats
then in inflicting of them, &amp; that he neuer forget this lesson:
How Officers gouerne men full of a thousand imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
subiect to infinite errours, how they are not Angells of
Heauen which cannot sinne; and therefore in his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hee affects more the report of a sweet natured Iudge,
like his Creatour, who bearing with our trespasses, <hi>Si quoties
peecant homines, toties sua fulmina mittat,</hi> and not the repute
of a tyrannizing Minister.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:6615:92"/>
Seuenteenth, that he frequent not Reuels, Dances, or any
publike Feasts, mournfull spectacles, and tragicall in the end
to wise Officers, as instruments, which vilifie his fame, and
bring his personall presence into contempt among the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and might bring his grauitie into question among his
equals.</p>
               <p>Eighteenth, that he know how the shamefull acts of the
Nobles and principall Gentlemen doe waxe more cruell
against them, which debase themseues to commit them,
without touching or blemishing the generall reputes of their
honourable families.</p>
               <p>Ninteenth, that he held it for a thing certaine, that it is
better to dissemble and winke at some common infirmities
and frailties, then to shew himselfe earnest to punish them,
it not being the resolution of a wary man to enter into that
naughty passage, out of the which he otherwise knowes, that
the horse cannot draw forth his feet.</p>
               <p>Twentieth, that he vary not in opinion with his equals
in office or vnder Officers, but vpon extremitie, knowing
that his Prince had rather he should vse dexteritie and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of wit in such actions, then rigorous Iustice.</p>
               <p>Twenty one, that with a pleasing sagacity he let the world
see, how he had found all such as inhabite in his iurisdiction
rather good people, then by any rigorous proceedings of his
that he made them good, because whosoeuer glories and
vaunts that he hath hanged and punished so many malefactors
during the time of his office, he triumphs in their infamy
and shame, which cannot redound to his honour, nor to
that discreet carriage, which is required in a well foreseene
Gouernour.</p>

               <p>THe Monarchies of Great <hi>Britaine, Prance, Spaine</hi> and
<hi>Polonia,</hi> wondring that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had gotten the
start and fame for their gift of Secrecie, and that the

the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> neuer as yet to disclose any of their priuy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel,
they went with one consent to the Palace of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Lady, earnestly importuning her to discouer vnto them by
what meanes or pollicie of State she had arriued to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
as to obtaine such Secrecie and rare Obedience in so
many mouthes and hearts, which they could scarce meet
withall in one or two of their trustiest seruants. To this the
Lady answered, that she had allured and wonne her Nobility
to this vertue of Secrecie, with rewards and hopes of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for the crime of disobedience she scared them with
punishment.</p>
               <p>To which the aboue-named <hi>Monarchies</hi> replied, that

in a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> rightly ordered, the <hi>rewards</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies</hi>
were poore, and punishments more sparing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6615:93"/>
the <hi>Monarchies</hi> made answer, that with them it was
cleane contrary, and that the <hi>rewards</hi> of <hi>Free-States,</hi> to bee
paraleld with the wastfull liberalitie, which <hi>great Kings</hi>
extended towards their Ministers, was but beggery. For
they neuer heard, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had beene so liberall as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
any of their <hi>Senators</hi> seruice and fidelity with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them to be owners of Cities, Townes, Castles, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantships,
or Lands in Fee, as <hi>Kings</hi> haue diuers times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
their Subiects vnto: And that the greatest <hi>reward,</hi>
which the <hi>Venetians</hi> accustomed to bestow at any time
vpon their <hi>Senators,</hi> was to prefer them to some <hi>Offices,</hi>
which they were forced to labour hard for, and to passe many
base and inferiour <hi>Offices</hi> by degrees and steps, euen from
their youth vp, before they could arriue to any supreme
<hi>place</hi> of command or profit. Besides that, the most part of
their <hi>Offices</hi> were rather hindrances than gainfull: onely
they caried a colour of some reputation to them that knew
no better, nor saw the glory and pomps of <hi>Monarchies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for <hi>punishments,</hi> without any comparisons, those
were far more terrible and cruell, which proceeded from the
resolued will of a <hi>Prince</hi> incensed for some grieuous cause,
than the punishments of the <hi>Venetian Senate</hi> against any of
their <hi>Senators,</hi> which ordinarily were more slow and warie,
than sudden and quicke. And that there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in proportion betweene a <hi>Prince,</hi> which iudged his

called, <hi>Iltremendo Canal Orfano,</hi> to sowe vp their
<hi>Traitors</hi> in a Sack, and to drowne them in their <hi>Lake,</hi> which
they seldome doe but in desperate cases: Whereas in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies,</hi>
the Iudges sentenced some to be hang'd, drawne,
and quartered, some to be burnt, some to be rackt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
a thing common in <hi>Spaine,</hi> practised vnder pretext of
<hi>heresie</hi> towards other <hi>Princes</hi> sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ects; and if any of their
<hi>Nobilitie</hi> were condemned for high <hi>Treason,</hi> they escaped
not the <hi>axe,</hi> the kindest fauour <hi>England</hi> affords to offendors,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6615:94"/>
sauing one only example in the Chronicles, of <hi>Queene Anne
Bullen,</hi> for her greater grace and honour was beheaded with
the sword of <hi>Calice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At these speeches the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dame smiled, and said,
that in stead of those <hi>rewards of Honour and Estates in Fee,</hi>
which <hi>Monarchs</hi> bestowed vpon their well-deseruing
<hi>Creatures,</hi> shee also requited her best and wisest <hi>Nobles</hi> with
places of great authority and command, with most absolute
power and dominion; One with the <hi>Noble Kingdome of
Creet</hi> or <hi>Candy;</hi> others with <hi>Corfu,</hi> and other <hi>Ilands</hi> subiect
to her <hi>State:</hi> Some shee preferred to be her <hi>Viceroyes</hi> in
<hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Istria;</hi> some shee appointed Gouernours of
her neighbouring <hi>Territories</hi> on the <hi>Continent,</hi> of <hi>Nova
Palma, Forum Iulij, Harca Trevisano, Padua, Vincenza, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,
Brescia, Bergamo, Crema</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Milan,</hi>
and the rest of her <hi>Nobilitie</hi> shee reserued perhaps to their
far greater contentment in the <hi>Senate-house</hi> at home in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
which might be termed <hi>the Maiesticall Miracle of
Cities.</hi> So that her <hi>Nobles</hi> might better be called <hi>Kings and
great Princes,</hi> than priuate Gentlemen or Subiects, who in
all affaires of moment, hauing euery one a speciall interest,
must needs be faithfull to their owne selues; whereas the
seruants of Princes were faithfull vnto them not as sons but
as vassals. And the feare, which frights our <hi>Nobles of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
from selling the <hi>Secrets of the State,</hi> to forraigne Princes
ariseth from this infinite disparity and disproportion, that
is betwixt that which is lost with treachery, and that which
is gained with fidelitie; betwixt that remorse of conscience,
which a Subiect feeles for betraying his <hi>Prince,</hi> and the
feare which a <hi>Senator</hi> is possessed with for prouing disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to a <hi>Free-State.</hi> There is great difference in the loue of a
<hi>Free-borne Senator,</hi> and the loue of a <hi>cringing vassall,</hi> howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
he be gilded with the bare title of a <hi>Nobleman.</hi> What
will it then boot one of our <hi>Senators</hi> to bewray the secrets
of our <hi>State</hi> to his owne hindrance and perpetuall disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
Finally, the <hi>Venetian Dame</hi> told them, that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
which <hi>Princes</hi> conferred vpon their <hi>Counsellors</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6615:94"/>
                  <hi>Secretaries,</hi> occasioned oftentimes pernitious effects cleane
contrary to their <hi>Masters</hi> meaning which trusted them;
because those <hi>rewards</hi> so giuen not onely cooled them in
their good seruice, specially at that time, when they had no
more, than they might hope for of him for their cares and
paines: but the good will of the <hi>Prince</hi> being commonly
mutable, and subiect to change and nouelty, the treacherous
machinations and emulations of some <hi>Courtiers</hi> being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and rife, it sometimes falls out that the <hi>Ministers</hi> to
assure themselues of their places and high commands, which
they purchased by their honourable deserts, or perhaps by
the helpe of their purses, or by other meanes, suspecting a
remouall from their <hi>Offices,</hi> or some disasters by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
they proue vnderhand false, and to make vp their
market, or perhaps to make themselues sauers; if they bought
their places, they fell their <hi>Princes secrets,</hi> and may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
tempted to doe him a worse mischiefe. But such
is the ardent affection, which kindles in the hearts of all
our <hi>Venetian Nobles,</hi> that they will hazard to liue with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty,
shame, and disdaine at home, than to be hired abroad
by strange <hi>Princes,</hi> or to betray their <hi>natiue Country</hi> by reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any secrets which might redound to the common hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance:
so that I may rightly liken a <hi>Nobleman of Venice</hi>
to a <hi>Fish,</hi> which being bred in that <hi>Lake</hi> in the water of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
knowes not how to liue abroad out of <hi>Venice</hi> in the
element of seruitude.</p>

recreation had retired himselfe out of <hi>Parnassus</hi> into the
Country. To whom shee said, that she came vnto him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to be resolued of one maine doubt, which troubled
her minde continually, the which she had imparted to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Politicians,</hi> but could neuer as yet be satisfied by any of
them, and therefore she repaired to him, as to the prime
and grand <hi>Statesman</hi> of all others. The matter which thus
perplexed her was to know why the Kingdomes of <hi>Greece,
Asia, Egypt, France, Britaine, Spaine, and the Common-wealth
of Carthage, with many other great Prouinces, before they
became vnited to the State of Rome, were of themselues power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full-enough
and formidable, but being sithence subiected and
vnited together in her proper person, they missed with all their
forces to make her strong and durable.</hi> To this <hi>Cornelius
Tacitus</hi> answered, that this was a difficult <hi>Question,</hi> and
could not suddenly be resolued, but the next day after some
pause and studie he would returne thither with his best reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6615:95"/>
The <hi>Monarchesse</hi> rested very well satisfied, and as
shee was ready to licence his departure, <hi>Meliboeus</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Shepherd recorded by the <hi>Poets,</hi> who that morning
had brought to <hi>Tacitus</hi> a present of fresh cheese and creame,
and a couple of dainty cheeses, and stood all the while at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely
listning to this <hi>Question,</hi> seeing them now ready
to take their leaue, he interrupted them, desiring <hi>Tacitus</hi>
not to depart, for he would instantly without any study giue
the <hi>Lady</hi> sufficient satisfaction. The <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi>
laughed very heartily, and bade him not to beat his braine
about such deepe matters, but to goe home and looke to his
sheepe. <hi>Meliboeus</hi> replied very earnestly, that no Race a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
mortall men could better discourse of true and solid
<hi>State-businesse</hi> than <hi>Shepherds;</hi> and that <hi>Princes</hi> should
be most happy, if in gouerning their <hi>Subiects,</hi> they could
imitate <hi>Shepherds</hi> in charity: And so should the <hi>people</hi>
bee, if they could obey their <hi>Prince,</hi> as sheepe did their
shepherd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Monarchesse</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> confounded with maruell
at the sudden and extemporary words of the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him freely to vtter his resolution. Whereupon <hi>Meli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oeus</hi>
began in this manner: <hi>Most mighty Princesse,</hi> I am (as my
<hi>Virgil</hi> well knowes) his <hi>Mantuan Shepherd,</hi> and it were a
great shame to these siluer haires, which you see on my head
and chin, if I were not exactly experienced in my owne
occupation; I say then, that in so many yeares which I haue
spent in gouerning sheepe, I haue gotten this knowledge,
that the greatnesse and power of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
(as many ambitious and conetous men beleeue) in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
of thousands of sheepe, but that he be owner of so
many sheepe onely, as a good <hi>Shepherd</hi> can watch with his
eye, gouerne with his rod, and rule with his whistle. And
the reason is cleare, for in too small a number of sheepe we
see <hi>Shepherds</hi> poore, because their great pouerty compels
them with too much seuerity to milk their flock, and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to sheare them. In a moderate and meane number, where
the true <hi>perfection</hi> lies, <hi>Shepherds</hi> become alwaies wealthy
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6615:96"/>
and happy; whereas in the excesse and ouer-abounding
number of sheepe, by reason of the difficult and hard means
to gouerne them, being thus from the golden rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
so far remote, and indeed beyond the power of one
man, they cannot chuse but incur manifest danger. Whence
it comes to passe, that the miserable sheep of his flock being
too many in number, by the couetousnesse and carelesnesse
of him, that vndertakes to gouerne them, doe pine away at
first, and at last they dye of meere necessitie and want. How
is it possible, but that confusion should happen, where mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
abound out of the <hi>Owners</hi> view and reaches: For
<hi>it is the Masters owne eye, which fattens and makes his flocke
to thriue.</hi> Right happy were many great <hi>Potentates</hi> and
<hi>States,</hi> if our <hi>Creator</hi> had bestowed on them the propertie
of <hi>Camells</hi> to bow and kneele downe to the ground for the
receiuing of the burthen of <hi>Gouernments,</hi> and had the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
moderation to set meeres and bounds vnto their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
minds by rising and standing vp (as is the manner of
those <hi>beasts</hi>) when they feele themselues reasonably well
laden; and to receiue no heauier charge on their shoulders,
though stronger than <hi>Atals,</hi> at such time as they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
sufficiently charged with <hi>states</hi> proportioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their abilities in true wisdome and prudence.</p>
               <p>There are past now 1626. <hi>yeares,</hi> since I became a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi>
in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and euer since my comming and being
here, I haue contented my selfe with <hi>fiue hundred sheepe</hi> in
my flocke, which haue yearly yeelded mee <hi>fiue hundred
Crownes,</hi> which is more than sufficient for my owne main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and my families. And this most fortunate gaine is
so sure vnto me, that I am respected of all men in <hi>Arcadia,</hi>
and reputed for the best Shepherd in all the Country. Yea,
the wisest in <hi>Parnassus</hi> doe hold me to be a happier man
than <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who was not ashamed to wish for
more worlds to conquer. That <hi>Shepheard,</hi> whose ambition
prouokes him to keep many flocks in hope of gaine is much
deceiued, for where his owne eye cannot ouersee, he must
needs commit the charge of them to others, commonly, to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6615:96"/>
                  <hi>Louts, Knaues, Theeues,</hi> and <hi>Villaines,</hi> who as people borne
altogether for their bellies, and other carnall and worldly
pleasures, will not only sheare but slay their <hi>Masters flocks.</hi>
Besides, who knowes not whether he must sometime or
other vndergoe a greater charge than all his <hi>Flocks</hi> amount
vnto in warlike prouisions and garrisons to defend them
from Pirates and wilde Tartars, or from his malicious
neighbours?</p>
               <p>For example, I will instance in my neighbour <hi>Menalcas,</hi>
who being my capitall enemy, and bearing great enuy and
emulation in seeing me prosper with my fiue hundred sheep
aboue him and others, and verily beleeuing, that he should
supplant me, if he could enioy more flocks than I kept,
not content with the like number of sheepe as he formerly
possessed equall vnto mee, but thinking to make himselfe
absolute <hi>Monarch</hi> of all other Pastors in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> he tooke
vp money at vse, and at the extremest interest, sold the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his Patrimonie, and hauing got together a
large masse of money, sent into <hi>England, Spaine,</hi> and to
strange Countries, where he vnderstood the fairest wolled
sheep were, and with excessiue cost transported them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and made three seuerall flocks of fiue hundred in each
flocke. But it fortuned so, that those sheepe being forraine,
and not acquainted with the language and whistles of our
Shepheards, nor with our kinde of pasture, they stragled
here and there into vnknowne places. Whereupon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalcas</hi>
was forced to substitute Deputy Shepheards and
many Dogs to looke vnto them and to fetch them in. But
such was the naturall hatreed of the sheepe towards the
Dogs, and the implacable moodinesse which they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be continually hurried vp and downe, that they fell
into an inward conceit of languor and despair, and so into
flat disobedience to abhorre both their Shepheards and the
Dogs, insomuch that when they were to bee milkt and
shorne, they hid themselues in woods and deserts. And
then it was known throughout all <hi>Arcadia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that <hi>Despaire and
strange vsage can turne Conies into Lions.</hi> Yea, it was sound,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6615:97"/>
that at that time the <hi>Spanish sheepe,</hi> which <hi>Menalcas</hi> had
brought thither, proued so rauing mad, that they attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
bite their Shepheards. <hi>Menalcas</hi> thus perplexed for
the losse and escape of so many sheepe, hired out of <hi>Spaine</hi>
and <hi>Swizzerland,</hi> the valiantest Dogs hee could haue for
money, which considering the infinite charge he sustained
in conducting them into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and the nature of these
Dogs being continually accustomed to hunt these sheepe,
they came at last, what for want of their due allowance, and
what of a wanton and greedy disposition, they turned like
Wolues, and preyed so long vpon these silly sheep, that the
rest which were left aliue pined away with griefe, rather to
endure such continual hurrying and troubles vnder <hi>strange
Pastors and rauenous Dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poore <hi>Menalcas</hi> vpon the report of this tragicall euent
became the by-word and subiect of laughter to all <hi>Arcadia</hi>
for this his ambitious enterprise; and was pointed at with
the more fingers, euen of very boyes, when afterwards he
was faine to turne a petty merchant of skins, the vnlucky
relicks of a lamentable charge, and the presaging tokens of
his owne Funerals; for indeed the mans heart-strings
brake of very sorrow and melancholy, leauing his
house, that sometimes flourished among
the best of vs in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> now
desolate and most
miserable.</p>

qualities, to their healths impaire, the ruine of their estates,
and soules danger. And for their outside, they garnished
themselues like peacocks, so gay and trimme, that no patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
how rich soeuer, can now supply the ambition of
men, nor the vanities of women; &amp; that they also obseruing

that all the portion which is left vnto young Gentlewomen,
whom ciuill modesty heretofore was wont to be their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

now suffice to buy them <hi>Carkanets</hi> and <hi>Iewels,</hi> and imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>peticotes,</hi> so that Fathers are not able to marry them
according to their rancke; and to match them with thrifty
persons were almost impossible, for hauing knowne them
for such vaine creatures, they will not be troubled with their
company, and to let them runne headlong according to their
vnbridled fancies, they must either marry with vnthrifts, like
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6615:98"/>
themselues, or liue vnmarried, to the hazard of their chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
so that except some Law be enacted for the curbing of
this excesse, they may well be said to hold the Wolfe by the
eares.</p>
               <p>Vpon these considerations, fearing their vtter ouerthrow,
with one consent they presented their supplications to their
Princes, who seemed very glad to entertaine their motion so
much tending to the publike good, and like good Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
knowing how profitable it is to strike the iron while it is
hot, &amp; at that time to publish a Law, when the subiects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

with good fruit in the effect, they out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, while their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
were in this humour of thirft, ioyned together to cut off
all superfluous customes in feasts and drinkings, and all new
fashions of attires, tying themselues to one fashion onely, not
to be altered for many yeares, allowing what is decent and
comely to euery seuerall vocation.</p>
               <p>But the Euening before this most laudable Statute was to
be signed and published, accidentally it came to the eares of
the Princes, Farmers, and Officers of the Customes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts,
who being likewise backt and whetted on by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Vintners, Grocers and other Tradesmen which liued
vpon the spoile of the richer sort, they repaired in all haste to
their Princes, and very cunningly intreated to defaulke and
abate a great part of those yearely summes which they were
to pay them for such Wines, Spice, Sugars, and such other
forraine commodities, as by way of Customes and Imposts,
they were to receiue to their vse. The Princes stood confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their iudgement, hearing speech of so great losses and
defalkments, as they very craftily insinuated and pretended
in Foxes habits to be most true, and although most of the
stuffes were wrought in their owne Countries, at least the
most durable and best befitting euery Nation, yet they made
their Princes beleeue, that there came from <hi>Naples,</hi> from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi>
from <hi>Millan,</hi> and from <hi>Spaine,</hi> so many kinds of stuffes,
silkes, gold and siluer lace, which if the Statute of thrift went
currant, they could not but sustaine exceeding great losses in

the publike Customes; whereupon the Princes sent for the
Committies and Deputies of their People, and told them
what their Customers had proued before them on their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
words, so that they could not hinder their owne interest
and profit, lest they should make themselues leane in going
about to fatten them. With this answere sauouring of the

not with the tongue, which oftentimes trips and deliuers, like
a clattering clapper, more noises and gall, then honeyed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions.
To this he added, that the necessitie of ambition
and the violence of desire did arise and flow, not from vice
but from that honourable zeale, which also Philosophers, yea,
the most mortified of all others in <hi>Parnassus,</hi> doe hold as the
most earnest and intentiue spurre of their Reputation. The
reason is, because when they should not receiue in progresse
of time, the same or the like preferments at his Maiesties
hands, as he had conferred vpon <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the world would
iudge all that came to passe, not by their professed humility,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6615:101"/>
nor because they with all their hearts and soules preferred the
priuate life before publike Offices, quietnesse before busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and pouertie before riches: but because his Maiestie
had not found in them those abilities, worths and deserts,
which he had knowne and found in <hi>Diogenes.</hi> Therefore
<hi>Crates</hi> foreseeing these inconueniences incident to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
his conscience would not permit him with such a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
mind, so subiect to the violence of ambition, with any
hope of doing good to reade Lectures of humilitie, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of riches, and the vanitie of worldly greatnesse: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing impossible to find any man so powerfully elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
which shall be able to perswade others to follow that
kinde of life, which the hearers know to be abhorred and
misliked of the Preacher himselfe.</p>

the <hi>Offendor,</hi> that fled to a Country mans house adioyning
to the Territorie of <hi>Pindus,</hi> and threatned to burne the

the Party had submitted himselfe prisoner to the Gouernor
of <hi>Libethru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> wherupon he of <hi>Pindus</hi> required the prisoner as

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6615:101"/>
and difference, both Gouernours not being able longer to

both, and after long patience in examination of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
his Maiestie finding that the Gouernour of <hi>Libethrum</hi>

to be clearly in the Gouernment of <hi>Pindus,</hi> though before

condemned him for all that to the Gallies for ten yeares, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating

all other Officers, that they which serue the one and the

armes and force for strangers, which might inuade their

by the Venetian State herselfe, to whose

               <p>VVOrthy of Record is that vertuous Contention,
which about six daies past arose betwixt certaine
Learned men of this State; who while they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of the notable orders, the most excellent Lawes,
and other mostrare Decrees, which maintained the famous
Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in such height of greatnesse,
they fell into sundry opinions, which of them ought to beare
away the victory. And because euery one of them did obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
defend his owne opinion as the best, to the end so
great a difference should be decided without commotion of
minde or passion, they vnanimously agreed vpon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
to appeare all of them before the State herselfe, to
whom they should first declare their seuerall reasons, and
that shee should afterwards adiudge which of them had ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
next vnto the marke. This they made knowne vnto
the Soueraigne Lady, who gratiously vndertooke to giue
that satisfaction which they expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Crinitus</hi> then was the first, who said, that it
being a most assured rule, that <hi>all things whatsoeuer subsist
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6615:103"/>
vnder the Moone, doe spring at first and then grow, and waxing
old at last they faile:</hi> it seemed a thing vnto him worthy of
admiration, that the Venetian State alone did notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her yeares become more youthfull and fresh euery day
than other, and that those Lawes, Orders, and Decrees,
which in other Principalities after long forbearing of their
execution, were at length vtterly forgotten, did only in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
so flourish with seueritie, with greater obseruance, and
exacter diligence, working that efficacie and benefit, that in
this Common-wealth no such reformation, nor innouation
euer hapned, as heretofore wee read haue chanced with
infinite tumults and hurliburlies in the ancient Romane
State, and now of late in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Common-wealth;
it being a peculiar vertue vnto the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to preserue their flourishing liberty, with a seuere exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their ancient Lawes; whereby none of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults
euer hapned in this State, which other Potentates and
Free States could no way shun for all their exquisite care and
diligence, but that they fell into such carelesse negligence,
that they lost both their liberty and liues. Therefore not
without good cause he dared to affirme, as a thing most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that <hi>the Venetian Common-wealth for their prudent
care in the rigorous execution of their ancient Lawes ought to
continue and prosper eternally, as long as the world lasteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next spake <hi>Angelus Politianus,</hi> that he did truly admire
both what <hi>Petrus Crintus</hi> had recounted, and a thousand
other orders in that most prudent Common-wealth. But
the rarest thing which he obserued, was how an <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
the true foundation whereof, as the most vnderstanding
Writers haue deliuered, was <hi>the equalitie of fortunes among
the Nobilitie,</hi> could haue beene able to maintaine it selfe in
such peace and greatnesse, consisting in that disproportioned
<hi>inequality of wealth,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Venetian Nobilitie</hi> is
endowed, wherein although there were two such dangerous
extremes found, as <hi>immoderate riches</hi> with some of them,
and <hi>much pouertie</hi> with others of the same ranke in <hi>Venice,</hi>
notwithstanding there appeared not that defect, which in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6615:103"/>
humane probability and according to the common course
of the world, the best Lawes could not prohibite, that the
<hi>richer</hi> sort did not trample the <hi>pooror</hi> vnder their feet, who
though they greatly enuied the condition and state of the
wealthy, yet notwithstanding either by reason of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
charity, which reigned in the <hi>Venetian Nobilitie</hi>
towards the publike good, or else because those infinite
<hi>riches,</hi> which some of them so possessed, were not abused to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Inferiours; both poore and rich liued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly,
peaceably, and contented in this most Fortunate
Countrey.</p>
               <p>After him followed <hi>Iulius Caesar Scaliger,</hi> and said, that
the greatest wonder in the <hi>Venetian State,</hi> which amazed
the world, was that the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> themselues which bare
sway, did not onely most patiently pay the vsuall ancient
subsidies and tallages belonging to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> but with
incredible alacritie of minde and speedy performance, they
assessed on themselues other new impositions of money,
which with great diligence and rigour were afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
and called for at the publike Receiuers hands. Yea
and oftentimes in important affaires concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
before they burthened the common people
with any new Customes and Taxations, they haue yeelded
supplies out of their owne purses, and that so liberally and
cheerfully, that this one act of theirs deserued place before
all other wonders and remarkable orders in this State, as such
a one, which euery man must acknowledge to be an act of
that excellent quality, which renders the <hi>Venetian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
for euer glorious; for hauing such a Nobilitie
so dearely inamoured of their Free-State, that they more
readily preferred the publike interest before their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
particular.</p>
               <p>Then succeeded <hi>Bernardo Tasso,</hi> and said, that he had
for a long time soiourned in <hi>Venice,</hi> where he maruelled at
nothing more than to see the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> who glutted their
mindes with continuall pleasures, delights, and idlenesse,
gouerning the affaires of the <hi>Republike</hi> with such admired
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6615:104"/>
vertue, that they seemed vnto others to be men of an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie
and regular life, and also <hi>Rulers</hi> borne to perpetuall
cares and burthens.</p>
               <p>After the opinion of <hi>Tasso, Francis Berni,</hi> according to
his manner, with a pleasing grace, which gaue good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to the <hi>most Excellent Venetian Lady,</hi> said, that the most
rare and wonderfull thing, which great wits ought to admire
in this State, that notwithstanding the marshes and chanels
did abound with crabs and creuices in all places about the
Citie, the <hi>Venetian Senators</hi> tooke so few of them, that of
all other Nations they were reputed, and that iustly, to be
<hi>the Salt of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next vnto him, said <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> that while he wrote the
<hi>Venetian Historie,</hi> hauing most diligently obserued the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablest
Lawes and Customes of this renowned State, hee
wondred at nothing more, than at the <hi>Publike Treasure,</hi>
which carefull <hi>Senators</hi> managed with so great fidelitie,
that among the Nobilitie it was held not only a capitall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
but exceeding great infamy to defile their hands with
one penny of their Patron <hi>S. Marks Treasurie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After him spake <hi>Sannazzarius,</hi> that the strangest thing
vnto him was, that seeing there were many among the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
of <hi>Venice</hi> poore and ill prouided of the <hi>Goods of
Fortune,</hi> yet neuerthelesse they endured with vnspeakable
patience all their miseries and crosse fortunes, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the least thought of affecting any of the publike goods
to be gotten either by ingrossing of corne, or by some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall
diuision of lands, matters which mightily perplexed
the State of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that it seemed vnto him a thing
worthy of commendation to see a poore Nobleman in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
so striue and force himselfe only by the helpe of <hi>Vertue</hi>
to comfort himselfe in his miseries, hoping in time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
some honourable and profitable place of imployment
in his Country, whereby at last it chanceth, that <hi>the vertue,
valour, and bountie of the minde doe serue an impouerished
Nobleman of this State in stead of a wealthy Patrimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iouianus Pontanus</hi> said, that they which passed were great
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:6615:104"/>
maruels, but in his opinion this surpassed all things in the
<hi>Venetian</hi> State, that the huge estates and infinite wealth of
some Noble persons wrought not those pernitious effects
to puffe them vp with vaine-glory and pride, as haue beene
noted in many other Common-wealthes. And that it was a
most laudable custome to see these Rich Senatours possessing
Princely Treasures liue very priuately at home, and to shew
themselues abroad little differing from ordinary people.
Whereby all men may conceiue, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> onely doe
know the true way and meane to distinguish and seuer from
great riches those inconueniences of Ambition, Pride, and
Popularity, which the famous <hi>Romane</hi> State neuer knew, or
could not hinder in <hi>Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and many other power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Senatours.</p>
               <p>Assoone as <hi>Pontanus</hi> had ended his discourse, <hi>Hannibal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
said, that aboue all other wonders he thought it a matter
worthy of greatest admiration, to obserue the quality of the
Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> followed with obedience and reuerence,
with Regall Authoritie, with a great command: And for
all that to see his Royalty and Princely sway moderated with
a set Rule, and the power of his will ioyned with modestie
were tempers vnknowne to the prudent Lawgiuers of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, and a kind of wisedome luckily practised among
the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bartholomew Caualcanti,</hi> after him told his opinion, that
as <hi>Pontanus</hi> had intimated, it was strange indeed, that their
Senatours wealth and great Estates did not cause some of
them to be puft with ambition: But it was a more strange
thing to see that such were the Orders of this Famous State,
such the sacred Lawes of this euerlasting Common-wealth,
that the high places and supreme gouernments, which some
of their Senators inioyed as presidents in remoter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
subiect vnto their Dominion, did not sometime or other
pricke them with ambition to rebell and vsurpe. And at
that time when he lay there at <hi>Venice,</hi> he wondred not at the
great Treasure of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> nor at the <hi>Arcenall,</hi> nor at the
<hi>Grand Canal,</hi> with the proud Palaces of the <hi>Cornaria,</hi> the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:6615:105"/>
                  <hi>Grimani,</hi> the <hi>Foscari,</hi> and other magnificent edifices built
with such Royall expences in this renowned City being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
things in the sight of ordinary persons. But farre
more miraculous in his conceit was, that he saw the Noble
Signior <hi>Sebastian Venieri,</hi> a little after he had returned to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
from that memorable victory at Sea, which hee had
gotten being Generall against the <hi>Turkes,</hi> liue retired at
his priuate house, and when hee walked abroad to the
market place, hee differed in nothing from these Senators,
who had stayed behind at <hi>Venice,</hi> but went very plaine and
simple in apparell. And surely it is a most singular Custome,
which they haue, that their Nobilitie can vse that ciuility and
modestie in their owne Citie, and being employed abroad
in matters of import and of high command, that they can so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
transforme themselues into most costly garments,
with such magnificence, and Princely liberality, to let the
world know them for no Citizens of an ordinary State, but
for men borne for great enterprizes and for bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as if they were subiects descended from Royall bloud;
and also to make themselues famous vnto all other Nations
by thus accommodating their affections and spirits to the
nature of the place, and framing themselues as well to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
ciuilitie, and thrift at home, as to pompuous authority
abroad. A thing so true, that whereas other States for the
reputation and countenance of publike Magistrates are wont
to recommend to their Gouernours, that they maintaine the
Maiestie of their soueraigne places, with magnificence and
stately comportments both of courage and gorgeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
The <hi>Venetian</hi> State on the contrary haue enacted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
to forbid any of their Citizens, which supply Offices
or charge vnder them in any of their Territories to grace
their presence with glorious shewes, or to weare any costly
suits of apparell. So great a care haue those politicke Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of their Cities thrift and prosperitie.</p>
               <p>This spake <hi>Caualcanti,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Flauio Biondo</hi> said, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
was at <hi>Venice,</hi> he became much astonisht to find in a pure <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracie,</hi>
that the Citizens and Common people liued with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:6615:105"/>
such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment in this fortunate cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, that in many years
of his abode there, he could neuer learne, whether the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
State were better beloued and respected of the Nobility
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them, or of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> obeyed.</p>
               <p>Next to him spake <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> that not onely vnto
himselfe, but also vnto many great Princes, with whom hee
oftentimes had conference, touching the wonders of <hi>Venice,</hi>
it seemed a thing of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the Senate of this most
famous Republicke, did altogether bend their endeauours
vnto Peace, and to no other end at all, withall their vigilancy
and care, not studying to make perpetuall preparations for
the warres, as others did, whereupon they all concluded, that
in this flourishing State alone, a man might find the Lady
Peace armed withall exquisite appurtenances.</p>
               <p>After <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ovius</hi> ensued <hi>Iohn Boccace,</hi> who said, that the true
salt, which preserued the <hi>Venetian</hi> State from the purrefaction
and corruption of abuses, was the soueraigne Queene of all
Lawes, that most excellent Order, so inuiolably obserued of
her, that for the aduancing of a Senatour to a higher place, not
the glory of his Riches, not the merits of his Father, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
nor the multitude of his Tenants or Friends, nor the
fauour of great persons, but his owne worth and naked ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
were had in most consideration. From whence it comes
to passe, that in <hi>Venice</hi> the vitious and ignorant Nobles were
onely accounted a number, as Ciphers in Arithm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ke,
while the <hi>Vertuous</hi> alone, and the best deseruing subiect, bare
the chiefe sway, <hi>detur Digniori,</hi> with that prudent care and
circumspection, as is knowne vnto all the world.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Leonardus Aretinus</hi> after he had extolled the opinion
of <hi>Boccace,</hi> added, that the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vsage of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State,
in not granting to their Nobilitie, the charge and Offices at
the first iumpe, but by degrees, was the true solid foundation,
wheron their Greatnesse consisted most firmely built, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the eternitie of their Libertie. For this is one of their most
admired Precepts, <hi>That euery Nobleman whatsoeuer, before he
mount vp into the highest Dignity, must from his youth vpwards
be forced, like an enfranchised Townesman, to beginne from the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:6615:106"/>
lowest Offices, and not leaping wise and sodainly.</hi> A most safe
Custome, as that, which iustly distributed this important
effect of vpholding the true and substantiall equality among
the Nobilitie of an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> which giues long life to a
free State, because according to the certaine and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
policie of true gouernment, the equality of goods made
not <hi>Senatours</hi> equall in a Common-wealth, but that all the
Nobles should be first compelled to walke faire and softly to
the most eminent places of command from the inferiour
steps, which I haue formerly shewed. The which if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire had practised, it had not shortned the life of their
libertie, nor wrought those dangerous and fatall infirmities of
tyrannies and tumults. Their grosse abuses in affording the
Consular authority and the charge of armies vnto <hi>Pompey,</hi>
the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and to other wealthy and powerfull Citizens in
their greene and vnsetled youth, was no other then as if they
had chosen some of the Bloud-Royall in a Monarchy, as
Lords and Patrons of their liberty, rather then <hi>Senatours</hi> of
a well ordered Common-wealth. By which vnwitting er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

               <p>Albeit that <hi>the most excellent Lady of the State of Venice</hi>

the way of good fortune to bring in among her Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,

                  </gap>ude, puts me now in a
great amazement, and I thinke it may surpasse all other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
in this State, when I consider with deliberation, that a
Nobleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> although most grieuously offended
for the life of his sonnes, and for his owne proper person, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
more with a feruent charity towards the freedome of
his Countrey, then terrified with the seuerity of Magistrates,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:6615:106"/>
had learned that difficult lesson of resolution, to forgiue at
the instant the wrong which he had receiued at his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
hands, and that with a free heart. A resolution worthy
of remembrance, and by so much the more wonderfull by
how much it is cleerely obserued, that a Nobleman of <hi>Venice</hi>
referres the reuenge of all receiued iniuries into the Senates
hand with all willingnesse of mind, the which sensuall and
brutish men, yea &amp; many of the wiser sort without the length
time and much strugling of nature cannot yeeld vnto God,
to whom vengeance belongeth, and from whom wee must
all acknowledge our liues, liuing, and liberty to proceed. This
<hi>Varchi</hi> spake, when <hi>Lodouico Dulce</hi> began the deliuery of his
Opinion, that if that were true, which all confessed, that the
rarest and most prized greatnesse that might be considered
in a Prince, was to disarme with facilitie and without danger
one of his war-like Generals, and to receiue of him exact and
conformable obedience, for all that that this Generall did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
know, and long before his returne, how his Prince
grew in suspition of his loyalty, or in dislike of his seruice:
Then this custome vsual in the state of <hi>Venice,</hi> deserued more
to be wondred at then any other, to be able to disarme with
great ease, their Generals and Admirals at Sea. Yea, and at
such time when they vnderstood how the Senate was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
bent to punish them at their returne, notwithstanding
that they found themselues very strong, beloued of their
souldiers, and powerfull enough to offend the State, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselues from shame, it alwayes fell out, that assoone
as euer they were sent for, they readily and presently obeyed,
voluntarily they resigned ouer their charge, and publike
command, and withall speed hastned to <hi>Venice,</hi> to be senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by their friends and Citizens, though with Capitall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which they willingly endured, rather then to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the losse of their Countrey by vnnaturall innouations,
and ciuill warres. So deare vnto them is the care of the
Common safetie.</p>
               <p>The most excellent <hi>Venetian Lady,</hi> who without answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any thing to the <hi>Vertuous</hi> aboue-named had attentiuely
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6615:107"/>
heard all these commendable Orders and admirable Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues
said to <hi>Dulce,</hi> that the matter which he related, was
indeed of great consequence, yet not so rare, but that the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Emperours likewise participated of the like benefit.
Howbeit neuerthelesse, there was one singular Prerogatiue,
which she most exactly possessed, and wherein she excelled
all other Principalities, as well of the ancient, as present
times, whereto she acknowledged and ascribed all her Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the which as yet she did not heare any of them as much
as touch.</p>
               <p>Then spake <hi>Hieronymus Mercurialis,</hi> that while he read
the Physicke Lecture at the Vniuersitie of <hi>Padua,</hi> hee knew
some of the <hi>Plebeian</hi> and common sort at <hi>Venice,</hi> that went
in their <hi>Gundoloes</hi> to disport themselues vpon the water with
some young <hi>Courtezans,</hi> according to their common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
and there being mightily misused by certaine young
<hi>Noble-men,</hi> whom they casually met, it chanced that these
<hi>Plebeians</hi> slew one of them in the affray. For which offence
vpon complaint made by the parties friends, the <hi>Plebeians</hi>
were sent for by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> who although they knew the
power of the Law to be in the hands of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> whom
they had offended, neuer fled, but trusting in the vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and integrity of the Senate and Magistrates, they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to appeare before them, and to yeeld themselues pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.
Neither did their hopes faile them, for vpon consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the cause giuen in euidence for their defence,
how they were prouoked first by those young Noble-men,
they were enlarged and pronounced innocent to the honour
of the <hi>Venetians</hi> vncorrupted Iustice: so that neither power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
parentage, greatnesse of friends, nor abundance of wealth
can blinde and diuert the Iudges of <hi>Venice</hi> to wrong any
man.</p>
               <p>Last of all, these vertuous States-men spake the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Hermolaus Barbarus,</hi> that in a free State Tyranny begins
then to vsurpe and worke, when the most weightie secrets
concerning the generall good of the Common-wealth, are
communicated to a few Senators. And for this cause the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6615:107"/>
most <hi>Soueraigne Lady of Venice,</hi> to auoid shipwreake on that
dangerous rockie shelfe, imparted her <hi>Secrets,</hi> and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the designes and pragmatickes of greatest import, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her state was interessed <hi>in her highest Court of Magistracy</hi>
or <hi>Parliament of the Pregadi,</hi> a number co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fiftie Senators and vpwards; and to him it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be a miraculous thing, how the <hi>Venetian</hi> State could
finde among so great a number of Senators that Secrecie,
which many great Potentates for all their exquisite diligence
and large entertainment of gifts and rewards, had bootlesse
sought in one only Secrtarie, or in a couple of Counsellors of
State.</p>
               <p>At these words, the most excellent <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady laid her
hand on the shoulders of <hi>Barbarus,</hi> and pronounced this
verdict: Now thou hast hit the naile on the head, and named
that most pretious Iewell, wherein I most glory, and prize
my selfe aboue all other States, and for which indeed I ought
to be iustly emulated and enuied at, seeing that nothing else
appertaines for the true gouernment and managing of State-businesse,
more necessary than Secracie.</p>

Apolloes answer.</head>
               <p>THe most Excellent Lady <hi>Victoria Colonna</hi> a Princesse
of exemplarie chastitie, about three daies past appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his Maiesties Court of Audience, and in the
name of all womankind said, that they all loued the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of chastitie, which was naturally giuen them for a most
particular vertue, that they did not awhit enuy <hi>Courage,</hi> a
vertue attributed to mans sexe, because they well knew, that
a Lady without the soule of chastitie, which renders her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous
to the world, was but a stinking carcasse: yet
notwithstanding it seemed vnto them, that they had much
cause to grieue and lament at the great inequalitie, which
they saw betwixt the Husband and the Wife in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
punishment of Adultery; so that women could not rest
contented to see men in such wise free, that the punishment
of shame, which alone was wont to terrifie honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
did now lesse serue to restraine them from committing
against their wiues these beastly and libidinous defaults. In
which dissolute courses they said, that they proceeded so far,
that many Husbands were not onely not ashamed to keepe
openly Concubines in their houses, but had oftentimes
presumed to make them partakers of the sacred bed of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.
These abuses came to passe, by reason that the
Lawes had not prouided the like punishment against the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
Husbands, as were thundred out and practised
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6615:109"/>
against adulterous Wiues. And that in this case, the Lawes
shewed too much fauour vnto maried men, in allowing
them to reuenge the iniurie with their owne hands at the
time when they hapned to take their wiues in the adulterous
act. By which notorious aggrieuances the Sexe of women
being so much wronged, were now forced to repaire vnto
the cleare fountaine of true Iustice, to the end that by publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
equall punishment in the equalitie of the self-same
fault, there might be some competent remedy ministred for
their oppressions. And that if this did not stand with <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi>
good will and pleasure, there might be at leastwise the
like liberty granted vnto them in this particular of Adultery
to keepe amorous seruants, or to marry againe, as many men
aduentured to doe. After which liberty granted them, they
would not perhaps make vse thereof, but only <hi>in terrorem
tantùm,</hi> vnder colour of law to be enabled to bridle their
loose and lustfull Husbands.</p>
               <p>Vnto this demand of the <hi>Lady Victoria, Apollo</hi> answered,
that the <hi>Law of Fidelitie</hi> betwixt the Husband and the Wife
ought to be indeed equall, and that the defect and breach
thereof ought to be punished no lesse in the one, than in the
other: but that in the Wife a more exquisite and perfect
chastitie was required for the great and weighty respect to
know the certainty of their children, to which end Nature
had assigned them the noble vertue of Chastitie, the which
was so necessarie for procreation of humane kinde, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the children should both lose their inheritance and
their fathers affection. A thing so true, that Nature herselfe
hath most prouidently allotted chaste wiues to all liuing
creatures of the earth, where the Male concurres for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
hatching of the Egge, or for the nourishing of their
young ones; all to the end that the carke of the fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imployed for their children welfare should proue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pleasing, and that their charge should redound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and to great gaine in time to come.</p>
               <p>At these words the <hi>Lady Victoriaes</hi> beautifull cheeks were
stained with an honourable blush, who with a <hi>Roman</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6615:109"/>
confessed vnto his Maiestie the simplicitie of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and said, that indeed it were a great shame and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the sexe of women, if in the pretious gift of chastitie
they suffred themselues to be ouercome of those vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
liuing creatures, who although they pursue no other
thing than pleasure, yet neuerthelesse doe they very religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
obserue Chastitie, because they would not anger the
fathers of their young ones by their wandring and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
lust. And for the important reason, that Husbands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to haue their wiues chaste, the lawes against adulterous
women were too fauourable, because the wound which the
vnchaste Husband giues his Wife did only pierce the skin,
whereas the Wife by her lasciuious deeds doth stab and kill
her Husband with the poniard of euerlasting infamy, and
also doth disparage her children.</p>

caused two companies of <hi>Skeltenicall Poets,</hi> dogrel Rimers,
men that made verses at random, and very aduentrous at
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6615:110"/>
ruffianly conceits to come out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whose office was to
scoure the countrey and to cleare the coast, of vagabonds.
These, about eight daies past, tooke prisoner a <hi>Poetaster,</hi>
that had beene capitally banished from <hi>Parnassus,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

audacious arrogancie, that he assumed vnto himselfe the
Soueraigne name of a Poet. This exorbitant fault of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
aggrauated with a paire of Cardes, which those Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles
in searching him had found in his pocket, for which
being likewise a notorious Vice and worthy of death they
brought him incontinently with the said Cardes before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
who when he saw them was wonderfully amazed at
the brutish inuention, which the vicious had found out to
cast away their pretious time, to consume their reputation,
and to spend their meanes. But much more was his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
astonished, when he vnderstood, that men now a dayes
were growne to such a height of folly, that they vsed to call
that thing a Play or Game, whereat they dealt so cruelly in
good earnest. And further that they esteemed it a delight,
sport, and pastime to put in suspence and to doubtfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise
that money, which was gotten with so much toyle
and cares, and serued so necessary for such great vses, that
without it, this present world would take <hi>Aristotle</hi> to bee

               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Apollo</hi> askt the Prisoner, what game at Cards was

true Philosophy of Courtiers,</hi> the most necessarie <hi>Science,</hi>
which all men ought to learne, that would not be thought
innocents or simple-witted. And shewing how much the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6615:110"/>
affront done vnto the prisoner did displease him, he inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him presently, and honoured him with the title of a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

to erect vp a publike Schoole, where with a stipend of fiue

this answer <hi>Apollo</hi> was so grieuously mooued against

to the afflicted, you hope to merit grace at Gods hand,
and to obtaine good will among men, goe your wayes to

comfort those poore wretches, who die of meere necessitie

to sit all day long closely among <hi>Ladies,</hi> as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to doe, thinking to make men beleeue, that you exercise
Spirituall doings, they are such hypocrisies, as will moue
the veriest idiot to laugh at you, and will make them to burst
with rage, that know, how these which goe often to the mill
become whited with meale. And a man of your wisdome
ought to vnderstand, that at such time as a woman conceiues
of two infants, which we call Twinnes, if both be male, they
are enclosed within one membrane, the which likewise comes
to passe, if both bee female. But if it happens, that one bee
male, and the other female, most prouident nature preserues
the female in a perticular membrane, seuered from the male.
Seeing that Nature thought good not to thrust a little bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a little sister of that tender age to dwell together in
one place, she teacheth all men, and especially men of your
fashion to liue more warily and securely; and in these doings,
<hi>O Thraseas,</hi> whosoeuer trusteth his owne power, I hold him
to be more rash than wise.</p>
               <p>And for that these disorders, in regard of our reputation
and yours, had need to be corrected, I doe straitly command
you, that from henceforth you leaue off such dangerous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises.
The world is not so sottishly simple, as you more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
conceiue it, but that they doe well vnderstand, how the
visites which men of your qualitie vse vnto Ladies, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to smell after the second time, and specially in their noses,
that know, how faire and beautifull things seeme pleasing to
all men, and that the prouocation of the flesh is a naturall vice
in all men, the which they cannot cure and keepe backe with
a more excellent remedy, than to stand a farre off from such
faire and goodly obiects: There's no safer way to defend a
man from error, than to shunne the occasions. And all your
Philosophy cannot produce such proofes, as will make any
man of iudgement beleeue, that a dainty bit of flesh doth
not agree with euery mans mouth, that is made of flesh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Learned Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> which some few dayes
since arriued at <hi>Parnassus,</hi> was yesterday admitted to
his Maiesties Royall Audience, vnto whom he shewed,
that for many iniuries, which hee had receiued of diuers ill
willers of his in the Court of a certaine Prince, where the
Lawyers persecuted him, and made him pay aboue three
score seuerall fees by their cunning trickes of Law, he hath si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
liued very much troubled in minde, and so much the
more, for that he could not worke his reuenge vpon them
without incurring farre greater troubles, then his Enemies
had plunged him in. And on the other side, he found that
he was not endowed with that generous resolution of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and forgiuing them. For which cause, and now to be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6615:112"/>
freed from this hellish torment, wherein he perpetually liued,
he repaired to his Maiestie, whom most humbly he intreated
to bestow vpon him some present remedie to heale his mind,
which was galled with the passions of hatred and reuenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> did much pitie this Gentlemans case, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that one should giue him a large cup-full of the water of
<hi>Lethe,</hi> prepared in such manner, that it might cause him to
forget odious things, and not to take away the remembrance
of benefits receiued. The Gentleman with great greedinesse
drunke vp the water, the which to all mens wonder was
found to haue only the vertue to blot and cancell out of his
minde those iniuries, which he had receiued of his inferiours
in condition; and that the iniuries which were done vnto
him, by greater persons than himselfe, had inflamed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
his minde rather with an euerlasting memory of
them, than any way caused him to forget them. Whereat
many began to murmur, that the famous water of <hi>Lethe</hi>
had lost that pretious vertue, which the Poets had blazed
of it. But his Maiestie gaue them to vnderstand, that the
water of <hi>Lethe</hi> had euermore the same vertue, which it
had in the beginning. And in that it did not worke the
expected effect in that Gentleman; the reason was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
persons nobly descended, and of great spirits, had euer
this custome proper vnto their natures, to write in the sand
these iniuries, which they receiued of base people; but in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
marble with eternall characters those aboue-handed
blowes, which were giuen them by their equalls, or superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
it being the propertie of a noble mind to remit wrongs
by magnanimitie, but not to pardon them of necessitie.</p>

               <p>ABout the eight of the Current <hi>Apuleius</hi> his famous
Asse accompanied with <hi>Plautus</hi> his Asse, appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Apolloes</hi> Maiestie, who in the name of all the sort
of Mules, Asses, and Pack-horses, said, that if any kinde of
beasts subiect to mankind, which were of small expence and
of much profit, had deserued better vsage than others; they
had most reason aboue all other beasts, to grieue at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
rough and rigorous dealings. And although they bare
the whole burthen of their Lords houses, and maintained
them both day and night by their perpetuall labours, and
were content to feed ordinarily on sedge, straw, and water,
and to keepe their Shrouetide with branne, and such poore
prouender; all this notwithstanding they were ingratefully,
cruelly, and with great indiscretion entreated by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and being the most vnhappie of all creatures, they were
now become the miserable spectacle of all drudgery. For as
much as they could not by their prostrate and humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
mollifie the passionate minds of their Lords, they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
his Maiestie in most lowly manner to commiserate
their Asinine miseries, if not to conclude and end them, yet
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6615:113"/>
at least to order the matter so, that by his Maiesties command
their Patrons would thenceforth vse them, though not grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
respects for their great seruices, yet with moderation of
passion, and with more hmanitie.</p>
               <p>Vnto these <hi>Apollo</hi> answered, that the seuerity, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
vsed towards their pack-horses, whereof they so bitterly
complained, proceeded not out of their Masters naturall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
since that it is plaine, that no man yet hated the vtilitie
and benefit of his heritage, but rather from their monstrous
sloth, and stupendious stupiditie of the pack-horses, through
which most brutish defaults, their Masters were enforced furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with whips and goads to pricke them on to doe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which otherwise for want of quickness they had not
spirit enough of themselues to performe. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

wise men of Greece, and by other Learned
men, is published by expresse Order from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IVstinian</hi> the Emperor, that great Composer of the <hi>Codes</hi>
and <hi>Pandects,</hi> some few dayes since brought a new <hi>Law</hi>
vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> to haue the same approoued of his Maiestie,
whereby it was straightly forbidden, that any man should
waxe so cruell against his owne person, as to be the Authour
of his owne death. <hi>Apollo</hi> seeing this Law, had it in so great
horrour, that with a sigh, which proceeded from the bottome
of his heart, he brake forth into these speeches: Is the good
gouernment of Mankinde precipated into such disorder,
<hi>O Iustinian,</hi> that they will now a dayes voluntarily attempt
their owne deathes, because they will not liue any longer, as
they ought? And wheras I haue hitherto hired a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the wisest morall Philosophers, to the end that with
their tognes and writings they should Minister vnder mee
graue and ciuill conceits vnto others, which might make
Death seemed lesse terrible, are things now reduced to that
great calamity, that men wil no longer liue, not yet learn to
accommodate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to die well? And do I carelesly sleep,
while these disorders abound among my learned Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
To these words of <hi>Apollo, Iustinian</hi> answered, that this
Law was very necessary, and that many notorious effects ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
happened by these desperate courses, more inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
would yet ensue, if his Maiestie did not in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
some conuenient remedy to salue the wilfull disorders
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:6615:114"/>
of these Franticke fellowes. Whereupon <hi>Apollo</hi> tooke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Information of that manner of life, which the world
lead, and found that it became extraordinarily depraued
with euill customes, the which to reforme hee resolued to
create a Congregation of some notable Personages, the most
prudent and ingenuous Polititians of his Empire. But in
the very beginning of this serious talke he met with inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
difficulties, for being come to the point, to appoint a
number of subiects among his Morall Philosophers, and
those innumerable Vertuous Spirits which attended his
Court, he could not light on any to his absolute liking, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
enabled for so great a businesse, by reason that his
Maiestie knew, that the sanctitie of life, and the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Reformer wrought a greater force and power in
them, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were to be reformed, then the best Rules, which the
wisest State could enact and publish. In this penurious exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<hi>Apollo</hi> referred the charge of the Worlds vniuersall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to the seuen wise men of <hi>Greece,</hi> men that are held
and reputed to be in the chiefest credit at <hi>Parnassus,</hi> was
those which in all mens conceit haue learnt the receit and
way to make straight the Dogs leg, which with so much
paines (yet alwayes in vaine) Antiquity hunted after. The
rumour of these newes being come to the <hi>Grecians</hi> eares, it
reioyced them exceedingly for the honour, which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
vouchsafed vnto their Nation; as on the other side, it
much troubled the Latines, it seeming vnto them, that they
herein had singular great wrong offered vnto them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
<hi>Apollo</hi> perceiuing, that this emulation might much
hinder the generall Reformation, to take away all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to yeeld some satisfaction to the discontented <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
to those <hi>Grecian Sages</hi> he adioyned <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> and
<hi>Annaus Seneca,</hi> and in fauour of the <hi>Italian Philosophers,</hi> hee
constituted <hi>Iacobus Mazzon Secretary of the Congregation,</hi>
whom he graced with a consultiue voyce.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ninteenth day of the aforesaid moneth, all these
famous <hi>Sages</hi> and new Reformers brauely accompanied
with a great Troupe of the Noblest Vertuous of this State
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6615:115"/>
went into the <hi>Delphick Palace,</hi> the place appointed for this
businesse of Reformation, and to the Learned it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sight to behold the great number of <hi>Pedantes,</hi> which
with table-books in their hands went quoting and laying
downe the <hi>Sentences</hi> and <hi>Apothegmes,</hi> which these conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
let slip out of their harmonious mouths.</p>
               <p>As soone as these learned and wise Lords were reunited
to declare their remedies, the fame is, that <hi>Thales the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesian,
the first of the seuen Sages,</hi> began in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most prudent Philosophers;</hi> The businesse for which we
are now here assembled together, is the greatest, which the
wit of man can treat of; and although no other enterprise
may be found so hard, as to heale an inueterate <hi>Neapolitane
bone-ache,</hi> an infistulated <hi>Gangrene,</hi> an incurable <hi>Canker,</hi> yet
notwithstanding, the insuperable difficulties, which weare
out other mens braines, ought to animate men of our ranke
to ouercome them, seeing that the supposed impossibilitie
of the <hi>Cure</hi> will augment our glory, and will maintaine vs
still in that sublime and high degree of reputation, wherein
we are eleuated; and now I firmly assure my selfe, that I
haue found out the true <hi>Antidote</hi> for the easie expulse of
these venemous and banefull corruptions. I am confident,
that there is not any of vs, but assures himselfe, that no other
disease hath infected the healthfull life of this present Age,
than the hidden hatred, dissimulation, equiuocation, and
treachery of men couered ouer with the faire mantle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
of Loue, Simplicitie, and Charity; the which, <hi>my
good Lords,</hi> being corrected with Cauteries, Razours, and
with Corrosiue Plaisters fit for this cancred wound, such as
I shall now discouer, all men liuing, which at this time are by
these vices brought euen to Deaths doore, all other <hi>Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
hauing left them without hope of recouery, shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
become restored to their former health, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that sinceritie, that verity of speech, and that holinesse
of life, which in ancient times hath beene esteemed true-hearted
candour, genuine simplicitie, and plaine dealing.
The true remedie then is of necessitie to reduce men into an
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:6615:115"/>
ingenuous kinde of liuing, and to embrace that simplicitie
of the heart, which they can neuer doe, before Princes haue
with their high authoritie chased out of their Kingdomes
irreligious hypocrites of a different Religion, as Wolfes of
State, and also to cut off wrangling suits at Law; nor these
can they euer bring to passe without diminishing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Lawyers, and needlesse Courts of Iustice, which
hearten euen sheepe to turne vpon their keepers. These,
these abuses, most <hi>vertuous Lords,</hi> being so restrained, then
lies, falshoods, double dealing, and hypocrisies, will depart,
as the chiefe nourishment of the <hi>Infernall Spirit</hi> out of the
possessed soules homeward to their Master the <hi>Deuill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In such wise did this opinion of <hi>Thales</hi> worke within the
rest of the <hi>Sages</hi> hearts, that he was ready to goe away with
all their suffrages and voices, when <hi>Mazzon</hi> the Secretary
commanded him to rehearse the same vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
so well of <hi>Thales</hi> his remedy, that he commanded
out of hand a Chirurgion to make a little window in the
heart of man. But in the same houre, when the Chirurgion
had prepared his instruments to open the breast of man for
that purpose, <hi>Homer, Virgil, Plato, Aristotle, Auerroes,</hi> and
some other learned men repaired to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and signified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Maiestie, that the chiefest instrument, which with
great facilitie gouerned the world, was the reputation of
those which commanded it, and that a iewel of that worth
ought neuer to be exposed vnto any perill by wise Princes.
They laid before his Maiesties consideration the credit of a
holy life, the opinion of the bounty of customes, wherein
the <hi>excellent Philosophicall Senate,</hi> and the <hi>Honourable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Vertuous</hi> were had in great reuerence among
all the learned Subiects of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Empire. And if his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
would suddenly cause all mens hearts to be opened, the
greatest and best sort of his Vertuous Followers could not
but suffer infinite shame &amp; infamie, whonow were in chiefe
credit about his sacred Person, when they should see euen
boyes to take notice of their foolishnesse, as who is wise at
all seasons? Yea and his Maiestie himselfe would grow
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6615:116"/>
into hatred with his most principall Fauourites, when hee
saw they were not such notable persons of an vnspotted life
as he reputed them to be. And by these meanes he should
lose the most part of his Dependants, to the vtter depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of famous <hi>Parnassus.</hi> And for this cause, before his
Maiestie would attempt this important enterprise, they
humbly desired in the name of all the Vertuous, to grant
them some competent time to purifie their mindes, and to
lay them a little a bucking. The aduise of these famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
greatly pleased. <hi>Apollo,</hi> and by a publike Edict he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
the terme of making the window vntill eight daies
were expired, in which time the Vertuous in such manner
toyled themselues in cleansing their minds of all hidden
fallacies, of counterfeit friendship, of inbred rancour, and
other stinking vices, that in the Grocers, Druggists,
and Apothecaries shops of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> all the sweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues,
Cinnamon, Cassia, Syrops, Lozenges, Roses, Violets,
and other pretious wares were all spoiled with the taint, and
the stench abounded so corrupt, that all the quarters of the
Platonick and Peripatetick Philosophers, smelt worse than
if the filthiest I akes of the Countrey were emptied; whereas
the street of the Latin and Italian Poets, smelt only like the
broth of reheated Coleworts. Now the time for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
bucking and purifying, that was limited, became
almost ended, when the day before the opening of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in mens hearts, the great <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Cornelius
Celsus,</hi> and other experimented Physitians of this State went
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and freely spake their minds in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Royall Sir,</hi> if this worke goes forward, wee must needs
deface this little world of mankinde, most noble for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
workmanship, wherewith it is wrought with eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
perill of an important musckle and a principall veine,
and by that meanes kill and destroy the whole fabricke of
<hi>Mans Microcosme,</hi> or at least make it for euer sickly and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
And so great an euill we might practise onely by the
benefit of foure ignorant persons, seeing that not only the
profoundest wits, but likewise men of meane iudgement
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6615:116"/>
onely with foure daies practise, which they may haue with
any notable Hypocrite whatsoeuer, they know how to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
into the most inward gutt. With <hi>Apollo</hi> this speech
of the Physitians so preuailed, that he resumed his former
deliberation, and by <hi>Ausonius Gallus</hi> made it knowne vnto
the <hi>Lords Reformers,</hi> that they should continue their <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall</hi>
opinions.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Solon</hi> thus began: The cruell hatred and poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enuie, which vniuersally breed among men, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere
ouer them in these daies, are these, <hi>most prudent Lords,</hi>
which to my thinking haue so confounded the world in the
case, as we see it. The correction then consisteth in insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Charitie in mens hearts, and the sacred loue towards
their Neighbours, which is one of the Precepts of God.
We must now imploy the whole engine of our ablest wits to
take away the occasions of <hi>Hatred,</hi> which make them so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
and implacable. I haue to the vttermost of my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
diued into the mysticall cause of this <hi>Hatred,</hi> and
I finde it to proceed of the inequalitie of worldly goods by
that hellish vsage of <hi>Mine and Thine</hi> among our worldlings,
the very rock of all scandals. And it is manifest, that mens
mindes depraued by Ambition, Couetousnesse, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
haue occasioned this inequality and disproportioned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision.
And seeing that is true, which all must confesse, that
this world is no other than an inheritance left by one Father
and one Mother vnto mankind, from whom as Brothers we
all descend; what Iustice is there, but that euery one of vs
should not haue share and share like throughout all the wide
world, the one as well as the other? But now it falls out
otherwise, that the Good and Vertuous haue the least part,
and the wicked the greatest part: The honest man a begger,
the dishonest by a preposterous order haue gotten their
right, and will not communicate the same, no not to their
owne flesh and bloud, and neerest kinne. Now I haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
vnto you the wound, it is easie to apply the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
The best aduise which I can giue, is to come vnto a
new diuision of the world, and to let euery man haue his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6615:117"/>
share; and by this meanes there will be enough for euery
one of vs without troubling one another: Though Tyrants
and Lawyers may for a time grudge at this equalitie, yet true
Iustice requires it for the pacifying of this vnnaturall hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barly.
And further to take away all disorders in time to
come, let there bee a Law enacted to forbid all chopping
and changing, all buying and selling to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>A long time this opinion of <hi>Solon</hi> was canuased, the
which although it was esteemed necessary, but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, by <hi>Bias, Periander,</hi> and <hi>Pittacus,</hi> was reproued
notwithstanding by the rest of the <hi>Philosophicall Lords;</hi>
whiles that the iudgement of the wise <hi>Seneca</hi> preuailed,
who with most liuely reasons made all the <hi>Lords of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
to vnderstand, that if now they should come to a
new diuision of the world againe, there would ensue a very
great disorder, that too great a part would fall into the share
of Gluttons, and too little among braue Spirits, who hold
Sobriety, Temperance, and Reason, the chiefe meanes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them, which beare the <hi>image of God</hi> in their soules
from bestiall <hi>Satanicall</hi> creatures; and that the <hi>Plague, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
and <hi>Warre</hi> were not, as many thought, the most rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
scourges wherewith God in his anger afflicts mankind,
but that the sorest and most grieuous whip, wherewith he
may torment them, is <hi>to enrich villaines,</hi> and base minded
misers, whose pelfe will at last worke the ruine of their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and better part being their Soules.</p>
               <p>As soone as <hi>Solons</hi> opinion was refelled, <hi>Chilon</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his: Which of you (quoth he) <hi>most wise Philosophers,</hi>
knowes not, That the insatiable <hi>thirst of Gold and Siluer</hi>
hath not occasioned such mischiefes in the world, as wee
all see and many of vs haue felt? What impietie, what
wickednesse, what vnnaturall act is there, which men will
not commit, and that with all diligence, to rake together a
masse of money and wealth? Conclude yee then all cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
with me, that to root those vices out of the world
wherewith this Age is corrupted, there is no better way than
to exterminate and vtterly to abolish the vse of those pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6615:117"/>
mettals, <hi>Gold and Siluer,</hi> the true prouocations of all
these miseries: <hi>Irrimenta malorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very goodly and specious in apparance seemed the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Chilon,</hi> but when it came to the scanning and triall,
it proued not solid at the stroke of the hammer of liuely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Because it was answered, that men had brought the vse
of Gold and Siluer, that it might stand for the measure and
counterpoyse of all bargains &amp; commerce betwixt party and
party. And if Gold and Siluer were prohibited, they must
of force imploy some other mettall or commoditie to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their necessities, which likewise would replenish the
world with the same greedinesse of minde as before: As in
some part of the <hi>Indies</hi> they vse shels as currant as wee doe
money. And <hi>Cleobulus</hi> in particular with a kinde of <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi>
scoffe said; <hi>My Lords,</hi> we may as well banish out
of the world <hi>Iron,</hi> seeing that it is also a mettall, which hath
wrought infinite confusion among men. <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Siluer</hi>
for the vse destinated of <hi>God</hi> to be the balancing proportion
of all things, whereas <hi>Iron</hi> produced of Nature to make
Ploughs, Spades, Harrowes, necessarie tooles for tillage
and gardens, as for buildings, hath beene maliciously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
toswords, poniards, and other instruments of war to
destroy mankind.</p>
               <p>With this opinion of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> albeit most true, it was
neuerthelesse concluded by all <hi>the Lords of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that it being a thing impossible to conuert <hi>Iron</hi> from
men without peruerting <hi>Iron,</hi> it should be no prudence to
multiply their miseries, and to heale the wound with more
blowes. Vnanimously it was resolued and concluded, that
men should still retaine the mettals of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Siluer,</hi> but
to admonish the <hi>Refiners</hi> to take care for the well purifying
of them, &amp; not to lift them off from the fire, vntill they were
throughly assured that they had cleansed them from that
clammie and fast clinging <hi>Turpentine,</hi> which these kinde of
mettals haue in them, which caused that their Coines stucke
exceeding fast to mens hands, yea sometimes to their hands,
whom the world reputes for honest men.</p>

After this with extraordinary grauity <hi>Pitiacus</hi> began
thus: The world, most learned Philosophers, is fallen into
deplorable miseries, because this moderne generation of
mankind haue relinquished the beaten way of Vertue, and
haue chose to walke through those crooked by-paths of
Vice, whereby they steale away those Rewards due onely to
the Vertuous. Things are now reduced, Lords, to this passe,
that no man enters into the house of Dignities, of Honors, &amp;
of Rewards as in old time, through the Gate of Merit, true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
and by vertuous paines, but by the windowes they clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
like vnto filching theeues, which climbe to peare-trees
with their back-sides turned to the true owners. Yea, and
we haue known some, with the force of fauours and Violence
of Bribes haue not beene ashamed to enter through the tops
of Chimneyes, and by casting downe the tiles, haue through
the very roofe come into the house of Honour. To amend
this corrupted course of behauiour, the best way in my
iudgement is to decree vpon paine of Death, that no man
hereafter be so hardy, as to get into any well-deseruing place,
whether it be of Honor or Gaine, but by the Royall high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Desert; and to shut vp all other darke and damnable
wayes, onely fit for Scritchowles, and Sauage Beasts. This is
a great disheartning of our Learned rancke. Wherehence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our best vnderstanding Spirits doe verily beleeue, that
those Hypocrites haue ioyned vnto their Craft the Spels of
the Magicke Art, and thereby, like <hi>Zoroastres,</hi> they bewitch,
enchant, an taint the mindes of some Princes, yea and those
of the wiser sort.</p>
               <p>All the Reforming Lords admired this speech of <hi>Pittacus,</hi>
and were about to conclude with him, if <hi>Periander</hi> had not
thus opposed: The disorder specified by <hi>Pittacus,</hi> most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Lords, is very true; but for what cause a iudicious and
wise Prince refuseth to preferre vertuous and learned men so
pleasing to God, so honourable and profitable for his State:
and wherefore in their stead hee serues himselfe, being the
life and fountaine of all goodnesse, or at least seeming so to
be, with debauched, vnworthy, and base-minded wretches,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6615:118"/>
is a point of great import and to be considered of vs. I know
the common opinion is, that the Prince chuseth men which
are like to humour and sooth him vp in his affections before
the best deseruing Creature. And I acknowledge that it is a
Rule of State, for a wise Prince to aduance no man to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
but either for his wisedome or valour. This founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Rule of State is well knowne vnto him, yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sheweth, that few Princes practise it, and mocke at such
as shall tell them that they doe the contrary by a carelesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the honour of their place. But the truth is, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
ignorant persons, new fellowes, and of small desert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
learned and vertuous men, not by any default of their
side, but by errors (I am sorry to speake it) of the learned
and vertuous themselues. I confesse with you, that Princes
haue need of such, and of braue minded Commanders for the
warres. But none of you will deny, but they stand in more
need of loyall and faithfull Ministers of State, who with the
gift of Secrecie may stead them as much as all their Treasure.
And now it is more than apparant, that if honourable perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
and valiant Souldiors had bin as true &amp; Secret to their
Countrey, as they ought, we should not behold the infinite
disorders, which we see and obserue to our great griefe in
this present age, euen Pigmeyes in foure dayes to shoot vp
as tall as Giants, and all these vnworthy spectacles to happen
for want of Fidelity, and firme regard to the interest of State.
So corrupted is the mind of many men, that forgetting their
owne worths and valorous magnamities, they will bee
tempted with gold and ambition, yea and after sufficient
promotion by their natiue Prince some haue turned so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,
as to become mercenary slaues to another Prince.
Which disasters Princes distrusting, they are faine to confer
Honour and Offices vnto vnworthy persons, who might
serue them with their Secrecie and Fidelity, and proue more
thankefull for their fauours.</p>
               <p>As soone as <hi>Periander</hi> had ended his Opinion, <hi>Bias</hi> spake
in this wise: There is not any among vs here, but knowes,
most wise Lords, that the world is become so much depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6615:119"/>
because Mankind is departed from those sacred Lawes
of a contented state, the which God from the beginning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
vnto euery Nation, hauing assigned seuerall stations,
out of which they ought not to breake out. The <hi>Britaines,
diuisos orbe Britannos,</hi> he hath placed in <hi>Albion,</hi> as in another
world by themselues, the <hi>Gothes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations in other habitations. And because euery one
of them should not trespasse, or like a Deluge breake out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their bordering Neighbours. His foreseeing Maiestie fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the fearefull Ocean to compasse about <hi>Great Britaine,</hi>
the <hi>Pyrenaean Mountaines,</hi> as a wall betwixt <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Alpes</hi> betweene the <hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as
some part of them deuides this from <hi>France</hi> also. The like
wary diuision the Diuine Maiestie hath set betwixt <hi>Europe</hi> &amp;
<hi>Africke,</hi> as the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas. The which hee did of
purpose, that none should encroch vpon the other, and not
mingle one with anothers language, as heretofore fell out at
<hi>Babel,</hi> nor subiect the other to forraigne Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
whereby each one liuing at home with their neerest
kinne might agree the better together without innouations
or Tyrannies, and not like Drones, intrude into other mens
liues to purloyne the sweet, which others wrought. Now for
as much as the world is infected with the company and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of strange Nations, let euery Nation be ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into his proper limitation; and for feare of the like so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and violent intrusions in time to come, let it be also
enacted, that no ships be suffered to passe for the space of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares to come, nor any to be built, and if any Bridges lie
betwixt seuerall Principalities, to sunder them the better, that
these Bridges be pulled downe. If this course be taken, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
shall liue more peaceably in their owne natiue soile. With
wondefull great attention this Declaration of <hi>Bias</hi> was
heard, the which notwithstanding it was subtilly examined
by the profound wits of the Congregation, at the last seemed
not expedient to be put in practise, by reason that they knew
that the hatred, though excessiue, which reigned amogst
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6615:119"/>
diuers Nations, are not naturall, as some very simply haue
coniectured, but occasioned either by the artificiall sleights
of some Princes, or at least by the cunning tricks of some of
their principall Ministers to busie their Princes and States
braines, while they enriched their Cofers with part of the
Treasures, which were to be laid out for the warres, or casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought into the Kingdome from the warres, as prizes and
booties. Besides, some Princes are skilfull masters to put in
execution that old Maxime of policie: <hi>Diuide &amp; Impera;</hi>
Diuide and command. As for <hi>Bias</hi> his counsell to forbid
Nauigation, who knowes not but among all Nations vnited
together that harmonicall perfection is pickt out for politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Gouernment, which cannot be found in any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
States, and this is gotten by peregrination into forreine
countries, so that an expert Traueller returnes home like the
grand <hi>Vlysses,</hi> hauing bettered his vnderstanding facultie by
noting the diuersities of Spirits, manners, Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.
To this may be added the other exceeding great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
as arise by Nauigation, as the establishing of Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where their owne countrey ouerswarmes with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people, the transportation of Commodities, and the
ciuilizing of Sauage Nations. They obserue the wonderfull
difference of Climates, the seuerall natures of the cold, the
temperate, and the <hi>Torrid Zones,</hi> with many other remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
euents, to the glory of our Creatour and their vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pleasure.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cleobulus</hi> desired leaue to speake, who boldly thus
began: As farre I see, we proceed like those light-headed
fellowes, who make publike Languages with new conceits
and curious fancies, to the outside beautifull, but not with
matter of profit, as might edifie and reforme the world, the
onely cause of our <hi>meeting at this time.</hi> To what purpose
then for the rooting out of <hi>Vias</hi> should we open a window in

Maiestie? Wherefore should we vndertake that most paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
charge and taske for the diuiding of the vast wide world
into equall parts, as <hi>Solon</hi> proposed? The opinions of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:6615:120"/>
for banishing of Gold and Siluer out of the world, of <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi>
to enforce men to walke the beaten way of Merit and
Vertue, of <hi>Bias</hi> to limit men their habitations, and to forbid
Nauigation the miracle of this world, what are all these but
Sophisticall Dreames, and Chymerizing Ideas of shallow
imaginatiue Schollers, no way participating of the practicke
reall way to extreminate those moderne corruptions, which
are crept into the world? we must not treat of impossibilities,
but fall to mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers actually in earnest, and to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not how things ought to be done, but how substantially
to reforme the world, according as now we find it most
strangely deformed; and this we must performe warily, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
and without long arguing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> or criticall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduersions,
the cause of new tumults. In briefe then I say,
that all the reformation of this present Age consisteth in
these few words: <hi>To reward the good, and to punish the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Cleobulus</hi> rested, against whom <hi>Thales</hi> thus violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposed, shewing vnto all men, how dangerous a thing it
is, albeit for the Truths sake, to offend those persons, who
liue in the repute of Freedome and Prudence, which made
this sage Philosopher breake forth into these speeches: Both
these Reuerend Lords and my selfe, most wise <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you had derided and despised our Opinion as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall
and Chymerizing, expected some rare proiect to
proceed from your prudent braine, or that you had brought
from the <hi>Indies</hi> some new and miraculous <hi>Bezoar</hi> for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
cure of the present enormities, when you sleighted our
cares, and propounded a Receit more, I will not say difficult,
but indeed impossible, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might pose &amp; go beyond euen the
most curious Princes of secrets, <hi>Caius Plin.</hi> &amp; <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
There is not any of vs here, my <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> but knows, that
the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rewarding the good,
and punishing the wicked. Therefore let me demand of you,
I pray, who be those good men and those wicked? And then
I will returne you this resolution, that that man liueth not,
which can discerne and distinguish Truth from Hypocrisie.
Doe you not perceiue, that counterfeit Art and dissimulation
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6615:120"/>
are in these times growne to that height of perfection, that
a great number of Spirits are so artificially and cunningly
wicked, which seeme to wise men to be currantly good?
And that those good men, which liue sincerely, ingenuously,
simply, as innocent as Doues, without the least painting or
dawbing of Hypocrisie, are reputed scandalous, and of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine
loose behauiour? All men naturally loue the good,
and hate the euill. Yea and most Princes themselues doe so
as well by naturall instinct, as in respect of Interest of State.
And when Hypocrites or slie crafty knaues are exalted to
promotion, and the good are vilipended and neglected, that
comes to passe not by the Election of Princes, but through
the deceit and fraudulent tricks of others. Onely true
bounty and ingenuous Candour are knowne to God and by
him rewarded. By him Vices are discouered &amp; punished, for
he alone entreth into the depth and profundity of the heart.
Yea, and my selfe too with opening the window in mans
breast had pierced into the bottome of mens thoughts, had
not the enemy of this honest proiect and profitable field
wherein I had sowne this memorable Graine, cast in before
me his Seed of Tares.</p>
               <p>Incredible satisfaction did these words of <hi>Thales</hi> produce
to the Congregation, who casting their eyes vpon <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
he as if he had been bidden to shew his reason, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:
The diuersitie of Opinions, which hitherto I haue
heard of you, most prudent Philosophers, confirme mee in
my ancient Opinion, tht many a man doth die, because Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
haue not apprehended the certainty of their Patients
disease. For which errours of theirs, they are to be excused,
because men may easily be deceiued in these things, to the
knowledge of which they walke onely with the feet of aime
and coniecture. But for vs, who are thought by his Maiesty,
to be the curers of the world, to be ignorant in the cure of
this diseased world, it is the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shame, by how much the
disease increaseth. Yet as farre as I see hitherto by reason of
the varieties of the medicines, wee goe about to heale the
arme in stead of the breast that is corrupted. The truth is, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6615:121"/>
Disorders haue euer raigned among men. But now adaies by
reason of the Worlds decrepit age, which cause men to
abound with Auarice, Ambition, and Pride, the true occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Hatred.</hi> These being occasioned by some mighty
Potentates, which intrude vpon their Neighbours states,
haue bred in continuance of time iealousies, warres, and as
it were an hereditary heart-burning of one Nation against
the other. The medicine therefore is, that Princes repent
them, and content themselues with a moderate fortune, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their neighbours at rest, and not vnder some imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
pretences challenge a Catholicke Supremacie ouer
their brethren.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Periander</hi> ended his discourse, whom <hi>Solon</hi> thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
The true causes of the present euills, <hi>O Periander,</hi>
were not omitted by vs of ignorance, as you perhaps sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but of a wary circumspection. The world from the
beginning hath bin corrupted, and still continues. Yet it is a
point of Prudence to winke at some disorders, rather than
with danger to seeke to remoue them. All men liuing haue
some faults. And many dishonourable acts which Princes
perpetrate, we must not meddle with, lest we aggrauate and
make them incurable, whom Time may correct. Therefore
let a wise man either speake charitably of their spots, or hold
his peace. For we shall finde worke enough to reforme the
hatred of the common sort; by whom they proceed wee
must not scan, but referre the prime workers of their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to <hi>the King of Kings,</hi> who sometimes hardens <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
for their owne ruine, or <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> for scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to punish his rebellious seruants.</p>
               <p>With these words, applauded of the Congregation, <hi>Solon</hi>
made end of his speech. After whom <hi>Cato</hi> began in this
manner: Exceeding well haue yee parlied, <hi>O graue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Grecians,</hi> in shewing the meanes to supplant and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<hi>Hatred</hi> and other humane vices. But as I conceiue,
they are those, which languish of an incurable <hi>Ptisick,</hi> which
spit vp their lungs, and do cast off their haire. In men there
is no helpe; therefore the best aduice which I can giue, is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6615:121"/>
to desire a finall consummation of the world, and for vs to
ioyne in prayer to the <hi>Diuine Maiestie,</hi> to open the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts
and windowes of Heauen to drowne the whole Earth
againe, yet with prouiso, to preserue in new Arks all those
male children, which haue not past twelue yeares of age,
and that of all the <hi>Feminine Sexe,</hi> of what age soeuer, there
may remaine no other thing behind them, saue their vnlucky
memorie. And I beseech the <hi>Diuine Maiestie,</hi> that euen as
he hath allotted vnto <hi>Bees, Fish,</hi> and to other infinite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that prized and singular benefit to breed without the
helpe of the Female kinde, that the like grace he will graunt
vnto men. For, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I am assured, that while <hi>women</hi>
liue in the world, that <hi>men</hi> will proue but <hi>a Swinish heard
of vngratious brood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not possible to beleeue, how much the <hi>Congregation</hi>
did stomacke this discourse of <hi>Cato,</hi> who had this conceit of
the new Deluge in such horrour, that all the rest of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Philosophers</hi> fell prostrate vpon the ground with
their hands lift vp towards Heauen, and deuoutly desired
<hi>God</hi> to preserue the pretious <hi>Sexe of Women,</hi> and to defend
<hi>Mankind</hi> from any such inundations, which none would
wish but frantick braines, or Chymerizing Heteroclites; and
also to protect them from fraudulent Make-bates, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of the Lawes with their mercenarie tongues put
euen the best natur'd by the eares; and that if men would
not be ruled to follow more wholsome counsell, hee would
beat them with his scourges of Famine, Warre, and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
vntill they were made to know themselues, and their
duties to their Neighbours; And if it pleased not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
to be so seuere and rigorous, yet that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
of his Soueraigne Bounty to grant this one request,
<hi>Not to enrich villaines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This vnhappy euent had the opinion of <hi>Cato,</hi> when <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
thus began his Discourse: The <hi>Reformations</hi> of these
moderne abuses, as I conceiue, ought not to be handled too
bitterly, before they be first dealt with gentle hands, and
managed with some milde medicines in the beginning of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6615:122"/>
their Cure. For what shame will redound to that Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
whose Patient happens to die with his Recipe still in
his body remaining? To passe from one extremitie to an
other, and to neglect the due meanes is rash counsell; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Man is not capable of sudden and violent mutations.
And seeing that wee finde that the world in thousands of
yeares is now fallen into this dangerous infirmity of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he is not very wise, nay very foolish, which thinks in
a few daies to reduce this corrupted body to his former
health. A grosse and corpulent person, if the Physitian thinks
it expedient to bring him low and leane, is to be prescribed
a Diet of one kind of meat at his meale, and to feed each day
lesse than other, that so by degrees he forgoe his gurmandise
and gluttonous custome. And so a sickly person vpon his
recouerie, or a <hi>Sea-man</hi> returning from a long voyage must
for the first fortnight sup broths, gellies, and such weake
nourishments, vntill time reduce him stronger to feed on
stronger meats; to which agrees that <hi>Aphorisme</hi> of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
Corpora, quae longo tempore extenuantur, lentè refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
oportet.</hi> Besides this, both the quality of the Reformers,
and the condition of them which haue need of reformation,
are to be considered. As for example, our selues, who at
this present are appointed to reforme the World, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be reformed, are Schollers, Book-sellers, Clerks, Pen
and Inke men, or such like, we may preuaile to censure and
correct their faults. But if we goe out of our limits, and
enter into other mens professions and trades to reforme
their enormities and knauish customes, we shall proue like
that ridiculous <hi>Cobler,</hi> who going beyond his naule, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to iudge of colours, and to censure the exquisite picture
of <hi>Apelles.</hi> Let vs which are Schollers meddle with matters
onely in our clement. Which of vs, I pray here, haue euer
dealt among <hi>Taylors,</hi> to iudge of their deceits; among
<hi>Vintners,</hi> to tell of their sophisticating of wines; among
<hi>Butchers,</hi> to shew their blowing vp of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh; among <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
to censure of <hi>Simony;</hi> or among <hi>Lawyers,</hi> to entrap
them in their equiuocations, quirks, and quillets? yet all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:6615:122"/>
these require reformations, and the whole Earth grones and
cries for ease and peace. But shall we aduenture to put our
hands to hinder these disorders so far remote from our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions?
Shall we like so many blind bayards, endeuour
to stop bottles so crackt and cleft, and by that meanes let
all the wine to spill about the roome? Then surely will a
true Reformation fall out, and not before, when the Mariner
is called forth to shew his iudgment of the Seas and Winds,
the Souldier of marshalling a Battell, the Shepheard of his
fleece, and he that hath beene beaten by Lawyers and baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld
by their iuglings, can best demonstrate vnto vs, how
to tame their <hi>Hydra</hi> furies and poysonous qualities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs call vnto vs out of euery Craft, Mysterie, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
foure of the honestest, most renouned for their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
of life, and confer with them touching the meanes,
how to amend what is amisse.</p>
               <p>Although this graue counsell greatly pleased <hi>Pittacus</hi> and
<hi>Chilon,</hi> yet all the rest detested it as bad as <hi>Catoes,</hi> saying,
that he offred them a scandalous affront, and an indignitie
to <hi>Apollocs</hi> Maiestie, to call in such base-minded people not
traind vp in <hi>Philosophy</hi> to be ioyned with men of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
And that they were the Soules pretious faculties,
which gaue the well-being to a businesse of this nature,
which those wanted. Further, they concurred in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
with might and maine, to preserue the Iurisdiction of
their Philosophicall Court, whereof they protested to be as
iealous as Husbands of their fairest Wiues; And that they
thought so wise a man as <hi>Seneca</hi> was reputed to be, being
the <hi>Archphilosopher</hi> of the <hi>Latines</hi> would haue yeelded to
haue twenty ounces of his bloud drawne out of the best
veine of his life, than to perswade them to lose one ounce
of their Iurisdiction, whereon their reputation consisted.</p>

                     </gap>s</hi> after they had thus checkt <hi>Seneca,</hi>
were wonderfully perplext, and in a manner hopelesse of
effecting any good, because <hi>Mazzon</hi> who was yet to speake,
they adiudged a new man, and without experience. Yet now
that his turne came to speake, he thus pithily spake: Not

by any desert of mine, <hi>most prudent Philosophers,</hi> but by his
Maiesties meere and speciall fauour am I admitted into this
Honourable Assembly. And I freely acknowledge, that at
this vertuous meeting it were my part to imploy my eares,
rather than my tongue, being fitter to learne and to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
And if that any other matter had beene to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sauing this, I would not presume to speake. But because
the subiect now in hand concernes the reformation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
disorders, which now adaies raigne in the world, I
being a moderne man, euen now come from the world,
where I left them continually disputing and keeping a stir
about reformations, am the better incouraged to lay my hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
hand, and though I say it, I am as good a Proficient in
this matter, as <hi>Euclide</hi> in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> The true cure
of the bodies disease is to visit the sicke in person, and to
conferre with him of the causes and other occurrences of
his sicknesse. Euen so for the cure of the Worlds infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
let vs call in the World himselfe, question with him,
feele his pulses, and looke vpon the diseased parts of his
body, whereby the Cure may become the sooner remedied,
which now seems desperate and incurable.</p>
               <p>In such wise did this aduice please the <hi>Lords of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
that they suddenly commanded the World to
be called vnto them, who incontinently made his repaire,
being drawne in a Coach by the foure Seasons of the Yeare,
and by them was led into the <hi>Delphick Palace.</hi> Hee was a
man well stricken in yeares, yet seemed to be of a galliard
and robustuous complexion, which betokened that hee
might liue many yeares longer. Onely it seemed, that he
had a wheezing in his pipes with some difficulty of breath,
and in speaking he shewed himselfe to be somewhat hoarse,
and wept continually, which argued he ayled somewhat, and
laboured as yet more with some grieuous tormenting paine
in his braine or some other inward part of his body. The
Philosophers askt him, how hee had his face so ruddy and
Iouially appearing, which was a signe that he was in health,
hauing store of pure radicall moysture, full of naturall heat,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6615:123"/>
and could not but haue a good stomack. And they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that about a hundred yeares sithence, they had seene
him looke yellow, as if hee had beene sicke of the yellow
Iaundise, yet now it seemed vnto them, that hee was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
But for all that they charged him freely to open his
griefes, that they might prescribe thereafter some remedies
to helpe him.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>World</hi> answered: <hi>My Lords,</hi> Presently
after I was borne, I fell into sicknesses and griefes, whereof
I languish at this instant. My face, which you behold so
seeming red, is done ouer with Ladies licks, slicks, and
other painting stuffe of the <hi>Levant.</hi> My Infirmitie is like
the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, with the self-same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, for all it seemes to increase, and fall; but with this
interchangeable course, that when I haue a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
outwardly, my griefe lies within mee, as I feele my
selfe at this instant: And when I looke ill outwardly, I am
in perfect health within. But if you please to try in what
case I am indeed without dissembling any longer my mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
pull off my maske and gaudy coat, and you shall see
when I am starke naked, that I am indeed but a liuing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case.
The Philosophers out of hand disrobed him, and
when the <hi>World</hi> was stript naked, they saw, that the poore
vnfortunate Creature had a scurfe foure fingers thicke ouer
his flesh, as bad as the Leprosie, or the Catholicke disease,
which did eat into his flesh dangerously: Whereupon the
wise <hi>Reformers</hi> tooke ten Razours, and euery one of them
with a Razour began very diligently to shaue and pare off
that thicke scurfe in apparance, and busied themselues so
long, vntill they pierced to the quicke bone, but could not
in this huge <hi>Colossus</hi> meet with one Ounce of good substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
flesh. Which when the <hi>Reformers</hi> perceiued, they stood
a while amazed, and when they had reuested him with his
maske and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oolish Robes, they licensed him to depart. And
then after conference among themselues, concluding the
Cure too desperate and past helpe, they abandoned the
care of their publike thoughts, and resolued to prouide for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6615:124"/>
the sauing of their priuate reputation vnstaind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they all ioyned together to satisfie the common peoples
expectations, and because they should see they were not
idle, nor carelesse of their good, they caused <hi>Mazzon</hi> the
Secretary to pen and publish the <hi>generall Reformation,</hi>
wherein with a preamble of magnificall words, they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the world, the perpetuall care which his <hi>Maiestie</hi>
tooke for the vertuous conuersation of his <hi>Learned Societie,</hi>
of his indefatigable paines from time to time, sustained for
the safetie of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and of the infinite labour and toyle
of the <hi>Lords Reformers</hi> for the compiling and setting out
of good <hi>Orders;</hi> and afterwards descending to particulars,
they did put downe the prices of Coleworts, Pilchards,
Pumpions and Melons. And now when all the Lords were
ready to subscribe to the Proclamation, <hi>Thales the Milesian</hi>
remembred them, that some slie <hi>Hucksters,</hi> when they sold
Lupines, Pease, and Oaten meale, vsed a little Dish, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
was a most intolerable scandall not to foresee this disorder.
This last aduice of <hi>Thales</hi> seemed very expedient to the
whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> and as most necessary it was added to
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that these Dishes should be greater there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from thence forwards. Presently after they caused the
Gates of the Palace to be opened, and going into the Market
place, they commanded the <hi>Cryer</hi> to reade the <hi>Proclamation</hi>
concerning the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which was done
with such applause and ioy to euery man, that all <hi>Parnassus</hi>
rebounded with their clamours and shouts, as tokens of the
great contentments they tooke for this serious and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<hi>Reformation.</hi> But the wisest sort smelt out the drift,
and laughed in their sleeues to see the rascality and foolish
Idiots to delight themselues with bables, as babies with
nuts. Men of vnderstanding know, that vices will abound,
as long as men liue in the world, <hi>Vitia erunt donec homines;</hi>
and that humane Prudence doth consist in this, to haue wit
sufficient for this one difficult resolution, <hi>to forsake the world
as another hath found it,</hi> or <hi>to liue as not to liue.</hi>

               <p>I Could wish in these present stirres of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> that I were
rather a Minister and an executioner of your Maiesties

your Maiestie and my country. The most sacred King Treats
now, whether he ought to lay downe armes and hostilitie,

the situation of this place, being in the midst of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi>
we hold the residue of <hi>Italy</hi> bridled, that they dare not stirre
to oppose our wills. The which things although they bee
knowne vnto this most prudent Councell, and better yet to
your Maiestie, I would notwithstanding put you in minde
thereof, because you might excuse me, if I seemed perchance
fearefull or iealous for the preseruation thereof; and certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when I shall conceiue that there is some securitie and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in these courses which now are propounded, I will
then rancke my selfe among the first to incline to peace, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that after our tedious and long warres in <hi>Flaunders,</hi>
which haue consumed both the men and Kingdomes, wee
might breathe a while, and recouer some fresh blood, and also
refresh our drooping vitall Spirits, to be the better able one

                  </gap>se propounded Treaties? The Popes Nuntio doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that if we would free the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> from the feare

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:6615:125"/>
disarme, and hold himselfe alwayes hereafter your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties

preiudiciall to the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> And to secure vs
from fraud, that he shall leaue his second Sonne at your

separating himselfe from the friendship and aliance of
<hi>France;</hi> nor that he will oppose himselfe against their forces,
when they shall attempt to assault this State of <hi>Milan.</hi> And
who doth not here see his fraud, as if we were so simple in
beleefe, and knew not how to diue where his thoughts ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
Are not we sufficiently choked and made perfect of his
cunning deuices? Seeing that the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> hath
written from <hi>Milan,</hi> that we ought not to trust him; that his
Treaties and practises holden with the King of <hi>France</hi> were
most certaine for the surprizing of that State; let no man tell
me, that it is securitie sufficient to lay a sonne of his in our
hands for hostage, because he hauing other sonnes left him
at home, among whom is his Eldest sonne, will neuer care
to remoue him hence to hinder his designes, no more
then King <hi>Francis</hi> was hindred and stayed from raising
Armes against the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, after hee had
left his two sonnes in pledge: Or the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who
for all that he had giuen a Son of his in pawne, desisted not to
conspire the ruine of <hi>Flanders</hi> against your most glorious
Father. He hath declared himselfe what he is, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of conscience he feeles, that now hath complotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a King, his Kinsman and Benefactour; against that
house, which twise restored him to the State which he holds,
in that he would compasse and effect the <hi>French</hi> Match, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
your Maiesties disagreement and disswasion.
For your Maiestie fore-saw, that this match would proue a
Seminary of Discord, and a rocke of Scandall. Now he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and compasseth by all meanes onely to auoid the present
perill, and to watch an occasion to deceiue vs another time,
or to take vs vnprouided. For all this, hee comes not with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6615:126"/>
humilitie to procure pardon from the magnanimity and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerositie
of your most sacred mind, but casting himselfe into
the armes of your enemies with weapons in hand, and with
threats he goes about to terrifie you, and with the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
to force your Maiestie to a peace no lesse ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
then ill secured. We haue too much lost (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
forme to speake the truth) our reputation in yeelding to
a Truce with the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> though the same was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
necessary for our Affaires in regard of the difficulty
to sustaine the charge of a warre so farre remote. To which
now let vs adioyne this point, that there is not so vile an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary,
who dares not to moue and conuert his thoughts at
euery nouelty, and already we see the rest of the <hi>Italians</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with our Greatnesse, willing to rise against vs, yea,
and to call the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Turkes</hi> in to their succour, albeit
with their owne dangers, if God and the Angell Guardians
of your Crowne doe not worke continuall miracles for our
Defence, truely I cannot see, who shall deliuer vs. What
then remaines? <hi>Most sacred King,</hi> I am of opinion, that
Peace is not to be refused, so that the same be concluded with
safety, the which can no way be, but by holding in <hi>deposit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and impawned in your hands those Forts, which shall be
thought fit by your Captaines, and to releeue them vpon
his cost, and for your good, or at least that hee disburse the
greatest part of the expence occasioned hitherto through
his default. This Demaund ought not to seeme strange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, seeing he hath wittingly and aduisedly vsed such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and deceits so oftentimes against you. Therefore
we must let him vnderstand, that we may not repose any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in him, except we haue these Forts in pledge, that so
we may safely with our Reputation, reduce our matters to a
sound issue, not leauing place for him in reason to complaine
of vs as the Authours of the warre. But if the Duke will not
consent to these our iust demaunds, and will refuse to receiue
our Garrisons into his Forts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am of the minde it is better
to make warre against him, then by protracting time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6615:126"/>
troubles hereafter in our owne home. Another time
we may runne into a greater hazzard, and wee may haue to
doe with a more powerfull Prince. In the meane while it is
conuenient for your Maiesties honour to aduenture all into
the hand of Fortune, then voluntarily to yeeld with so great
indignitie to conditions of so little safety. Howbeit I see not
where those dangers lie, which some would make so great.
I am sure, that in respect of the Iustice of the cause, where a
man is not stirred with any desire to spoyle another of his
due, but with necessity to preserue his owne State, and that
with greater facility then some imagine, the Duke of <hi>Sauoyes</hi>
power is not stronger then ours. I am sure, that hee is in a
manner weake, and for two reasons to be slighted, as well in
knowing him to be dangerously suspected, as also in that he
is driuen to stand Armed and on his guard, which cannot
but consume him in a short time. Nor doth their opinion
any whit moue me, which say that he shall not want succours
out of <hi>France,</hi> and out of those parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
for their preseruation, because the <hi>French</hi> which
should aide him, are deriued from a Gouernment, whereof
the Head is a Woman, diuided in Religion, full of emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of sundry disagreements among themselues, where
it is no hard matter still to nourish and increase their doubts
with their dissentions and diuersified resolutions, so that the
effects of them will fall out to be of small securitie, vaine, or
long and vncertaine.</p>
               <p>And the dessignes of the <hi>Italians</hi> enuironed with our bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
States are become weakned and worne out by the
sodaine death of the <hi>French</hi> King, in whom they had groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their hopes; so that now being afraid of our nighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Forces, and by the rising Fortunes of your Maiestie,
they wil not presume openly to descend into this warre, but
rather by obseruing other mens proceedings, and vainely
trusting to the benefit of the time, they will stand idle as
mournfull spectators of the tempest, which beates on their
Neighbours fields; vnto whom it shall be in your Maiesties
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6615:127"/>
power to giue them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orme and Law, whatsoeuer your
Benignity shall please to impose, and hereafter shall be adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
according to the times. Neither let your Maiestie faile
to entertaine them with sundry cautions and artificiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and with protestations to affirme vnto them, that what
you take away from their Father, you will restore it to the
Sonne, granting that to your Bloud, which now you haue
denyed to the Father for his ill deserts. With these hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
promises let the Prince <hi>Philebert</hi> be fed, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
made much off. In the meane time then let the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions
for the warre be speedily hastened on, assembling
souldiers out of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> which are not enfeebled,
as some (I know not whether they doe it of zeale or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest)
doe expresse, to minister an occasion to the enemy of
insulting. We haue men for number and valour sufficient
for a greater enterprize then this, among these good store of
old Souldiers exercised in the Warres of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi>
nor are there wanting Captaines of estimation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>And if your Treasure seemes somewhat scanted, you haue
a way to find out so much money as you please, by departing
with diuers Merchandises, and by feeding your Creditors
with the particulars of the Fleets at their returne from the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and also by other extraordinary meanes. And seeing
that your Maiestie hath no warres at this present in any
other parts, the ordinary Reuenues of your Kingdomes are
enough to supply the charge of this warre. Besides the seat
of the warre will fall out to be in a great part of the Enemies
owne Territories, which will euery day produce more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
conditions. Onely let your Maiestie resolue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to passe (as <hi>Caesar</hi> did) the <hi>Rubicon;</hi> and then all
things will succeed easie, plaine, and the fruits of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will alwayes ouercome the lightnesse of beliefe. Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are rare, and you had need to meet with them: For

without vnsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

shewes that he hath had but small doings in the world. God

Shall we for friuolous suspicions of remote dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
contemne liuely and assured hopes?</p>
               <p>I doe then conclude, Most inuincible King, that vnlesse
we may haue some Forts impawned into our hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which the State of <hi>Milan</hi> will still remaine in the
same perill, we ought not in any wise to embrace that other
Treaty, which is offered by the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> nor to stay so
long vntill the new King of <hi>France</hi> bee growne to his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
yeares, lest hee be then incited and prouoked by this
Duke, who is full of vast and irregular conceits to passe the
mountaines to your dammage, but now whilest he is a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill,
it is necessary to preuent the inconuenience and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Warre into the Enemies Land. I beseech your
Maiestie to consider with what good opportunity the way
is made open for you to the <hi>Monarchy of Italy,</hi> and to the
greater part of <hi>Europe,</hi> as God hath lately fauoured you.
In what manner hath hee dissipated and confounded our
Enemies Counsels by the sodaine death of <hi>Henry</hi> the

               <p>That Kingdome is now without a Head, <hi>Italy</hi> disunited
and weake, <hi>Germany</hi> all tottered and diuided; The <hi>Turke</hi> is
beaten backe, and intangled in the Warres of the <hi>Levant,</hi>
so that none is able to withstand your designes. The Iniury
is apparant, which prickes you to a iust reuenge, and frees
you from any blot of too much desire of Rule. Your Age
which is now at the flowre, is pried into, and expected that
it walke with some trauell through the way of Glory, with
the which your Greatnesse shall no lesse bee conioyned,
then the Aduancement of Religion, together with the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all Christendome. By which proceedings we shall see
