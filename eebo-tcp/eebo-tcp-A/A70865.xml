            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I never heard ſo much good of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> except from Popiſh Interpreters, who tell us out of the Traditions of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and out of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Martyrologies, that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was a godly man, and a Diſciple of the Apoſtles. Sure I am, our beſt Interpreters judge of him, as an irreligious Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, adieophorit, neutraliſt, Nullifidian.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His principall end and ſcope was not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing of the Apoſtles, but the preſervation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">Act. 5. 26.</note> and the Councell from the wrath of the people of the Jewes, whom he feared, becauſe they favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and magnified the Apoſtles and from the wrath of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which he well knew would fall upon<note place="margin">Joh. 18 34.</note> the Counſell, if they ſhould preſume to put any man to death, the liberty of capitall puniſhment, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to them.

Though there be ſome truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that which he ſpake in the Councell, yet there are there three exceeding great errours in it.

men: he puts an <hi>If,</hi> where he ſhould have put a <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Another is, that he judgeth himſelf, and would have others to judge what is of God, and what not, by the event, according as the thing proſpers, or not, whereas he ſhould have judged according to the truth, and the rule of the Word, let the event be what it may be. A third is, that whatſoever dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and pernitious Hereſies doe infeſt a Church, all men, even Magiſtrates, muſt refraine from the Authors and ſpreaders thereof, and let them alone, in confidence, that ſuch wayes, if not of God, will come to nought of themſelves.</p>

He maketh a moſt odious comparriſon betwixt thoſe Miniſters who appeare for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way (as he calleth it) and the Miniſters who appeare for the Presbyteryall way, deſcribing the Miniſters of the former way thus, <hi>ſome Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and Meſſengers of his</hi> (Gods) <hi>of a very choice anointing, and indued with ſtrength from on high.</hi> The Miniſters that ſtand for the Presbytery, thus, <hi>ſome that would be thought Pillars, and prime men in the Houſe and Temple of God.</hi> Surely they that would be thought ſo, are not worthy to have the ſmalleſt place in the Temple of God.

I would gladly know how he can reconcile theſe things with what himſelf ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. where he tells us what opinion the Gongregationall way holdeth of ſuch as are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minded to it. <hi>It thinketh no evill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no evill of ſuch: if it conceives them upright and faithfull, with God, and with Jeſus Chriſt, it imbraceth them with all love, tenderneſſe and honour, as pertakers of the precious Faith with it ſelf, and nothing doubts but that they ſerve and worſhip God with as much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and ſingleneſſe, of heart, and are accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him in their way, as it ſelf.</hi> In the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of this Paſſage, I have ſome light, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile him with himſelf. There is a great <hi>If</hi> here, If Presbyterians be faithfull and upright with God, and not onely ſo, but If Independents conceive them to be ſuch. He had ſaid poſitively of the other way, many thouſands are for it, of the beſt and choiceſt Servants of God. But of this way, hee greatly doubts whether he can ſay neere half ſo much, as if Godly Presbyterians were hardly to be found, and

Where is that Presbytery that doth imbrace the ungodly, or perſecute the religiouſly affected, or hinder their edification? For my part I ſhall caſt the firſt ſtone at it. The Lord rebuke this Spirit of belying and calumniating the way of Chriſt, by which God hath beene ſo much honoured, Satan ſo much foyled, true grace and knowledge ſo much propagated and advanced. And what is this but a <hi>Fighting againſt God,</hi> even that ſinne which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe holds out as the <hi>Achan, the troubler of our Iſrael,</hi> and that which <hi>makes the Sunne of our Peace to goe ſo often backwards in the Heavens.</hi>

When it is objected, that, that way provideth no ſufficient nor effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remedy for reducing an Offending or Apoſtatizing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: the anſwer we receive is this; Other Churches may admoniſh, rebuke, and (if that do it not) non-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch a Congregation. It is replyed, What if that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſlight all this, both reproof and non-communion. What ſay they for that cauſe?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apologeticall Narration, pag.</hi> 19. Tells us, If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power do but aſſiſt and back the ſentence of non-communion, then it will be as effectuall, as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian way is ſuppoſed to be. To this I ſay no other thing but what <hi>John Goodwin</hi> ſaith, The Lord Chriſt hath provided for his Churches ſufficient intrinſecall remedies, without the concurrence of any externall power. And ſo I leave it betwixt them to unty the knot.</p>

Shall the Covenant, how neceſſary ſoever for the good of the Kingdom, be left free, that every man may take it or refuſe it, as he liſteth? May the Civil Power inflict no puniſhment on thoſe that do evil? and who do more evil then ſoul-deſtroying, and Church-diſturbing Hereticks? Hath the Magiſtrate no coercive power in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Let the five Apologiſts animadvert to this, and look how ſweetly it agreeth with their ſolemn profeſſing, that<note place="margin">Apol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Nar. p. 19.</note> they give more to the Magiſtrate, then the Principles of Presbyteriall Government will yeeld.</p>
            <p>Pag. 52, and pag. 18, he wiſheth it may be <hi>the firſt-born of religious Advertiſements and Cautions to us,</hi> That no man, <hi>or rank of men whatſoever, do appear, eſpecially in any high handed Oppoſition or Conteſtation, nor ſo much as lift up an hard thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Doctrine or Way, claiming Origination and Deſcent from God, till we have Security upon Security, Proof upon Proof, Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration upon Demonſtration, Evidence upon Evidence, that ſuch Ways or Doctrines onely pretend unto God, as the Authors of them; and that in truth they are not at all from him.</hi> This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe two Paſſages put together. Now I aſſume, The Presbyterian way claimeth Origination and Deſcent from God; yet Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth not onely lift up an hard thought againſt it, but in theſe Sermons extremely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and conteſt againſt it, without Security upon Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Proof upon Proof, Demonſtration upon Demonſtration, Evidence upon Evidence, that it onely pretends unto God as the author of it, and that in truth it is not at all from him:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50588:7"/>
Therefore now let him give this <hi>his firſt-born for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> What if I have but one good Proof, Demonſtration, Evidence, or Security, that this or that Doctrine is Hereſie, which yet claims Origination from God and his Word, may I not appear in conteſtation againſt it, nor ſo much as lift up an hard thought againſt it, till I have multiplied Proofs, Demonſtrations and Evidences, and all thoſe <hi>as clear as the noon-day,</hi> as he preacheth? I fear, if the Genealogie of this ſame Doctrine of his were ſearched for, it ſhould be found to have an Origination and Deſcent from <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> which (I conceive) I could demonſtraté, if I had leaſure to turn over my Books. However, let him conſider whether this Doctrine doth no ways fall upon the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Hereticks in the Congregationall Way: of which he himſelf ſpeaketh thus, Pag. 34. <hi>If the errour be dangerous, amounting to, or neer an Hereſie, after two or three admonitions (that is, according to her Warrant from heaven) ſhe caſts it out of the line of her Communication, to him who caſt it in, I mean Satan.</hi>
