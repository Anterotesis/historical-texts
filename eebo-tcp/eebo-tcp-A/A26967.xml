            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is a queſtion more boldly than accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by many; <hi>[Whether a man may not be
ſaved in any Religion, that is faithful to the
principles of it by ſerious diligent practice?]</hi>
The true Solution is this: <hi>Religion</hi> is that which
men hold and do to ſerve and pleaſe God. 1. If men
make themſelves a Religion of ſerving Idols or
Devils inſtead of God. 2. Or if they place their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God himſelf in things that are evil (as
what evil is there that ſome men have not brought
into their Religion, and fathered upon God?) the
more <hi>diligent</hi> ſuch men are in their Religion,
the more they ſin. 3. Or if they make themſelves a
Religion of irrational ludicrous ceremonies, their
greateſt diligence in this will not ſave them. 4. Or
if they hold all the Eſſentials of the true Religion,
except ſome one, it cannot ſave them while one
thing is wanting, which is Eſſential to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and ſo neceſſary to ſalvation (which is the
caſe of real Hereticks:) For they are not indeed
of that Religion, if they want that which is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to it. 5. Or if they hold all that is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the true Religion only Notionally, and hold
any thing with it practically, which is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
and inconſiſtent with it, the ſoundneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:48167:4"/>
their Notional belief will not ſave them from the
mortal poiſon of their practical Hereſie or Error.</p>
            <p>But 1. Whoſoever holdeth all that is neceſſary
to ſalvation, and is ſerious and diligent in living
according thereunto ſhall be ſaved, whatever er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
he holdeth with it. For if he be ſerious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in the Practice of all things neceſſary to
ſalvation, he hath all that is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>viz.</hi> in Belief and Practice: And it muſt
needs follow, that his Errors are either not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictory
to the things neceſſary which he
holdeth and practiſeth, or that he holdeth not thoſe
Errors practically, but notionally, as an opinion, or
uneffectual cogitation in a dream, which provokes
not to action; and in ſuch a caſe the error keeps
no man from ſalvation.</p>
            <p>What is neceſſary to be believed by them that
never hear the Goſpel, it ſo little concerneth us
to know, that God hath not thought meet to make
it ſo plain to us, as things that more concern our
ſelves. But as it is certain, that without the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Satisfaction, and Reconciliation made by
Chriſt, and without new terms of Grace to be
judged by, and without his Grace for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their part, no man can be ſaved (that hath
the uſe of reaſon,) ſo there is ſo much knowledge
neceſſary to ſalvation, as is neceſſary [to engage
the heart to love God above all, and ſincerely to
obey his revealed will, and to prefer the life to
come before the tranſitory pleaſures of this life.]
Now if any man can prove to me, that thoſe that
never heard the Goſpel, can thus love God, and
the life to come, and obey ſincerely, without the
knowledge of the perſon, life, death, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:48167:4"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Declaration of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
Love and Goodneſs of God in him, and
in the work of our Redemption, then I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſuch Negative Infidels may be ſaved:
For God cannot damn a ſanctified ſoul, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
loveth him. But if the diſcovery of the Love
of God in our Redemption be ſo neceſſary a moral
means to ingage the heart (now corrupted by ſin
and creature-love) to the true Love of God, that
this cannot be wrought without it; or if Chriſt
give not his Spirit to produce the love of God in
any but thoſe that hear the Goſpel, and believe in
him, then no ſuch perſons can be ſaved by their
Religion. For Chriſt is the way to the Father,
and no man cometh to the Father but by him; and
and the Love of God is abſolutely and of its ſelf
neceſſary to ſalvation; and Faith in Chriſt is ſo
far neceſſary to ſalvation, as it is neceſſary to
bring men to the love of God, as pardoning ſin
and reconciled to them.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhould never ſo confidently conclude,
that ſome that hear not of Chriſt may be ſaved,
yet he muſt needs confeſs that the want of this
clear and great diſcovery of the love and goodneſs
of God, in his pardoning grace, and of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life which he hath prepared for us, muſt needs
make the love of God a very rare and difficult
thing, and conſequently their ſalvation rare and
difficult in compariſon of ours.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Faith, is [The believing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
life of happineſs to be given by God
(with the pardon of all ſin) as procured by the
ſufferings and merits of Jeſus Chriſt, to all that
are ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, and do perſevere
<pb facs="tcp:48167:5"/>
in love to God, and to each other, and in a holy
and heavenly converſation.] This is ſaving Faith
and Chriſtianity, if we Conſent as well as Aſſent.
All that was neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed,
was formerly thought to be contained in the Creed,
and that was the teſt or ſymbol of the Chriſtian
Faith; and Chriſtian Religion is the ſame, and
hath the ſame rule, and teſt, &amp; ſymbol in all Ages.
But ſince Faction and Tyranny, Pride &amp;. Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
became the maſters of the Religion of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vice and ſelfiſh intereſt hath commanded them
to change the Rule of Faith by their additions, &amp;
to make ſo much neceſſary to ſalvation, as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to their affected Vniverſal Dominion, and to
their Commodity and carnal ends. And ſince Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
entred, and hath torn the Church into many
Sects (the Greek, the Roman, the Armenian,
the Jacobites, the Abaſſine, and many more) it
ſeemeth meet to the more tyrannical Sect to call
theſe ſeveral Religions, and to ſay that every
man that differeth from them in any of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or additions, which they pleaſe to call Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

how do their Laicks here know what is a
point of faith, but by the teſtimony of their
Prieſts?</p>
            <p>He is the true Catholick Chriſtian that hath but
One, even the Chriſtian Religion: And this is the
caſe of the Proteſtants, who caſting off the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Popery, adhere to the Primitive ſimplicity &amp;
unity: If Papiſts, or any others, corrupt this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with humane additions and innovations, the
great danger of theſe Corruptions, is, leſt they
draw them from the ſound belief and ſerious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
of that antient Chriſtianity which we are all
agreed in: And (among Papiſts, or any other Sect)
where their corruptions do not thus corrupt their
Faith and Practice in the true Eſſentials, it is
certain that thoſe corruptions ſhall not
damn them. For he that truly believeth all
things that are eſſential to Chriſtianity, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
accordingly with ſerious diligence, hath
the promiſe of ſalvation: And it is certain

not inconſiſtent with true Chriſtianity, or not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically,

and liveth by faith above the world, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth
the deſires of the fleſh, and liveth wilfully

or let down ſo little as nature and antidotes
do expel. But I will not therefore plead for poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor take it, becauſe men may live that thus
take it.</p>
            <p>Having anſwered this great Queſtion Reader,
I am now come up to the ſubject of my following
diſcourſe, and to tell thee that though it be a great
queſtion whether ſerious diligence in a corrupt
Religion will ſave a man, it is paſt all queſtion,
and agreed on by all ſides, that no Religion will
ſave a man that is not ſerious, ſincere and diligent
in it. If thou be of the trueſt Religion in the world,
and art not true thy ſelf to that Religion, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is good, but it is none of thine. Objectively
thou art of a true and good Religion, the things in
themſelves are true and good; but ſubjectively,
thou art ſincerely of no Religion at all; for if thou
art not ſerious, hearty and diligent in it, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:48167:6"/>
that thou doſt not truly entertain it, and make
it thine; but it is thy Books that have the true
Religion, or thy tongue or fantaſie, or brain, but
not thy heart, and the beſt meat on thy table, or
that goeth no further then thy mouth, will never
feed thee, or preſerve thy life. So certain is the
ſalvation of every holy mortified Chriſtian, and
ſo certain the damnation of every ungodly, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
fleſhly ſenſualiſt that I had a thouſand fold ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have my ſoul in the caſe of a godly Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
yea or a Monk or Fryar among the Papiſts
that liveth a truly heavenly life, in the love of
God and man, and in a ſerious diligent obedience
to God according to his knowledge, then in the caſe
of a Protestant, or whomſoever you can imagine
to be righteſt in his opinions, that is worldly, and
ſenſual, and a ſtranger (if not an enemy) to the
power and ſerious practice of his own profeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and void of a Holy and Heavenly heart
and life. If ever ſuch a man be ſaved, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all Religion do deceive us.</p>
            <p>And certainly ſuch mens hypocriſie doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their ſin, and will encreaſe their miſery. So
many as there be in the world, that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Chriſtians, and yet are not ſerious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in their Religion, but are ungodly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
or enemies of a holy life, ſo many Hypocrites
are in the world. And I wonder that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
call them not Hypocrites, when they
ſtand up at the Creed, or profeſs themſelves Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
though the Congregation ſeeth not [hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite]
written in their foreheads, God ſeeth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
written on their hearts, and thoſe that converſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with them may ſee it written in their lives. And
<pb facs="tcp:48167:7"/>
yet theſe men are the forwardeſt to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Hypocrites: The Devil hath taught it
them to ſtop the ſuſpition and the chaſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as he hath taught the greateſt Schiſmaticks
or Church-dividers the Papiſts) to cry out moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Schiſm and diviſion, and pretend to unity.
But theſe ſhifts do blind none but fools, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
conſciences; and the cheat that is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by the wife, will quickly by God be detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before all the world. Till then l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t them make
merry in their deceits: who would envy the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
the pleaſure of an hours ſwiniſh ſick delight?
This is their portion, and this is their time: As we
have choſen and covenanted for another portion,
we are content to ſtay the time aſſigned, till God
ſhall tell them &amp; all the world, who was ſincere &amp;
who the hypocrite. For our parts, we believe that
he is moſt or leaſt ſincere, that is moſt or leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the practice of his own profeſt Religion.</p>
            <p>For my part, I muſt profeſs that (by the mercy
of God) I have made it the work of many a year,
to look about me and think wherein the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of man doth indeed conſiſt: And I have long
been paſt doubt (as much as I am that I am a man)
that it is not in tranſitory ſenſual delights; and
that theſe are ſuch lean and dry commodities, and
pittiful pleaſures, leaving men ſo ſpeedily in a
forlorn ſtate, that I am contented that my greateſt
enemy have my part of them. I have renounced
them to God (as any part of my felicity) and I
renounce them to men: Let them do with me about
theſe things as God will give them leave. I
will have a portion after death, or I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e have
none.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48167:7"/>
And the caſe is ſo palpable, that it is my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that the contrary deceit is conſiſtant with
the nature and reaſon of a man; and that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen and Scholars and perſons of an
ingenuous education, can no better diſtinguiſh, and
can poſſibly conquer their reaſon ſo eaſily with
the preſence or ſenſual delights, and ſo eaſily
make nothing of that which will be to morrow and
for ever, meerly becauſe it is not to day. Well. I
muſt ſay the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſeen in the Government of the world with
the Liberty of the will, and determining that
all men ſhould ſpeed as they chooſe.</p>
            <p>It may be the Reader will ſay, be expected that
inſtead of writing ſuch popular diſcourſes, I ſhould
have vindicated my ſelf againſt the accuſations,
that in multitudes of Libels and Pamphlets are
ſcattered abroad againſt me. But doth he think that
man is ſeriouſly a Chriſtian that is not more
zealous for God and Religion, and the ſouls of
men, then for himſelf? Have I nothing elſe to do
with my time &amp; labour, but plead cauſe of my own
which God will ſo ſpeedily and effectually plead?
Will it not be time enough to be juſtified at the Bar
and day of God? I am content that they carry it as
they deſire till then (were it not more for their own
and other mens ſakes then mine) Am I like to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
my life &amp; all for Chriſt, &amp; endure torments
if I were called to it, if I cannot endure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
and ſlandered by paſſionate men? Was it for
nothing that our Lord would not anſwer for himſelf
when he was accuſed before <hi>Pilate?</hi> Shall
they be able to calumniate under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Revenge of Heaven? and ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:48167:8"/>
I not be able to be ſilent under ſuch a promiſe, as
<hi>Mat. 5. 10, 11, 12. The ſervant of the Lord
muſt not ſtrive!</hi> Our Lord gave us an example
of not reviling again, when he was reviled: <hi>He
made himſelf of no reputation, but endured
the croſs and contradiction of ſinners, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſhame.</hi> I confeſs I think when Gods
intereſt, and the good of others doth require it, a
man ſhould not be wanting to his own defence, and
I have long ago written that which will ſatisfie
the impartial: But when I ſaw that it is like to
tend to heats, and ſet more on work, I had rather
let men call me all the names they can deviſe, and
voluminouſly accuſe me of any thing that malice
ſhall ſuggeſt, then do any thing to foment conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Church. But if God convince me that
it is my duty to detect the calumnies of man, it is
a work ſoon done.</p>
            <p>But what good will it do the world for me to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the numerous untruths, that other men have
publiſhed, or to confute every Script; when all
that I converſe with are ſatisfied already, and
believe not the reproaches; and all the evidence
in the world will not ſatisfied thoſe that will not
read it, or are reſolved by their malice or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
never to be ſatisfied?</p>
            <p>For my part, I doubt not but God and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
will give them ſuch a Confutation as
ſhall be ſufficient to them and me to end the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
            <p>My work is to plead the Cauſe of God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
againſt the profane and ſenſual world, and
no further to plead any Cauſe of my own, then is
neceſſary to that. If I muſt bear the effects of
<pb facs="tcp:48167:8"/>
mens diſpleaſure, I had an hundred times rather
it were for pleading for Holineſs, and Love, and
Peace, and Concord, againſt impiety, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,
and diviſions, then for defending my ſelf,
or upon the account of Ceremonies or ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And if for theſe I bear it, I doubt not of
more comfort at the preſent, much leſs do I doubt
of a better iſſue then falſe accuſers can expect.
We ſhall be ſhortly upon even ground: The time
is ſhort: The pleaſures of ſin, the triumphs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
the ſufferings of innocency, are but for a
moment. I envy them not ſo ſhort and dark day:
The Judge is at the door that will judge all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and ſet all ſtrait, and judge in righteouſneſs.
When I am afraid of leaving a noiſom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
world, and ending all my pain and
trouble, and being beyond the reach of malice,
then I will fear what man can do. Let them keep
me out of heaven, or deprive me of my peace and
comfort if they can: If they fear not the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of God</hi> againſt the malicious and unjuſt;
ſurely I have leſs reaſon to <hi>fear their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi>
When they have done their <hi>worſt to
others,</hi> let them <hi>ſave themſelves</hi> from death if
they can: I am devoted to God, and I never yet
found cauſe to repent it: I am reſolved to uſe the
utmoſt of my power for the intereſt of Holineſs,
Charity and Peace, and for loyalty to the King,
and obedience or patient ſubmiſſion to Superiors:
And if yet I bear the fruits of fury, let thoſe that
inſult over ſufferers, as if they were therefore
guilty or miſerable, remember that we could
have avoided it if we would, and could have
found the way of applauſe and proſperity as
<pb facs="tcp:48167:9"/>
well as they; and that no man takes that for his
miſery which he chooſeth! If this kind of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or writing offend, could not I have avoided it?
I am not in love with ſufferings from men, nor will
I eſcape them at the rates of Gods diſpleaſure. I
never think my ſelf in the higheſt form of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
till I am more conform to the ſufferings of
Chriſt, and have endured more then yet I
have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the Chriſtians old Apology in</hi> Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:
Quaſi non totum quod in nos poteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
noſtrum ſi Arbitrium Certe ſi velim
Chriſtianus ſum tunc ergo me damnabis: ſi
damnari velim: Quum vero quod in me potes,
niſi velim non potes jam meae voluntatis eſt
quod potes, non tuae poteſtatis: Proinde
&amp; vulgus vane de noſtra vexatione gaudet.
Proinde &amp; noſtrum eſt gaudium quod ſibi
vendicant, qui malumus damnari quam a Deo
excidere. Contra, illi qui nos oderunt, dolere
non gaudere debebant, conſecutis nobis
quod eligimus.] Tert. Apologet. cap. 39.</p>
            <p>That is, <q>As if all that you can do againſt us
were not our own choice! (or will) Certainly
it is becauſe I will that I am a Chriſtian, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if I will be condemned, then thou wilt
condemn me. And when that which thou canſt
do againſt me, thou canſt not do, unleſs I will;
it is not now from thy power that thou canſt
do it, but from my will: And therefore the
vulgar do in vain rejoyce at our vexation. And
therefore it is our joy, which they challenge to
themſelves, while we had rather be condemned
then fall from God.</q> On the contrary they that hate
<pb facs="tcp:48167:9"/>
us ſhould grieve and not rejoyce while we attain
but what we chooſe.</p>
            <p>For my part, if the world will needs be mad,
I think both the laughing and the weeping Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
are more excuſable then he that would be
over-angry at them, or over-buſie in diſputing with
them; ſaith <hi>Seneca [Quare fers aegri rabiem

of a mans loſing his wit; and therefore he that
can bear with one, ſhould ſomewhat bear with the
other: (Though indeed voluntarineſs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarineſs

not worth a man's time and labour and coſt to
be over ſolicitous in his own vindication, let the

            <p>I have truly given you now the Reaſons, why
I rather chooſe to ſpeak theſe common neceſſary

(agreeable to the ſubject of his Majeſties Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

any cauſe that is my own. And now referring the
Reader to this ſhort Diſcourſe, I muſt firſt deſire
that he miſunderſtand me not in one or two paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
1. That my citation of the paſſage in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles,
be not taken as if I ſpoke a word againſt
it, though I ſay, I dare not my ſelf ſubſcribe it:
For though I think my ſelf, that ſeeing a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
like Saul may repent, and be pardoned; a
mocker at Godlineſs may Repent and be forgiven
alſo: Yet I am reſolved ſtill to ſuſpect my own
underſtanding, rather then to ſpeak againſt the
doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. Think it not ſtrange that I reprehend even
Miniſters that are ſecret, or open oppoſers of a
holy diligence: For our foreſaid Homily tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, as followeth: Hom. for Inform, &amp;c,
part 2. p. 150, 251. [Examples of ſuch ſcorners,
we read in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 
               <q>When the good King
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the beginning of his Reign had
deſtroyed Idolatry, purged the Temple, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion in his Realm, he ſent Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
into every City to gather the people to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſolemnize the feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> in
ſuch ſort as God hath appointed. The Poſts
went from City to City—And what did
the people think ye? Did they laud and praiſe
the name of the Lord that had given them ſo
ſo good a King, ſo zealous a Prince to aboliſh
Idolatry, and to reſtore again Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
No, no; the Scripture ſaith, the people
laughed them to ſcorn, and mocked the Kings
meſſengers. And in the laſt Chap. of the ſame
Book it is written, that Almighty God having
<pb facs="tcp:48167:10"/>
compaſſion on his people ſent his Meſſengers the
Prophets to them, to call them from their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idolatry and wicked kind of living: But
they mocked his Meſſengers, they deſpiſed his
words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the
wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and
till there was no remedy.]—The wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that were in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> made but a
mock at the Word of God, when <hi>Noah</hi> told them
that God would take vengeance on them for

that except they repented, both they and their
City ſhould be deſtroyed; They thought his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
impoſſible to be true; they ſcorned and
mocked his admonitions, and reputed him as an
old doting fool: But God—burnt up thoſe
ſcorners and mockers of his holy Word. And
what eſtimation had Chriſts doctrine among the
Scribes and Phariſees? What reward had he
among them?—The Phariſees? which were
covetous, did ſcorn him in his Doctrine. O then
you ſee that worldly rich men do ſcorn the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of their ſalvation; the worldly wiſe men
ſcorn the Doctrine of Chriſt as fooliſhneſs to
their underſtandings. Theſe ſcorners have ever
been, and ever ſhall be to the worlds end. For
<hi>St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peter</hi> propheſied, that ſuch ſcorners ſhould
be in the end before the latter day. Take heed
therefore my brethren, take heed: be ye not

            <p>
               <q>Certainly by the Divine wiſdom was it brought
to paſs, that in our times—Aſſemblies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in the City, much what after the form of
thoſe Apoſtolical Conventions, ſuch eſpecially
as by the Apoſtle were oppointed for diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of divine matters, both for edifying
the hearers, and for propogating the Church.
It was agreed that the zealous Chriſtians
ſhould meet a days at St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Oratory, and
there a Religious meeting ſhould be held after
this manner. Firſt, ſilence being made,
they began with prayer, and one of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reads ſome pious leſſon. At the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, the Father uſed to interpoſe upon
occaſion, explaining more fully, enlarging and
vehemently inculcating on the minds of
the Auditors, the things read, continuing his
diſcourſe ſometime a whole hour (to the great
ſatisfaction of the hearers) dialogue-wiſe,
asking ſome of the company their opinions about
ſuch a thing. Afterward by his appointment,
one of them went up into the Desk, raiſed
upon ſteps, and made an Oration without flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
or varniſh of Language, compoſed out
of the approved and choice lives of Saints, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writ, and ſentences of Holy Fathers. He
that ſucceeded him, diſcourſed after the ſame
manner, but on a differing matter. Then followed
<pb facs="tcp:48167:12"/>
the third, who related ſome part of the Church
ſtory in the order of its ſeveral Ages. Every of
theſe had his half hour allotted him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all with marvellous delight and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:
Then ſinging ſome Hymn, and going
to prayers again, the company broke up. All things
thus ordered, and ratified by the Pope, as far as
the times would ſuffer, the beautiful face of the
Primitive Apoſtolical aſſembling, ſeemed to be
revived again, whereat all good men rejoycing,
and many taking their Model from them, the
like exerciſes of piety were ſet up and practiſed
in other places.]</q> So far <hi>Baronius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſay that this long and zealous exerciſe
was not in private houſes; I Anſwer, Allow us an
Oratory, as the Pope himſelf allowed them, and
we had rather far be there then in private houſes:
But if any that hinder ſuch from being publick,
ſhall then reproach it for being in a leſs publick
place, they ſcarce play fair. The Church of
<hi>England,</hi> in the third part of the Serm. againſt
the peril of idolatry, <hi>p.</hi> 66, 67. ſaith. <q>In
<hi>Maximinian</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperours
Proclamation, the places where Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
to publick Prayer, were called Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.]</q>
See further.</p>
            <p>But how were the Oratorians eſteemed and
uſed? In <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. of <hi>Nerius</hi>'s perſecutions, after
the mention of mens rancor and railing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned
him, it follows, <hi>p.</hi> 56. that <q>The Prelate
that was Deputy of the City, moved by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of them that bore a ſpleen to <hi>Philip,</hi> ſent
for him, and reprehended him ſharply: Is it not
a ſhame (ſaith he) that you who profeſs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb facs="tcp:48167:12"/>
of the world, ſhould hunt for popular
applauſe, and walk through the City guarded
with troops, with ſuch nets as theſe, fiſhing for
Church-preferments?] When having ſhrewdly
taunted him with ſuch like expreſſions, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
him the hearing of Confeſſions for fifteen
dayes, and to uſe the cuſtomes of the Oratory,
but by leave firſt obtained, or to lead about
with him any companies of men, threatning
impriſonment upon his diſobedience: Neither
would he let him depart, till he put in ſecurity
for his appearance, ſaying—Come, you do all
this, not for the glory of God, but to make a party
for your ſelf.—Mean time, while the good man
was commending himſelf to God, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
divers religious perſons to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in Prayer about this buſineſs, one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
and ſaith—This trouble ſhall be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over, and the work that is begun be more
ſtrongly oonfirmed; they who reſiſt now, ſhall
aſſiſt hereafter; and if any one ſhall dare to
oppoſe it any longer, God ſhall ſpeedily avenge
it on him; the Prelate, that is your chiefeſt
adverſary, ſhall certainly dye with 15. dayes.]
And it fell out preciſely as he foretold: for
the Prelate (the Popes Deputy) relating the
proceedings to his Holineſs ſomewhat partially,
died ſuddenly.—No ſooner was this blaze of
perſecution out, but a much fiercer was kindled
againſt the Order: For under pretext of Piety
and Religion, ſome poſſeſſed the Pope that the
Preachers of St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> many times deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
things ridiculous and unſound, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
high indiſcretion or ignorance, and muſt
needs endanger their hearers.]</q>

I would not have troubled you with any of theſe

at my reproof of impious Miniſters, that in all
places and parties in the world where there is
any ſerious diligence for ſalvation, there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
enemies of the ſame Profeſſion, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Clergy as well as others. The hindering
of Holy Diligence and Seriouſneſs, is the work of
the Devil and his Inſtruments in the world. The
promoting it is the work of Chriſt, and of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

the <hi>words</hi> of my <hi>Text:</hi> where <hi>you</hi> have
1. <hi>The duty commanded. 2. The reaſon</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Duty</hi> is in the firſt part; <hi>[What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

whatever work is aſſigned thee by

            <p>2. The <hi>Motive</hi> is in the laſt part

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The work of this life cannot
be done, when this life is ended. <hi>Or,</hi>
There is no working in the grave, to
which we are all making haſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Therefore while we have
time, we muſt do our beſt: or do the
work of this preſent life with vigour
and diligence.</p>
            <p>It is from an unqueſtionable and
commonly-acknowledged <hi>truth,</hi> that
<hi>Solomon</hi> here urgeth us to <hi>diligence</hi> in
duty; and therefore to <hi>prove it</hi> would
be but loſs of time. As there are <hi>two
worlds</hi> for man to live in and ſo <hi>two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48167:15"/>
lives</hi> for man to live; ſo each of theſe
<hi>lives</hi> hath its <hi>peculiar employment. This</hi>
is the life of <hi>preparation:</hi> the <hi>next</hi> is
the life of our <hi>Reward</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment:</hi>
We are <hi>now</hi> but in the <hi>womb</hi> of <hi>eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

This is the time of our <hi>appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip:</hi>
we are <hi>learning</hi> the <hi>trade that</hi>
we muſt <hi>live upon</hi> in Heaven. We <hi>run
now,</hi> that we may <hi>then</hi> receive the
<hi>Crown:</hi> we <hi>fight now,</hi> that we may
then <hi>triumph</hi> in victory. The <hi>Grave</hi>
hath no <hi>work:</hi> but <hi>Heaven</hi> hath <hi>work,</hi>
and <hi>Hell</hi> hath <hi>ſuffering.</hi> There is no
<hi>Repentance unto life</hi> hereafter: but
there is <hi>Repentance unto torment,</hi> and
to <hi>deſperation.</hi> There is no <hi>Believing</hi>
of a <hi>happineſs</hi> unſeen in order to the
<hi>obtaining</hi> of it: or of a <hi>miſery unſeen</hi>
in order to the <hi>eſcaping</hi> of it; nor <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in a Saviour</hi> in order to <hi>theſe
ends:</hi> But there is the <hi>fruition</hi> of the
<hi>happineſs</hi> which was <hi>here believed;</hi> &amp;
<hi>feeling</hi> of the <hi>miſery</hi> that men would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48167:16"/>
               <hi>not believe;</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> from <hi>him</hi> as
a <hi>righteous Judge,</hi> whom they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a <hi>merciful Saviour.</hi> So that it is
not <hi>all work</hi> that <hi>ceaſeth</hi> at our <hi>death:</hi>
but only the work of <hi>this preſent life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed no reaſon can <hi>ſhew</hi> us
the <hi>leaſt probability</hi> of doing our <hi>work</hi>
when <hi>our time</hi> is done that was <hi>given</hi>
us to do it in. If it can be done, it
muſt be, 1. by the <hi>recalling</hi> of our
<hi>Time;</hi> 2. by the <hi>return of life;</hi> 3. or
by <hi>opportunity</hi> in <hi>another life:</hi> But
there is no hope of any of theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Who knoweth not that <hi>Time
cannot be recalled?</hi> That which <hi>once
Was,</hi> will be no more. <hi>Yeſterday</hi> will
never come again. <hi>To day</hi> is paſſing,
and will not return. You may work
while it is day: but when you have
loſt that <hi>day,</hi> it will not return for <hi>you</hi>
to work in. While your <hi>candle burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
you</hi> may make uſe of its light: but
when it is <hi>done,</hi> it is too late to uſe it.
No force of <hi>Medicine,</hi> no <hi>Orators</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
perſwaſions, no worldlings
wealth, no Princes power, can call
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48167:16"/>
back one day or hour of time. If
they could, what endeavours would
there be uſed, when extremity hath
taught them to <hi>value</hi> what they now
deſpiſe? what <hi>chaffering</hi> would there
be <hi>at laſt,</hi> if <hi>time</hi> could be <hi>purchaſed,</hi>
for any thing that man can give.
Then Miſers would bring out their
wealth, and ſay, <hi>All this will I give for
one days time of Repentance more:</hi> And
Lords and Knights would lay down
their Honours, and ſay, <hi>Take all, and
let us be the baſeſt Beggars, if we may
but have one year of the Time that we
miſpent!</hi> Then Kings would lay down
their Crowns, and ſay, <hi>Let us be equal
with the loweſt Subjects, ſo we may but
have the Time again that we waſted in
the Cares and Pleaſures of the world.</hi>
Kingdoms would then ſeem a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
price</hi> for the recovery of
<hi>Time.</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> that is now <hi>idled</hi> &amp;
<hi>talkt</hi> away: The <hi>Time</hi> that is now
<hi>feaſted</hi> and <hi>complemented</hi> away, that

that is wickedly &amp; preſumptuouſly

would they think that they had
made, if at the deareſt rates they
could redeem it? The prophaneſt
Mariner fals a praying, when he <hi>fears</hi>
his <hi>Time</hi> is at an end. If importunity
would then prevail, how earneſtly
would they pray for the recovery of
<hi>time,</hi> that formerly derided praying,
or minded it not, or could not have
while, or mocked God with lip-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and cuſtomary forms, &amp; feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words inſtead of praying? what

Time deſpiſing Gallants, the
idle, buſie, dreaming-active, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
covetous Lovers of this world,
if <hi>time</hi> could be <hi>intreated</hi> to return!
How paſſionately then would they
roar out their requeſts! <hi>[O that we

may <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>learn,</hi> and

ſhall be ſo no more. You ſhall riſe
from the dead indeed to <hi>Judgement,</hi>
and to the Life that now <hi>you</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for, but never to ſuch a Life
<hi>as this on earth:</hi> your life is as the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48167:18"/>
fighting of a Battel, that muſt be won
or loſt at once. There is no coming

If you are Enemies, you
may be reconciled to God: But
when once the thread of life is cut,
your opportunities are at an end.
Now you may enquire of your
Friends and Teachers, what a poor

and you may receive particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
and exhortations, and <hi>God</hi>
may bleſs them to the illuminating,
renewing and ſaving of your ſouls:
But when life is paſt, it will be ſo no

might but return, and once more be
tryed with the means of life, what
joyful tidings would it be! How
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48167:19"/>
welcome would the Meſſenger be
that bringeth it! Had <hi>Hell</hi> but ſuch
an offer as this, and would <hi>any cryes</hi>
procure it from their righteous
Judge, O what a change would be
among them! How importunately
would they cry to God, [O ſend us

more let us ſee the face of Mercy, and
hear the tenders of Chriſt &amp; of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
Once more let the Miniſters
offer us their helps, and teach us in

we will hate them, and drive them
away from our Houſes &amp; Towns no

Mercy of ſuch a Life as once
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48167:19"/>
we had! O try us once more with
ſuch a Life, and ſee whether we will
not contemn the world, and cloze
with Chriſt, and live as ſtrictly, and
pray as earneſtly, as <hi>thoſe</hi> that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and abuſed for ſo doing: O that
we might once <hi>more</hi> be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the holy Aſſemblies, and have the
Lords Days to ſpend in the buſineſs
of our Salvation! We would plead
no more againſt the power &amp; purity

            <p>I makes my heart even ſhake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<hi>damned ſouls</hi> would ſtrive with God,
and how they would roar out <hi>[O try

<hi>will not be, It muſt not be!</hi> They <hi>had</hi>
their <hi>Day,</hi> and would not know it:
They cannot <hi>loſe</hi> their <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>have</hi>
it. They had faithful Guides, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48167:20"/>
would not follow them: Teachers
they had, but would not learn. The
duſt of their feet muſt witneſs againſt
them, becauſe their entertained
obeyed meſſage, cannot witneſs for
them. Long did Chriſt wait with
the patient tenders of his blood and
ſpirit; His Grace was long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
offered, but could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
and received: And they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finally refuſe a Chriſt, and yet
have a Chriſt; Or refuſe his mercy,
and yet be ſaved by it. He that would
have <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſent from the <hi>dead,</hi> to
<hi>warn</hi> his unbelieving <hi>Brethren</hi> on
Earth, no <hi>doubt</hi> would have ſtrongly

And how earneſtly would he have

Heb. 9. 27. But there's no return to

<hi>This</hi> world, <hi>theſe</hi> houſes, <hi>that</hi> wealth

be to you as if you had never known

a little while! yet a little longer, and
we muſt preach, and you muſt hear it
no more for ever. That therefore
which you will do, muſt <hi>preſently</hi> be

you will repent and Believe, it muſt

            <p>3. And as there is no <hi>Return</hi> to
<hi>Earth,</hi> ſo is there no doing <hi>this work</hi>
hereafter. Heaven and Hell are for

the <hi>open</hi> world will not <hi>revive</hi> him;
That which is generated, and born
a <hi>beaſt,</hi> or <hi>ſerpent,</hi> will not by all the

            </p>
            <p>Is this believed and conſidered by
the ſleepy world? Alas ſirs, do you
live as men that muſt live here no

that muſt pray no more, when once
the time of work is ended? What

            <p>1. [Whatſoever thy hand findeth

            <p>
               <hi>[Do it with thy Might:</hi> Do thy beſt

            <p>3. Do it with thy moſt <hi>awakned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>

            <p>1. The <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> here

of <hi>Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Prudent</hi> conduct.
Otherwiſe, the <hi>faſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

you may go out of the way; and
miſ-guided zeal may ſpoil all the
work, and make it but an injury to
others or your ſelves. A little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
in the ſeaſon, and order
and manner of a Duty, ſometimes
may ſpoil it, and hinder the ſucceſs,
&amp; make it do more hurt then good.
How many a Sermon, or Prayer, or
reproof, is made the matter of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and contempt, for ſome impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
paſſages or deportment? God
ſendeth not his ſervants to be <hi>jeſters</hi>
of the world, or to play the <hi>mad-men,</hi>
as <hi>David</hi> in his fears: We muſt be

diſregarded: Remember when thou
lookeſt them in the faces, when
thou beholdeſt the Aſſemblies, that
They muſt be</hi> Converted <hi>or</hi> Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
ſanctified <hi>on</hi> Earth, <hi>or</hi> tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>in</hi> Hell; <hi>and that</hi> this is the Day,

            <p>In a word, Apply this <hi>quickening
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48167:36"/>
precept</hi> to <hi>all the duties</hi> of thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
courſe. Be <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi>
and <hi>Charitable</hi> in <hi>good ſadneſs,</hi> if you
would be taken for ſuch when you
look for the reward. <hi>Work out your
ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi>
Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Strive to enter in at the
ſtrait gate; for many ſhall ſeek to enter
and ſhall not be able,</hi> Mat. 7. 13.
Luk. 12. 24. <hi>Many run, but few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the prize: ſo run that you may

4. 18. Let the doting world deride
your diligence, and ſet themſelves
to hinder and afflict you: It will
be but a little while before expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
change their minds, and
make them ſing another ſong. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt fully: Ply your work,
and loſe no time. The Judge is
coming. Let not words nor any
thing that man can do, prevail with
you to ſit down, or ſtop you in a
journey of ſuch importance. Pleaſe
God, though fleſh, and friends,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48167:36"/>
and all the world ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.
Whatever come of your
reputation, or Eſtates, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
or Lives, be ſure you
look to Life Eternal, and caſt
not that on any hazard, for a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
flower, or a pleaſant dream,
or a picture of commodity, or any
vanity that the Deceiver can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<hi>For what ſhall it profit you to win
the world, and loſe your ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16.
26. Or to have been honoured and
obeyed on earth, when you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wrath of God in Hell? Or
that your fleſh was once provided
with variety of delights, when its
turned to rottenneſs, and muſt be
raiſed to torments? Hold on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Faith, and Holineſs, and
Hope, though Earth and Hell ſhould
rage againſt you; though all the
world by force or flattery, ſhould do
the worſt they can to hinder you:
This is your trial: your warfare, is
the reſiſting of deceit, and of all that
would tempt you to conſent to the
means of your own deſtruction:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48167:37"/>
conſent not, and you conquer: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
and you are crowned. The
combat is all about your Wills;
Yield, and you have loſt the day. If
the prating of ungodly fools, or the
contemptuous jears of hardned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or the frowns of unſanctified
Superiours could prevail againſt the
Spirit of Chriſt, and the workings
of an enlightened mind, then what
man would be ſaved? You deſerve
damnation, if you will run into it
to avoid a mock, or the loſs of any
thing that man can take from you.
You are unmeet for Heaven if you
can part with it to ſave your purſes.
<hi>Fear not them that can kill the body,
and after that have no more that they
can do: but fear him that can deſtroy
both ſoul and body in Hell,</hi> Mat. 10.
28. Luk. 12. 4, 5. Obey God, though
all the world forbid you. No power
can ſave you from his Juſtice: And
none of them can deprive you of
his Reward. Though you loſe your
Heads, you ſhall ſave your Crowns:
You no way ſave your lives ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48167:37"/>
as by ſuch loſing them, <hi>Mat.
10. 39. One thing is neceſſary:</hi> Do that
with ſpeed, and care, and diligence,
which <hi>Muſt</hi> be done, or you are loſt
for ever. They that are now againſt
your much and earneſt praying, will
ſhortly cry as loud themſelves in
vain; When it is too late, how fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
will they beg for mercy, that
now deride you for valuing &amp; ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in time! But <hi>then they ſhall call
upon God but he will not anſwer: they
ſhall ſeek him early, but ſhall not find
him: For that they hated knowledge,
and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord:
They would none of his counſel, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed
all his reproof.]</hi> Prov. 1. 24. to
the end.</p>
            <p>Up therefore &amp; work with all thy
<hi>might.</hi> Let <hi>unbelievers trifle,</hi> that know
not that the righteous God ſtands
over them, and know not that they
are <hi>now</hi> to work for everlaſting, and
know not that <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> is at
the end. Let them delay, &amp; laugh, &amp;
play, &amp; dream away their Time, that
are drunk with proſperity, and mad
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48167:38"/>
with fleſhly luſts and pleaſures, and
have loſt their reaſon in the cares,
and deluſions, and vain glory of the
world. But ſhall it be ſo with thee
whoſe eyes are opened, who ſeeſt the
God, the Heaven, the Hell, which
they <hi>do but hear of</hi> as unlikely things?
Wilt thou <hi>live awake,</hi> as they that <hi>are
aſleep?</hi> Wilt <hi>thou do</hi> in the <hi>day-light,</hi> as
they <hi>do</hi> in the <hi>dark?</hi> ſhall <hi>Freemen</hi> live
as <hi>Satans ſlaves?</hi> ſhall the <hi>living lie as
ſtill</hi> &amp; <hi>uſeleſs</hi> as <hi>the dead?</hi> Work then
while it is <hi>day,</hi> for the <hi>night</hi> is <hi>coming</hi>
when none can work, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>It is not the works of the <hi>Moſaical</hi>
Law, nor works that are conceited
for their proper <hi>value</hi> to deſerve any
thing at the hands of God, that I am
all this while perſwading you to: But
it is the works preſcribed you by
Chriſt in the Goſpel, according to
which <hi>you</hi> ſhall be ſhortly judged to
<hi>joy</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> by Chriſt himſelf, that
will call you to account Theſe muſt
be done with all your <hi>Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But (you'l ſay perhaps)
alas,</hi> what Might have we? We have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48167:38"/>
no ſufficiency of our ſelves; without
Chriſt we can do nothing! And this we
find when it comes to the trial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is not a <hi>might</hi> that is <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignally
thine Own,</hi> that I am calling
thee to exerciſe: but that which
thou haſt <hi>already</hi> received from <hi>God,</hi>
and that which <hi>he is ready</hi> to beſtow.
Uſe well but all the <hi>Might</hi> thou haſt,
and thou ſhalt find thy labour is not
in vain. Even the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi>
and of <hi>common Grace,</hi> are Talents
which thou muſt improve.</p>
            <p>2. Art thou <hi>willing</hi> to uſe the
<hi>Might</hi> thou haſt, and to have more,
and <hi>uſe it if thou hadſt it?</hi> If thou
<hi>art,</hi> thou haſt then the ſtrength of
Chriſt: Thou ſtandeſt not, and
workeſt not by thy own ſtrength:
His promiſe is engaged to thee, and
his ſtrength is ſufficient for thee.
But if thou art not willing, thou art
without excuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, when thou hadſt
Heaven and Hell ſet open in the
word of God, to make thee <hi>willing,</hi>
God will diſtinguiſh thy <hi>wilfulneſs</hi>
from <hi>unwilling weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48167:39"/>
3. There is more <hi>Power</hi> in all of
you then you uſe, or then you are
well aware of. It wanteth but <hi>awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
to bring it into act. Do you
not find in your <hi>Repentings,</hi> that the
change is more in <hi>your Will</hi> then in
<hi>your Power?</hi> and in the <hi>awaking</hi> of
your <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> into <hi>act,</hi> then
in the addition of meer <hi>abilities?</hi>
and that therefore you befool your
ſelves for your ſins &amp; your neglects,
&amp; wonder that you had no more uſe
of your underſtandings? Let but a
ſtorm at Sea, or violent ſickneſs, or
approaching death, rowſe up and
waken the powers which you have,
and you will find there was much
more aſleep in you then you
uſed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore next endeavour
to awaken your abilities, or tell you
how you ſhould awaken them.</p>
            <p>When your ſouls are drowſie, and
you are forgetting your God, and
your latter end, and the matters of
Eternity have little force and ſavour
with you; when you grow lazie and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48167:39"/>
ſuperficial, and religion ſeems a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
thing; and you do your duty as
if it were in vain or againſt our wils,
when you can loſe your time, and
delay repentance, and friends, and
profit, and reputation, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
can be heard againſt the Word
of God, and take you off when you
do all by the halves, and languiſh in
your Chriſtian courſe, as near to
death; <hi>Stir up your ſouls</hi> with the <hi>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi>
of ſuch <hi>Queſtions</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p>Qu. 1. <hi>Can I do no more then this
for God!</hi> Who gave me all? Who
deſerveth all? Who ſeeth me in my
duties and my ſins? When he puts
me <hi>purpoſely</hi> on the trial, what I can
do for his ſake and ſervice, Can I <hi>do
no more?</hi> Can I love him no more?
and obey, and watch, and work no
more?</p>
            <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Can I do no more then this
for Chriſt?</hi> For him that did ſo much
for me? that lived ſo exactly; obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo perfectly; walked ſo inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
and meekly; deſpiſing all the
<hi>baits,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and riches of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48167:40"/>
World? that loved me to the death;
and offereth me freely all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and would bring me to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory, Are theſe careleſs, cold
and dull endeavors my beſt return
for all this mercy?</p>
            <p>Qu. 3. <hi>Can I do no more, when my
ſalvation is the prize?</hi> when Heaven
or Hell depend much on it? when I
know this before-hand, and may ſee
in the glaſſe of the holy Scriptures,
what is prepared for the <hi>diligent</hi> and
the <hi>negligent,</hi> and what work there is
and will be for ever in Heaven and
Hell on theſe accounts? Could I not
do more, if my houſe were on fire,
or my eſtate, or life, or friend in
danger, then I do for my ſalvation?</p>
            <p>Qu. 4. <hi>Can I do no more for the
ſouls of men?</hi> when they are undone
for ever if they be not ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered?
Is this my love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to my neighbour, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
freind or child?</p>
            <p>Qu. 5. <hi>Can I do no more for the
Church of God?</hi> for the publick
good? for the peace and welfare of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48167:40"/>
the Nation and our proſperity? in
ſuppreſſing ſin? in praying for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance?
or in promoting Works
of publick benefit?</p>
            <p>Qu. 6. <hi>Can I do no more, that have
loytered ſo long?</hi> and go no faſter,
that have ſlept till the evening of
my daies, when <hi>Diligence</hi> muſt be
the diſcovery of my Repentance?</p>
            <p>Qu. 7. <hi>Can I do no more, that know
not now but I am doing my laſt?</hi> That
ſee how faſt my Time makes haſte,
and know I muſt be quickly gone?
that know it muſt be <hi>now</hi> or <hi>never:</hi>
and that this is all the time I ſhall
have, on which an endleſs life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth?</p>
            <p>Qu. 8. <hi>Can I do no better, when
I know before hand, what different aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
diligence and negligence will have,
to the awakened ſoul in the review?</hi>
What a comfort it will be at death
and judgement, to be able to ſay, I
did my beſt, or loytered not away
the time I had? And what a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and heart-diſquieting thing it
will then be to look back on time as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48167:41"/>
irrecoverably loſt, and on a life of
tryal, as caſt away upon imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
while the work that we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for lay undone? ſhall I now by
trifling prepare ſuch griping and
tormenting thoughts, for my awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
conſcience?</p>
            <p>Qu. 9. <hi>Can I do no more, when I
am ſure I cannot do too much, and am
ſure there is nothing elſe to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</hi>
and that its this I live for: and
that life is for action, and diſpoſeth
thereunto; (and holy life for holy
action) and that its better not live,
then not attain the ends of living;
when I have ſo many and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
enemies; when ſloath is my
danger, and the advantage of my
enemy; when I know that Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Vigorous diligence, is ſo
neceſſary that all is loſt without it;
will temptations be reſiſted, and ſelf
denied, and concupiſcence mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fleſhly deſires tamed and
ſubdued, and ſin caſt out, and a holy
communion with Heaven maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with idleneſs and ſloath? will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48167:41"/>
be well ordered, and Church,
or City, or Country well governed?
will the careleſs ſinners that I am
bound to help, be converted and
ſaved, with ſitting ſtill, and with
ſome heartleſs cold endeavours?</p>
            <p>Qu. 10. <hi>Can I do no more that
have ſo much help?</hi> that have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of all ſorts encouraging me, and
creatures attending me; that have
health to enable me, or affliction to
remember and excite me; that have
ſuch a maſter, ſuch a work, ſuch a
reward as better cannot be deſired;
who is leſſe excuſable for neglect
then I?</p>
            <p>Qu. 11. <hi>Could I do no more, if I
were ſure that my ſalvation lay on this
one duty?</hi> that according to this
<hi>prayer,</hi> it ſhould go with me <hi>for ever;</hi>
or if the ſoul of my <hi>child,</hi> or <hi>ſervant,</hi>
or neighbour muſt ſpeed for ever,
as my endeavours ſpeed with them
now for their converſion? for ought
I know it may be thus.</p>
            <p>Qu. 12. Would I have God to
come with the ſpur and rod? How
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48167:42"/>
do I complain when affliction is up-me?
And will I neither endure
it, nor be quickened without it? Is
it not better mend my pace, and
work on eaſier tearms?</p>
            <p>I would not have diſtreſſed ſouls
to uſe theſe conſiderations meerly
to <hi>diſquiet</hi> themſelves for their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
and ſo live in <hi>heavineſs</hi> and
<hi>ſelf-vexation,</hi> becauſe they cannot
be as good as they deſire, or do as
much and as well as they ſhould do:
It is not deſpair that will mend the
matter, but make it worſe: But I
would wiſh the lazie ſloathful ſoul to
plead theſe Queſtions with it ſelf,
and try whether they have no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
power, if cloſely urged, and
ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
            <p>Believe it, Sirs, it is the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of proſperity that keeps up
the <hi>reputation</hi> of a <hi>ſlathful life,</hi> and
makes <hi>holy diligence</hi> ſeem <hi>unneceſſary.</hi>
When affliction comes, awakened
reaſon is aſhamed of this, and ſeeth
it as an odious thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48167:42"/>
BY this time you may ſee, what
difference there is, between the
judgement of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>world;</hi>
and what to think of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
of thoſe men, (be they
<hi>high</hi> or <hi>low, learned</hi> or <hi>unlearned)</hi>
that hate or oppoſe this <hi>holy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
God bids us <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ſeek</hi>
and <hi>ſerve</hi> him, with all our <hi>heart,</hi>
and <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>might:</hi> And theſe
men call them <hi>Zealots,</hi> and <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
and <hi>Puritans</hi> that <hi>endeavour</hi> it;
though, alas, they fall exceeding
ſhort, when they have done their
beſt. It is one of the moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
monſtroſities and deformities
that ever befel the nature of man,
that men, that <hi>learned men,</hi> that men
that in other things are <hi>wiſe,</hi> ſhould
<hi>ſeriouſly</hi> think that the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to obey the Lord and ſave our
ſouls, is <hi>needleſs;</hi> and that ever they
ſhould take it for a <hi>crime,</hi> and make
it a matter of <hi>reproach:</hi> That the
<hi>ſerious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diligent obeying of Gods Laws,</hi>
ſhould be the matter of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48167:43"/>
diſdain and hatred of the
world; that no men are more <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
abhorred,</hi> and toſt up and down
by impatient men; that great and
ſmall, the Rulers and the vulgar rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in <hi>moſt places</hi> of the earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure them: To think how
the <hi>firſt man</hi> that ever was born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, did <hi>hate his own brother</hi>
till he had proceeded to murder
him, becauſe he ſerved God better
then himſelf, <hi>[Becauſe his own works
were evil, and his brothers righteous,]</hi>
1 Joh. 3. 12. And how <hi>conſtantly</hi> this
horrid unnatural madneſs, hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
and raged in the world from
<hi>Cain</hi> until this day! It is not in vain
that the Holy Ghoſt addeth, in the
next words, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 13. [Marvail
not my brethren, if the world hate you]</hi>
implying that we art apt to <hi>marvail
at it;</hi> as I confeſſe I have oft and
greatly done. Methinks, it is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
a <hi>plague</hi> and <hi>ſtain</hi> in Nature,
that it doth very much to confirm
me of the truth of Scripture; of the
doctrine of mans fall, and original
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48167:43"/>
ſin, and the neceſſity of a Reconciler,
and of renewing grace.</p>
            <p>Diſtracted miſerable ſouls! is it
not enough for you to refuſe your
<hi>own ſalvation;</hi> but you muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
withal that will not imitate you!
Is it not mad enough, and bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to <hi>chooſe</hi> damnation, but you
muſt be offended withal that are not
of your mind! If <hi>you</hi> will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God, that without Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Converſion, Holineſs, and a
Heavenly Spiritual life, there is no
Salvation to be hoped for <hi>(John 3. 3,
5, 6. Mat. 18. 3. Heb. 12. 14. Rom.
8. 9, 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17.) mnſt we all
be <hi>unbelievers</hi> with you? if you will
laugh at Hell till you are in it, muſt
we do ſo too? if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> ſeem
leſs worth to you, then your <hi>fleſhly
pleaſure for a time,</hi> muſt we renounce
our <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and our <hi>Reaſon</hi> for
fear of differing from <hi>you?</hi> if you
dare differ from your <hi>Maker,</hi> and
the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
and all the <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> and
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and all that ever came
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48167:44"/>
to Heaven, might not we be bold to
differ from you? If you will needs
be ungodly, and chooſe your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
wo, be patient with them
that have more underſtanding, and
dare not be ſo hardy, as to leap af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>you</hi> in the unquenchable fire:
<hi>Mock not</hi> at <hi>Holineſs</hi> if you have no
mind of it. <hi>Hinder not</hi> them that
<hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> if
you refuſe your ſelves. Be not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of company in Hell: It will
prove no comfort to you, or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your pain.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you have the faces to
contradict the God of Truth, and
to reproach that work which he
commandeth, and to ſay, <hi>what needs
ſo much ado?</hi> when he bids us <hi>do it
with all our might;</hi> I will briefly tell
you what you are doing, and ſhew
you the ugly face of the ſcorner,
and the filthy hearts of the enemies
of Holineſs, that if it may be, you
may loath your ſelves.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Theſe enemies of Holy diligence,
deny God with their works and lives,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48167:44"/>
and are practical Atheists;</hi> and it
ſeems are ſo near of kin to <hi>[that
wicked one]</hi> (ſee 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 12.)</hi> that
they would <hi>have all others</hi> do ſo too.
And then how ſoon would <hi>earth</hi> be
turned into <hi>Hell!</hi> The caſe is plain:
If <hi>God</hi> deſerve not to be loved and
ſerved with all thy heart, and ſoul,
and might, he is <hi>not God.</hi> And if thy
wealth, or honour, or fleſh, or friend,
deſerveth more of thy love, and
care, and diligence then God, then
that is thy God that deſerveth beſt.
See now what theſe deriders of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and obedience do think of <hi>God,</hi>
and of the world.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Theſe Cainites do blaſpheme the
Governour of the world:</hi> When <hi>he</hi>
hath <hi>given Laws</hi> to the Creatures,
that he made of nothing; Theſe
wretches deride and hate men for
obeying them. If <hi>God</hi> have not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>

that think it not worth ſo <hi>much ado,</hi>

            <p>7. <hi>Theſe enemies of holineſs would

O that we had ſpent that Time, and

Care, and Labour for our ſouls,
which we ſpent on that which now

theſe men will take no warning, but

Father the Devil,</hi> Joh. 8. 42, 44. and
is his walking, ſpeaking inſtrument

of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> of his <hi>Image,</hi> and

19. 27. O that they knew, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing,

the <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>ugly</hi> picture of a <hi>Cainite,</hi>
or <hi>Enemy</hi> of a <hi>holy life,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
<hi>ſerious diligence</hi> as a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi>
and <hi>needleſs thing,</hi> when God
commandeth us, and death, and the
Grave, and Eternity admoniſh us to
do his work with all our might. Now
conſider this ye that forget God, leſt
he <hi>tear you in pieces, and there be none

            <p>BUt of all the oppoſers of <hi>ſerious
Holineſs</hi> in the world, there are
none more unexcuſable and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
miſerable, then thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
themſelves <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi>
Would one <hi>believe</hi> that had not
known them, that there are ſuch
men in the world! Alas, there are <hi>too
many.</hi> Though Education, and the
Laws of the Land engage them to
preach <hi>true doctrine,</hi> yet are they
<hi>falſe Teachers</hi> in the <hi>Application.</hi> For
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48167:48"/>
they never well learned the holy and
heavenly doctrine which they
preach, nor digeſted it, or received
the power and impreſs of it upon
their hearts; and therefore retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their natural corruptions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
and enmity to the Life, and
Power, and practice of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
they <hi>indirectly</hi> deſtroy what
directly they would ſeem to build;
and preach both for God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; for Chriſt and the <hi>Holy
Spirit,</hi> and <hi>againſt them;</hi> for <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>againſt</hi> it, both in the ſame
Sermon. In <hi>General,</hi> they muſt
needs ſpeak for the word of God,
and a holy life: But when they
come to the <hi>particulars,</hi> they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reproach it, and condemn the
<hi>parts,</hi> while they commend the
<hi>whole.</hi> In <hi>General</hi> they ſpeak well of
Religious, Godly, Holy people;
But when they <hi>meet</hi> with them, they
hate them, and make them <hi>Preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
a Sect that is <hi>every where ſpoken
againſt, peſtilent fellows, and movers of
ſedition,</hi> as the Apoſtles were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48167:48"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 5. &amp; 28. 22. and any
thing that malice can invent to
make them odious: And what they
<hi>cannot prove,</hi> they will <hi>cloſely intimate</hi>
in the <hi>falſe application</hi> of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
deſcribing them ſo as may
induce the hearers to believe that
they are a company of ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hypocrites, factious, proud, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
turbulent, peeviſh, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſingularity, deſiring to ingroſs
the reputation of Godlineſs to
themſelves, but ſecretly as bad as
others. And when they have thus
repreſented them to the ignorant
ſort of people, they have made the
way of Godlineſs odious, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
furniſhed miſerable ſouls
with prejudice and diſlike; ſo that
becauſe the perſons are thus made
hateful to them, all ſerous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
for Heaven, all tenderneſs of
Conſcience, and fear of ſinning, all
heavenly diſcourſe, and ſerious
preaching, reading, or praying, are
alſo made odious for their ſakes:
For hearing ſo ill of the perſons,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48167:49"/>
and ſeeing that theſe are the things
wherein they differ from others,
they reduce their judgement of
their <hi>practices</hi> to their foreſetled
judgement of the perſons. When
their diligence in their Families in
prayer and inſtructions, in reading,
and fruitful improvement of the
Lords day, or any other actions of
ſtrictneſs and holy induſtry are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
theſe ungodly Miniſters are
ready to blot them with ſome open
calumnies, or ſecret reproaches, or
words of ſuſpicion, to vindicate
their own unholy lives, &amp; make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe that ſerious piety is facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; hypocriſe. The black tincture
of their minds, and the deſign and
drift of their preaching may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the jeers, and girds, and
ſlanderous intimations againſt the
moſt diligent ſervants of the Lord.
The <hi>controverted truths</hi> that ſuch
maintain, they repreſent as <hi>errours:</hi>
Their <hi>unavoidable errours</hi> they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
as <hi>hereſie:</hi> Their <hi>duties</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
as <hi>faults:</hi> and their <hi>humane
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48167:49"/>
frailties</hi> as enormous <hi>crimes:</hi> They
feign them to be guilty of the things
that never entred into their <hi>thoughts.</hi>
And if <hi>ſome</hi> that have profeſſed god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
be guilty of greater crimes,
they would make men believe that
the reſt are ſuch, and that the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Chriſt is to be judged of by a
<hi>Judas,</hi> and the ſcope is to intimate
that either their Profeſſion is <hi>culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
or <hi>needleſs,</hi> and <hi>leſs commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Regeneration</hi> they would make
to be but the entrance into the
Church by Baptiſm, and any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
converſion, then the leaving
off ſome groſs ſins, and taking up
ſome heartleſs forms of duty, to be
but a fancy or unneceſſary thing:
And they would draw poor people
to believe, that if they be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Sacramentally of water, they
may be ſaved, though they be not
born again by the <hi>renewing of the
Holy Spirit.</hi> Being ſtrangers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the myſtery of <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and to the life of Faith, and a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48167:50"/>
heavenly Converſation, and to the
loving and ſerving God with all
their Soul and Might, They firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to quiet themſelves with a
belief that theſe are but fancies or
unneceſſary; and then to deceive
the people with that by which they
have firſt deceived them elves.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy your obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>what it is in Religion</hi> that theſe
formal Hypocrites <hi>are againſt.</hi> There
are ſcarce any words ſo ſound or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but they can bear them, if they be
but deprived of their <hi>Life:</hi> Nor
ſcarce any duty, if it be but <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
but they can endure. But it is
the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of all Religion
which they cannot bear. As a <hi>Body</hi>
differeth from a <hi>Carkaſs,</hi> not by the
<hi>parts,</hi> but by the <hi>life;</hi> ſo there is a
certain <hi>life</hi> in preaching, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and all other acts of worſhip,
which is perceived by ſeveral ſorts
of hearers. The <hi>Godly</hi> perceive it to
their <hi>edification</hi> and <hi>delight:</hi> For
here it is that they are quickned
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48167:50"/>
and encouraged. <hi>Life</hi> begetteth <hi>life,</hi>
as fire kindleth fire. The ungodly
often perceive it to their vexation,
if not to their conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion;
This <hi>life</hi> in preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
diſcipline, reproof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
is it which biteth, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and diſquieteth their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
And <hi>this</hi> they kick and rail
againſt; <hi>This</hi> is the thing that will
not let them ſleep quietly in their
ſin and miſery; but is calling and
jogging them to awake, and will not
let them ſin in peace, but will either
convert them or torment them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time. It is the <hi>Life</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that the hypocrite <hi>wants;</hi> and
the <hi>life</hi> that he is <hi>moſt againſt.</hi> A <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fire</hi> burneth not. A <hi>dead Lion</hi> biteth
not. The <hi>Carkaſs</hi> of an <hi>Enemy</hi> is not
<hi>formidable.</hi> Let the words of that
Sermon that <hi>moſt offendeth them,</hi> be
ſeparated from the <hi>life,</hi> and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Homily,</hi> and <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>read</hi> in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
drowſie, or a <hi>School-boys tone,</hi> and
they can <hi>bear</hi> it and <hi>commend</hi> it. Let
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48167:51"/>
the <hi>ſame words</hi> of prayer which now
they like not, be <hi>ſaid over</hi> as a <hi>life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
cuſtomary form,</hi> and they can like
it well. I ſpeak not againſt the <hi>uſe
of forms,</hi> but the <hi>abuſe</hi> of them:
Not againſt the <hi>Body,</hi> but the <hi>Carkaſs.</hi>
Let <hi>forms themſelves</hi> be uſed by a
ſpiritual ſerious man, in a <hi>ſpiritual
ſerious manner,</hi> with the inter poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any quickening exhortations,
or occaſional paſſages, that tend to
keep them waken and attentive, and
make them <hi>feel</hi> what you <hi>mean</hi> and
are <hi>about,</hi> and you ſhall ſee they love
not ſuch <hi>animated forms.</hi> It is the
<hi>living Christian,</hi> and <hi>lively worſhip,</hi>
and <hi>ſerious ſpiritual Religion,</hi> which
they hate: <hi>kill</hi> it and they can <hi>bear</hi>
it: Let the <hi>picture</hi> of my <hi>enemy</hi> be
nearer and comelier then his perſon
was, and I can endure it in my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
better then <hi>himſelf</hi> in the
<hi>meaneſt dreſs.</hi> It is the <hi>living Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
that in all parts of the world are
chiefly perſecuted: Let them be
<hi>once dead,</hi> and <hi>dead-hearted hypocrites</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48167:51"/>
themſelves will honour them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at a ſufficient diſtance: They
will deſtroy the <hi>living Saints,</hi> and
keep Holy dayes for the <hi>dead</hi> ones.
<hi>Wo to you, Scribes and Phariſees hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
becauſe ye build the Tombs
of the Prophets, and garniſh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers
of the Righteous, and ſay, if
we had been in the days of our Fathers;
we would not have been partakers with
them in the blood of the Prophets:
Wherefore be ye witneſſes unto your
ſelves, that ye are the children of them
which killed the Prophets: Fill ye up the
meaſure of your Fathers; ye ſerpents;
ye generation of vipers, how can ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
the damnation of Hell!</hi> Matth.
23. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. The dog that
will not meddle with the <hi>dead crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
will purſue the <hi>living;</hi> and
when he ſees it <hi>ſtir no more,</hi> will <hi>leave
it.</hi> Chriſtianity without <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi>
is not Chriſtianity; and therefore
not lyable to the hatred of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as ſuch. Say any thing, and
do any thing how ſtrict ſo ever, if
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48167:52"/>
you will but act it as a player on the
ſtage, or do it coldly, ſlightly, &amp; as if
you were but in jeaſt, you may have
their approbation. But it is this <hi>life,</hi>
and <hi>ſeriouſneſs,</hi> and worſhipping
God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
them that <hi>they themſelves
are lifeleſs,</hi> and therefore troubleth
their deceitful peace, and therefore
muſt not have their friendſhip. If it
were the meer <hi>bulk</hi> of duty that they
are weary of, how comes it to paſs
that a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> at his Pſalter, Beads,
and Maſs-books, can ſpend more
hours without much wearineſs or
oppoſition, then we can do in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worſhip? Turn all but into
<hi>words,</hi> and <hi>beads,</hi> and <hi>canonical hours</hi>
and <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>ſhews,</hi> and <hi>ceremony,</hi>
and you may be as religious as you
will, and be <hi>Righteous overmuch,</hi> and
few will hate, or reproach, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
you <hi>among them,</hi> as too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
or ſtrict. But <hi>living Christians</hi>
and <hi>worſhip,</hi> come among them like
fire, that burneth them, and makes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48167:52"/>
them ſmart, with a <hi>word that is quick,
powerful, ſharper then any two edged
ſword, piercing even to the dividing of
ſoul and ſpirit, joynts and marrow, and
is a diſcerner of the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>enmity</hi> of the <hi>Cainites</hi>
may teach the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> what he
ſhould be, and wherein his <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
lieth. It is <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> that
your enemies hate: and therefore
it is <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> that you muſt
above all maintain; though dead-hearted
hypocrites never ſo much
oppoſe and contradict you.</p>
            <p>O ſirs, they are no trifles, but the
greateſt things that God hath ſet
before you in his Word, and called
you out to proſecute and poſſeſſe:
and your time of ſeeking them is
ſhort; and therefore you have no
time fortrifles, nor any to loſe in
idleneſs and ſloath. And of all
men, Preachers ſhould be moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of this. If <hi>they were not</hi> againſt
ſerious holineſs in <hi>others,</hi> it is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48167:53"/>
wickedneſs for ſuch as they, to
be <hi>againſt it in themſelves.</hi> It is great
things that they have to ſtudy and
to ſpeak of; and ſuch as call for the
greateſt ſeriouſneſs, and reverence
and gravity in the ſpeaker, and
condemn all trifling in <hi>matter</hi> or in
manner. A man that is ſent to Chriſt
to run for an immortal crown, or
to direct others in ſuch a race, to
ſave his own, or other mens ſouls,
from endleſs miſery, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to fill up his time with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
or to be ſlight and cold about
ſuch great and weighty things. All
the heart, and ſoul, and might, is
little enough for matters of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
importance. When I hear
Preachers or people ſpend time, in
little impertinent fruitleſs things,
that do but divert them from the
great buſineſs of their lives, or to
<hi>dally</hi> with the <hi>greateſt matters,</hi> rather
then to uſe them, and treat of them
with a ſeriouſneſs ſuitable to their
importance, I oft think of the words
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48167:53"/>
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> the <hi>ſerious Moralin,</hi> as
ſhaming the hypocriſie of ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling

For the <hi>Nurſe</hi> to poiſon them;
for the <hi>parents</hi> to cut the <hi>childrens
throats,</hi> is worſe then for an <hi>enemy</hi> to
do it. If the <hi>Devil</hi> our profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſhould himſelf appear to us, and
ſay, <hi>[Prepare not ſo ſeriouſly for death:
Be not ſo ſtrict, and diligent, and holy]</hi>
it were not, in many reſpects, <hi>ſo bad,</hi>
as for <hi>you</hi> to do it, that ſhould help

profeſs your ſelves their Fathers!
that ſhould travail in birth till
Chriſt be formed in your peoples
hearts! that ſhould love your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as your own bowels, and tender
the weak, and pitty the wicked, and
ſtick at no labour, ſuffering or coſt,
that might advance their holineſs,
and further their Salvation; For
you to tempt men into a <hi>careleſs
life,</hi> and turn them out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way, is an aggravated cruelty.
Its worſe for the Shepherd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us then the Wolf. Read <hi>Ezek.</hi>
34. &amp; 33.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Are you not aſhamed thus to
contradict your ſelves?</hi> What can
you find to <hi>Preach</hi> from the <hi>Word of
God,</hi> that tendeth not to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diligence which you are againſt?
How can you make ſhift to Preach
an hour, and not acquaint men
with the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God with all their Might?</hi> Do
you not tell them, that <hi>except they
be converted and new born, they ſhall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48167:63"/>
not enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi>
John 3. 3, 5. Mat. 18. 3. And <hi>that
without holineſs none ſhall ſee the
Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. And <hi>that if
they live after the fleſh, they ſhall die,</hi>
Rom. 8. 13. And <hi>that except their
righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees they
ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 20. And will you
in your <hi>Application,</hi> or <hi>private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
unſay</hi> all this again, and
give God and your ſelves the <hi>Lye?</hi>
And let people ſee, that the Pulpit
is to you but as a Stage, and that
you believe not what you ſpeak?</p>
            <p>7. Conſider, that your <hi>place and
calling, maketh you the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervants of the Devil,</hi> and ſo the
moſt bloody murderers of Souls,
while <hi>you</hi> give your judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a ſtrict and Heavenly life.
For a <hi>Drunkaod in an Ale-houſe</hi> to
mock the Miniſter, and rail at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Religion, is leſs regarded by
ſober men, and ſmall advantage to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48167:64"/>
his Maſters cauſe; nay the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his life, is ſo great a ſhame
to his judgement, that it inclineth
many to think well of thoſe that
he ſpeaks againſt. But when a
man that pretendeth to learning and
underſtanding, and to be himſelf a
Paſtor of the Church, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Miſteries of Chriſt, ſhall
make them odious, that are moſt
careful for their Souls, and moſt
exact in pleaſing God, and ſhall
make all <hi>ſerious diligence</hi> for Heaven
to ſeem but intemperate <hi>zeal</hi> and
<hi>ſelfconceitedneſs:</hi> and ſhall deſcribe
a Saint as if the formal lifeleſs Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
that giveth God but the
leavings of the world, and never
ſet his heart on Heaven, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the man: what a ſnare is here
for the perdition of the ignorant!
They that are naturally averſe from
holineſs, and are eaſily perſwaded
to think that to be unneceſſary or
bad, which ſeems ſo much above
them, and againſt them, will be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48167:64"/>
much confirmed in their miſtakes
and miſery, when they hear their
Teachers ſpeak without them, the
fame that Satan by his ſuggeſtions
doth within them. This turneth a
trembling ſinner, into a hardened
ſcorner: he that before went under
the daily correction of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for neglecting God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
holy duties, and living to
the fleſh, grows bold and fearleſs,
when he hears the Preacher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the ſtricter purer way. By
that time he hath heard a while the
fear of God derided as preciſeneſs,
and a tender conſcience reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a ſcrupulous fooliſh thing, his
conſcience grows more plyable to
his luſts, and hath little more to
ſay againſt them. When Gods own
profeſſed Miniſters, that ſhould be
wiſer and better then the people,
are againſt this zeal, and induſtry
for Heaven, the people will ſoon
think, that at leaſt it is tolerable in
them. And they will ſooner learn
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48167:65"/>
to deride a <hi>Saint</hi> from a <hi>Sermon,</hi>
or diſcourſe of a <hi>Preacher</hi> or a <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man,</hi> then from the ſcorns or
talk of hundreds of the ignorant.
And wilt thou <hi>teach</hi> them to <hi>hate
Godlineſs,</hi> who haſt undertaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Righteous God, to teach
them to practice it? He that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſeth
it, though under other
names, and repreſenteth it as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though masked with the title of
ſome odious vice, doth indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make men hate it. And
what a terrible account wilt thou
have to make, when the ſeduction
and tranſgreſſion of all theſe ſinners
ſhall be charged upon thee? When
Chriſt ſhall ſay to the haters, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and oppoſers of his holy wayes
and ſervants <hi>[In as much as you did
it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you did it unto me.]</hi> How durſt
you ſcorn the image of your Maker?
and hate the <hi>Saints</hi> whoſe <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
you profeſſed to <hi>believe;</hi> and
deride or oppoſe that <hi>ſerious holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:48167:65"/>
without which you had no
hope of being ſaved? If then the
ſinners become your accuſers, and
ſay, <hi>[Lord, we thought it had been but
unneceſſary preciſeneſs, and that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Chriſtians had been but ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
factious hypocrites, and that lip
ſervice with a common worldly life
might have ſerved the turn; We heard
our Preachers repreſent ſuch strict and
zealous men, as turbulent, ſeditious,
and refractory, as odious and not as
imitable: Their application was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>8. <hi>Are not the people backward

Is not the corrupted heart of lapſed

            <p>But 1. I do here ſolomnly profeſs
that I hate theſe crimes as well as
you: and that it is not any part of
my intention to plead for <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
diſobedience in lawful things,</hi>
for <hi>ſchiſms,</hi> or <hi>faction,</hi> or <hi>any irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity:</hi>
And this I here put in againſt
thoſe that are diſpoſed to miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

leave it as <hi>on record</hi> to prove them
ſlanderers, that ſhall accuse me of

and <hi>have not the leaſt intent to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that any others are guilty of that
crime that are not.</hi> But having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
this proteſtation, to prevent

now to the guilty.</p>
            <p>2. If it be <hi>crimes</hi> only that you

            </p>
            <p>3. Why do not you <hi>commend thoſe</hi>

And why do you not commend the

<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> be ſecretly

<hi>have ſome</hi> fault to be accuſed of? If
men be <hi>faulty,</hi> you ſhould perſwade
them to be <hi>more ſtrict</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi>
and not <hi>leſs:</hi> It is for <hi>want</hi> of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and ſtrictneſs that they <hi>ſin.</hi>
Nothing is more contrary to their
<hi>faults,</hi> then <hi>Holineſs.</hi> There is no
other way for their full reformation.
And therefore all true humbled
Chriſtians are ready to confeſs their
faultineſs themſelves; but ſo far are
they from thinking the worſe of
piety for it, that its one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that moveth them to go on, and
to read, and hear, and pray, and
meditate, and do ſo much that they
may get more ſtrength againſt their
faults. Muſt they think ill of food,
and phyſick, and exerciſe, becauſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48167:70"/>
they are infirm? All faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
tell their people plainly of
their ſins (ſo far as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

But they do it not in a way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
to their holy diligence;
They do not therefore call them off
from Godlineſs, nor tempt them to
be leſs in the uſe of means, but more
by how much their need is greater.
A holy heart, and a malignant
heart, will ſhew their difference in
the reproving of the ſame fault.
The one layeth all the <hi>odium</hi> on the

it is a <hi>duty to rebel,</hi> or <hi>diſobey;</hi> and
that muſt be becauſe that God hath

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48167:81"/>
you (&amp; remember another day that

the boldeſt Infidel in the world, nor
the bittereſt enemy to <hi>holineſs</hi> in this
Aſſembly, but ſhortly would wiſh

            <p>Honourable and beloved Hearers,
I beſeech you do not take it ill, that
I ſpeak ſo much of theſe matters
that are ſo unpleaſant and unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to unbelieving, careleſs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
hearts: It is that I may prevent
all this in time, by the awakenings
of true Repentance: And O that
this might be the ſucceſs! That I
might hear by your penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and ſee by your univerſal
ſpeedy reformation, that God hath
ſo great Mercy for you, &amp; that theſe
perſwaſions might be the means of
ſo much Happineſſe to you, and
comfort unto me! However <hi>this
Aſſembly</hi> ſhall be <hi>witneſſes</hi> that you
were warned: and <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhall
be witneſs, that if you waſt the reſt
of your dayes in the pleaſures and
vanities of this deceitful world, it
was not becauſe you <hi>could have no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48167:84"/>
better,</hi> and were not <hi>called</hi> to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
things. That if you <hi>yet ſtand idle,</hi>
it is not becauſe you could not be
<hi>hired.</hi> For in the name of Chriſt
I have called you into his vineyard,
and told you of your work and
wages, and aſhamed your excuſes
and objections this day. Come away
then ſpeedily from the ſnares of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the Company of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hardened men, and caſt away
the works of darkneſſe! Heaven is
before you! Death is at hand: The
Eternal God hath ſent to call you!
Mercy doth yet ſtretch forth its
arms! You have ſtaid too long, and
abuſed Patience too much already:
Stay no longer! O now pleaſe God,
and comfort us, and ſave your
ſelves by <hi>Reſolving that this ſhall be
the Day:</hi> and <hi>faithfully performing
of this your Reſolution, Vp and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
Believe, Repent, Deſire, Obey,
and do all this with all your <hi>Might.</hi>
Love him that you muſt Love for
ever, and Love him with all your
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48167:85"/>
Soul and Might; ſeek that which
is truly worth the ſeeking, and it
will pay for all your coſt and pains:
And ſeek it firſt with all <hi>your Might:</hi>
Remembring ſtill it muſt be <hi>Now</hi> or
<hi>Never.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEfore I conclude, I have two
meſſages yet to deliver to the
ſervants of the Lord: The <hi>One</hi> is
of <hi>Encouragement:</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> of
<hi>Direction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that many of you have a
<hi>threefold trouble,</hi> which requireth
a <hi>threefold comfort</hi> and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>One is, that you have done ſo
little of your work; but loſt ſo
much of your time already: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
is, that you are ſo oppoſed
and hindred. And the greateſt
of all is, that you are yet ſo dull
and ſlow: The cure of which
muſt be the matter of my <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:48167:85"/>
1. For the firſt: That you
have loſt your Time, muſt be the
matter of your Humiliation: But
that all is not loſt, before you ſee
your ſin and duty; but yet the
patience and mercy of the Lord
are attending you, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your hope; this is the <hi>matter
of your comfort and encouragement.</hi>
Repent therefore that you came
no ſooner home: But rejoyce that
you are come home at laſt: and
now be more diligent in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your time, in remembrance
of the time already loſt; And
though it muſt be your grief,
that your Maſter hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of ſo much as his ſervice,
and others of ſo much good which
you ſhould have done them, and
that time is loſt that cannot be
recalled; yet it is your comfort,
that your own Reward may be
equal with them that have born
the burthen and heat of the day:
For many that are laſt (in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48167:86"/>
time of their coming in) ſhall be
firſt (in receiving their reward.)
This is the meaning of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to encourage them that had
ſtood out too long, and to rebuke
the envie, and high expectations
of them that came in ſooner:
and it is no whit contradictory
to thoſe paſſages in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.
which intimate a different degree
of glory to be given to them that
have different degrees of Grace
upon their induſtrious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The one Parable <hi>Matth.</hi>
20. ſhews that men ſhall not be
rewarded differently for their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or ſhorter continuance in the
work, but that thoſe that came
in late, and yet are found with
equal holineſs, ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
equally with the firſt: And
more, if their holineſs be more,
which the ſecond Parable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
declaring Gods purpoſe to
give them the greateſt Glory,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48167:86"/>
that have improved their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the greateſt Meaſure. O
therefore that the ſenſe of your
former unkindneſs might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you the more reſolvedly to
give up your ſelves in fervent
love, and full obedience! and
then you will find that your
Time is Redeemed, though it
cannot be recalled; and that
Mercy hath ſecured your full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
O what an unſpeakable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Mercy is this! that if yet you
will devote your ſelves entirely to
Chriſt, and ſerve him with your
might, the little time that yet
remains, he will take it as if you
had come in at the firſt hour of
the day!</p>
            <p>2. And as for the Oppoſition
and hinderances in your way,
they are no other then what
your Lord foretold. He hath gone
before you, and conquered much
more then ever you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
from without (though he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48167:87"/>
had not a body of ſin to conquer:
and in that reſpect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of his <hi>Spirit</hi> in his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
hath the preheminence of
his perſonal conqueſt.) He hath
bid you <hi>Be of good chear,</hi> becauſe
he hath overcome the World.
If you will not take up your
croſs and follow him, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be his Diſciples, <hi>Joh. 16. 33.
Luk.</hi> 14. 27, 33. Would you be
<hi>ſoldiers</hi> on condition you <hi>may not
fight;</hi> or <hi>fight,</hi> and yet have no <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition?</hi>
Follow the Captain of
your ſalvation. If mocking, or
buffeting, or ſpitting in his face,
or hanging him upon a Croſs, or
piercing his ſide, would have made
him give up the work of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
you had been left to
utter deſperation. The oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is <hi>conquerable,</hi> ſhould ſerve
but to excite your <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi>
in a caſe of ſuch <hi>neceſſity</hi>
where you <hi>muſt prevail,</hi> or <hi>periſh.</hi>
Have you God himſelf on your
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48167:87"/>
ſide, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. and Chriſt your
Captain, and the Spirit of Chriſt
to give you courage, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to invite you, and Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and Hell behind you,
and the examples of ſuch an Army
of conquering Believers: and
ſhall the <hi>ſcorns</hi> or <hi>threats</hi> of a
crawling Worm prevail againſt
all theſe for your diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
You are not afraid leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man ſhould pull down the <hi>Sun,</hi>
or dry up the <hi>Sea,</hi> or overturn the
<hi>Earth:</hi> And are you afraid that Man
ſhould <hi>conquer</hi> God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. or
take you out of the hands of Chriſt?
<hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. 39. Mark how they

They gather themſelves together: they

when they wait for my ſoul.]</hi> But
what did he therefore <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>fly</hi> from
God? No, <hi>[What time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee: In God will I

praiſe his word; In God have I put
my trust; I will not fear what fleſh
can do unto me]</hi> Iſa. 51. 7, 8.
<hi>[Hearken to me; ye that know righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
the people in whoſe heart is
the Law; Fear ye not the reproach of
men, neither be ye afraid of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings;
For the moth ſhall eat them
up like a garment, and the worm ſhall

You deſerve to be ſhut out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if you will not bear the breath

            <p>3. <hi>But (ſaith the ſelf-accuſing ſoul)</hi>
I am convinced that I ought to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
for my ſalvation, and that all
this is too little that I can do: but I
am dull, and cold, and negligent in
all: I am far from doing it with my
might: I hear, and read, and pray, as
if I did it not, and as if I were half
aſleep, or my heart were away upon
ſomewhat elſe. I fear I am but a lazy
hypocrite.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48167:88"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſpeak to thy
<hi>doubt,</hi> and then to direct thee againſt
thy ſin.</p>
            <p>And firſt, you muſt be reſolved

3. Between that ſloath

            <p>And ſo the caſe lieth plain before

of your <hi>affections,</hi> and the <hi>backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

God and duty.</hi> For all the powers
of your ſoul will languiſh, when
you ſhould ſet them on work on
ſpiritual things, and your hearts
will be abroad, when you ſhould
be wholly taken up with God,
if once they be entangled with
worldly things. Watch therefore
over them in your Callings, leſt

            <p>
               <hi>Dir. 3. If it be poſſible, live under
a lively Miniſtry, that when your
hearts go cold and dull unto the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
they may come warm and
quickned home.</hi> Life cheriſheth life,
as fire kindleth fire. The Word
and Ordinances of God are
quick, powerful, and ſharper then
any two-edged ſword, piercing
even to the dividing aſunder of
ſoul and ſpirit, and is a diſcerner
of the thoughts and intents of the
hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. and therefore
it may do much to make you feel.
Many a thouſand hath it pricked
at the heart, and ſent them home
alive, that before were dead, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 37. Much more may you expect
that it ſhould excite the principles
which you have already.</p>
            <p>Dir. 4. If it may be, converſe with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48167:91"/>
lively, active, stirring Christians;
<hi>but eſpecially have</hi> one ſuch <hi>for a</hi>
boſome Friend, <hi>that will warm you
when you are cold, and help to
awake you when you drop a ſleep,
and will not comply with you
in a declining, lazie, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
courſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. 9, 10, 11.
Two are better then one, becauſe they
have a good reward for their labour:
For if they fall, the one will lift up
his fellow; but woe to him that is
alone when he falleth, for he hath not
another to help him up. Again, if
two lie together, then they have heat;
but how can one alone be warm?
And if one prevail against him, two
ſhall withstand him; and a threefold
cord is not eaſily broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir. 5. Put not away from you the
day of death. Look not for long life.</hi>
It is the life to come that muſt be
the life of all your duties here:
and diſtant things do loſe their
force. Set death, and judgment,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48167:91"/>
and eternall life continually as
near at hand; live in a watchfull
expectation of your change, do all
as dying men, and as paſſing to
receive the recompence of endleſſe
joy or woe; and this will quicken
you. To this end, go often to the
<hi>houſe of mourning,</hi> and be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
or immoderately in the
Houſe of Mirth. When you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what is the end of all men,
the heart will be made better by
it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of carnal mirth doth infatuate
men, and deſtroy their wiſdom, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
and ſobriety. Keep always
a ſenſe of the brevity of Life, and
of the preciouſneſs of Time, and
remember that it is poſting on whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you work or play. Methinks, if
you forget any of the reſt, this one
conſideration that we have in hand,
ſhould make you beſtir you with

            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48167:92"/>
I ſhall only add two needful <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
leſt while we cure one diſeaſe,
we cauſe another (as knowing that

            <p>1. <hi>Deſire and labour more for an

For <hi>theſe latter</hi> are more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant

            <p>And obſerving <hi>theſe cautions,</hi> let

            </p>
            <p>THough I know that the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to a holy, heavenly life is ſo
radicated in corrupted nature, that
all that I have ſaid is neceſſary and
too little; yet ſome I know will think
it ſtrange that I ſhould intimate, that
any that preach the Goſpel are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48167:93"/>
of any meaſure of this ſin, and
will think that I intend by it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon ſome parties above the
reſt. But again I profeſs, that it
is no party but the Devills party,
and the ungodly party, that I
mean and its hard if you will not
beleve me concerning my own ſenſe.
Nor is it my deſire that any of the
odiouſneſs of Schiſm, Sedition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
or diſobedience to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſhould be ſo much as diminiſhed
by any mens profeſſion of godlineſs.
No, I beſeech you, by how much the
more godly you are, by ſo much the
more deteſt all theſe; godlineſſe
tendeth to ſhame &amp; condemn theſe
odious ſins, and not to be a cloak for
them or any extenuation. Nay, what
can more aggravate them, then
that they ſhould be found in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of godlineſs? I again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that I have no deſign but to plead
for <hi>ſerious</hi> diligence in the Religion
which we are all agreed in, and to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48167:93"/>
ſtop the mouth of thoſe that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſpeak againſt it.</p>
            <p>But alas! it is too evident that I
have too many to ſpeak to that are
not innocent; why elſe doth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tell us that ſuch there will be
ſtill to the end of the world? and
that there is ſome that preach Chriſt
of ſtrife and envy, to add affliction
to the bonds of the afflicted! And
how came holy Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> to find ſo
much work for theſe rebukes ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his time, as in his books you
find? And can we already forget
what abundance of <hi>Antinomian</hi>
Teachers were among us, that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out the very doctrine of practical
diligence, and crying it down as a
ſetting up our ſelves and our own
works, and as injurious to free grace;
and under pretence of exalting
Chriſt did ſet up an heartleſs, life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
doctrine, that tended to turn
out the life of a Chriſtianity, and
take men off their neceſſary dili-
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48167:94"/>
as a legal dangerous thing?</p>
            <p>And what Ordinance of God hath
not been caſt out by Preachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon Religious pretences,
Family-Duties, Catechiſing, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Pſalms, Baptiſm, the Lords
Supper, and which not? And if
all theſe were down, wherein ſhould
the practice of Religion conſiſt?
And what abundance of Pamphlets
had we that laboured to make the
Orthodox, faithfull Miniſtry a very
ſcorn, and deride them for their
faithful ſervice of God, and their
faithfulneſs to their Superiors, inop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to their unrighteous ways?
I am loath to blot my papers, and
trouble your ears with the names
of the <hi>Martin</hi>-mar-prieſts, and a
multitude of ſuch others which I
mean.</p>
            <p>And let no Papiſt, or any enemy
of our Church, reproach us, becauſe
ſuch enemies to Holineſs are found
among us. Can it be expected that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48167:94"/>
our Church ſhould be better than
the Family of <hi>Adam,</hi> that had a
<hi>Cain?</hi> or of <hi>Noah,</hi> that had a <hi>Cham?</hi>
or of Chriſt, that had a <hi>Judas?</hi> And
are there not far more enemies to
ſerious godlineſs among the Papiſts
themſelves, then among us? One
inſtance out of the Life of <hi>Philip
Nerius,</hi> the Father of the Oratori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
I will put into the Preface, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is too long to be here inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
There is no place, nor rank of
men in the world, where ſome of
the enemies of an holy life are not
to be found, even among thoſe that
profeſs the ſame Religion in Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
with thoſe whom they oppoſe.
Chriſt and the Devil have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Armies; and if once the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
disband his Souldiers, and have
none to oppoſe a holy life, then tell
me that its a needleſs thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, and to confute them. But I
am liſted under Chriſt, &amp; will never
give over pleading for him, till his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48167:95"/>
adverſaries give over pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and his cauſe, as long as
he continueth my liberty and duty.
And bleſſed be the Lord, that if an
Hypocritical Preacher be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, that ſecretly or openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth
a diligent holy life, there are
more able, holy faithful ones to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
him both by Doctrine, and by
their Lives, then are to be found in
any other Kingdom in the world
proportionally, that ever I could
hear of. And that the faithful Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are ſo many, and the <hi>Judas'es</hi>
ſo few, how great a bleſſing is it to
this Land, and how great an honour
to his Majeſties Government, and to
the Church in his Dominions? The
Lord teach this ſinful Nation to be
thankful, and pardon their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and never deprive them of
this forfeited mercy. The Lord teach
them to hearken to the Friends, and
not to the Enemies of Holineſs, and
never to receive a wound at the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48167:95"/>
heart of their Religion, however
they hear their ſmaller differences
about things circumſtantial.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhould conclude, I am
<hi>loth to end,</hi> for fear leſt I have not
yet prevailed with you: What are
you now <hi>reſolved to do</hi> from this day
forward? It is <hi>work</hi> that we have
been ſpeaking of, and <hi>neceſſary work</hi>
of endleſs conſequence, which <hi>muſt</hi>
be done, and quickly done, and
throughly done. Are you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that <hi>it is ſo?</hi> that plowing
and ſowing are not more neceſſary
to your harveſt, then the work of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
in this day of grace, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to your ſalvation? You are blind
if you ſee not this: you are dead if
you feel it not: what then will you
do? For Gods ſake, and for your
own ſake, ſtand not demurring till
time be gone. It is all that the Devil
deſireth, if he can but find you one
thing or other to be thinking, and
talking, and doing about, to keep
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48167:96"/>
you from this till time be gone; and
then he will inſult over you, &amp; then
he that kept you from ſeeing and
feeing, will help you to ſee and feel
to your calamity: Then the <hi>Devil</hi>
will make you feel that which Preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers
could not make you feel: and
he will make you think of that, and
lay it cloſe enough to your hearts,
which we could not get you to lay
to heart. Now we ſtudy and preach
to you in hope, but then (alas it
breaks our hearts to think of it) we
have done with you for ever, becauſe
all hope is gone. Then the Devil
may challenge a Miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r: [Now do

will you ſtop your ears, and go on in

our hearts to fore-ſee that day! Muſt
we ſee the Devil go away with ſuch

hear him that ſhed his blood for ſouls
and tendereth you now ſalvation by

delay, before all is gone, and you
are gone, and he that now deceiveth
you, torment you! Yet hold on a
little longer in a carnal, earthly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified
ſtate, and it is too late
to hope, to pray, or ſtrive for your
ſalvation: Yet a little longer, and
mercy will have done with you for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48167:97"/>
ever; and Chriſt will never invite
you more, nor never offer to cleanſe
you by his Blood, or ſanctifie you by
his Spirit! Yet a little longer, and
you ſhall never hear a Sermon more,
and never more be troubled with
thoſe Preachers that were in good
ſadneſs with you, and longed once
for your converſion and ſalvation!
O ſleepy dead-hearted ſinners, what
ſhould I do to ſhow you how near
you ſtand to Eternity, and what is
now doing in the world that you
are going to, &amp; how theſe things are
thought on there! What ſhould I do
to make you know how Time is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
how ſin and holineſſe are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the world where you muſt
live for ever! What ſhould I do to
make you know thoſe things to day,
which I will not thank you to know
when you are gone hence! O that
the Lord would open your eyes in
time! Could I but make you know
theſe things as believers ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48167:97"/>
know them, I ſay not as thoſe that
<hi>ſee them,</hi> nor yet as <hi>dreamers,</hi> that
do not regard them, but as thoſe
that believe that they muſt ſhortly
ſee them; what a joyfull hours work
ſhould I eſteem this! how happy
would it be to you and me, if every
word were accompanied with tears!
If I followed you home and beg'd
your Conſideration on my bear
knees, or as a beggar begs an alms at
your doors, If this Sermon coſt me
as many cenſures or ſlanders as ever
Sermon did, I ſhould not think it
too dear, if I could but help you to
ſuch a ſight of the things we ſpeak
of, that you might truly underſtand
them as they are: that you had but
a true awakned apprehenſion of the
ſhortneſſe of your day, of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of eternity, and of the endleſs
conſequence of your preſent work;
and what holy labour and ſinful loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
will be thought of in the
world to come for ever! But when
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48167:98"/>
we ſee you ſin, and trifle, and no
more regard your endleſs life, and
ſee alſo what haſte your Time is
making, and yet cannot make you
underſtand theſe things; when we
know our ſelves as ſure as we ſpeak
to you, that you will ſhortly be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the review of your preſent
ſloth and folly, and when we know
that theſe matters are not thought
of in another world, as they are
among the ſleepy or the bedlam ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
here, and yet know not how to
<hi>make you know it,</hi> whom it doth ſo
exceeding much concern; <hi>this</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazeth
us, and almoſt breaks our
hearts! Yea, when we tell you of
things that are <hi>paſt doubt,</hi> and can
be no further matter of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
then men have ſold their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
&amp; betrayed their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to their ſordid luſts, and yet
we cannot get reaſonable men to
know that which they cannot chooſe
but know, to know that ſeriouſly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48167:98"/>
and practically, which alwayes hath
a witneſs in their breaſts, and which
none but the profligate dare deny:
I tell you ſinners, this, even this is
worſe then a priſon to us; it is you
that are our perſecutors; it is you
that are the <hi>daily ſorrow</hi> of our <hi>hearts;</hi>
its you that diſappoint us of our
hopes, and make us loſe ſo much of
the labour of our lives! And if all
others did as ſome do by us, alas
how ſad an employment ſhould we
have! and how little would it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us to be ſilenced and laid aſide!
If we were ſick of the ambitious or
covetous thirſt, we ſhould then ſay
that it is they that deny us wealth
and honour that diſappoint us. But
if we are Chriſtians, this is not our
caſe, but it is the thirſt after your
converſion and ſalvation which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
us: and therefore it is you,
even you that linger in your ſins and
delay repentance, and forget your
home, and neglect your ſouls, it is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48167:99"/>
you that diſappoint us, and you that
are our afflicters; and as much as
you think you befriend us when you
plead our cauſe againſt men of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and rage, it is you that ſhall
anſwer for the loſs of our time, and
labour, and hope, <hi>and for the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of your Teachers hearts.</p>
            <p>Sinners, what ever the Devil and
raging paſſion may ſay againſt a holy
life, God and your own conſciences
ſhall be our witneſſes, that we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
nothing unreaſonable, or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at your hands. I know it is
the maſter-piece of the Devils craft,
when he cannot keep all Religion in
contempt, to raiſe up a duſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
in the world about names,
and forms, and circumſtances in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that he may keep men buſily
ſtriving about theſe, while Religion
it ſelf is neglected or unknown;
and that he may make men believe
that they have ſome Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are for one ſide or other
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48167:99"/>
in theſe controverſies: and eſpecially
that he may entice men to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the ſubſtantials of Religion it
ſelf among theſe leſſer doubtful
points, and make ſinners believe
that it is but the preciſe opinion of
one party that they reject, while
they reject the ſerious practice of
all true Religion. And ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
gets more by theſe petty quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and controverſies, occaſioned
by contentious empty men, then
he could have done by the open op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Infidels, Heathens, or
the prophane: So that neither I, nor
any man that <hi>opinionative</hi> men have
a mind to quarrel with, can tell how
to exhort <hi>you</hi> to the very practice of
Chriſtianity it ſelf, but you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
caſting your thoughts upon
ſome points wherein we are report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to differ from <hi>you,</hi> or remembring
ſome clamours of malicious men,
that prejudice againſt the perſon of
the ſpeaker, make keep your ſouls
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48167:100"/>
from profiting <hi>to ſalvation</hi> by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which even your ſelvs profeſs.</p>
            <p>If this be the caſe of any one of
you, I do not mean your conſciences
ſhall ſo ſcape the power or evidence
of the truth. Doſt thou talk of our
differences about Forms and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies?
Alas man! what's that to
the meſſage which we come about
to thee, what is that to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that we are preaching of?
The queſtion that I am putting to
you, is not whether you will be
for this form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or for that, for a Ceremony or
againſt it; but it is, whether you
will hearken in time to God and
conſcience, and be as buſie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for Heaven as ever you have
been to provide for Earth? and
whether you will ſet your ſelves to
do the work that you are Created
and Redeemed for? This is the
buſineſs that I am ſent to call you to;
what ſay you? will you do it, and do
it ſeriouſly without delay? You ſhall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48167:100"/>
not be able to ſay, that I called you
to a party, a faction, or ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of my own, or laid your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon ſome doubtful controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
No ſinner, thy conſcience ſhall
have no ſuch ſhift for its deceit: It
is godlineſſe, ſerious and practical
godlineſs that thou art called to. It is
nothing but what all <hi>chriſtians</hi> in the
world, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
and all the parties among
thoſe that are <hi>true chriſtians,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of. That I may
not <hi>leave thee</hi> in any <hi>darkneſs</hi> which
<hi>I can deliver thee from,</hi> Ile tell <hi>thee</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly,
though ſuccinctly, what it is
that thou art thus importuned to;
and tell me then whether it be that
which <hi>any christian can make doubt of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That which I intreat of thee
is, but to live as one, that verily
believeth there is a God, and that
this God is the Creator, the Lord,
and Ruler of the world; and that it
is incomparably more of our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48167:101"/>
to underſtand and obey his
Laws, and as faithful Subjects to
be conformed to them, then to
obſerve or be conformed to the
Laws of Man: And to live as men
that do believe, that this God is
Almighty, and the greateſt of
men are leſs then crawling worms
to him; and that he is infinitely
wiſe, and the wiſdom of man is
fooliſhneſs to him; and that he is
infinitely good and amiable, and
the beſt of creatures is dung and
filth in compariſon of him; and
that his love is the only felicity
of man, and that none are happy
but thoſe that do enjoy it, and
none that do enjoy it can be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable;
and that riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and fleſhly delights are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
vanities in compariſon of the
eternal love of God. Live but as
men that heartily believeth all
this, and I have that I come for.
And is any of this a matter of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48167:101"/>
controverſie or doubt? not among
Chriſtians I am ſure: not among
wiſe men. It is no doubt to thoſe
in heaven, nor to thoſe in hell, not
to thoſe that have not loſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
upon earth, they Live then
according to theſe truths.</p>
            <p>2. Live as men that verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>Mankind is fallen into ſinne
and miſery,</hi> and that all men are
corrupted, and under the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Law of God, till <hi>they</hi>
are delivered, pardoned, reconciled
to God, and made new creatures
by a renewing, reſtoring ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
change. Live but as men that
believe that this cure muſt be
wrought, and this great reſtoring
change muſt be made upon your
ſelves, if it be not done <hi>already.</hi> Live
as men that have ſo great a work
to <hi>look</hi> after. And is this a matter of
<hi>any</hi> doubt or controverſie? ſure it is
not to a Chriſtian: and me-thinks
it ſhould not be to <hi>any</hi> man elſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48167:102"/>
that knoweth <hi>himſelf,</hi> any more then
to a man in a <hi>dropſy,</hi> whether he be
diſeaſed, when he feels the thirſt, and
ſees the ſwelling. Did you but know
what cures and changes are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to be made upon your diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
miſerable ſouls; if you care what
becomes of them, you would ſoon
ſee cauſe to look about you. 3. Live
but as men that verily believe that
you are <hi>Redeemed by the Son of God,</hi>
who hath ſuffered for your ſins, and
brought you the tidings of <hi>pardon</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſalvation,</hi> which you may have if you
will give up your <hi>ſelves</hi> to him, who
is the phyſitian of ſouls, to be healed
by him. Live as men that believe,
that the infinite love of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to loſt mankind in the Redeemer,
doth bind us to love <hi>him with all</hi> our
<hi>hearts,</hi> and ſerve him with all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<hi>faculties,</hi> and to work as thoſe
that have the <hi>greateſt thankfulneſs</hi> to
ſhew, as well as the greateſt mercies
to receive, and miſerie to eſcape: &amp;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48167:102"/>
as thoſe that believe, that if ſinners
that <hi>without Chriſt</hi> had no hope, ſhall
now love their ſins, &amp; refuſe to leave
them, and to repent and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and <hi>unthankfully</hi> reject the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of <hi>ſalvation</hi> ſo <hi>dearly bought,</hi> and
ſo <hi>freely offered them,</hi> their damnation
will be doubled as their ſin is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Live but as men that have ſuch
Redemption to admire, ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to entertain, and ſuch a ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to attain, and that are ſure <hi>they</hi>
can never ſcape if <hi>they</hi> continne to
neglect ſo great ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.
And is there <hi>any</hi> controverſie among
Chriſtians in <hi>any</hi> of this? There
is not certainly. 4. Live but as men
that believe, that <hi>the holy Ghoſt is
given by Jeſus Chriſt to convert, to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to ſanctifie all that he will ſave:</hi> &amp;
that except <hi>you</hi> be born of the Spirit,
<hi>you</hi> ſhall not enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, and that if any man have
not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is
none of his, <hi>Joh. 3. 5, 6. Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48167:103"/>
that without this, no patching or
mending of your lives by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principles wil ſerve the turn for
your ſalvation, or make you accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Live as men
that believe that this Spirit is given
by the hearing of the word of God,
and muſt be prayed for, and obeyed,
&amp; not reſiſted, quench'd, and griev'd.
And is there any controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chriſtians in any of this? Ask
thoſe that make a mock at Holineſſe,
Sanctification, and the Spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be not baptized into the
Name of the Holy Ghoſt, and profeſs
to believe in him as their Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as well as in the Son as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?
And then ask them whether
it be not a thing that ſhould make
even a devil to tremble, to come ſo
near the blaſphemy againſt the holy
Ghoſt, as to mock at his Office and
Sanctifying work, and at the holines,
without which no man ſhall ſee the
Lord! <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and this after they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48167:103"/>
are baptized, and profeſs to believe
in the holy Ghoſt as their Sanctifier?
5. Live but as men that believe that
ſin is the greateſt <hi>evil,</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> which
the Holy Ghoſt abhorreth; and then
you will never make a mock of it, as
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith the fooliſh do, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. 9.
nor ſay, What harm is in it? 6. Live
but as men that believe no <hi>ſin</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
without Repentance, and that
Repentance is the loathing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of ſin; and if that it be true,
it will not ſuffer you to live wilfully
in any groſs ſin, nor to deſire to keep
the leaſt infirmity, nor to be loth to
know your unknown ſins. 7. Live as
thoſe that believe that you are to be
members <hi>of the Holy Catholick Church,</hi>
and therein to hold the <hi>Communion
of Saints.</hi> And then you will know,
that it is not as a member of any
Sect or Party, but as a holy member
of this holy Church, that you muſt
be ſaved: and that it is the name of
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> which is more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48167:104"/>
then the name of any diviſion, or
ſub-diviſion among Chriſtians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Greek, or Papiſt, or Poteſtant,
or Prelatiſt, or Presbyterian, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
or Anabaptiſt. It is eaſie to
be of any one of theſe parties; but to
be a <hi>Christian,</hi> which all pretend to, is
not ſo eaſie. It is eaſie to have a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
zeal for any divided party or
cauſe, but the common zeal for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, is not ſo eaſie to be
kindled, or kept alive, but requireth
as much diligence to maintain it, as
dividing zeal requireth to quench it.
It is eaſie to love a party as a party;
but to keep up Catholick charity to
all Chriſtians, &amp; to live in that holy
love &amp; converſe, which is requiſite to
[a Chriſtian communion of Saints]
is not ſo eaſie. Satan and corrupted
nature befriend the love and zeal of
faction, which is confined to a party
on a controverted cauſe: but they are
enemies to the love of Saints, and
to the zeal for holineſs, and to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48167:104"/>
chatholick charity, which is from the
ſpirit of Chriſt. You ſee I call <hi>you</hi> not
to diviſion, not to ſide with Sects, but
to live as members of a holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, which conſiſteth of all
that be holy in the world: and to
live as thoſe that believe the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints.</hi> 8. Live as thoſe that
believe that there is a life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where the Sanctified ſhall live in
endleſs joy, and the unſanctified in
endleſs puniſhment and woe: live but
as men that verily believe a Heaven
and a Hell, and a day of Judgment,
in which all the actions of this life
muſt be reviſed, &amp; all men judged to
their <hi>endleſs</hi> ſtate. <hi>Believe</hi> theſe things
heartily, and then think a holy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
needleſs if you can: Then be of
the mind of the deriders &amp; enemies
of godlineſs if you can! If one ſight
of Heaven or Hell would ſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado, inſtead of other
arguments to confute <hi>all</hi> the cavils of
the diſtracted world, &amp; to juſtifie the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48167:105"/>
moſt diligent Saints in the judgment
of thoſe that now abhor them, why
ſhould not a ſound belief of the ſame
thing in its meaſure do the ſame? 9.
Live but as thoſe that believe this life
is given us as the only Time to make
preparation for eternal life: and that
all that ever ſhall be done for your
ſalvation, muſt be Now, juſt Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your time is ended: Live as thoſe
that know (and need not faith to
tell them) that this time is ſhort, and
almoſt at an end already, and ſtayeth
for no man, but as a poſt doth haſte
away: It will not ſtay while you
are trimming you or ſporting you:
it will not ſtay while you are taken
up in Stage-plays, in complements,
in idleneſs, or any impertinent
needleſs thing; It wil not tarry <hi>while</hi>
you ſpend yet the other year, or
month, or day, in your <hi>worldlineſs</hi> or
<hi>ambition,</hi> or in your luſts and ſenſual
delights, &amp; put off your Repentance
to another time. O ſirs, for the Lords
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48167:105"/>
ſake do but live as men that muſt
ſhortly be buried in a grave, &amp; their
ſouls appear before the Lord, and as
men that have but this little Time to
do all for their everlaſting life, that
ever muſt be done. O live as men that
are ſure to die, and are not ſure to
live till to morrow. And let not the
noiſe of pleaſure or wordly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or the chat or ſcorns of miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fools, bear down your reaſon,
and make you live as if you knew
not what you know, or as if there
were any doubt about theſe things.
Who is the man, and what is his
name, that dare contradict them, and
can make it good? O do not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your knowledg: do not ſtand
ſtill and ſee your glaſs running, and
Time making ſuch haſt, and yet
make no more haſte your ſelves, then
if you were not concerned in it: Do
not, O do not ſlumber, when Time
and Judgment never ſlumber; nor ſit
ſtill when you have ſo much to do, &amp;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48167:106"/>
know <hi>all</hi> that is now left undone
muſt be undone for ever! Alas, ſirs,
how many queſtions of exceeding
weight have you yet to be reſolved
in? whether you are truly ſanctified?
whether your ſins be pardoned? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you ſhall be ſaved when you die?
whether you are ready to leave this
world, and enter upon another? I <hi>tell
you,</hi> the anſwering of <hi>theſe,</hi> and <hi>many</hi>
more ſuch queſtions, is a matter of
no <hi>ſmall difficulty</hi> or <hi>concernment.</hi> And
<hi>all</hi> theſe muſt be done in this <hi>little</hi>
and <hi>uncertain</hi> time. It muſt be <hi>Now</hi>
or <hi>Never.</hi> Live but as men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and conſider theſe certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
things.</p>
            <p>10. Laſtly, Will you but live as
men that believe that the world and
the fleſh are the <hi>deadly</hi> enemies of
your <hi>Salvation;</hi> and that believe;
that if any man love the world, (ſo
far) the love of the Father is not in
him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15, 16. And as men that
believe, that if ye <hi>live</hi> after fleſh, ye
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48167:106"/>
ſhall die, but if by the ſpirit ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the bodie, ye ſhall
live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. and that thoſe that
are in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and are freed from
condemnation, are ſuch as walk not
after the fleſh, but after the Spirit,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. And that we muſt make no
proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie the
will or luſts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10. and
muſt not walk in gluttonie &amp; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
in chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in ſtrife and <hi>envying,</hi> v. 13. but
muſt have our <hi>hearts</hi> where our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. and converſe in
Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. and being
riſen with Chriſt, muſt ſeek the
things that are above, and ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
on them, and not on the
things that are on earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Sirs, will <hi>you ſay</hi> that <hi>any</hi> of this is
our ſingular <hi>opinion,</hi> or matter of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie</hi>
&amp; <hi>doubt?</hi> Are not all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
agreed in it? Do <hi>you</hi> not <hi>your</hi>
ſelves profeſs that <hi>you</hi> believe it? Live
then but as <hi>thoſe</hi> that do believe it, &amp;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48167:107"/>
condemn not <hi>your</hi> ſelves in the <hi>things</hi>
that you confeſs.</p>
            <p>I tell <hi>thee,</hi> if now thou wilt refuſe to
live according to theſe common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<hi>truths,</hi> thou ſhalt <hi>never</hi>
be <hi>able</hi> to <hi>ſay</hi> before <hi>the Lord,</hi> that
mens <hi>controverſie</hi> about a <hi>Ceremony</hi> or
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> of the manner
or <hi>worſhip,</hi> were the <hi>things</hi> that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>thee!</hi> but all <hi>ſorts</hi> &amp; <hi>ſects</hi> ſhall
be <hi>witneſſes</hi> againſt thee, and <hi>condemn</hi>
thee, for <hi>they</hi> all <hi>agreed</hi> in theſe <hi>things</hi>
even the bloodieſt ſect, that <hi>impriſon,</hi>
and <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>kill</hi> others for their
<hi>differences</hi> in <hi>ſmaller matters,</hi> are yet
<hi>agreed</hi> with <hi>thoſe</hi> that they <hi>perſecute,</hi>
and <hi>murder,</hi> about theſe <hi>things:</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
are <hi>agreed</hi> in them, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
are <hi>agreed</hi> in them: All the <hi>ſects</hi>
that are <hi>now quarrelling</hi> among us, &amp;
in the <hi>world,</hi> are <hi>agreed</hi> in them, who
are but <hi>meet</hi> for the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
All theſe <hi>will be</hi> ready to bear
<hi>witneſs</hi> againſt the <hi>prophane,</hi> the <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,</hi>
the <hi>ſloathful neglecter</hi> of God and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48167:107"/>
his Salvation, and to ſay, we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
notwithſtanding our other
differences, that all theſe things were
certain truths, and that mens lives
<hi>ſhould be ordered according unto theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if yet you pretend controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to cover your malignity or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,
I will go a little <hi>further,</hi>
and tell <hi>you,</hi> that in the <hi>matter</hi> as well
as in the <hi>principles,</hi> it is <hi>things</hi> that
<hi>we</hi> are all agreed in, which I call
you to, and which the ungodly do
refuſe: Ile briefly name them.</p>
            <p>1. One part of your work which
we urge you to do with all your
<hi>might</hi> is, ſeriouſly &amp; ſoberly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
often of all theſe <hi>truths</hi> before
mentioned, which <hi>you ſay you</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
And is it <hi>any controverſie</hi> with
<hi>reaſonable men</hi> whether they ſhould
<hi>uſe</hi> their <hi>reaſon?</hi> or with <hi>believers</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>they ſhould conſider and lay to heart
the weight &amp; uſe of the things which
they believe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another part of your work is to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48167:108"/>
love God with all your ſoul &amp; might
and to make him your delight, &amp; to
ſeek firſt his Kingdom and the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
thereof; and to ſet your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above, and to live
on earth as the heirs of heaven: And
is there any controverſie among
<hi>Proteſtants, Papiſts,</hi> or any about this?</p>
            <p>3. Another part of your work, is,
to ſee the honouring of God in the
world, the promoting of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Government in your ſelves
and others, the doing of his will and
obeying of his Laws: And is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
controverſie in this?</p>
            <p>4. Another part of your work, is, to
to mortifie the fleſh, &amp; to reject its
<hi>conceits,</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>lusts,</hi> which
reſiſt the foreſaid <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>God;</hi>
and to caſt out <hi>the inordinate love</hi> and
<hi>care</hi> of <hi>worldly things:</hi> to <hi>refuſe</hi> the
<hi>counſels,</hi> the <hi>commands,</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> the
<hi>enticements</hi> and <hi>perſwaſions</hi> of man,
which <hi>contradict</hi> the <hi>commands</hi> &amp; <hi>will</hi>
of <hi>God:</hi> &amp; to forſake <hi>all</hi> that <hi>you</hi> have
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48167:108"/>
in the world rather then forſake your
dear Redeemer, and hazard your
ſalvation by any wilful ſin: To take
up your Croſs and follow Chriſt
through a life of ſuffering to glory;
I know there is difficulty enough in
all this, and that fleſh will repine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it and abhor it: But is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>controverſie</hi> about it among any
true <hi>believers?</hi> Is not all this the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<hi>Command</hi> of God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation?</p>
            <p>5. Another part of your work, is,
to avoid <hi>temptations,</hi> and fly from the
<hi>occaſions</hi> and <hi>appearances</hi> of evil, and
not only <hi>to avoid</hi> that <hi>which is</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evil it <hi>ſelf,</hi> but that <hi>alſo</hi> which
would draw you into evil (as far as
you can) and to keep as far as may
be from the brink of <hi>hell</hi> and danger,
&amp; to have no <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
works</hi> of <hi>darknes,</hi> nor be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions</hi>
with <hi>them,</hi> but reprove <hi>them,</hi>
and <hi>mourn</hi> for the <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>wicked
converſation of the world.</hi> This is it that
we <hi>intreat</hi> of <hi>you:</hi> &amp; <hi>is there</hi> any <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of controverſie in all this?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48167:109"/>
6. Another part of the work which
we call <hi>you</hi> to, is, to redeem this little
Time that is allotted you; To make
the beſt of it, and improve it to the
greateſt furtherance of <hi>your</hi> ſalvation:
To loſe none of it upon unprofitable
things: to ſpend it in thoſe works w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
will comfort you moſt when time
is gone; If it will be more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you in the <hi>day of Judgment,</hi> that
you have <hi>ſpent your</hi> Time in playes, &amp;
ſports, and idleneſs, &amp; worldly cares,
&amp; pleaſures, then in ſerving God, &amp;
preparing for another life, then hold
on, and do ſo to the end: But if it will
not, then do what you would hear
of, ſeeing you muſt hear of it: ſpend
none of your time in idleneſs &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
things, till you have no better
and more neceſſary things to ſpend
it in, &amp; till you have Time to ſpare
from more important work. This is
our requeſt to <hi>you,</hi> that you would not
loſe one hour of your pretious Time,
but ſpend it as <hi>thoſe that have lost</hi> too
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48167:109"/>
much, and have but a little more to
ſpend in preparation for eternity.
And is this any Schiſmatical or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
motion? Is there any thing
controvertible, or which any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
can ſpeak againſt, in any of this?</p>
            <p>7. Another part of your work, is, to
ſearch the Scripture as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
<hi>your</hi> directions for <hi>eternal life,
Joh.</hi> 5. 39. To love the Word of God
more then <hi>thouſands</hi> of gold &amp; ſilver,
&amp; perfer it before your <hi>neceſſary food,
Pſal. 119. 72. Job</hi> 23. 12. and to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
in it day &amp; night, as that which
is your pleaſure and delight, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1. 2.
&amp; as that which is able to make you
wiſe unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and
to build you up, &amp; give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
among the ſanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
32. That you lay up the word of God
in your hearts, and teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to your children, and talk of
them when you ſit in your houſes, and
when you walk by the way, &amp; when
you lie down, and when you riſe up,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48167:110"/>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. &amp; 11. 18, 19. that ſo you
&amp; your <hi>houſhoulds</hi> may ſerve the <hi>Lord,
Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. This is the <hi>work</hi> that we
call <hi>you</hi> to: And is <hi>there any thing</hi>
that a <hi>chriſtian</hi> can make a <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
of in all this? Is there any <hi>thing</hi>
that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not agreed of?</p>
            <p>8. Another part of your work, is,
that you <hi>guard</hi> your <hi>tongues,</hi> and take
not the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in vain, and <hi>ſpeak</hi>
no <hi>reproaches</hi> or <hi>ſlanders</hi> againſt your
<hi>brethren,</hi> &amp; that no <hi>corrupt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
proceed out of your mouths,
but that which is good to the uſe of
<hi>edifying,</hi> &amp; that it may miniſter <hi>grace</hi>
unto the <hi>hearers, Eph.</hi> 4. 29. and that
<hi>fornication, uncleanneſs,</hi> and <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
be not <hi>once named</hi> among <hi>you,</hi> as
becometh <hi>Saints:</hi> neither <hi>filthineſs,</hi>
nor <hi>fooliſh talking,</hi> nor <hi>jeſting,</hi> which
are not <hi>convenient,</hi> but rather giving
of <hi>thanks, Eph.</hi> 5. 3, 4. And is <hi>there any</hi>
thing of <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>controverſie</hi> in this?</p>
            <p>9. Another part of the work
which we perſwade you to, is,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48167:110"/>
to pray continually, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17.
and not to wax faint, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. to
be fervent and importunate with
God, as thoſe that know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their neceſſity, <hi>Luke 18. 6, 7.
Jam.</hi> 5. 16. That you pray with all
prayer and ſupplication in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. and in every thing by
prayer and ſupplication to make
known your requeſts to God, <hi>Phil.</hi>
4. 6. that you pray for Kings and all
in Authority, that we may lead a
quiet and peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and honeſtie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2.
And is there any thing in all this
that any Chriſtian can deny?</p>
            <p>10. Laſtly, the work we call you
to, is, to love your neighbours as
your ſelves, and to do to others as
you would have them <hi>(arbitrio ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no)</hi>
do to you. To ſcorn, deride,
moleſt, impriſon, ſlander, or hurt
no man, till you would be ſo uſed
your ſelves on the like occaſion. To
rejoyce in other mens profit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
as your own. To envy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48167:111"/>
none, to hate no man; to wrong
none in their perſons, eſtates, or
names: To preſerve the chaſtity,
honour and eſtate of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as your own. To love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and forgive them that wrong
you, and pray for them that hate,
and hurt, and perſecute you. This
is your work: And is there any
thing of faction, Schiſm or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
in this? No, you ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be convinced, that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and controverſies of believers,
and the many opinions about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
were a wretched hypocrital
pretence for your neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the ſubſtance of Religion,
about which there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but all parties were agreed
in the confeſſion of the truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hypocrites would not live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own profeſſions.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you'l ſay, that there
is ſuch difference in the <hi>Manner</hi> yet
among them that agree in the
<hi>Principles</hi> and the <hi>Matter,</hi> that you
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48167:111"/>
know not which way God is to be
worſhipped?</p>
            <p>In anſwer, 1. Do you practiſe as
aforeſaid, according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and matter agreed on, or not?
If you do not, it is but groſs hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
to pretend diſagreements in
the <hi>Manner,</hi> as an excuſe for your
contempt or omiſſion of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which all agree in. Forſooth
your families ſhall be <hi>prayerleſs,</hi> and
you will make a jeaſt of <hi>ſerious pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
becauſe ſome pray on a book, and
ſome without, and ſome that are
wiſeſt, think that either way is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Will God be deceived by ſuch
ſiilly reaſonings as theſe?</p>
            <p>2. But this ſhall not hide the
nakedneſs of your impiety. Will you
alſo in the <hi>Manner</hi> of your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but go ſo far as all <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
are <hi>agreed</hi> in? I will breifly then
give you ſome particular inſtances.</p>
            <p>1. The work of God muſt be
<hi>done with reverence,</hi> in his <hi>fear:</hi> not
like the common works of men, with
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48167:112"/>
a common careleſſe frame of mind:
God will be <hi>ſanctified of all that draw
near him, Lev.</hi> 10. 3. He will be
ſerved as God, and not as man: He
will not be prayed to with a regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
mind, as thoſe do that can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
their tongues from their <hi>hearts,</hi>
and ſay over ſome cuſtomary words
while they think of ſomething elſe.
Is a dreadful thing for duſt to ſpeak
to God Almighty; and a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing to ſpeak to him as ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and regardleſly, as if we were
talking to one of our companions.
It beſeemeth a believer to have
more of the fear of God upon his
heart, in his <hi>ordinary converſe</hi> in the
world, then hypocrites and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
have in their moſt <hi>ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
Knoweſt thou the difference
between God and man? Put then
ſuch a difference between God and
man in thy addreſſes, as his Majeſty
requireth. And ſee alſo that thy <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
compoſe themſelves to a <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
behaviour,</hi> when they joyn with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48167:112"/>
thee in the worſhipping of God.
What have you to ſay now againſt
this <hi>reverent manner</hi> of behaviour?
Is there any thing controvertible in
this?</p>
            <p>2. It alſo requiſite that you be
<hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> in all the ſervice
you perform to God. Do it not lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicruouſly,
and with half a heart!
Be as much more fervent and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in ſeeking God and your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then you are in ſeeking world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, as God and your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is better then any thing in the
world: Or if that be beyond your
reach (though elſe there is reaſon
for it) at leaſt let the <hi>greatest things</hi>
have the <hi>greatest power</hi> upon your
hearts. You cannot pray more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
for heaven then heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth.
O let but the excellency and
greatneſſe of your work appear in
the <hi>ſerious manner</hi> of your perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
I hope you cannot ſay that his
is any point of controverſie, unleſſe
it be a controverſie whether a man
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48167:113"/>
ſhould be an hypocrite, or be <hi>ſerious</hi>
in the Religion which he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
            <p>3. It is requiſite that your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God be performed <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly,</hi>
Pſal. 47. 7. 1 Cor. 14, 15.
God delighteth not in the blind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of men that know not what
they do. Prayers not underſtood are
indeed no prayers: For no mans
deſire goeth further then his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and he expreſſeth not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that knoweth not what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
himſelf. Nor can he expect
the concurrence of another mans
deſires, that ſpeaketh what another
underſtandeth not. The word that
is not underſtood, cannot ſink into
the heart and ſanctifie it: or if it be
not well and ſoundlie underſtood,
its eaſily ſtoln away by the tempter,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19, 23. If underſtanding be
neceſſarie in our common converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
much more in our holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the Almighty, <hi>Prov. 17. 27.
A man of underſtanding is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48167:113"/>
Spirit:</hi> but God hath <hi>no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in fools,</hi> or in their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi>
Eceleſ. 5. 1, 4. nor is pleaſed with a
Parrot-like lip-ſervice, which is not
underſtood. He ſaith in deteſtation
of the Hypocrites, <hi>This people draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
near unto me with their mouth, and
honoureth me with their lips, but their
heart is far from me,</hi> Mat. 15. 8, 9. I
hope then when we call you to ſerve
God in judgment, &amp; with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
we call you to nothing that a
Chriſtian ſhould make queſtion of.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and they that
ſerve him muſt ſerve <hi>him in Spirit
and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4. 24. <hi>The Father
ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> ver. 23.
He calleth for the <hi>heart:</hi> he looketh
for the inward deſires of the ſoul:
He converſeth with minds that are
<hi>abſtracted</hi> from vanity, and are <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>
taken up in attending him, and
are intent upon the work they do:
The <hi>carkaſs</hi> of a <hi>Prayer</hi> ſeparated
from the <hi>Life</hi> of it, ſtinketh before
the holy God. As he will be <hi>loved,</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48167:114"/>
ſo will he be <hi>ſerved with all the heart
and ſoul and might.</hi> And do we call
you then to any thing that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
when we call you to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
worſhipping of God.</p>
            <p>5. Yet we maintain that the <hi>body</hi>
hath its part in the ſervice of God
as well as the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> muſt
expreſſe the inward reverence and
devotion of the ſoul; though not in
a way of <hi>hypocritical oſtentation,</hi> yet
in a way of <hi>ſerious adoration.</hi> The
bowing of the knee, the uncovering
of the head, and reverent deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whatſoever nature, or
common uſe, and holy inſtitution
hath made an expreſſion of holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and a decent and grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of our ſelves, ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obſerved in the preſence of the
moſt High, and the holy things of
God more reverently to be reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then the preſence of any mortal
man. And the rather becauſe that a
grave, and reverent, and holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of deportment in Gods worſhip,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48167:114"/>
reflecteth upon the heart, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us in our inward and ſpiritual
devotion: &amp; it helpeth the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and awakeneth them to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thoughts of God, and holy
things; which a regardleſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
manner of deportment would
extinguiſh. And its no diſhonour to
<hi>reverent behaviour,</hi> that it is the uſe
of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but rather an honour
to it; For it is ſomething that is
<hi>good</hi> that the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> uſeth for the
cloak of his ſecret <hi>emptineſs</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi>
If there were nothing <hi>good in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
behaviour</hi> before God, it would
not ſerve the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> turn. As it
is a commendation to <hi>long-prayer,</hi>
that the Phariſees made it their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for the devouring of widdows
houſes: And thoſe that call them
hypocrites that are much in <hi>holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes</hi>
and <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> ſhould conſider,
that if <hi>holy exerciſes</hi> and <hi>ſpeeches</hi>
were not good, they were not fit for
the hypocrites deſign; <hi>evil</hi> will not
be a fit cloak for <hi>evil:</hi> that which the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48167:115"/>
hypocrite thinks neceſſary to the
<hi>covering</hi> of <hi>his ſin,</hi> we muſt think
<hi>more neceſſary</hi> to the <hi>cure</hi> of our ſin
and the ſaving of our ſouls; The
way to <hi>avoid hypocriſie</hi> is not by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into <hi>impiety</hi> and <hi>prophaneſs:</hi>
we muſt <hi>do more</hi> then the <hi>hypocrite,</hi>
and not leſs, elſe he will riſe up in
judgement againſt you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you, if he would do more to
<hi>ſeem good,</hi> then you will do to <hi>be
good,</hi> and to pleaſe your Maker: if
a Phariſee will <hi>pray longer</hi> to colour
his oppreſſion, then you will do to
<hi>attain ſalvation.</hi> The miſchief of <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi>
is, that the <hi>ſoul</hi> of Religion
is wanting, while the <hi>corps</hi> is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi>
And will you caſt away both
<hi>ſoul and body:</hi> both <hi>inſide</hi> and <hi>outſide,</hi>
in oppoſition to <hi>hypocriſie?</hi> If others
do <hi>ſeem</hi> to love God when they do
not, will you therefore not ſo much
as <hi>ſeem</hi> to do it? So here about <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
in the ſervice of God: The
<hi>hypocrite</hi> ſhould not <hi>exceed</hi> the <hi>ſincere</hi>
in any thing that is truly good. This
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48167:115"/>
is the <hi>manner</hi> of Gods ſervice that
I perſwade you to, and to no other:
And is there any thing of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
in this? Prefer but the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
part, and know but what that
meaneth, <hi>[I will have mercy, and not
ſacrifice]</hi> that ſo you may not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent,</hi> and you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſay that we will be more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
then you to <hi>decency,</hi> and <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
behaviour</hi> in Gods ſervice.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>God will be ſerved in</hi> Purity
<hi>and</hi> Holineſs, <hi>with cleanſed hearts
and hands, and not with ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
defiled with the guilt of any
wilful ſin. He abhorreth the</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>of the wicked and diſobedient.</hi>
He that turneth away his ear from
hearing the Law, his prayers are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
<hi>Prov. 28. 9. and 15. 8. &amp;
21. 27. Iſa. 1. 13. Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.
[To what purpoſe is the multitude of
your Sacrifices unto me? ſaith the
Lord, <hi>(to oppreſſing wicked men)</hi>
Iſa. 1. 11. When you come to appear
before me, who hath required this at
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48167:116"/>
your hand to tread my Courts? Bring
no more vain oblations: incenſe is an
abomination to me: the new Moons
and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
I cannot away with: it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
even the ſolemn meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ver.
12, 13. And when you ſpread forth
your hands I will hide mine eyes from
you; yea when you make many prayers
I will not hear; your hands are full of
blood: Waſh you, make you clean; put
away the evil of your doings from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine eyes; ceaſe to do evil, learn
to do well, ſeek judgement, relieve the
oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead
for the widdow; Come now and let us
reaſon together, ſaith the Lord.]</p>
            <p>To play the <hi>glutton,</hi> or <hi>drunkard,</hi>
or filthy <hi>fornicator</hi> in the <hi>day time</hi> &amp;
then to come to God at <hi>night,</hi> as if
it were to make him amends by an
hypocritical prayer; to <hi>blaſpheme</hi>
Gods <hi>Name,</hi> and oppoſe his <hi>Kingdom</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> in your ſelves and

hate and ſcorn them that do <hi>his will,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:48167:116"/>
and ſtudy <hi>his will</hi> that they may do
it, and then to <hi>pray that Gods Name
may be hallowed, his Kingdom come,
and his Will be done]</hi> is an abuſing
God, and not a <hi>ſerving</hi> or <hi>pleaſing</hi>
him. <hi>Live</hi> according to your <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and let your <hi>lives</hi> ſhew as well as
your <hi>words</hi> what it is that you <hi>deſire.</hi>
This is the ſervice of God that we
call you to: And can you ſay that
there is any thing controvertible in
all this? Are there any men of any
party among Chriſtians, or ſober
Infidels that dare contradict it?</p>
            <p>7. God will be ſerved <hi>entirely</hi> and
<hi>univerſally:</hi> in all his Commands;
and with all your faculties, in works
of <hi>Piety, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi>
which muſt never be ſeparated:
You muſt not pretend your <hi>Charity</hi>
againſt duties of <hi>Piety;</hi> for God is
to be preferred in your eſtimation,
love and ſervice; and all that is
done for <hi>man,</hi> muſt be done for <hi>his
ſake.</hi> You muſt not ſet up duties of
<hi>Piety</hi> againſt duties of <hi>Juſtice, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48167:117"/>
and <hi>Sobriety:</hi> It is not <hi>true Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
that will not bring forth theſe.
<hi>God</hi> muſt be <hi>loved above all,</hi> and our
<hi>neighbours as our ſelves;</hi> and theſe
two <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>love</hi> are inſeparable. Do
<hi>all the good</hi> you can to <hi>all</hi> while you
have <hi>opportunity; eſpecially to them of
the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. What
good you would <hi>hear of</hi> in the day
of your accounts, that <hi>do now,</hi> ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
diligently, and ſincerely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your power. Say not, I
may come to want my ſelf, but <hi>[caſt
thy bread upon the waters, for thou
ſhalt find it after many dayes; give a
portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight, for
thou knowest not what evil ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 1, 2.] and
whether all may not quickly be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thee; and then thou wilt
wiſh thou hadſt done good with it
whilſt thou hadſt it, and lent it to
the Lord, and <hi>truſted</hi> him with thy
<hi>remainder,</hi> who entruſted thee with
his <hi>bleſſings;</hi> and hadſt made thee
<hi>friends of the Mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48167:117"/>
that when all fail they might
receive thee into the everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
Drop not now and then a
ſcant and grudging alms, as if thou
were a <hi>loſer</hi> by it, and God muſt be
be beholden to thee; but believe,
that the greateſt gain is to thy ſelf,
and look after ſuch bargains, and do
good as readily, and gladly, &amp; libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
as one that verily expecteth a
ful reward in Heaven. This is part of
the ſervice of God that we exhort
you to, even to viſit, and relieve, and
love Chriſt in his members and
brethren <hi>(Mat. 25.)</hi> and is there any
thing of <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>controverſie in all
this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Moreover, God will be ſerved
with <hi>Love, and willingneſs, and delight:</hi>
It is the moſt gainful, honourable,
bleſſed, and pleaſant work in the
world, which he hath appointed
you, and not a <hi>toilſome</hi> task or ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
And therefore it is not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
pining, troubleſom courſe
of life that we perſwade you to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48167:118"/>
the name of Godlineſs; but it
is to rejoyce in the Lord, and to
live in the joyful expectations of
Eternal Life, and in the ſenſe and
aſſurance of the Love of God. If
you could ſhew us any probability
of a more pleaſant and joyful life on
Earth, then that which ſerious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
doth afford, I ſhould be glad
with all my heart to hearken to you.
I am ready to tell you what is the
ground of <hi>our comforts,</hi> which faith
revealeth: If you will come, and
ſoberly debate the caſe, and ſhew us
the matter and ground of <hi>your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi>
which you have or hope for
in any other way: if <hi>yours</hi> prove
<hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>ſurer</hi> then
the <hi>joys of faith,</hi> we will hearken to
you, and be of your mind and ſide.</p>
            <p>The matter of the <hi>joyes</hi> of a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>
is, that all his ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that God is reconciled to him
in Chriſt; that he hath the promiſe
of God, that all things, even the
greateſt ſufferings, ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48167:118"/>
for his good; that he is always
in the love, and care, and hands of
God; that he hath leave to draw
near him by holy prayer, and open
his heart to him in all his ſtraits and
wants; that he may ſolace himſelf
in his Praiſes and Thankſgiving, and
in other parts of holy worſhip; that
he may read and hear his holy
Word, the ſure diſcovery of the will
of God, and revelation of the
things unſeen, and the Charter of
his Inheritance; that he may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
his ſoul in the ſerious believing
thoughts of the Love of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the wonderful work of
our Redemption, and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and office, and grace of Jeſus
Chriſt our Redeemer; and that he
may love that God that hath ſo
wonderfully loved him; that he hath
the Spirit of God to quicken and
actuate his ſoul, to ſupply his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
defects, and kill his ſins, and
help him to Believe, to Love, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
to Pray: that this Spirit is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48167:119"/>
Gods Seal upon him, and the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of everlaſting life; that Death
ſhall not kill his hopes, nor end his
happineſs, but that his felicity and
fulleſt joy beginneth, when that of
worldlings hath an end, and their
endleſs miſery begins; that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from everlaſting torment by
the redemption of Chriſt, and the
ſanctification of the ſpirit; that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
will attend his departing ſoul
into the preſence of his Father;
that he ſhall be with his glorified
Redeemer, and behold his Glory;
that his body ſhall be raiſed to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life: that he ſhall be juſtified
by Chriſt from all the accuſations
of the Devil, and all the ſlanders
of the malicious world; that he ſhall
live with God in endleſs Glory, and
ſee and enjoy the Glory of his
Creator, and ſhall never more be
troubled with enemies, with ſin or

is the <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>labour</hi> that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
you to: It is not to <hi>deſpair,</hi> nor
to ſome dry unprofitable toil, nor to
ſelf-troubling, grieving, miſerable
melancholy, nor to coſtly Sacrifices,
or idle Ceremonies, or irrational
Service, ſuch as the Heathens offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their Idols; it is not to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all mirth and comfort, and to
turn unſociable, and moroſe, and
ſower: but it is to the greateſt joys
that the world alloweth, and nature
is here capable of, and reaſon can
diſcern and own: It is to begin a
truly merry ſociable life: It is to fly
from fear &amp; ſorrow, in flying from
ſin and Hell, and from the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath of God: It is to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes
of everlaſting joys, and to the
beginnings of eternal life. This the
<hi>labour,</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> which we would
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48167:120"/>
have you follow with all your might.</p>
            <p>If you have <hi>better</hi> things to ſeek,
and follow, and find, let us ſee them,
that we may be as wiſe as you. If you
have not, for your ſouls ſake, make
not choice of vanity, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you in the day of your <hi>neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you muſt not think to make us
believe that a great houſe, or a horſe
or a whore, or a feaſt, or a flatterer, or
fine cloaths, or any childiſh toys, or
brutiſh filthineſs, are more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things then Chriſt, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Life, or that it is ſweeter and
better to love a harlot, or lands, or
mony, then to love God, and Grace,
and Glory: nor that any thing that
will go no further then the Grave
with you, is as good as that which
will endure to Eternity; nor that
any pleaſure which a dog or ſwine
hath, is equal to the delights of the
Angels of Heaven: If you would
have us of your <hi>mind,</hi> you muſt not
be of this <hi>mind,</hi> nor perſwade us to
ſuch horrible things as theſe. But
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48167:120"/>
we profeſs to you and all the world,
that we are not ſo in love with <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi>
or <hi>ſowrneſs,</hi> nor ſo fallen out
with <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi> as co <hi>chooſe</hi>
a life of miſerable <hi>ſadneſs,</hi> or refuſe
a life of <hi>true delight.</hi> If we could hear
from any man, or find by the moſt
diligent inquiry, that there is a
more full, and ſweet, and rational,
and ſatisfactory, and durable delight
to be had in any other way, then
that of <hi>ſerious faith and holineſſe,</hi>
which Chriſt in Scripture hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to us, we were like enough
to hearken after it.</p>
            <p>But can the diſtracted ſenſual
world believe that its ſweeter and
happier to ruffle it out in fleſhly gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and ſport, and to rage againſt
the godly for a while, till the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God lay hold upon them,
and give them their reward, then
to live in the love of God, and wait
in patience for the performance of
Gods promiſe of everlaſting joy?
Oh what a thing is fleſhly paſſion,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48167:121"/>
and raging ſenſuality, and blind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief!
The Lord have mercy upon
poor deluded ſinners; the Devils bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is to turn the world into a <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi>
and alas, how ſtrangely hath
he prevail'd! That ſo many men can
take their <hi>greateſt miſery</hi> for their
<hi>happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>only happineſs</hi> for
an <hi>intollerable life!</hi> Yea, and be ſo
<hi>angry</hi> with all that are not of their
mind, and will not ſet as much by
filth and foolery, and as little by
God and Glory as they! Like the
Noble man that was Lunatick, or
mad by fits, and when ever he was
mad, he would ſwear all were mad
that ſaid not as he ſaid, and would
make all his ſervants be ſent to <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>
that would not immitate him,
and there they muſt lie as mad men
till their Lord was recovered from
<hi>his madneſs.</hi> So are Gods ſervants
uſed, and talkt of in the world, as if
they were beſide themſelves, as long
as the world is uncured of its mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
As the <hi>Man is,</hi> ſo is <hi>his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:48167:121"/>
and ſuch is his <hi>reliſh,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi>
and <hi>delight:</hi> When I was a
child, I had far more deſire to fill
my pin-box, then now I have to fill
my purſe, and accounted it a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
treaſure, and had much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and contentment in it. And
alas, we may remember ſince we
were ſtrangers to the reliſh of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, that we found more
pleaſure in that of which we are now
aſhamed, then we did in the moſt
high and excellent things. Let us
therefore pitty and pray for thoſe
that are diſtempered with the ſame
diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I have been longer on this then I
thought to have been, becauſe men
think that we call them from <hi>all
Mirth, &amp; Joy, &amp; pleaſure,</hi> to a <hi>ſowre
heavy, melancholy</hi> life, when we call
them to <hi>ſerious diligence</hi> for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
As if levity &amp; folly were the
only freinds to <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and it were
only to be found in childiſh, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
tranſitory things. And as if the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48167:122"/>
greateſt everlaſting Happineſs were
no matter of true Delight, nor Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
or Diligence of a friend to <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Moreover, as to the manner,
God will be ſerved with abſolute
ſelf-reſignation, without <hi>Exceptions,
Limitations</hi> or <hi>Reſerves:</hi> Not with
the leavings of the fleſh, nor with a
<hi>Proviſo</hi> that you may not ſuffer by
your Religion, or be <hi>poor,</hi> or <hi>deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
or <hi>abuſed</hi> by the world: But with
<hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> you muſt lay down all the
fleſhes intereſt at his feet; and you
muſt take up your Croſs, and follow
a ſuffering Chriſt to Glory. You
muſt ſerve him as thoſe that are
wholly His, and not your own, and
have nothing but what is his, and
therefore nothing to be <hi>excepted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
or ſaved from him;</hi> but muſt
be content that <hi>you</hi> and all <hi>your</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
be in his hands, and <hi>ſaved by
him,</hi> if ſaved at all. I know theſe
tearms ſeem hard to fleſh and blood
(and ſhould Heaven be the Crown
and reward to them, that have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48167:122"/>
no tryal for it?) But here
is nothing but what is paſt all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,</hi>
and all Chriſtians do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
is the Word of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>10. Laſtly, God will be ſerved <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly</hi>
and <hi>conſtantly:</hi> If you will
<hi>raign,</hi> you muſt <hi>conquer</hi> and <hi>endure to
the end. Oppoſition</hi> you muſt expect;
and overcome it, if you would not
be overcome. It is not good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
that will ſerve turn, unleſſe
you alſo perſevere, and fight out the
good fight of faith, and finiſh your
courſe, and patiently wait to the
laſt breath, for the Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which the Righteous
Judge will give the Conquerours,
when the unbelieving world ſhall
ſay of all their Delight and Hope
[Its paſt and gone, we ſhall never ſee
or taſt it more] but muſt now taſt of
that endleſſe wrath of God which
we were treaſuring up, when we
ſhould have workt out our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Well ſirs, I have all this while
been deſcribing to you, both as to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48167:123"/>
the <hi>Principles,</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> and the
<hi>Manner,</hi> what that Religion and
Service of God is, in which you muſt
labour with all your might: that
you may ſee that it is no factious or
private opinions or practices that
we call you to; and that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
may no longer be deluded
with the pretences of mens diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
opinions in Religion; and that
the names of Prelatical, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
Puritan, Papiſt, nor any other
ſounding in your ears, may not ſo
diſtract and doat you, as to make
you forget the name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
which you have all undertaken, nor
what the Chriſtian Religion is. You
ſee now that it is nothing (no not a
ſyllable or tittle) which all ſober
Chriſtians are not agreed in, that we
perſwade you to do as the work of
your Religion: And therefore I tell
you again here, before that God
that ſhall be your Judge, and that
Conſcience that ſhall be as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
witneſſes, that if you will go
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48167:123"/>
on in ungodly worldly lives, and
refuſe the <hi>ſerious diligence</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in <hi>this Religion</hi> which <hi>your
ſelves profeſs,</hi> it ſhall be ſo far from
being any excuſe or eaſe to you, that
there were <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
or <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or <hi>different opinions
in Religion</hi> in the world, that this
very thing ſhall aggravate your ſin
and condemnation, that all theſe
Hypocrites, Schiſmaticks, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parties in the Church, did <hi>agree</hi>
in the confeſſion of <hi>all theſe things,</hi>
and yet for all that you would not
practice them: no nor practice what
<hi>your ſelves confeſſed:</hi> All theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Sects ſhall riſe up againſt the
ſenſual and prophane ungodly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and ſay, [Though we were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
or doubtful of many other
things, yet we are all agreed in
theſe: we gave our concurrent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
for them: we tempted no
man to doubt of theſe, or to deny
them.] If you will <hi>erre more</hi> then an
<hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> and be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48167:124"/>
far <hi>worſe</hi> then thoſe that are ſuch, or
<hi>you account</hi> ſuch, and think to excuſe
it, becauſe <hi>they erred</hi> in leſſer things,
it is as if the devil ſhould excuſe his
ſin by ſaying; [Lord, thy Saints did
none of them love thee as they
ſhould, and Hypocrites did but <hi>ſeem</hi>
to love thee, and therefore I thought
I might hate thee and ſet againſt
thy wayes.]</p>
            <p>BVT <hi>(ſaith the ungodly ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt)</hi>
I will never believe that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in long and earneſt prayers:
or that he is moved by the paſſions or
the words of men; and therefore I
take this but for babling, which you
call the ſerious diligence of Believers,
in their ſerving God.]</p>
            <p>To this impious objection, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
theſe ſeveral anſwers.</p>
            <p>1. I ſuppoſe this were true as you
imagine, what's this to you that
ſerve God <hi>no way at all</hi> with any <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diligence?</hi> that live in ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and wilful diſobedience to his
Laws, and do more for your bodies
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48167:124"/>
then for your ſouls, and for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, then for eternal?</p>
            <p>2. Who do you think is likeſt to
underſtand Gods mind, and what
is pleaſing to him? Himſelf or you?
Is any thing more plainly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Gods Word then <hi>praying</hi>
with <hi>frequency, fervency,</hi> and <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity?</hi>
Luk. 18. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 Theſ.
5. 17. Jam 5. 16. And will you tell
God that he hath but diſſembled
with you, and told you that he is
pleaſed with that which is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him?</p>
            <p>3. And what is the reaſon of your
unbelief? forſooth, becauſe God is
not moved with humane words or
paſſions! I grant he is not. But what
of that? Hath prayer no other uſe
but to move God? It is enough,
1. That it moveth us, and fiteth us
to receive his mercies. 2. And that
God hath made it neceſſary to the
effect, and a means or condition
without which he will not give thee
the bleſſing. Do you think (if you
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48167:125"/>
judge but by natural reaſon) that a
perſon is as fit for a mercy that
knoweth not the want or worth of
it, and would not be thankful for it
if he had it, as one that valueth it,
and is diſpoſed to thankfulneſs and
improvement? And do you not
know that holy prayer is nothing
but the actuating of holy deſires,
and the exerciſe of all thoſe graces
which are ſuited to the due eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and improvement of the
mercy. And is it not the way when
we would draw the <hi>boat</hi> to the <hi>bank,</hi>
to lay hold of the <hi>bank</hi> and pull, as
if we would draw it to the <hi>boat?</hi> If
God be not moved and drawn to
us, it is enough that we are moved
and drawn to God: And with all
that God may give his own bleſſings
to whom and upon what terms he
pleaſe, and that he hath aſſured us
he will give them but to thoſe that
value, deſire, and ſeek them, and
that with faith, and fervency, and
importunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:48167:125"/>
And yet I may add, that God is
ſo far above us, as that his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
eſſence, and bleſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is very little known to us; and
therefore though we know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that he hath no humane paſſions
or imperfections, yet if he aſſume
to himſelf the title of ſuch a thing
as love, deſire, joy or wrath, we muſt
in reaſon believe, that though theſe
are not in God as they are in man,
with any imperfection, yet there is
ſomething in God that cannot fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
be repreſented to man, nor be
underſtood by man, then by the
Images of ſuch expreſſions as God
himſelf is pleaſed to uſe.</p>
            <p>3. But I beſeech you hearken to
<hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf. Doth it not teach all
rational creatures in neceſſity to
<hi>pray to God?</hi> A ſtorm will teach the
prophaneſt Sea-man to pray, and
that with continuance and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The Mariners could ſay to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
in their danger <hi>[What meaneſt
thou, O ſleeper? ariſe, call upon thy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48167:126"/>
God; if ſo be that God will think upon
us, that we periſh not.]</hi> And <hi>they</hi>
themſelves <hi>cryed every man unto his
God,</hi> Jon. 1. 5, 6. When thou comeſt
<hi>to dye,</hi> and ſeeſt there is no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
nor any more hope from the
pleaſures of ſin, or from any of thy
companions or old deceits, then tell
me whether <hi>nature</hi> teach thee not to
cry, and cry mightily for pardon,
and mercy, and help to God? Then
we ſhall hear thee crying [O Mercy,
mercy Lord, upon a miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner]
though now thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that prayer doth any good.</p>
            <p>Ile ſay no more to thee of this. If
Nature be not conquered, and Grace
have not forſaken thee, thou wilt
be taught at home to anſwer this
objection. Sure thou canſt not eaſily
ſo far conquer reaſon, as to believe
that there is no God. And if thou
believe that there is a God, thou
canſt not believe that he is not to be
worſhipped, and that with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſeriouſneſs and diligence! Nor
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48167:126"/>
that he is not the giver of all that
thou doſt want! Or that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the world regardeth not
the diſpoſitions and actions of his
ſubjects, but will equally reward the
good and bad, and give to all alike,
and have no reſpect to mens prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for his reward. What Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
that believeth that there is a
God, doth not believe that Prayer
to him is a neceſſary part of his
worſhip?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But is not your ſtrict obſervation
of the Lords day a controverted thing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this alſo I will ſtrip
thee of this excuſe. 1. Spend the
Lords day but according to the
common principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and reaſon, and it ſhall ſuffice:
Spend it but as one that loveth God
better then any thing in the world,
and that taketh more pleaſure in his
ſervice then in ſin and vanity:
Spend it but as the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of thy
<hi>own ſoul,</hi> and thy <hi>families</hi> require; as
one that's glad of ſo honourable,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48167:127"/>
gainful, and delightful an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the publick and private
worſhipping of God, and the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
contemplation of the life to
come: As one that knoweth the
need and benefit of having ſtated
times for the ſervice of God; and
what would come of all Religion,
if the Time were left to each ones
will? Spend it as men that put a
juſt difference between the common
buſineſs of this world, and the things
that concern your endleſs ſtate, and
that have conſidered the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one day in ſeven, in reference
to this different conſequence of the
work: Spend it as men that have
loſt as much time as you have done,
and have need to make the beſt of
the little that is left,; and that are
behind hand ſo far in the matters
of your ſalvation, and have need to
work with all your might, and
ſhould be gladder of the helps of
ſuch a day, then of thouſands of
gold and ſilver: Spend it as thoſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48167:127"/>
that believe that we owe God as
much ſervice as the <hi>Jews</hi> did: Spend
it as the Ancient Chriſtians ſpent it,
that were wont to ſtay together al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
from morning till night in
publick worſhip and Communion:
Spend it as the Kings Declaration
requireth, which ſaith <hi>[Our purpoſe
and reſolution is, and ſhall be, to take
care that the Lords day be applied to
holy exerciſes, without unneceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And if yet there be any doubt in
this, I refer you to the judgment of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> expreſſed
in the <hi>Homily of the Time and Place
of Prayer.</hi> And for the <hi>Time,</hi> the
<hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the <hi>Authority,</hi> &amp;
the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf, I deſire you but to
receive what is there delivered, not
by any factious perſons, but by the
Church. Do this, and we are agreed
and ſatisfied. And I make it my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to the Reader, to peruſe both
<hi>Parts</hi> of that <hi>Homily,</hi> that he may
know how far the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:48167:128"/>
is from the looſe conceits of the
enemies of Godlineſs: And if alſo
you will read over the Homilies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the peril of Idolatry, you
will the fuller know the Judgement
of the Church about the manner
of Gods worſhip. (Indeed the
whole Book is ſuch as the people
ſhould be acquainted with.)</p>
            <p>I Have done my part to open to
you the Neceſſity of <hi>SERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVS
DILIGENCE,</hi> and to
call up the ſluggiſh ſouls of ſinners
to mind the work of their ſalvation,
and to do it <hi>SPEEDILY,</hi> and
with all their <hi>MIGHT.</hi> I muſt
now leave the ſucceſs to God and
you. What uſe you will make of it,
and what you will be and do for the
time to come, is a matter that more
concerneth your ſelves then me. If
long ſpeaking, or multitude of
words, were the way to prevail with
you, I ſhould willingly ſpeak here
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48167:128"/>
while my ſtrength would endure,
and lengthen out my exhortations
yet ſeven-fold. But that's not the
way: A little wearieth you: You
love long feaſts, and long viſits, and
plays, and ſports, much better then
long Sermons, or Books, or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
But it is no ſmall grief to us,
to leave you in a caſe of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
without ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hopes of your deliverance.</p>
            <p>Sirs, the matter is now laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and much in your own
hands; it will not be ſo long! What
will ye now do? Have I <hi>convinced</hi>
you now, that God and your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are to be ſought with all your
might? If I have not, it is not for
want of evidence in what is ſaid,
but for want of willingneſs in your
ſelves to know the truth: I have
proved to you, that it is a matter <hi>out
of controverſie,</hi> unleſs your luſts, and
paſſions, and carnal intereſt will
<hi>make a controverſie</hi> of it. I beſeech
you tell me, if you be of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48167:129"/>
at all, why are you not <hi>strict,
ſerious,</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>mortified,</hi>
and <hi>Heavenly in that Religion</hi> which
you are of? Sure you will not ſo far
ſhame your own <hi>Religion,</hi> whatever
it be, as to ſay that your Religion
is not for mortification, holineſſe,
heavenlineſs, ſelf-denial, or that
your Religion alloweth you to be
ambitious, covetous, gluttonous,
drunken, to curſe, and ſwear, and
whore, and raile, and oppreſs the
innocent; It is not <hi>Religion,</hi> but
<hi>Diabolical ſerpentine malignity</hi> that is
for any of this.</p>
            <p>Its wonderful to think, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, and Gentlemen, and men
that pretend to reaſon and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can quietly betray their ſouls to
the Devil upon ſuch ſilly grounds,
and do the evil that they have no
more to ſay for, and neglect that
duty that they have no more to ſay
againſt, when they know they muſt
do it <hi>NOW</hi> or <hi>NEVER!</hi> That
while they <hi>confeſſe</hi> that there is a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48167:129"/>
God, and a life to come, a Heaven
and a Hell, and that this life is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
given us for preparation for
Eternity, while they confeſs that
God is moſt wiſe, and holy, and
good, and juſt, and that ſin is the
greateſt evil, and that the Word of
God is true, they can yet make ſhift
to quiet themſelves in an unholy,
ſenſual, careleſs life: And that
while they honour the Apoſtles and
Martyrs, and Saints that are dead
and gone, they hate their ſucceſſors
and imitators, and the lives that
they lived, and are inclined to make
more Martyrs by their malicious
cruelty.</p>
            <p>Alas, all this comes from the
want of a ſound belief of the things
which they never ſaw; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of thoſe things, &amp; the power
of paſſion, and ſenſual objects and
inclinations, that hurry them away
after preſent vanities, and conquer
reaſon, and rob them of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
and by the noiſe of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48167:130"/>
company of ſenſual ſinners, that
harden and deaffen one another,
and by the juſt judgement of God,
forſaking thoſe that would not know
him, and leaving them to the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and hardneſs of their hearts.
But is there <hi>no remedy!</hi> O thou the
fountain of mercy and relief,
vouchſafe theſe miſerable ſinners a
remedy! O thou the Saviour of loſt
mankind, have mercy upon theſe
ſinners in the depth of their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
preſumption, and miſery! O
thou the Illuminater and Sanctifier
of ſouls, apply the remedy ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purchaſed! We are conſtrained
oft to fear leſt it be much long of
<hi>us,</hi> that ſhould more <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> preach
the awakening truths of God unto
mens hearts. And verily our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
cannot but accuſe us, that
when we are moſt <hi>lively</hi> and ſerious,
alas, we ſeem but almoſt to trifle,
conſidering on what a meſſage we
come, and of what tranſcendent
things we ſpeak. But Satan hath
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48167:130"/>
got his advantage upon <hi>our hearts</hi>
that ſhould be inſtrumental to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<hi>theirs,</hi> as well as on <hi>theirs</hi> that
ſhould receive the truth. O that we
could thirſt more after their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
O that we could pray harder
for it; and entreat them more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly;
as thoſe that were loath to take
a denial from God or man; I muſt
confeſs to you all with ſhame and
ſorrow, that I am even amazed to
think of the hardneſs of my own
heart, that melteth no more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to the miſerable, and is no
more earneſt and importunate with
ſinners, when I am upon ſuch a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as this;</hi> and am telling them
that it muſt be NOW or NEVER;
and when the meſſengers of <hi>Death
within,</hi> and the <hi>fame of mens diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
from <hi>without,</hi> doth tell me how
likely it is that <hi>my Time</hi> ſhall be but
<hi>ſhort,</hi> and that if I will ſay any thing
that may reach the hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
for ought I know, it muſt be
NOW or NEVER. O what an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48167:131"/>
what a lamentable diſeaſe is
this inſenſibility and hardneſs of
heart! If I were ſure this were the
laſt Sermon that ever I ſhould
preach, I find now my heart would
ſhew its ſluggiſhneſs, and rob poor
ſouls of the <hi>ſerious fervour</hi> which is
ſuitable to the ſubject and their caſe,
and needful to the deſired ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But yet poor ſleepy ſinners, <hi>hear
us:</hi> Though we ſpeak not to you
as men would do that had <hi>ſeen
Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a perfectly awakned frame,
yet <hi>hear us</hi> while we ſpeak to you
the <hi>words of truth</hi> with ſome <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
and compaſſionate deſire of
your Salvation. O look up to your
God! Look out unto eternity:
Look inwardly upon your ſouls:
Look wiſely upon your ſhort and
haſty Time: and then bethink you
how the little remnant of your
Time ſhould be employed: and
what it is that <hi>moſt</hi> concerneth you
to diſpatch and ſecure before you
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48167:131"/>
die. <hi>Now</hi> you have <hi>Sermons,</hi> and
<hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Warnings:</hi> It will not be
ſo long: Preachers muſt have done:
<hi>God</hi> threatneth them, and <hi>death</hi>
threatneth them, and <hi>men</hi> threaten
them, and its <hi>you,</hi> its <hi>you</hi> that are
moſt ſeverely threatned, and that
are called on by Gods warnings,
<hi>[If any man have an ear to hear, let
him hear.] Now</hi> you have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of private helps, you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of underſtanding gracious
companions; you have the Lords
dayes to ſpend in holy exerciſes,
for the edification and ſolace of
your ſouls; you have choice of
ſound and ſerious Books: and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God, you have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of a Chriſtian and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
King and Magiſtracy: O
what unvaluable mercies are all
theſe! O know your time, and
uſe theſe with induſtry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this harveſt for your ſouls!
For it will not be thus alwayes: It
muſt be NOW or NEVER.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48167:132"/>
You have yet time and leave to
Pray and cry to God in hope: Yet
if you have hearts and tongues, he
hath an hearing ear: The Spirit
of grace is ready to aſſiſt you: It
will not be thus <hi>alwayes:</hi> The
time is coming when the loudeſt
cries will do no good: O pray,
pray, pray poor needy miſerable
ſinners; for it muſt be NOW or
NEVER.</p>
            <p>You have <hi>yet</hi> health and ſtrength,
and bodies fit to ſerve your ſouls:
It will not be ſo <hi>alwayes:</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and paines and death are
coming. O uſe your health and
ſtrength for God: For it muſt be
NOW or NEVER.</p>
            <p>Yet there are ſome ſtirrings of
<hi>conviction</hi> in your <hi>Conſciences:</hi> You
find that all is not well with you:
and you have ſome thoughts or
purpoſes to repent, and be new
creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is ſome hope in
this, that yet God hath not quite
forſaken you. O trifle not, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48167:132"/>
ſtifle not the conviction of your
conſciences, but hearken to the
witneſſe of God within you: It
muſt be NOW or NEVER.</p>
            <p>Would you not be loath to be
left to the deſpairing caſe of many
poor diſtreſſed ſouls, that cry out,
<hi>O it is now too late! I fear my day of
grace is paſt; God will not hear me
now if I ſhould call vpon him: he
hath forſaken me, and given me over
to my ſelf. It is too late to repent, too
late to pray, too late to think of a
new life; all is too late.</hi> This caſe is
ſad: But yet many of theſe are in a
ſafer and better caſe then they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and are but <hi>frightened</hi> by the
tempter, and it is <hi>not too late,</hi> while
they cry out, <hi>It is too late:</hi> But if you
are left to cry in <hi>hell [It is too late]</hi>
alas, how <hi>long</hi> and how <hi>doleful</hi> a cry
and lamentation will it be!</p>
            <p>O conſider poor ſinner, that God
knoweth the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Seaſon</hi> of thy
<hi>mercies:</hi> He giveth thee <hi>Spring</hi> and
<hi>Harveſt</hi> in their <hi>Seaſon:</hi> and all his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48167:133"/>
mercies in their <hi>Seaſon,</hi> and wilt
thou not know thy <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Seaſon,</hi>
for <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>thanks</hi> to him?</p>
            <p>Conſider that God who hath
commanded thee thy work, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
appointed thee thy time: And
this is his appointed time. To day
therefore hearken to his voice, and
ſee that thou harden not thy heart:
He that bids thee <hi>Repent and work
out thy Salvation with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
doth alſo bid thee do it <hi>Now:
Obey</hi> him in the <hi>time,</hi> if thou wilt be
<hi>indeed obedient:</hi> He beſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the fitteſt time. One would
think to men that have loſt ſo much
time already, and loitered ſo long, &amp;
are ſo lamentably behind hand, and
ſtand ſo near the bar of God, and
their everlaſting ſtate, there ſhould
be no need to ſay any more, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them to be up and doing. I
ſhall add but this: <hi>You are never like
to have a better time.</hi> Take this or
the work will grow more <hi>difficult,</hi>
more <hi>doubtful,</hi> if through the juſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48167:133"/>
judgement of God, it become not
<hi>deſperate.</hi> If all this will not ſerve,
but ſtill you will loiter till time be
gone, what can your poor friends do
but lament your miſery! The Lord
knowes, if we knew what words,
what pains, what coſt would tend to
your awakening, and converſion
and ſalvation, we ſhould be glad to
ſubmit to it: and we hope we ſhould
not think our labours, or liberties,
or our lives too dear to promote ſo
bleſſed and ſo neceſſary a work. But
if when all is done that we can do,
you will leave us nothing but our
tears and moans for ſelf-deſtroyers,
the ſin is yours, and the ſuffering
ſhall be yours: If I can do no more,
I ſhall leave this upon record, that
<hi>we took our time</hi> to tell you home,
that SERIOUS DILIGENCE is
neſſary to your Salvation, and that
<hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. and that
<hi>this</hi> was your <hi>day,</hi> your <hi>only day:</hi> It
muſt be NOW or NEVER.</p>
