            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F those many hundreds of Sermons,
which you have heard from me,
(since you pleased to call me to the
work of the Gospell in your place)
The lot of being published is only falne upon
this single one, preach't at your Command, to
the Country then under your Command. I
will not adventure at an Apology for my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, for I look upon the presse as a common
Midwife for poore folkes, as well as rich; and
an advantage (not only to the grand Masters of
Learning, and parts, but) to all other men, who
desire a cheape, easie, and ready way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
Neither doth this Sermon (a <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54555:3"/>
rather than a <hi>Saul)</hi> come forth because it is
higher by the head, or of a goodlyer Stature,
or Complexion then its brethren (for no man
that sees it will by its looks guesse that it was
born in an University) nor doe I print it, for any
thing that it hath done beyond others upon the
Subject which it handles, for I am not worthy
(with <hi>Ionathans</hi> Lad) to run, and gather up
their Arrows; but, because the Lord pleased
to blesse it with some good successe (the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Judges and many others being much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it) and because I cannot (as yet)
find any way of expressing my due respects to
your selfe so publiquely as this.</p>
            <p>The best word it had after it was preacht
(and I never desire better) was, that it was <hi>An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Sermon,</hi> and as it is usually said of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, that he may travell all the world
over, and need not feare looking any one in the
face, so I hope may an honest Sermon. And,
to him that shall examine this Messenger of
mine, whence he comes, and whither he goes,
and what is his businesse? If he say, From <hi>Ayno,</hi>
with an Hue and Cry after a company of self-condemned
sinners, who have broken the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of conscience, and run up and downe in
<pb facs="tcp:54555:3"/>
their chaines, to apprehend them; and withall
makes mention of your name, and warrant for
so doing, I hope it shall be neither danger, nor
dishonour to you: There is never a Magistrate
in <hi>England</hi> but I am sure ought, and never a
good one but will assist this work of Gods word
to suppresse sinne and open wickednesse.</p>
            <p>There is a suite (I confesse) depending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Divines about Gods Vindictive Justice,
and its necessary working; and excellent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
there are on both sides: Now although this
Sermon speakes on the defendants side, yet I
hope its testimony shall offend none who shall
consider that the chief tendency of my speech
(and indeed of that point) is to the glory of
Gods holinesse, Justice, and mercy, and the
beating down sinne, and those slight thoughts
of ungodly men concerning it: if therefore this
comes into a good mans hands, he will not be
the worse for reading it; if into an evill mans,
he may be the better; and if into a learned mans,
he will have cause to blesse God, that he can
write farre better, My only request is, that when
it comes into your hand, it may be accepted with
the right hand, even as it is tendred.</p>
            <p>All that I have to adde, is to acknowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:54555:4"/>
and to leave this with you as a testimony of my
gratitude for your many favours, and of your
diligent, and exemplary attendance at, and
countenance of the publick Ordinances and
worship of God under my Ministery: And to
beg of God on your behalf, that you may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in your spirituall estate, even as you doe in
your temporall. That in your Magistracy, you
may be wise, and zealous, that you may be
eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; that you
may be a terrour to evill doers, and a praise to
them that doe well; that the poore and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
may waite for you as the raine, and you
may cause the widdowes heart to sing for joy;
That in your family you may walke with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
heart, not suffering an evill doer, or wicked
servant to tarry in your sight. In a word; that
by an holy, and cheerfull improvement of your
time, Interest, and many talents, you may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the great God, credit the Gospell, uphold
sinking Religion, be one of those innocents,
that may preserve the <hi>Island;</hi> doe good, be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in good workes, relieve the poore, and
needy (which indeed you doe more than many
that make a greater noise) strengthen the hands
of the Ministry, and so expresse your affection
<pb facs="tcp:54555:4"/>
to Learning (which I know you prize) that poor
I may stand by, and more excellent pens come
forth publiquely to acknowledge you, and
blesse God for you, and you may be the blessed
of the Lord, and your seed after you. Sir, These
are, and such as these shall be the humble, and
dayly prayers of</p>

condemned Malefactor Himselfe; But pardoned, made
a Favourite, raised to the dignity of an <hi>Apostle</hi> and
<hi>Ambassador,</hi> sent out, and by speciall commission of
<hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> (as I may say) given him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by word of mouth from Jesus Christ, the King of
all the world, authorized to try and judge the Gentiles:
And accordingly in this chapter he sits upon them,
opens his commission, publisheth it, &amp; then proceeds with
them upon an issue of Eternall Life or death. Such an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54555:7"/>
other Judge was the Prophet <hi>Ezek. Wilt thou Iudge
them Son of Man, wilt thou judge them? chap.</hi> 20. 3. And
(that I may seasonably magnifie our vilified office)
Such a Judge is every true Minister of the Gospell
(being all put into commission as well as the Apostles,
<hi>Math. 18. 19. 20.)</hi> As very scar-crowes as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
world make of them; having a power as authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to declare and pronounce Sentence of life or death
(from the Pulpit) upon the Souls of men, as any Judge
on earth hath upon the bodies and lives of Malefactors,
from the Bench. And the effects and Successe of our
Sermons doe oftentimes make this appeare, causing
Sinners that stand below as at a Barre, to grow pale,
wring their hands, to tremble, and cry out (like those
in the <hi>Acts) Men and Brethren what shall we doe?</hi> As we
read Judge <hi>Faelix</hi> himselfe did,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 3. 4. 5. 6.</note> who when he sent for
<hi>Paul</hi> to heare him,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> thought only of some neat discourse,
but it proved a Judiciary Tryall of Him for intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and injustice, The poore prisoner proving to be
the Judge, and the Judge the prisoner.</p>
            <p>2. The prisoners at the Barre of <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry are the
whole body of the <hi>Gentile-nations,</hi> spread all over the
Earth, <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians, Princes, Philosophers,
Poets, Orators, wise, unwise, rich,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> all, all. There is
I confesse a Learned Annotator of our owne nation,
who as he too much hath gratified the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
laying the great Mystery of Iniquity at the doore of the
<hi>Gnosticks,</hi> (a Mungrel Sect made up of <hi>Gentilisme, Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,</hi>
and <hi>Christianity,</hi> living in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time) So
also he loads them with the heavy Burden of both these
chapters. But I finde him in this latter opinion to stand
alone and by himselfe, and not so much as his Friend
<hi>H: Grotius</hi> with him. The generall vote of <hi>Expositors</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54555:7"/>
being that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were the men, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
here chargeth.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Indictment,</hi> and <hi>Articles of Crimes</hi> laid to their
Charge, wee have ranked under three Heads. (1) <hi>against
God</hi> (2) their <hi>neighbours (3) themselves,</hi> many or most
of them are found to be <hi>Felones de se.</hi> Not to name All,
Here is within the compasse of three verses (29, 30,
31.) a Bill brought in against them consisting of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Murders, Felonies, Riots, Buggeries, Perjuries,</hi> and
all sorts of <hi>misdemeanours,</hi> no lesse than 23. in number,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. As for the Law by which he proceeds in their tryall,
it is here produced, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] the <hi>Ancient</hi> and
<hi>Fundamentall Law</hi> of <hi>Divine Iustice.</hi> From whence (as
the very Fountaine) have issued all the just and good
Lawes both Divine and Humane in the world. The word
in the plural number (as <hi>Beza</hi> observes) is promiscuously
used both for the Mandates of God, (<hi>Morall, Iudiciall,</hi>
and <hi>Ceremoniall</hi>) and also for his Judgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.
But in the singular (as here) it either signifies that Divine
Law of Righteousnesse; written in all mens hearts, with
the obligation to vengeance upon the transgressors, (&amp; so
comes to as much as the <hi>Synteresis</hi> and <hi>Syneidesis</hi> in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conscience.) Or else it imports that just execution of
punishment due for sin:<note place="margin">Soe <hi>Aristotle</hi> defines it. <hi>Ethic.</hi> Lib. 5. chap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Iustitia poenalis, Suidas</hi> calls it,
and our English Translation in the Text, <hi>The Iudgement
of God.</hi> So then the Law is, (1.) A <hi>common</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Law,</hi> called by some <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> by others,
<hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Divine Law.</hi> (2.) A
<hi>Iust and Equall Law,</hi> translated sometimes, <hi>The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God,</hi> dealing with sinners according as they are
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. (3.) A <hi>knowne</hi> and <hi>divulged</hi> Law. Every son and
daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> hath a Proclamation of it nailed by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54555:8"/>
God upon his conscience. (4.) An <hi>approved Law,</hi> by
consent of all men under it, <hi>(Iure Die agnito) That they
who committed wickednesse were worthy of death.</hi> Lastly, an
<hi>immutable</hi> and <hi>indispensable</hi> Law, it being an essentiall
property in God,<note place="margin">Pareus in Locum.</note> and necessarily proceeding from him in
the government of the world. So that for matter of Law,
the Prisoners here have (you see) as faire a Tryall as heart
can wish.</p>
            <p>5. But what <hi>Iury</hi> have they? and who hath the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelling
of it, you will say? for that is very considerable.
Why for that, The Jury is not only taken out of the
neighbourhood and among their peeres, but (which is
an Indulgence not allowed by mens lawes) from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves and out of their owne consciences.
Such a One as we read of <hi>(Esay. 5. 3.) Iudge I pray you
betwixt Me and my Vinyard &amp;c.</hi> The very same grand
Jury which shall be made to serve betwixt the Lord and
the whole Earth, at that great day of Assize.</p>
            <p>6. This Jury (like some that in very cleare causes never
goe from the bar) quickly bring in their Verdict upon
Two Bills, In both which the prisoners are found
guilty. In the first as <hi>Principalls,</hi> They were Actors of
all those fowle crimes charged on them in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verse 29. 30. 31. In the Second, As <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories,
Abetters, Aiders, Countenancers, Mantainers</hi> and
<hi>Defenders</hi> of Others in the same and the like outrages,
which (although according to humane Lawes the <hi>accesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
are lesse guilty) yet according to Gods Law, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases is greater than to be the <hi>principall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. There is yet one thing more (implicitly) in the
Text, and that is this; The prisoners (being thus cast)
seeme to be called upon by the Judge what they can say
for themselves, That the Sentence of death of which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54555:8"/>
they were worthy (being found guilty) might not passe.
To which the poore wretches all stand silent: neither
being able to cavill at the Court, to demur to the Bill,
to except against the Jury, to evade the Law; nor to
plead ignorance of it, for the Text saith <hi>they knew it,</hi> that
<hi>They which do such things were worthy of death:</hi> nor lastly
To plead <hi>Infirmity, incogitancy, chancemedly,</hi> and that
they did it against their wills; For they did not only <hi>doe
such things,</hi> but they were (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>Master of the Trade,
professors</hi> and <hi>practitioners of</hi> the very <hi>Mysteries of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
nay they were such as did <hi>consent, countenance,
commend, applaud,</hi> yea <hi>command</hi> others to doe the same,
delighting and <hi>taking pleasure</hi> in them that did so. For
all this and more is in the nerves of the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
according to <hi>Beza, Pareus, Piscat.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And thus these <hi>Gentile Sinners</hi> being brought by the
<hi>Apostle</hi> under an <hi>inevitable conviction</hi> and <hi>Selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi>
and all excuses (like father <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaves)
taken away. They are left under the Sentence of death,
either to expect the execution thereof every moment
from the avenging Hand of a just God; or else (which
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> like a mercifull Judge puts them in mind of,
and perswades them to it) to fall downe and cry for <hi>a
Psalm of mercy, and the Benefit of the Booke (viz.)</hi>
the Gospell in the Hand of that great and only Ordinary
and Bishop of our Soules, JESUS CHRIST, that
so they might be pardoned and live.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Sacco soluto reluxit argentum</hi> (as <hi>Ambrose</hi>
saith concerning <hi>Benjamins</hi> Sack, My Text being like
That opened) This point of divine Learning (far richer
and finer than Silver or Gold) like Josephs cup appeares
in the mouth of it, By which (as was said of that) I shall
be able anon to divine what Estate you are in, whether of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54555:9"/>
death or life, and whether you be come hither this day
any of you as spies to finde out the weaknesse of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or indeed to get some spirituall bread. It is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That man</hi> (whoever he be on earth) <hi>Who knowes that
according to the righteousnesse of Gods vindictive justice,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
a wicked life deserves eternall death; yet dares both to doe
wickedly himself, and also to abet, countenance, uphold and
applaud others, is an inexcusable selfe-condemned man and
in a most desperate estate.</hi> A Theame not improper for
any Pulpit in this land and age, where men professe to
know so much, and surely doe know very much, yet
live (too many) as if they knew no law, no sin, no God,
no judgement: but I have thought it a very suitable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(were it in an hand that could well manage it) for this
Mornings exercise. That all you who are come together
to enquire after, to try, and accuse, and condemn to
death those poore prisoners, who shall be found worthy
thereof according to our Lawes, may heare of a justice
and wrath (the righteous judgement of God) which no
impenitent soule shall escape, much lesse they who judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
bring others to their deserved shamefull deaths,
and yet allow themselves, and delight in others who <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
things worthy of Eternall death;</hi> yea and many times
of a sentence too from the Bench; were you but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
here, as you are sure to be hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my prosecution of this point (begging some graines
of allowance for want of Academicall exactnesse) I shall
briefly speak of these 4. things most materiall.</hi> (1) That
there is in God an Avenging justice, ingaging him to punish
sin <hi>(the breach of his Law)</hi> with the eternall death of the
sinner. (2) That there is in sin that which deserves and it
worthy of such judgement. (3) That this merit of sin, and
vindictive justice of God is sufficiently made known to all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54555:9"/>
               <hi>men.</hi> (4) That notwithstanding this discovery of divine
justice, yet multitudes every where doe not only commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
themselves but delight in it, and in them that doe
it, <hi>The rest shall be all in application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Concerning the <hi>Iustice of God</hi> (which is a very large
and comprehensive subject) I must not be allowed to
read a Lecture of it here. Let this suffice to lead the way
to my purpose. There are not only in the Scriptures
(where the eradiation of Gods glory shines brightest)
but even in profane and naturall writings, four Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of <hi>Righteousnesse or Iustice;</hi> all which are more
truly, properly and naturally in <hi>God,</hi> then in either <hi>humane</hi>
or <hi>Angelicall</hi> natures.</p>
            <p>1. The first is called <hi>Universall righteousnesse,</hi> which
(as the Sun is the Fountaine of light) doth bestow not
only lustre and beauty, but life and being upon Bonity
and goodnesse of all kindes, so the Scripture useth it to
expresse both <hi>Morall,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 34.</note> Civill,</hi> and <hi>Evangelicall exactnesse,
Righteousnesse exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any
people;</hi> sin in that place is in its Latitude made the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
to righteousnesse in its extent, and so the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is equivalent to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Ethic. lib. 5.</note> And this notion <hi>Aristotle</hi>
was acquainted with, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, A <hi>just man</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is one that is possest of every vertue.</hi> And truly
in this sense, <hi>Iustice</hi> is so proper to God, that it is his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar,
none but his, who is Goodnesse it selfe, and can
doe no iniquity, nor approve it, whose will (though eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and perfectly free) yet is not like mans will (when
at the best) to be free to chuse good or evill, but his will
is the very constitutive of all goodnesse and justice, and
all creatures and their Actions are so farre and no further
right and just as they conforme to his will.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A second Righteousnesse</hi> is that speciall and proper
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54555:10"/>
vertue, which denominates a person (as he is considered
in such and such a condition and capacity) to be <hi>justus quà
sic,</hi> as a <hi>just Magistrate, Iudge, Husband, Steward,</hi> &amp;c.
And this is most proper to God in his performance of
those severall offices and stations which he is pleased to
take upon him to personate; He is a most just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lord, Father, Husband, witnesse, judge, there is no
unrighteousnesse in him.</p>
            <p>(3) Not only Christians, but Heathens also bestowed
the name and honour of <hi>Iustice</hi> upon <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>verity</hi> in
<hi>promises, Covenants, reports, Testimonies,</hi> yea and all
<hi>speeches; Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Offices</hi> calls it <hi>Fundamentum Iustitiae,</hi>
the very <hi>Basis</hi> of righteousnesse. And this is also so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to God, and so immutably in him, that it is given
to him alone,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
upon this (and therefore it had need be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
stands the Being and Well-being of us all, and all
we have or hope for ever.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, <hi>Iustice</hi> (yet more narrowly restrained and
limitted) is that vertue, of which <hi>Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> and
others have treated of at large, described by <hi>Plato</hi> to be,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And by the learned in the
Law, <hi>virtus suum cuique tribuendi,</hi> and is commanded as a
Christian duty by the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Render to every man his
due.</hi> And this is that which we call <hi>distributive Iustice,</hi>
and <hi>Aristotle</hi> contends to have the name of it,<note place="margin">Arist. l. Ethic. 5. cap. 7.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

of God, which (when it was the good pleasure of his will
to make a world, and to set up a Royall Court and
House keeping, and to Create Angels to wait upon him
in his Presence chamber above, and men here below,
and that they should know his mind and pleasure what he
lookt for at their hands, leaving them by their natures in

move him to make a <hi>locall Hell</hi> in a readinesse (as a prison

(in every sin) that which deserves the death, the Eternall

not provided to say much, neither indeed need I. <hi>Socinus</hi>

               </gap>) <hi>Worthy of

and take in all evills of punishment; death in its latitude,
death corporall, and spirituall, temporall, and eternall, of
sense and of losse, the full vialls of wrath. And by the
word (<hi>worthy</hi>) is meant due, deserved, just and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable:
<hi>Beza</hi> saith the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is taken from the

(an antient Embleme of Justice) so that though

that his sufferings are more or greater than he deserves:
<hi>Dives</hi> in Hell cries out of his torments, but not a word
against the Judge, or the Sentence that sent him thither;
the enemies of God have cause to blesse God, that spared
them, and kept them so long alive, but no cause to cavill
at their punishment, for eternall death is full weight, and
yet but weight for sinne; even among men (whole scales
cannot be carried with so even an hand as Gods) <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Iustice</hi> hath an Eye to the quality of the party

The wages, the reward, the stipend, the stipends of sinne,
of any sinne, of every single sinne are death, all kindes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54555:13"/>
of death, eternall death. Thus the words are diversly
read, and that eternall death is clearly implyed, may be
gathered from the <hi>Antithesis</hi> in the words following,
<hi>The gift of God is eternall life.</hi> The Greek word for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is that which was properly paid in Victualls to the
<hi>Roman Souldiers,</hi> by the Commissary of the Army, in
lieu of Money, and was a valuable payment, and stipend
for their warfare, so that it seems for a sinner to dye the
death is as just, as a pennyworth for a penny; and this
shall be enough upon the second Particular.</p>
            <p>The third followeth,<note place="margin">Third Partic.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That as it is naturall in
<hi>God</hi> to punish sinne with death, so it is naturall to <hi>Man</hi>
to know so much. It is true, that the first sinner had
both the precept, <hi>Thou shalt not eate,</hi> &amp;c. and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
<hi>Thou shalt dye if thou dost,</hi> given him positively over
and above what was stampt on his heart; but that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
being offended would be satisfied most certainly,
this was in him naturally: and therefore as soon as ever
he had sinned, expectation of vengeance made him fly
for the same, and to skulk and hide himselfe, Paradice
being now but a Prison to him. Me thinkes I heare the
Dialogue, <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> (so God comes cooly, and
friendly to him) <hi>whats the matter</hi> Adam? <hi>what (Man?)
hide thy selfe? Lord of the Earth,<note place="margin">Gen 3. 9.</note> and Prince of this place
and hide thy self? The most exact &amp; beautiful piece which I
have made and hide thy self? Whats the cause of this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse?</hi>
Oh my Lord (saith the poor sneak) I heard thy
voice in the Garden: <hi>Why what then? was my voice so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
thou hast heard my voice before now. Did I thunder? did
I threaten? did I call thee out of thy name? Come, come,
thats not it.</hi> Yea but Lord I was afraid, and hid, because
I was naked. <hi>Oh, was you naked? and what then? naked?
why so you was before, this is not the first time that I have
seen you naked. No, no, thats not it (thou wretch and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54555:14"/>
but the naked truth is, thou knowest thy desert, and
doom; thy coat of Maile was thy Righteousnesse, and that is
gone; thy Soule is naked, and lyes open now as well as thy
Skin, for my wrath and vengeance.</hi> Truly this was it: He
lookt upon <hi>Gods Iustice</hi> as <hi>Gods Nature,</hi> never dreaming
or imagining to stand it out, with hopes that God would
let it got for nothing. And it is very observable, that
(although he knew God to be a mercifull and loving
Lord) yet not knowing how <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> might
both meet in his case; he therefore in all the defence
which he made for himselfe, never pleads, <hi>Lord what
need this satisfying of Iustice? if thou pleasest, thou maist
let this fault escape, and look for no satisfaction.</hi> Had he
said thus, he had sinned yet more, even against <hi>Gods
Nature,</hi> as any one of us should also doe, should we ask
a pardon at <hi>Gods</hi> hands, without adding for whose sake
<hi>God</hi> should bestow it on us.</p>
            <p>As it was in <hi>Adam</hi> to know and feare <hi>Iustice,</hi> so it
remained in all his posterity, as the Apostle before he
leaves this argument, proves <hi>Rom. 2. 15. They having
not the Law, are a Law to themselves, their Consciences
excusing or accusing one another.</hi> The great Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
that broke his Soule in pieces, dasht out the knowledge
of the <hi>true God,</hi> yet left this naturall principle in Man;
<hi>If thou dost well,<note place="margin">Gen 4.</note> thou shalt receive well.</hi> And we finde the
Lord pleading the force of this with <hi>Cain</hi> as an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule, and naturall notion. <hi>If thou dost well, shalt thou
not receive well?</hi> The interrogation is a clear and strong
proof of this Candle yet shined in his spirit.</p>
            <p>There are certain Common and Universall principles,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Aphorismes</hi> and <hi>Fundamentall truths</hi> kept alive in all men,

and <hi>Protagoras</hi> could not utterly deny it) <hi>That the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54555:14"/>
Divine Power is to be observed and worshiped; that
we ought to hurt none, doe as we would be done to, that
there was an Eye which viewes men,</hi> (and among the rest)
<hi>that the Blasphemers of the Gods, and vicious, flagicious
persons deserved death.</hi> Some pretty glimmerings of
the light of this very Doctrine which I preach, the
Heathens had. Hence came their Fancy of <hi>Nemesis,</hi> or
<hi>Rhamnusia,</hi> to be a Deity, whose very work was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
wickednesse, and reward goodnesse, and it is to
my purpose, that they called her the daughter of <hi>Iove,</hi>
and <hi>Necessity,</hi> implying that to be a <hi>God,</hi> and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily

against sin.</p>
            <p>Not withstanding all which knowledge,<note place="margin">Fourth Partie.</note> both of the
Almighties words and deeds against sin (set on often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
closer then <hi>Conscience</hi> can doe it) by the heavy
hand of <hi>God</hi> himselfe upon the Soules and Spirits of
guilty ones, even kindling an <hi>Hell fire</hi> in their bosomes,
and making them (like poor <hi>Spira</hi>) to yell and shreek,
and to have such Devills in them, as no <hi>Disciple</hi> can
cast out, no <hi>Minister</hi> can quiet. Yet (oh wonder!)
How rife &amp; rank is all manner of wickedness to this very
day in the world! nay, in the best part of it, in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized,
cultivated, inlightned, baptized part of the
world. In <hi>England</hi> (whose sinnes are her onely shame,
and I feare will be her ruine) In <hi>England,</hi> old <hi>England,</hi>
as much as any where, and that not onely for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of sinners (take so many for so many) but for the
variety of sinnes. Blush ô ye Heavens over our heads,
and thou Earth tremble under us, for I fear there is not
a sinne (naturall or unnaturall) to be found upon record
in this sad Chapter, to have been committed by the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> against their star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Gospel</hi> in this <hi>Island,</hi> and now of late 12 or 14 yeares
judgements of an angry <hi>God</hi> amongst us) is still to be
found amongst our debaucht ones, and I pray <hi>God</hi> your
Lordships doe not, to the grief of your hearts meet with
most of them, even in this one Circuit, before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
Surely, surely, these dayes are the dreggs and
very bottome of Time, and if the abounding of Iniquity
be one of the signes of the worlds end, it cannot be long
before the <hi>Iudge of Quick and Dead</hi> rend the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
and comes down.</p>

Alas for us! How doe men sinne with their eyes open,
their cares open, their Consciences wide open! In the
face of the <hi>Sun,</hi> of the <hi>Minister,</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> himselfe! Men every where know that he is a <hi>jealous
God,</hi> a <hi>just Iudge,</hi> an Avenger of all impieties and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous

<hi>God</hi> hath his quiver full of arrowes, and some arrowes
upon the very string; and they the mark against which
they are level'd, that they are within shot, that <hi>hell</hi>

               </gap> that <hi>vengeance</hi> (like the sword hanging
over <hi>Damocles</hi> by an horse hair) is ready to drop: In brief,
men generally, great ones too, and <hi>Schollers</hi> too (as too
too many) know all this and a thousand times more,
and yet sinne, and sinne, and sinne, and make a mock
of sinne, delight in it, defend it, and them who doe it;
as if <hi>Religion</hi> were but a piece of <hi>Pageantry,</hi> and this
<hi>Holy book</hi> (the <hi>Bible</hi>) but a <hi>Romance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tell not me (any nice and curious Auditor among
you) that I might have brought hither some other subject
(not so common as this is) to have discourst of in such
an Assembly. I know I might, and confesse to you that
the commonnesse of it stuck a while with me in my
Study, and pleaded so hard, that I cast it by twice or
thrice; but it was my foolishnesse, and I could not well
be at quiet, untill I returned to it againe, being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that it was indeed one of the best and most seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
subjects in the world. And you all will say so too,
if you will but lay to heart these few things;</p>
            <p>First, there is not one Soule here (or that could be
here) but is concerned very neerly in this point, having
too often finned, presuming so to doe himselfe against
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54555:16"/>
this <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> made known to him, and also one
way or other to countenance it in others.</p>
            <p>2. Preaching and declaiming against sinne, as loud
and allow'd as it is, (and the Lord make it seven-fold
more common, and powerfull then it is) is not, neither
can be so common as committing it.</p>
            <p>3. It is that one common enemy of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth,</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> of the <hi>Creater</hi> and all his
<hi>Creatures;</hi> against which <hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,
Ministry, Magistracy,</hi> all meanes possible have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
ever since it first entred into the world; and yet
it will not yeild, but fights it out by Inches.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Lord</hi> (when it had of old over-spread all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,</hi>
and fill'd the <hi>Earth</hi> with <hi>Corruption,</hi> such as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
the very <hi>Aire,</hi> and ascended up, and stunk in his
nostrills, and caused him to repent that ever he made
such a Creature) resolved that he would wash this filth
away, or else he would wash his hands of all the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note>
and accordingly he did by the <hi>Deluge</hi> destroy all the
race of <hi>Adam</hi> (with a purpose to get rid of sinne) save
onely eight persons (the best he could pick out) whom
he kept alive to preserve a better seed to people the world
againe. And yet' (would you think it?) Sinne scap't
drowning, though the Sinners did not, that crept into
the <hi>Ark,</hi> and came out safe, and fell to work afresh, and
made ashift quickly to drown <hi>Noah</hi> himself in wine, whom
all the waters could not touch, and with that small
stock of Eight, set up, and thrived againe so fast,
that it soon recovered that ground which it had before
lost.</p>
            <p>A while after, the Lord tried it with another fierce
Element, to see if he could fire it out of a place, <hi>Raining
down fire and brim stone upon sinfull</hi> Sodome,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and burning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54555:17"/>
it to ashes,</hi> carrying out but one righteous <hi>Lot</hi> to save
alive, and yet in saving onely him, sinne enough was
saved, to fetch out of his loynes two cursed Nations,
enough to people all the world with sinners, if there had
been no more left but they: Thus did sinne (like <hi>Pauls</hi>
Viper) leap out of the fire of <hi>Sodome,</hi> it leapt upon <hi>Lot,</hi>
who could not so easily shake it off, but it stuck and
stung him. Neither Water, nor Fire have prevailed
over it, but it hath lived and reigned, and will doe (I
doubt) till the <hi>Universall Fire</hi> come down from <hi>God,</hi> and
burn the world about sinners eares.</p>
            <p>2. As for <hi>Christ,</hi> he came down in the similitude of
sinfull flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> for the nonce to <hi>destroy sinne in the flesh, to
save the sinner and slay his sinnes.</hi> He lived without,
preacht against it, prescribed antidotes to prevent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
to cure it: He raised forces, armed his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
against it, and <hi>Himselfe</hi> at last (by hanging upon the
Tree, the most sad and gastly spectacle in the eyes of
God, Angels, Men, and Devils, that ever was or shall
be seen) full of the stings of this Serpent, for his poore
sinfull peoples sake, gave thereby an incomparable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to the world, of his Fathers wrath against it; and
also at that time and encounter broke the head of it,
and yet it lives and is lively, though this was above 1600
yeares agoe.</p>
            <p>3. When <hi>Christ</hi> in his person went off the field, he
presently dispatched away the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> what to doe?
<hi>why to begin there where he had left, and to convince the
world of sinne, and of righteousnesse, and of judgement,</hi>
John 16. 8. And accordingly this good spirit of <hi>God</hi>
hath been striving, pleading, perswading, arguing,
threatning, using sinners now gently and kindly, anon
roughly and sharply:<note place="margin">Cant. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The South winde hath breathed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54555:17"/>
the North blustred, all windes blewn, and yet sinne</hi> (though
chaffe) <hi>is not winnowed out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. What shall be yet farther done? peradventure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had rather deale with <hi>Moses</hi> than with God; Man
(it may be) will heare reason from Man like himselfe:
God hath therefore gone that way to worke,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19.</note> and hath
set up the Office of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Leger-Ambassadors,</hi>
whose very businesse in the world is to <hi>Reprove, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
correct,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1</note> exhort, knowing the terrours of the Lord
to perswade men.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 11.</note> To be overseers, and watchmen. To
haunt, and follow, and cry after, and give sinners no
rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, yet further, because <hi>Ministers</hi> words may and
doe too often prove winde and be slighted; he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up, and ordained <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and given them
power from himselfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. to be <hi>Avengers of Evill,</hi>
as farre as to life it self: and ever and anon (besides all
this) he fights against sinne himselfe, even from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by Plagues, Famines, Warres, desolations of
Countryes; throwing down mighty ones (for their
mighty provocations) from their places of Dignity, and
lifting up others in their steads to try conclusions, who
have (neverthelesse) dared to succeed them, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out-sin them in their vices as well as places. And
still Iniquity abounds, and Sinne lives; <hi>Vivit, &amp; vivit,
non ad deponendam, sed ad confirmandam audaciam,</hi> as
was said of <hi>Catiline:</hi> And now therefore seeing I have
proved it, that the point I have pitcht upon is so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be preacht, suffer me to furbush it, and make it
glitter in your eyes like a sword, and let it (like that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
sword that turned every waies) move round about
this Congregation.</p>
            <p>1. In the first place I beseech you All (Saints and<note place="margin">Vses.</note>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54555:18"/>
Sinners) in the fear of God. To be more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of, and confirmed in this truth, which flesh and
bloud would faine have disputed and confuted. Keep
it as fixt and immoveable in your soules, as the Sun is
in Heaven, and let it have its influence. Oh be satisfied
concerning the true nature of Sin against God, and God
against Sin, &amp; that one Heart can never hold them here,
no more than one Heaven above. Oh good people stop
your eares, and blesse your selves from all those cursed
hellish opinions of <hi>Epicures</hi> of old, and of <hi>Atheists</hi> now
raised up afresh out of the bottomlesse pit by Rebellious
<hi>Ranters, Hectors</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> To extenuate sin, to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
for sin, yea to finde out Arguments, Providences,
Successes, to make a plea for sin, and would fain finde out
a Gospell, to reconcile (not a sinner to God, our Gospel
doth that, but) God to sin. Oh beware of the witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
(all you young Students) that is in books: take heed
of those which beat about for Arguments to gratifie the
flesh, and accommodate broken and corrupt nature; as
all <hi>Familisme, Antinomianisme, Arminianisme</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
doe: But especially that cursed devilisme of <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme,</hi>
which goes deeper into the heart of <hi>Christ,</hi> than
the Spear which let out his life-blood, and in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which, all other <hi>Heresies</hi> are but as the nailes in
his hands and feet. And which (in a word) stands more
in need of an <hi>Arraignment</hi> than any <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, be alarmd, awakned, and look about you,
all Christlesse, gracelesse, and unsanctified natures, who
have attained to more clear and distinct knowledge of
sin, and what it deserves, then these poor <hi>Heathens</hi> in my
Text, had, but no more minde, will, or power to forsake
it (though it cost you the life of your Souls) than they,
and yet have more to answer for, and for want of grace
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54555:18"/>
(the meanes of which you slight, and the worke of
which in your hearts you resist) are like (if there come
no change) to goe to Hell with this Gospell of Mercy
like a Mill-stone about your necks. Alas (my Brother)
as safe and civill as thou thinkest thy self, because of thy
ingenious nature, and well-educated Soule, Thou art ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tender to any spark of sin that falls. There is no safety
on this side of Regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man (gentle or simple,
untill God hath made him and created him a new) can
tell what kinde of sinner he himselfe shall prove ere he
dies; A <hi>Cain,</hi> an <hi>Esau,</hi> a <hi>Pharoah,</hi> an <hi>Hezael,</hi> a <hi>Iudas,</hi>
a <hi>Demas,</hi> a <hi>Iulian,</hi> an <hi>incarnate Devill.</hi> Well might
<hi>Austin</hi> say after his conversion, <hi>He would not be an
unregenerate man againe, no not for halfe an houre, for
the whole world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Is it the voice of Divine Iustice, death to every sinner,
double death to every knowing sinner?</hi> Then let me be true
to my trust, who am sent hither to be <hi>the voice of a Cryer;</hi>
Oh suffer me to cry aloud and not spare; Tremble at
your condition and station, all ye bold and impenitent
sinners, (who came in hither to judge the Sermon, and
little thought of an attachment) tremble at your fickle
hold, at your slippery standing. You cannot set your
feet upon one foot of safe ground, you are sinking every
moment, though you are not like <hi>Corah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
swallowed up in a moment; yet a little while and
you are gone. Oh how can you buy or sell, worke or
play, eat, drink, or sleep? what <hi>poppy</hi> stuffes your <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes?</hi>
what <hi>opium</hi> is in your <hi>cups?</hi> seeing you know
that Judgement sleeps not, and your Damnation slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
not. <hi>The Philistims are upon you,</hi> look about you, <hi>the
wrath of God abides upon you;</hi> it is like Fire already upon
your cloaths, which as yet you feel not, but it will burn
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54555:19"/>
through, and be at your flesh presently. Death is gone
out against you to apprehend you, and carry you away,
and why he may not doe his office at the next turning,
I know not. If you be in your sinnes, there is nothing
betwixt your Bodies and the Grave, your Soules and
Hell, but <hi>Gods Patience,</hi> and you have abused that too
much already, and cannot be sure of it a day longer;
<hi>This night, this houre</hi> your Soules are required, or as it
is in the Greek,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Luk. 12.</note> 
               <hi>They require your Soule,</hi> They? who?
Oh enough, the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi> the <hi>Devills,
tanquam satellites &amp; lictores,</hi> like so many black officers
and Serjeants, as <hi>Calvin</hi> observes in that place. O ye
distracted sinners, who feel your Consciences, (those
wormes with venomed teeth) gnawing you within (more
or lesse) when will you yeild? <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells a story of a
bold and hardy Boy, who having stolne a Fox (a live
Fox) was pursued and overtaken by the Owners,<note place="margin">In vitâ Licurgi.</note> and
whilst he was examined, he held the Fox close and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
stoutly denying the fact. The Fox gnawes, the
Boy feels and yet denies, and held it out denying, untill
the very bowells of him were pulld out and himselfe fell
downe dead before them. Such <hi>desperadoes</hi> there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, who account <hi>Confession cowardize,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
sneaking,</hi> and a <hi>tender conscience, womanish,</hi> and
will hold out and carry it high and stifly, though hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
within doe twinge and teare their hearts, and they
ready to fall down under the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>3. Oh hearken, and give me leave to expostulate (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
with all those selfe-condemned sinners, who
not onely know, and have lived to see Gods judgements
even to desolation, ruine &amp; death upon their neighbours;
have also had (as <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Stephens</hi>) some speciall hand
therein, justly it may be enough) as Magistrates, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54555:19"/>
Committees, Prosecutors, Witnesses, Juries,
Sequestrators, &amp;c. and yet live to doe the same, the
like, or worse things themselves. Oh inexcusable men,
how will you escape the righteous judgement of God?
Of a truth, nothing goes so deep with me, and makes me
horribly afraid for poor <hi>England</hi> as this [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
selfe condemnation. My Brethren, suppose the Judge
of Heaven and Earth (who stands before the door) were
this morning come down, that you saw the Court set,
the Books open, all men summoned and appearing, and
you heard such a voice as this; Set by a while all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the earth, and bring forth before me the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>England</hi> to the Barre, that Land of <hi>Mercies,</hi>
that Land of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> where a man could scarce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a sinne of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that Land of <hi>Bibles</hi> and good
<hi>Books</hi> (at such cheap rates,) that Land of rare <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi>
rich <hi>Providences,</hi> and precious <hi>Ordinances,</hi> that
Land of Vowes and Covenants of <hi>Reformation,</hi> reall,
nationall, personall. Oh how would those <hi>Magistrates,</hi>
men of Power, Place and Interest, be able to look <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> the astonisht <hi>Angels,</hi> and those grimme Ghosts
in the face (who shall cry to be their Tormentors) whom
they have punished, ruined, and cut their lives short for
those very crimes which they now doe themselves, and
farre worse? Oh my Soul! what deplorable and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
spectacles of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daring <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi>
hath this age produced! Men, who have pretended
to walke so Spiritually, as if they had no Bodies, and
yet have practised so carnally, as if they had no Soules;
Men, who have talkt as if they had cloven Tongues, yet
have walkt as if they had cloven Feet; <hi>Iamjam tacturos
sydera summa putes;<note place="margin">Ovid.</note> Iamjam tacturos Tartara nigra putes.</hi>
Sometimes they offer so fair for Heaven, as if they would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54555:20"/>
with <hi>Elijah</hi> enter it, though in the fiery-Chariot of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome:
A little after they fall like Lightning from
Heaven, as low as Earth or earthy trash, yea as low as
Hell, in plots, designes, and contrivements, as if
Satan himselfe had been their onely Tutor. And,
Secondly, where would those Ministers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
appeare? or how could they stand in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who should have been as unchangeable as the
Truth which they delivered, but yet have turned
(like the Cock on their Steeples) to every winde
that hath blown strongest; who have formerly much
declaimed against non-preaching Prelates, Prebends,
and Priests, yet now (<hi>adempto fine cessat motus</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to have the same Quinsey in their own throats; who
have heretofore accounted it (and that very justly) to
be Jesuiticall to reserve meanings, private senses,
and to equivocate, and yet have at a pinch, rather
than give out and suffer, done so themselves; who
have taken other mens livings, and quickly learned
to live their lives; who have (like thunder-clowds)
made a noise and ratled over the heads of sinners,
but yet have been as black and darke in themselves?
Gentlemen, such worke as this will come, as sure as
the Heavens are over our heads; and what will the
guilty doe at that day? Oh let us lay it to heart this
day I beseech you.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, One word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> brings my
errand to an end: Doth the Justice and wrath of
God deservedly follow, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Oh
then, my Honourable and Reverend Lords, the
Judges, and all yee Worshipfull Magistrates of
this City and County, who are solemnly met at
this time, to doe God and your Countrey what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54555:20"/>
service you can against sinne and sinners; Hearken
I beseech you to one who though he doe (like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>)
dwell in <hi>Tekoa,</hi> yet is called now to drop a
word in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and hear me of your Clemency a few
words; By your Christianity and Holy Religion, by
your high Callings and worthy Offices and professions,
by your considerable Interests and wealthy possessions,
by your experiences and what you have seen of Gods
judgements: by your ponderous Oaths and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the Judge of all men; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, if there be any sparkes of this vindictive
Justice of God in you (as there ought, and I hope
is some of that heavenly Fire in you all,) Oh let my
poor breath blow it up into a Flame, that it may blaze
out, scorch, burne and consume sin. Oh let not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
warme themselves by that Fire, which should either
refine them or burn them to ashes. You are great Trees
(trees of righteousnesse) let not any unclean Foules build
their nests in your branches, or perch themselves upon
your Armes, let not any noisome Beast or Vermine
lodge under your shadow. Shall the righteous suffer,
or the ungodly escape this day? that be farre from you
to doe on this manner. The Lord hath imparted his
very owne name to you, oh be not Idol-Gods, that have
eyes and see not, eares and hear not, hands to handle
Briars and Thornes roughly, and to pull them up,
but yet handle not. Much lesse be ye as the Gods
of the Heathens, patrons, and protectors of villany.
<hi>He that committeth sin is of the Devill,</hi> but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
connives, commands, commends it, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to punish it, is not onely of the Devill, but a
Devill, and a great one too. It was charged home and
stoutly by an Advocate once to a Judge in Germany,

<hi>cast Soule and Body into Hell fire.</hi> Oh remember what
the Lord our God hath done, hath done to unjust Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Magistrates, and what your eyes have seen.
Let none of your hearts entertaine, or tongues expresse
that vile opinion and speech of <hi>Lysander,</hi> That children
are to be cheated with Checkstones, &amp; men with Oaths.
But doe you this day remember the presence, and the
great and terrible name of the Lord our God, by which
you are sworn and shall swear, who will be avenged spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
on all that take his name in vain: Be ye holy and
just (all of you) and consider what sad offices and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(of all men) wicked and profane Magistrates and
Ministers are in. If they doe not preach against sinne,
and punish sinners, they are guilty; and if they doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Consciences, whilst they let fly against the
faces of others, their guilt (like a foul and rusty Gun)
recoyles and flyes in their owne faces. Beware therefore
that this accursed thing <hi>sinne</hi> be not in your own Tents,
as in <hi>Achans;</hi> and then look to your Sonnes, Servants,
Clerks, your <hi>Gehizies,</hi> that this Leprosie cleave to none
of them. Let not your eyes spare nor pitty, but cry out
(with <hi>Canutus,</hi> a King of the poor barbarous <hi>Vandalls,</hi>
when he was pleaded with to spare his owne Sonne,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54555:21"/>
found guilty of a capitall crime) <hi>Filio nostro sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem
crucem ponite,</hi> Make the Gallowes higher for my
Sonne, who durst break the Laws not onely of his King,
but of his Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Would you be free from the sinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Then look to your Edicts, your Warrants, your
Orders, your Licences. Let not any iniquity be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by a Law, or any thing like it. Not by a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
not by a Plea, not by a Verdict, not by a Sessions
order. Publick persons (like <hi>Briareus</hi>) have an 100
hands to doe good or evill withall. There is a <hi>Woe</hi> (and
that little word hath the whole wrath of God and Hell
in it) hang'd over the heads of them that decree unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
decrees. When <hi>Saul</hi> set <hi>Doeg</hi> to fall upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Priests, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. he had better have gone the
nearest way, and have destroyed them with his owne
hands, for then he had not been a sinner, and a sinner-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Oh beware, all you that have good heads, great
parts, acute wits, eloquent tongues, how you imploy
them. They were (among these Gentiles) their wise
men, Philosophers, Poets, Orators, that became
both practitioners and Patrons of vice, some of them
would for a fee, or in an humour, or to shew their parts,
openly defend, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: That there
was no such thing as Vertue or Vice. That Revenge,
Incest, Sodomy were but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things indifferent.
Gentlemen, Schollers, and Lawyers, better it were that
any of you had been born dumb, or Ideots, or had not
known Letters, than to prostitute your faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
parts for base gaine, (as an Harlot doth her body)
and to sell arguments to uphold, or under prop the
work of the Devill, which must, and will down, and
fall upon your heads, that doe offer to buttris up any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54555:22"/>
basenesse. Take heed Sirs, when God is the <hi>Plaintiffe,
(Iehovah litigat. Hos.</hi> 4. 1.) that none of you be <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Attorneyes, Councell</hi> or <hi>pleaders</hi> for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take heed, that you intrust not knowne
Knaves, and wicked men in any place, or office under
you, for all the Evill which they doe, will be found ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at your doores. And here I must begge leave that I
may pay my Vowes, which I made to God in my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
when I was a prisoner (some yeares agoe) in
yonder Castle, the common Jayle of this county. It
was something like that of the cheife Butler to <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
that if ever it should goe well with me and I came to be
restored to my office and liberty, and should have such
a duty and opportunity put into my Hands (as I have
now this day) I would then remember them that are in
bonds (bound Body and Soule, poore wretches) who
from the time of their Imprisonment, are commonly
made seven times more the children of wrath than they
were before: And all for want of good doctrine, good
discipline, and good example. I do verily beleive that
in that place (where the condition of men require Prayer,
and Teaching and Mortification, more then any) I saw
more drinking and fighting, and heard more swearing
and cursing, that in many a yeare abroad. Two things
(Gentlemen) would make your Jailes not to be such
Hells as they are, A godly Keeper, and a powerfull
preacher. Oh if any wealthy, worthy person would do
good and lay out a summe of money well indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He
could not thinke of a better way, than to allow a good
stipend, to keept a godly, grave, zealous Minister, not
only to preach, but even to dwell there, to be allwaies
preparing those poore creatures to live or dy better then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54555:22"/>
(I feare) they doe; The blessing of them that are ready
to perish, would light on such a Benefactour.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, One request more; Beware whom you trust
with that great (but too common) Trust and Licence of
Selling Ale and strong drinke; and of connivance at any
that are lawlesse and unlicens'd, all which I looke upon
as so many open pits and Sepulchres for men. Never
expect (so long as this deluge of drink still covers
our English earth) that ever the Arke of Gods presence
should settle, or rest amongst us. As much as men
whine and complaine of Taxes, I doe believe that there
is that drink needlesly, sinfully and shamefully guzled
away in <hi>England,</hi> which would pay the Tax thrice told,
and no man feele it. For justice and mercy sake doe
something vigorously for reforming this sinne, which
(like a <hi>Trojan</hi> horse) hath an army of sins in the bowels
of it, and now lay your Axes to the root of those rotten
trees, the signe-posts.</p>
            <p>I must give over; Seeing that sinne and wickednesse,
is that which deserves Gods judgement and eternall
death, and that this is made known to all men. Oh let
us all arme and engage against it, <hi>ye that love the Lord,
hate evill:</hi> The Lords people are not like to be all of a
minde in all things, till they come to Heaven, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
are not of this minde, are none of the Lords people.
Oh therefore, let Magistrates punish it, let Ministers
preach against it, Lawyers plead against it, Souldiers
fight against it, Scholers study, and write books against
it; all the Inke in the world is not enuogh, nor black
enough to paint it, and though the world be full of
books, yet still there are too few on this subject.<note place="margin">Dr. Reynolds.</note> One
little piece of the <hi>sinfulnesse of sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. Tho. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</note> and <hi>Aggravation of
Sinnes against Knowledge,</hi> will goe further, and doe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54555:23"/>
more good, than a whole Library of learned wranglers.
Finally, my Brethren, let us all (in the feare of God)
arise and practise against it, whilst we live, let us cry out,
<hi>Vivat Christus, Moriatur Barrabbas,</hi> Let God arise, and
sinne and sinners be scattered, and when we dye, let us
give up our ghosts with the words of <hi>Sampson, Let me
dye with these Phylistims<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Amen.</p>
