         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to attaine the ſcience of Philoſophye, Aſtrologie, Geometry or of any other like, without the ground or fyrſt principals. So without the knowledge of God the true be ginnyng and princypall of true deuynitie is impoſſible to haue any lyght of the truth neceſſary &amp; proffitable to the ghoſtly health And lykewiſe, as the knowledge of the firſt principals of one ſcience, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of all the trouthe and concluſyons that that ſcience conteineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So of the true knowledge of God, dependeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the circumſtaunces and truthe
<pb facs="tcp:4367:4"/> of Theologie or Deuinite. Wherefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much peſtiferous and deteſtable the ignoraunce of God is, and how much neceſſary the true knowledge of him is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue thought it expedient, fyrſt to conſyder what thinge God is.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt eaſy thing to know that god is, or that there is a God, ſithens that there is no Nation, ſo barbarous, but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth that there is a God, being a general knowledge that God hath ſo imprinted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if the man haue any iudgement at all, it behoueth him wyth the hart to confeſſe that there is a God. For al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit there haue bene many wicked whiche wyth their mouthes haue ſayde, there is no God. Neuertheles the ſelf ſame, when they haue fallen into any peril or neceſſity, haue bene enforced of that only light and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of god, to recommend themſelues vnto him, ſo that we muſt of force repute hym a very ydeote,<note place="margin">Pſalm. xi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And being therfore an euident and eaſy thing to know that there is a God, we muſt now trauayle to know (though it be moſt hard) to knowe what that God is. Many haue bene of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that it is impoſſible that we ſhuld i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin what god is, becauſe infiniteli aboue all proporcyons, he excedeth the weakenes

Nor it is not poſſible we ſhuld know what thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g god is not, if fyrſt we learne not to know what thing he is, and that his being is ſo perfect that it repugneth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> imperfections of thoſe thynges y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be not. Wherefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> negatiues y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ar rehearſed of god, ar grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And therfore ſpeaking of more hygh knowledge affirmatiue, that in this preſent life, the elect communly and without ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al priuiledge and miracle had of god, I ſay that fyrſt thou oughteſt to conſider that the creature hath his beinge, although imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

               <p>So is it neceſſarye that with the minde, thou firſt conſider the being of the creature
<pb facs="tcp:4367:6"/> And becauſe thou ſhalt fynde hym repleate of imperfeccion, being terminable create, temporal, corruptyble and other like, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoueth the to clenſe puryfy &amp; take from him al thoſe imperfectyons, and yma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyn him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>finite, interminable, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and in effect abſtract and lift vp aboue al imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nether yet doth that ſuffice, but alſo it is neceſſary that thou floriſh and adorne him of al perfection poſſible, in ſuch wyſe that thou conceyue to ſee him a terne neceſſary, ſimple, immutable and infinite. Neyther yet doth al that ſuffiſe, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it behoueth the with thought to pury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and clenſe of al inperfection the wyl and mynde created, the wyſdom created the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, bounty, pity, power, charitye, truthe, beauty and al the other vertues and perfec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, to which imperfectyon is contrary, and conſequently to enrich him of infinite degrees of perfection, and ſo to behold him in God as a thing purified, to be vnto him diuine and infinite. But becauſe thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers, vertues and operacyons with imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maner ruleth in vs, wyl not ſuffer our wittes to conceiue that creature in his being and to clenſe and ſpoyle him of al im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perfections, aud ſo to make him infinit, we can not in our being ſe him in God, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4367:7"/> there can be nothing imperfect, but it muſt ſuffice vs to ſe him in vertue and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci. So that albeit in gods proper being ther is the corporal viſion, the imagination, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, opinion, diſcourſes and other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eſſencially. Neuertheles it muſt ſuffice vs to ſe them in vertue and eminency. For to ſe God clerely it includeth &amp; conteineth all perfection, lyke as the gold conteyneth the perfectyon of all other metals. He then that ſeeth that diuine being with al perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſible, ſeeth what thing God is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth a ſpiritual light, mooſt pure, moſt clere, moſt ſimple and exellently fair, a terne, immutable, neceſſary and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, replete of celeſtial felicite, iuſtice power, bounty, veryte, wiſdom, mercy, cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie and of al the other perfeccions &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, infinitely perfect and that in it, in ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue and eminenci be al the colours, odours ſauoures, ſonndes, ſonges, ſwetenes, faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, honoures, dignities, treaſures, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and felicities of the world, infinitely and without proporcion, more perfect then they be of them ſelues here.</p>
               <p>And moreouer it behoueth the to knowe that the being of the creature is a ſhadow &amp; a moſt ſlyght vanite in compariſon of gods being, and the difference more. then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
<pb facs="tcp:4367:7"/> our ſhadow and our ſelues.<note place="margin">Exod, iii.</note> It is to be ſayde of God, that ſurely he is only the thinge that is. Lykewiſe I ſay of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, beauty, truth, charity, iuſtice, wiſdome and of al our other vertues, that compared to the diuine they be as moſt vaine images and ſhadowes infinitely diſtaunt from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. Alſo it behoueth to know, that god is not idel,<note place="margin">Ihon, v.</note> but that he continually worketh as (Chriſt ſaith) in ſuch wiſe, that he hathe not only geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the world his being, but alſo continually conſerueth al the thynges created, and al the vertues, that of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and ſtraunge effectes, we knowledg only God to be author and to him we geue al thankes honor and glory. So lykewyſe ought we to knowledge of him al the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effectes and operacions, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol or praiſe nature but God only, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and preſerueth the being and vertue to all thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither ought there any other chaunce or fortune to be named, but al to be confeſſed of god, and he only to be thanked euen as he continually worketh for vs. And as hys power is neuer ydel, but contynual working in al creatures. So his wyſdome continually ſeeth, diſpoſeth and ordeineth al things moſt beſt, and his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty lykewiſe continually communicateth vnto vs his be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefytes
<pb facs="tcp:4367:8"/> and graces. Furthermore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thou know that al that God hath wrought, worketh or ſhal worke in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, is al for man, for whom they be cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated and preſerued. For al the giftes and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefits that from the beginninge haue bene made or ſhalbe made to the creatures, man is bound to knowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as made to him and accordingly therfore to thancke God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And eſpecially the choſen or elect, to whom al creatures do ſerue, both the predeſtinate and reprobate.

               <p>Therfore when the Lord had created the world, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the earth to ſprynge, and the waters to bringe forthe.
