            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Societies for Reformation.</head>
            <p>THIS Title wherewith you are adorned, is so Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent
and truly Catholick, that your Request Obliged
my compliance in <hi>Preaching</hi> the following Sermon
under all the Disadvantages of a Traveler.</p>
            <p>Yet had I Conferred with Flesh and Blood, those many accurate
Discourses you have on this Subject, must have rendred my hurry
of business and want of Books, an insuperable Argument against
the <hi>Publication</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But being perswaded the <hi>Bible</hi> is not only the fittest Book to
<hi>justifie</hi> the Truth of the Duty insisted on, but attended with
greatest Authority to <hi>inforce</hi> it on the Conscience, the Censures
of the Polite for my want of other Ornaments, cannot deter me
from exposing what you think Serviceable to your good Design,
as that which I am sure is not only according to Gods Word, but
undertaken in Obedience to it.</p>
            <p>I am not ashamed the World should know how my Love for
<hi>Ireland</hi> Exalts my Joy at your Attempts, to Suppress that Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
which alone can Ruin it, and to promote <hi>Practical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which must cause its Flourishing against all Assaults: They
who less affect you, ought to be thankful for your good Success
herein, and ascribe the <hi>sudden</hi> prosperity of this Land, to Gods
Approbation of your vigorous Endeavours to Reform it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> whereby I urge all to Assist in your Blessed
Work, is too evident to be resisted by any, who account <hi>Service
to God</hi> either a Priviledge or a Duty; and next in force to that
I Published on the same occasion in <hi>London; viz.</hi> That they
who promote National Reformation are on <hi>Christ's side,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:106656:3"/>
they who neglect it are of the <hi>Devil's Party,</hi> in the Contest
managed by them as the <hi>Heads</hi> of their respective opposite
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The Consequence of your Undertaking may Excuse my <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi>
because I am under Conviction, that when you become
remiss, or altogether Unsuccessful, this Nation will be under
more than a Probable <hi>Presage</hi> of sudden Desolation, and much
severer than any that hath befallen it heretofore.</p>
            <p>If any think me too <hi>Close and Plain,</hi> Faithfulness to my Lord
whom you serve, and a peculiar regard for this Land which you
would Save, must afford the only Apology I dare make. As the
Enterprize you are Inspired to Engage in, is too fully Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by Divine and Human Laws, to be thought <hi>Unjust,</hi> and too
plainly Commanded, and Important in its Effects, to be esteemed
<hi>Indifferent;</hi> so its too <hi>contrary</hi> to Satans Interest, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Inclinations of Mankind, to be <hi>Executed</hi> without great
Fortitude, Vigor, Wisdom, Self-denial, and Union; or to keep
your Hearts <hi>by these</hi> in a fixed Disposition to <hi>persue</hi> it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rich supplies of Grace, and great Care and Labour with your
<hi>own Spirits,</hi> whence all remains of Sin are not yet expelled.</p>
            <p>Many do joyn with you in Prayer, that your fitness may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
by your work; your Resolution by your Difficulties; your
Union, by ill Designs to break it; your Success by Opposition;
and the Purity and Sedateness of your own Spirits, by all your
Endeavours to Reform others; which (among the rest) is heartily
desired by,</p>

               <signed>Your Servant in the Work of the Lord,

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Proverbs 28. ver. 4.</bibl>
               <q>They that forsake the Law praise the Wicked,
but such as keep the Law contend with
them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Text includes so full a distribution of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that none of us can be Exempted; one part
<hi>forsakes</hi> the Law, others <hi>keep</hi> it; some Praise the
Wicked, others Contend with them; some are
Wicked, others are Godly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Contrariety</hi> of what they are distinguished by, is <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream;</hi>
one Renounceth that Rule which the other Sacredly
observes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Law; the one Approves and
Commends those, whom the other Reproves and Punisheth,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Wicked. And no doubt the Difference extends
equally to what's implied, tho' not expressed, <hi>i. e.</hi> The
Good man renounceth those Lusts and Customs, which the
Wicked submit to as their Governing Law, and praiseth
the Righteous with whom the Ungodly do contend.</p>
            <p>It might seem an unaccountable Wonder, that men should
thus greatly differ in their Rules, Behaviour, Favourites
and Adversaries, were the Springs of this Contrariety alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unknown: But that Wonder will cease, when we
consider that these distinguished persons have Spirits, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Leaders, and Supream Ends and Designs, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
than their very Behaviour is: Nay, were it not for
the Unhealed remains of Sin in the Godly, and some Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Holy Ghost on the Wicked, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these men would be as great, as between Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<hi>Angels,</hi> and Apostate Devils; and when I have said
this, can any of you forbear to cry out? Oh how <hi>necessary</hi>
is Regeneration! And how <hi>great</hi> a Work must that be,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106656:4"/>
which so changeth a man from what himself once was, as
well as others!</p>
            <p>The last part of the <hi>Text</hi> I shall insist on, because it most
properly answers the present occasion. <hi>Such as keep the Law
contend with them,</hi> i. e. with the <hi>Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words give us, 1. The <hi>Character</hi> of a Good man.
2. An Instance whereby the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of that Character is
made good.</p>
            <p>I. The Character of a Good man, <hi>He keeps the Law;</hi> that
which others forsake, he sets before him as his directing
Light,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 105.</note> and a determining Rule; <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my
Feet, and a Light unto my Path.</hi> What this injoyneth, he sets
himself to observe; what it forbids, he is watchful to avoid:
He acknowledgeth the obliging force of the Will of God,
whether it be signified to him by the Light of Nature, or
positive Precepts and Institutions. He is subject to every
part as well as to any;<note place="margin">Psal 18.</note> 
               <hi>I have put away none of thy Statutes
from me:</hi> He observes it at <hi>all times</hi> as well as some, and in
<hi>Secret</hi> as well as <hi>Publick.</hi> To this he adheres against all <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi>
as well as when most Countenanced; he'l
keep it tho' all <hi>others</hi> should forsake it;<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 51.</note> yea, declineth it
not tho the <hi>Proud have him greatly in derision,</hi> for Obeying it.</p>
            <p>This Divine Law effectually prescribeth to him what he
will Believe and Profess; it Formeth his inward Temper,
Regulates his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> Words and Behaviour; hereby he
frameth his Desires, Designs and Resolves. Obedience
thereto is with him a sufficient Reason for his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
and that which his chief respect is to, in whatever
he deliberately performs.</p>
            <p>To examplifie this in his Inclinations, Affections and
Carriage, is his chief endeavour and aim; he Prays, Strives,
and industriously Contriveth and Watcheth to be <hi>compleat
in the whole will of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 4 12. Luke 1. 6.</note> and <hi>walketh in all the Commandments
and Ordinances of the Lord blameless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> wherein he is defective or offends, he seriously
blameth himself; bewails his Fault, hates his Sin, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
resolves amendment by greater Watchfulness, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106656:4"/>
more fervent Applications to Christ for the assistance of his
Spirit.</p>
            <p>He that answers this Account, keeps the Law in a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
Sence; his Obedience is Evangelical, though in many
things it be short of that which is Legal or Perfect.</p>
            <p>II. We have one Instance whereby the Sincerity of this
Character is made good: <hi>They contend with the Wicked.
q. d.</hi> The behaviour of Men towards the Wicked shews
whether themselves keep or forsake the Law. It's a plain
Characteristick, if they praise the Wicked they are Men
who forsake the Law; but if they contend with such, they
are Keepers of the Law. Whatever effectually inclines
Men to keep the Law, will compell them to contend with
the Wicked; as that which prevails with Men to forsake it
will disincline them to contend with such. It's indeed not
to be expected that such as live in Stated Rebellion against
the Will of God, should oppose the Profflgate; but it is so
decent, congruous and necessary for the Keepers of the
Law to oppose the Wicked; and therefore to be expected
that God sets it down as a fixed distinguishing property of
such, <hi>They contend with the Wicked.</hi> You'l find them thus
employed against violent Transgressors, and thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated
from them.</p>
            <p>I shall in some few Positions explain the Words, and
thereby come to state that Observation, which will more
directly support you in the work of Reformation, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
your engaging therein.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Keeping the Law is a fit Description of the Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Servants of the Living God, and such are intended
thereby.</hi> The Servants of God are variously denominated,
as Men fearing God, Lovers of God, Believers, Saints,
Godly, Righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all these Titles center in, and
refer to this in the Text. <hi>They keep the Law.</hi> For this Law
is the measure of all Goodness, all true Excellency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and all Regularity of Practice do lye in a Conformity
to this Rule. This perfect Law appoints all that's truly
good; and all that is accepted with God is done with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106656:5"/>
of Obedience to this Will of his: Whatever justly
bears the name of any Grace or Virtue, must be answerable
to what this defineth to be such a Grace or Virtue; or it is
no better than an Hypocritical Image. Moreover, the
<hi>Truth</hi> of the highest Graces must be adjudged by their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
Efficacy to the Obedience of this Law: <hi>Faith</hi>
without this is dead;<note place="margin">James 2. 20.</note> and our Saviour determines the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of <hi>Love</hi> in this manner: <hi>If you love me, keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jab. 14. 15.</note>
Yea, his Apostle faith, <hi>This is Love that we
walk after his Commandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Joh. 6.</note> Not that this is the formal
notion of Love, but it is such a necessary Effect of it,
that it is no true Christian Love which is too weak to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Obedience.</p>
            <p>Now who is a <hi>Keeper</hi> of the Law? none but he who
hath renounced his own Will and Humour, and is resigned
to the Divine Will, the Language of whose Heart is,
<hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And is this any other
than a <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of the Living God;<note place="margin">Act. 9. 6.</note> even one
who hath freely accepted God in Christ for his Supream
Lord and Law-Giver, upon which his Relation of Servant
and Subject is founded: But doth this Devotedness confine
it self to a meer <hi>Profession</hi> of Obedience, however Solemn
it be? no, there must be real <hi>Performance</hi> to make that
good: <hi>His we are whom we Obey.</hi> But this may suffice to
Evidence that to keep the Law,<note place="margin">Rom 6. 16.</note> and to be God's faithful
Servants and Subjects, are equipollent Terms.</p>

Crimes; Crimes which infect others, defile the Land,
and stigmatize the Offender: of which sort are Idolatry,

3. <hi>Contending with the wicked, imports all just and due me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to repel the wickedness of Transgressors.</hi> The difference
between good and bad men is fixed, each Pleads his respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

Propagates his own Likeness, and Abets his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of his Subjects, in opposition to Satan and his Followers:
<hi>Satan</hi> as the Head of the Apostacy employs his Followers,
in opposition to Christ and his <hi>Reforming</hi> purposes:<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 38.</note> Great
is the contradiction, and the contest Vehement and Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
The Wicked are intent to restrain the Godly from
adhereing to the Laws of Christ their Soveraign, and hence
Violence and Persecution have their rise: On the other
hand, the Subjects of Christ endeavour to stop the Deluge
of Impiety; they Reason, Exhort, Pray, and live down
Immoralities; these do what they can to Reform the World,
as the others struggle to Pervert it. They would rejoyce
that their Instructions and Intreaties were successful to
reclaim the Profligate; but when these avail not, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

the Sinner to accept of thy reproof: You must tell

               <hi>I pray you Brethren do not so wickedly;</hi>
the despised reprover must not Usurp the Sword of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
but grieve at the abominations he wants Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

the Law of the Land takes no Cognizance of, when other
Crimes be punishable by its Institutions.</p>
            <p>2. Answ. <hi>But verbal reproof will not be sufficient, where

               <hi>An evil man seeketh only Rebellion,
therefore a cruel Messenger shall be sent against him;</hi> and this
private persons should do by complaints to such as are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized

it cannot be executed:<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 5.</note> therefore as the declaring of

            </p>
            <p>Having made it plain that <hi>such as keep the Law</hi> is a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis
of the Servants and Subjects of the living God; and
that the <hi>Wicked</hi> here, are such as are found committing
gross Crimes; also that <hi>contending</hi> includeth severe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as well as reproof by words. I am sure the Text is a
sufficient ground for this Observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Such as would approve themselves the Subjects and
Servants of the living God, ought, nay, will by just severities as
well as reproof, endeavour the Reformation of notorious Offenders.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine enlarged and altered into other words, is
the same as to say; He whose heart is right with God, will
(in this Nation where good Laws are Enacted against wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness)
not only Reprove, but duly Convict and bring to
Legal punishment, such as he finds to be Cursers, Swearers,
Profaners of the Lords-day, Whore-mongers, Drunkards,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he will not forbear this for fear of shame, let who will
reproach him; he'l do it, tho' his Trade be in danger, and
his Person threatned and exposed.</p>
            <p>The Text as before explained, is a sufficient proof of the
Doctrine, but sad experience acquainting us, how much
harder it is to prevail with people to do what is their Duty,
than to prove it to be so; I shall not only add some further
Evidence for this Duty from the Argument, included in the
Doctrine, but endeavour to plead that Argument with
your Consciences, that if possible I may bring such to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the Reformation of others, who have hitherto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
it, and invigorate the hearts of those who have
therein so laudably engaged.</p>
            <p>Can any Argument be likelier than this to perswade
all Men to use due ways to reform Offenders you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
appear the real Servants of Christ, if you omit it?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106656:7"/>
Will any thing so compel such to this Work who think
they are his Servants, as a demonstration that you have
not the temper nor Spirit of his Servants, but are meer
Hypocritical Pretenders if you neglect it? And how can
such who are his faithful Servants be so excited to Zeal for
this Work, as by convincing Evidence, that if you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
you <hi>so far</hi> offer violence to the <hi>Instincts</hi> of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Nature; you disregard the <hi>Honour</hi> and Interests of
your Blessed Lord; you frustrate the design of that <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to which you are admitted? you counter-act the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Dispositions of all who are sincerely <hi>devoted</hi> to God's
Service; you desert the <hi>Party</hi> to which you are united;
you favour <hi>Satan</hi> and his Cause whom you have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
and neglect that real <hi>Felicity</hi> which you are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to persue? Now if such considerations remove
not your Indifferency, and secure you not against Fear and
Idleness in this great Design, what will?</p>
            <p>All these Motives will occur, but the great Argument I
shall more directly insist on is that which the Doctrine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to us, <hi>viz. That none approve themselves the Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God who do not endeavour the Reformation of notorious
Offenders.</hi> As for the other Point, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
must be by <hi>Severities</hi> as well as by Reproof, or mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ways; I think already proved, and therefore shall less
enlarge on that.</p>
            <p>Now, my well-beloved Friends! would not you be found
among the Loyal Subjects and Faithful Servants of your
Creator and Redeemer? Yea, do not all of you profess to
be so? Now God's Challenge as to this forementioned Case,
as well as others, is strict, <hi>If I be a Master, where is my Fear,
if I be a Father, mhere is my Honour?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> If I be your <hi>Master,</hi>
shew it by pleading my Cause against Transgressors; by
that Service shew I am indeed your Lord, and you my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi>
the time is hastening when all disguises will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, and God shall make an apparent <hi>Difference</hi> between
such as serve him in Reality,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 18.</note> and such as put him off with
meer pretence; therefore be now willing to endure such
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106656:7"/>
Convictions from his Word as he will fasten by his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
when he comes to Judge your State by this as the
<hi>Rule of Judgment;</hi> Let no Soul guilty as to this very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of reforming others, vainly support his pretence to God's
Service; for if you live in a stated neglect of resisting Sin,
and endeavours to reform the Wicked, you are not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God's: If you omit this, whatever you call your
selves, you do want the great Essentials which constitute
the Temper, Disposition and Behaviour of those who are
God's Servants in reality: This will appear if you consider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>You have not a true Zeal for God's Honour.</hi> Can any of
you doubt whether a Man can be God's Servant who hath
no Zeal for his Glory? whereas if you know any thing of
Religion, you must acknowledge that the Glory of God is
the <hi>Chief End</hi> of every good Man; and to that it's impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be indifferent. I must have a Zeal for my Chief
End, and when that's exposed, I cannot but resent it, and
endeavour its Vindication and Security with great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of mind.</p>
            <p>Now wherein is God more dishonoured than By open
flagitious Crimes? His Sacred <hi>Name</hi> is despised by common
Oaths: his <hi>Vengeance</hi> plaid with by Curses? his <hi>Day</hi> pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
by prophaning the Sabbath; the <hi>Authority</hi> of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God and of his Laws, are trampled on by these and
other open Sins. When Men dare <hi>declare their Sins as Sodom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 3. 9.</note>
they bid defiance to his Government, they slight his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
they condemn his Precepts as unjust, they contemn
his promised Rewards as Trifles, they openly avow the
Empire of the Devil, they justifie Man's Apostacy in the
view of the World, and to their power they rase out the
Divine Image, and shut out the Spirit's Operations which
would, if complied with, produce in the Soul those <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses</hi>
of God's Perfections, wherein he is most properly
Glorified.</p>
            <p>And can any one who serves and loves his God forbear
to oppose this? Must not the Zeal of all such kindle as
<hi>Phineas?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106656:8"/>
the Laws, and assert the Government of his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Benefactor and Ruler.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If you neglect the reforming of others you shew no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
or love to the Souls of Sinners.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> Love to our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
is one half of God's Law; our Neighbour's Soul is his
better part, and therefore its benefit is to be most attended
as an Evidence of the Sincerity of that Love to him, which
our Lord requires in his Servants. Moreover, Love to
Men is an Essential part of Godliness, for wherein are we
like God who is <hi>Love,</hi> if Love be a Stranger to us? Nor
can any thing be a grosser contradiction than to pretend
Subjection to Christ, and yet renounce Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
And no less irreconcilable would it be to love Men,
and yet suffer them to destroy themselves if we are capable
to prevent it by stopping their self-ruining course, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to consider. When persons openly commit their
horrid Villanies <hi>their Sins go before hand to Judgment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 24.</note> And
can you with any face profess to love such Men whiles you
tamely endure them to proceed for want of a Warning by
Reproof, or fixing that Warning by Punishment when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
is ineffectual? In which last case, <hi>Ah, be thou reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Penal Restraint,</hi> is no more an Evidence of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Love than <hi>Ah, be thou Cloathed</hi> when Garments are deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It's no light matter to be accessary to the Damnation
of Souls, and be sure there is a secret Enmity in you against
them, whose case requires your utmost pity, and yet it will
not move you to do what you can towards their Salvation,
no not to assist the Magistrate to inflict those Penalties
which may bring Offenders to themselves.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>If you neglect Reformation-work, you have not a just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the Welfare of the Community.</hi> A Man truly Devoted
to God will <hi>serve his Generation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13. 36.</note> a publick Spirit inspires
him, and a common Good is dearer to him than his own
particular Affairs:<note place="margin">Psal. 137. 6.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> is their Pattern when he saith, <hi>If
I prefer not</hi> Jerusalem <hi>above my chiefest Joy, let my Right Hand
forget her Cunning.</hi> The Servant of God is so far under the
power of Self-Denial, as to esteem the Welfare of the Body
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106656:8"/>
of his People, in it self preferrable to his own: and less
than this cannot be inferred, as the meaning of the words
of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> to whatever Transport you assign their
Wishes.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> Now it's impossible to have a publick Spirit, and
not strive to reform the Wicked; because a general Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is much promoted by unsubdued Vices, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good greatly depends upon Reformation. This will
appear if you consider how far,</p>
            <p>1. Uncontrouled Vices do corrupt a People.</p>
            <p>2. Unreformed Vices expose a Nation to Judgments.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Uncontrouled Vices do corrupt a People.</hi> Evil Examples
infect and ensnare; and where Sin goes unpunished it spreads
the faster, because it appears so innocent a thing as not to
deserve Correction. How violently will Men be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those Crimes whereto degenerate Nature inclineth, when
they find all seem to approve of them, because none call
the most notorious Offenders to account? The Torrent of
Impiety must rise in that place, where many allure and none
rebuke it. But surely the <hi>best Men</hi> in such a Region must be
base, selfish and cowardly; it can never agree with a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirit to fit still when you see the Plague to spread, a
Plague which so defileth, enslaveth, debaseth, disordereth,
and perverts your Countrymen and Fellow Citizens: All
which is fulfilled by the Immoralities which are unrepelled
by Punishments</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Unreformed Vices expose a Nation to Judgments.</hi> Gross
Transgressions are called <hi>Crying</hi> Sins, because they cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
to Heaven for desolating Punishments: where these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
the Lord will avenge. This righteous Governour of
the World will not suffer <hi>Proclaimed</hi> Wickedness to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
no not where his Worship is frequented; yea, he
is surer to visit his professing people than any other, for
their Abominations.<note place="margin">Am. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>You only have I known of all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
Calamities hang over that place where Rebellion is
committed against God; and certainly he whose Quiver is
so full of destructive Arrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be at a loss how to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106656:9"/>
fit all Ranks of Men with Judgments, of which they shall
be <hi>sensible,</hi> and against which they cannot <hi>preserve</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>But can any of you imagine that you are concerned for
the good of your Nation, and not divert its Misery by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
those Sins which do procure it? All care for the
Community is extinct when you do as good as say, I will
not be at the least pains or trouble to make them a Holy
and a Happy People: I'll not cast in my Mite to prevent
their Defilement or Destruction: Such <hi>Gallios</hi> are unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as well as Unchristian. Pretend not Inability, for each
of you may do something, at least you are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
against obstinate Sinners; and if you can do no more
towards saving the Land, this will acquit you, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
whereas if you omit this little you can do, you
would not advance Reformation had you the greatest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
for that selfish, base, careless, cowardly Spirit would
<hi>then</hi> restrain you from this good Work as well as now.</p>
            <p>I might have added the greatness of those Benefits which
Reformation secures to a Land, every one whereof makes
thy neglect in promoting that Reformation a great instance
of thy Unconcernedness for the Publick. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>If you neglect National Reformation, you have not that
true regard to your own Happiness which rational Self-love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects.
Carnal</hi> Self-love destroys Mankind, but <hi>Rational</hi> Self-love
is that Principle by which God governs this World,
and on which he grafteth Grace it self: This God owneth
himself the Author of, and never separates his Service from
our aim at our own Happiness, but requires the pursuit of
<hi>both</hi> these together: Nor indeed can we attain the one
without the other, for if we truly glorifie God in a way
of Service, we shall be happy; and if ever we be happy,
it must be by serving him who is Glorified in our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I think its needless to spend words to prove that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve God acceptably, unless you love your selves; nor
that you love not your selves if you disregard your own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106656:9"/>
happiness; the thing most likely to be doubted by rational
Creatures, is, that you despise your own Happiness, if you
neglect National Reformation; yet this you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of, when you lay to heart.</p>
            <p>1. That you contract much Guilt by your neglect, to Reprove
and Rebuke great Sinners in order to their Reformation.</p>
            <p>This is part of that Divine <hi>Law,</hi> which the Servants of
God are obliged to keep: He hath set this upon your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
as part of your <hi>Duty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt not suffer Sin on
thy Brother, but thou shalt rebuke him.</hi> And we are enjoyned
to <hi>reprove the unfruitful Works of Darkness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 11.</note> Must not Guilt
lie on that Man who lives in the Stated Omission hereof?
Moreover, if thy Grace be true, thou dost not only vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
plain Precepts, but Guilt is aggravated, because thou
offerest violence to the <hi>Instincts</hi> of a regenerate Nature;
for that prompts thee to testifie against Sin from a Divine
<hi>Antipathy,</hi> and excites thee to make Men better from those
Holy Propensions which render Goodness amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
wherever it may be found.</p>
            <p>Guilt thus aggravated, attending the neglect of National
Reformation, where is he that truly serves the Lord, who
dares contract it, and make himself partaker of other Mens
Crimes by sinful Connivance? Or can a Man of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
sit easie under this Guilt from day to day? Is it a
small thing to have God to charge you with a disregard to
his Interest; and to say concerning you, Here's one who
professeth himself of my <hi>Army,</hi> but will not strike a stroak
for me: He prays <hi>Thy Name be Hallowed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> but dares not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with open Blasphemers: <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> yet suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Satan</hi> to Empire it without Controul: <hi>Thy Will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> and yet allows my Laws to be
openly trampled on, without so much as a Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the most hainous Transgressor.</p>
            <p>Great Rebukes from Heaven may well be expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as this Accusation belongs to; nor could you
arraign God's Justice, if you and your Children should be
given up to be Infected with those Abominations you will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106656:10"/>
not reprove: Yea, must not you and your Families eepxct
a deep share in those Miseries you refused to prevent?
Nay, should God make the Land happy upon its Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by other Instruments, may not you fear that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you nor your Families should be Sharers in that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You loose great Benefits for your selves and Posterity which
endeavoured Reformation would Entail.</hi> If Desolation comes on
this unreformed Land,<note place="margin">Ez. 9. 41. Gen. 6.</note> notwithstanding thy lost Labour,
thou mayest hope to be <hi>Marked</hi> for Deliverance; for we
see <hi>Noah</hi> who strove to reform the old World saved from
the Common Deluge with his Family; and grieved <hi>Lot</hi>
with his Children escaped the Flames of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will it be a light matter if Sin should still abound
and Judgments ensue, that these quieting thoughts will pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
thy mind, Could I have reformed and saved this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I would have done it: my Conscience bears me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that I to my utmost have endeavoured to put a stop
to those Impieties that procured these Woes which now so
distress my Country. But if Virtue should spring up and
Wickedness hide the head, how happy wilt thou find thy
self in having <hi>contributed</hi> thereto?<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 136.</note> those <hi>Tears</hi> which stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the view of heinous Sins, will be turned into the
truest <hi>Joy</hi> and Gladness: Gladness to see Sabbaths Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which used to be Prophaned; the Name of God Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a Sacred Reverence instead of Oaths or Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and Sobriety and Temperance obtaining in the room
of Debauchery and Excesses.</p>
            <p>How will it revive thy years to see the Blessed Effect
of this change of things? when Peace, Prosperity, Love,
Health, the Success of the Ministry, and a Harmony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all sorts and degrees of Men, shall joyntly witness
God's Approbation of a <hi>Reformed</hi> People! Thy own <hi>Graces</hi>
will improve by the good Examples such a state of things
affords, and those pourings out of the Spirit which it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth:
thou wilt be free from the <hi>Dread</hi> of Impending
Judgments, and instead thereof live in the chearful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106656:10"/>
of publick Good; nay, how comfortable will it be
when thou <hi>diest,</hi> to behold an Entail of Helps to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Happiness of thy Posterity? These things may
well convince us, that such as neglect National Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
disregard their <hi>own Happiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I need insist on no other <hi>Mediums</hi> to prove that
none keep the Law who contend not with the Wicked, or
which is the Sence of that; <hi>None are the true Servants of
God who oppose not Sin, and endeavour not the Reformation of
notorious Sinners.</hi> This you must allow to be beyond
dispute, unless you can think him a faithful Servant of
God who hath no true Zeal for God's Honour, no real
Compassion or Love to Souls, no due Concern for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
nor true Regard to his own Happiness, or to that
of his Posterity. It follows therefore that you must <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi>
that name, or engage your selves in resisting Sin,
and promoting the Reformation of others by all just means;
and know, that your assuming that <hi>Name unjustly</hi> will no
more avail you than if it were renounced; and if you are
not the Servants of God in <hi>Reality,</hi> the Priviledges of such
belong not to you; nay, you are the Slaves of the Devil
and the Servants of the Flesh; and oh! how miserable
will the Portion of such be found at last?</p>
            <p>I shall apply this truth, 1. <hi>Particularly</hi> to the Societies
for Reformation. 2. More <hi>generally</hi> to all who hear me.</p>
            <p>1. To such as are Members of the Societies for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or any way engaged in this great Work. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Encouragement,</hi> nor may a word of Advice be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
needless: What I judge proper to you, will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under two Heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Make light of the discouragements which attend the Work
of National Reformation.</hi> What you have heard may vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
you from Reproach, and Steel you against Fears.
Can that be called <hi>busie meddling</hi> by which you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your selves the Servants of the Living God,
and fill up your place as such for God's Glory and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good? or should any call you <hi>severe</hi> when you stop
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106656:11"/>
Men from destroying themselves and Nation? Can any
wonder that reproachful <hi>Lies</hi> pursue you in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize?
or be so imprudent as not allow for it when you
thus disturb the Kingdom of the Devil, stem a Tide of
Wickedness to which Nature is so prone, and contend
with a Multitude who by long custom have become too
licentious to scruple either what they <hi>say</hi> or do. Need you
<hi>fear</hi> your Opposers? when you see <hi>what</hi> their contest is for,
even Vices reproved by the Light of Nature.<note place="margin">1. Joh. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and Works
the Lord Jesus came to destroy.</hi> And <hi>who</hi> they are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with you, even no other than the <hi>Wicked,</hi> who make
God their Enemy by breaking his Laws; who espouse the
Cause of <hi>Satan</hi> against that of Christ's, and when awaken'd
will <hi>Condemn</hi> their own Follies, and approve of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints.</p>
            <p>Ought you to <hi>despond</hi> as if too seeble to <hi>carry on this</hi>
Work? When you have Christ and all Men of true pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirits on your side; when your Attempts are sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>good Laws;</hi> when you are blessed already with so
considerable <hi>Success;</hi> and the Cause is God's, in whose
Power are the Hearts of all Men.</p>
            <p>Dare you be so impressed by Discouragements as to <hi>cease</hi>
this Divine Work! when it is so <hi>Noble</hi> in it self, so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
the Care of the Almighty, so certain of Success at
last, so Glorious in its Rewards, and your time so short to
labour or suffer before you wear the Crown. I joyn with
my Brethren in bidding you <hi>be of good Courage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 41. 6.</note> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on God's Protection, which hath hitherto so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that as <hi>yet you have not resisted unto Blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> 
               <hi>striving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Manage this Reforming Work as will most tend to its Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</hi>
To this end, keep far from the Evils you do rebuke
in others. Convince by good Examples such as you inforce
by Penalties. Watch your Temper and Words, that you
give no cause of stumbling to those with whom you contend.
Let your Contests be with Men as <hi>Wicked,</hi> and not from
By-respects; let it be without Partiality with <hi>all</hi> whom
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106656:11"/>
you find obstinately Wicked. Use <hi>Prudence</hi> as well as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in all your Undertakings; therefore never exceed
the Laws, neither accuse any whom you cannot fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict:
Make it appear to the Criminal that it's sence of
Duty, and not a meddling Temper; it's a design of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Sinners, and not Enmity, Cruelty or Selfish Ends
which encline you to get them punished. Finally, be
Humble, Modest and Watchful; fairhfully Reform to the
<hi>utmost</hi> of your Power, and back all your Attempts with
fervent <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for his Conduct, Success, and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>2. I shall now address my self more <hi>Generally</hi> to all who
hear me, and contract the Improvement of this Truth to
two Heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Love and readily submit to Reforming Means.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Am. 5. 10.</note> I wish too
many are not guilty of <hi>hating him who reproveth,</hi> whereas
such a Man is your best Friend, for he exposeth himself
to <hi>pluck you as a Brand out of the Burning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 23.</note> He spends his
time, and adventures your Indignation, to keep you from
destroying your self and others. It's great folly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the <hi>Flatterer</hi> who serves his own turn, and to abhor
a <hi>Reformer</hi> who is intent on your truest Interest.</p>
            <p>Be also willing to <hi>amend your ways and doings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 5.</note> Tremble
lest you be in their number who hate and refuse to be
Reformed. How sad is it to be fond of your ugliest <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,</hi>
and unwilling to be delivered from your Mortal
<hi>Disease!</hi> Whatever mistaken Conceits possess you, it's your
<hi>Shame you glory in;</hi> it's Self-ruin you are so resolved on,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note>
and your obstinate Adherence to your vitious Courses is
no other than desperate <hi>Madness;</hi> the Considerate do now
esteem it so,<note place="margin">Pro. 1. 28.</note> and in a while it will be confessed such by
your selves. God is now essaying your Amendment by
exciting his <hi>Servants</hi> to reprove and punish your Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
for this you will be accountable as well as for all
his other Methods of Conversion. Whiles he strives there's
hope of thy reclaiming; but know, he numbers the days
of his Patience, and the means by which he would cleanse
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106656:12"/>
thee; and if thou still resist, he will give thee up to thy
Lusts, and soon destroy thee as incorrigible, <hi>because I have
Purged thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and thou wast not Purged; thou shalt not be Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
any more from thy Filthiness until I have caused my Fury
to rest upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh then that you would strive to obey all the ways
whereby God instructs you! Engage your minds to seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Consideration,</hi> that so things may be represented in a
true Light, and with that pressing Weight as to <hi>affect</hi> you
suitably to their Nature; then it may be expected that you
will be willing to part with the Abominations, which you
dare not <hi>justifie</hi> on a Death-bed. I charge you in the Name
of that God who is your <hi>Owner,</hi> and will be your <hi>Iudge,</hi>
that you love not what he abhors; that you venture not
on what he so plainly, seriously and oft forbids; and that
you be not such <hi>Fools as to make a mock at those Sins</hi> which
will render you infinitely more miserable,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 9.</note> than all the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of God or Man <hi>in this Life</hi> can make you. In
a word, blush that your Lusts should ever be so loved as
to make you content to suffer any thing upon their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and now apply your selves to Christ for liberty
from that Thraldom, wherein your Vice restrains you;
that so the good Laws of Men may not be a Terror, nor
God an Enemy.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let your Reformation extend beyond those Sins the Laws
of the Land take Cognizance of.</hi> The Law of God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>adequate</hi> Rule of Reformation;<note place="margin">1 John 3. 4.</note> whatever is a <hi>Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this is Sin,</hi> though Humane Laws should command it,
or think it too trivial to be forbidden. Therefore study
God's Law in the Extent and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of it, and frame
your Lives by no lower a Rule. Watch against <hi>inward Sins</hi>
which the Eyes of Man discern not,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>for God will judge the
Secrets</hi> of the Heart, and Eternally punish many <hi>Civil</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for their <hi>Heart</hi> Unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Malignity and Impenitency.
Amend also those <hi>outward Faults</hi> of which Magistrates take
no notice; they restrain gross Affronts to the Divine Being,
and such things as disturb Human Societies. But be you
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106656:12"/>
convinced that God's <hi>Penal Sanctions</hi> extend to whatever
himself hath forbidden; and it's at thy utmost Peril if thou
repent not of thy Lies, thy neglect of God's Worship in
thy Family and Closet, thy covetous Griping, thy conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Knaveries, thy Levity and Backbiting, thy waste of
time, thy inordinate Passions, and the like. <hi>My Brethren!</hi>
God will reprove <hi>all these</hi> as well as those Crimes which
the Laws of the Land do punish: therefore <hi>these</hi> must be
Conscientiously forsaken as ever you desire a saving Interest
in God's Covenant, or would avoid Eternal Destruction
from the presence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Take therefore your measure from <hi>God's Statute-Book</hi> (the
Bible) and not only from Man's. Oh live! and be what
that appoints, for God will vindicate his own Authority,
and be <hi>sincerely</hi> regarded in whatever he hath made to be
the Duty of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Finally, be not content to abstain from the Sins forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Divine Law, but <hi>strive to obtain and exercise the
opposite Graces and Virtues which it commandeth;</hi> for negative
Goodness will not suffice to save any person capable of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in what the Statutes of God enjoyn as our Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Employ: Therefore let your Habitual <hi>Frame</hi> and
constant <hi>Exercise</hi> discover that the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precepts do
as effectually direct your Temper and Practice, as the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
Precepts do restrain them.<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 17</note> 
               <hi>Learn to do well</hi> as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as you <hi>cease to do evil:</hi> I shall conclude with a few
<hi>Motives</hi> to excite you both to reform your <hi>selves,</hi> and to
endeavour the Reformation of <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Remember your late Troubles, and retain their Voice.</hi>
Can you forget what you so lately felt, as the effect of
your former Sins? What Poverty accompanied such as fled,
what Frights, Losses and Anguish poffessed them as staid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind!
You felt much, and were in the highest danger of
undergoing more. Oh! will you not Reform those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities
which provoked a Merciful God to disarm you,
and leave you naked in your Enemies Hands? Were their
Insults and Threatnings so agreeable as to leave no Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106656:13"/>
Had your Dangers no Voice because they are past?
Know you not that it was owing to <hi>Providential Restraints,</hi>
and not to your Power, or the good Will of many of your
Foes, that you were not Butchered, and your Infants tof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
on Pikes as formerly? And can you be so <hi>stupid</hi> as to
think God called you not to Reformation when he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
you to the Brink of Ruine for former Sins? or that
your past Calamities do not remain a <hi>lively Caution</hi> against
persisting in those Sins? Must not you be <hi>Infatuated,</hi> if
you reassume the Crimes you were so lately convinced of;
and be horridly <hi>ungrateful,</hi> if you repeat them because your
dangers are removed by his goodness whom you had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 9.</note>
He is profane who acknowledgeth not Gods design
by all you felt or feared, <hi>was to take away your Sin:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be so regardful of God, and so wise for your selves,
as to say,<note place="margin">Ezr. 9. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Should we again break thy Commandments, wouldst not thou be
angry with us till thou hast consumed us; so that there should be
no Remnant or Escaping?</hi> Resolve then, we will not commit
those Evils, nor <hi>suffer</hi> others to repeat those Abominations,
against which God so plainly testified in the Distresses we
<hi>lately</hi> suffered.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Consider the Signal Deliverances God hath wrought, and
the amazing Prosperity to which you are so soon arrived;</hi> he
is blind and base Spirited, who owns not that Ireland <hi>was
saved by the Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 29.</note> Review the strength of the Enemy, and
Disadvantages of your Friends: Was it of man that Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Feeble exposed <hi>London-derry</hi> was preserved against so
formidable an Host? Or that such a multitude of well
Equipped Souldiers were Routed by a few undisciplin'd
<hi>Enniskillen men?</hi> Was not God seen in the amazing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of those Weak, Ill provided, Diseased Forces with
Duke <hi>Schomberg?</hi> Was it not <hi>the Lord's doing</hi> that our
<hi>King</hi> fell not by that Cannon Ball which wounded his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
And that he obtained a Victory under such great
disadvantages at the <hi>Boyn?</hi> Was it not our God that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>this City</hi> from being Burnt by the enraged Enemy, at
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106656:13"/>
his Return? How near was all to be lost again at <hi>Athlone,</hi>
if God had not Infatuated the Enemy to leave the Works of
that Town undemolished, and so afford a Defence for our
Forces that had passed the River, who must otherwise
have been cut off by that far superior Strength, which the
Enemy brought down upon them? Who can deny God
the Honour of Guiding that Bullet which cut off St. <hi>Ruth</hi>
when he was directing the Guarding of that Advantagious
Pass, where our Forces without a Miracle must have been
destroyed?</p>
            <p>All must see the <hi>Arm of God was made bare</hi> for your help;<note place="margin">Isa 52. 10.</note>
he dispirited, Divided, and Infatuated the Enemy, and this
apparently and often. And can you be so <hi>vile</hi> as to think
God did all this that you might commit Abominations? that
you might return to you Vomit? and commence a new
Rebellion against himself?</p>
            <p>Moreover, you <hi>sudden healing</hi> is as signally the Lord's
doing as your very safety; who could imagin you should
in so few years be so fully peopled; your Stocks so Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
your Houses Built; your Trade Revive; your Rents
Advanced; the Ordinances of God Restored, and all things
flourish so as to make you the Objects of Envy.</p>
            <p>How can you persist in provoking a God so great, and
sinning against a God so merciful and kind? Hath he
done all this to make you capable of Offending him more,
or to oblige you in Gratitude to Reform? Sure, <hi>Rom. 2. 4.</hi>
his goodness leads to Repentance; therefore Magistrates
should resolve, and all Assist them to do as, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33.
Josiah <hi>took away all the Abominations out of all the Countries,
and made all that were present to serve the Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. You may Humbly and Mournfully Confess, <hi>there's
much to be Reformed; notwithstanding all the evil you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and the good you receive.</hi> God might well expect that
a people so Smitten and strangely Saved, should be very
peculiar in their Walk, and Devout in their inward Frame.
But alas, is it not far from this with many, with most!
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106656:14"/>
How much open Profaness (which the Laws discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance)
doth still abound! Oaths may be heard, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
seen in your Streets; the <hi>Strand</hi> and other places,
witness how Sabbaths are Unsanctified; stupid is he that
cannot wonder to behold such a return to Sin, after such
Shakes, Desolations, Terrors and Deliverances. But were
Provocations confined to the Mockers at serious Religion,
the Aggravation were less: But alas, many who profess
strictness, and expect Eternal Happiness in Gods Service,
are corrupted, and forsake the <hi>Law of our God;</hi> many such
are drowned in the <hi>World,</hi> as if Heaven had not room in
your Hearts; you <hi>Match</hi> your Children without regard to
Grace, as if you cared not tho' the Devil had their Souls;
you neglect God's Worship in your <hi>Families,</hi> as if your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the Curse that hangeth over such, <hi>Jer. 10. 25.</hi> You
are <hi>Proud</hi> and Vain as if you would vye with the world in
its fashion; you are <hi>Extravagant</hi> as if you had never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any thing, or were never in danger of loosing all; nay
as if this were not enough, I hear some Professors and
Church-Members are grown so loose, as to frequent and
plead for those Nurseries and Schools of Wickedness, the
<hi>Play-houses,</hi> places the Devil claimeth as his own, by his own
account when he was dispossessed of one, he entred into
there, saying, <hi>What had she to do on my Ground;</hi> places the
Visible Saints of all Sects account scandalous and Ministers
of all Professions wrote against. What have many ascribed
your Debaucheries and Ruin to, more than these? and can
you Encourage such by your presence, when your awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Consciences must tell you at least on your Sick Beds,
Wretched I that time was unredeemed which I spent there;
Oh that I could recall it! it was the gratifying my vitious
vain Heart, which brought me there, and now I feel my
Guilt! There are other more inward faults to be amended,
which I must leave to your own Consciences; as decays
in Grace; loss of your first Love; formalities in Duties;
yet these are great Faults, and will produce bitter Fruits if
Unreformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106656:14"/>
4. <hi>You are but upon Trial in all that Prosperity you now enjoy,
and far from being out of the reach of Danger;</hi> you have no
Lease of it, that is not Forfeitable, and God tries you how
you will carry it, and speaks to delivered <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Joh. 5.
14. Sin no more least a worse thing do befall thee;</hi> God can
strike again, your Enemies are not Dead, nor your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
Impregnable; former Sins which you may commit
may bring your former Woes: Say not Profanely as they
<hi>Is. 9. 9, 10.</hi> least he say as <hi>ver. 11.</hi> how easily can God
scatter you again, if you Sin again; how soon can God take
away the Life of the <hi>King,</hi> upon whom so much depends
of your Safety! Your Unreformedness after such methods
looks like a sad presage, that God's Sword will yet be
drawn, and that he hath not made an end of Smiting, when
you seem resolved to begin to Sin afresh; know that God's
Jealous Eye is upon you, to observe whether after all that's
past over you, you amend or not.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>If God be forced by your growing worse to renew his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
your Calamities will be heavier than what you have yet
endured, if not your utter Ruin;</hi> your Sins will be aggravated
hereafter by the fore Judgments you have felt, the loud
warnings you have met with, the strange Deliverances you
have found, and the Means and Mercies you now Enjoy;
and be sure these aggravations will be found in the weight
of those strokes whereby God will testifie against them,
<hi>Is. 63. 9, 10.</hi> God's Rebukes do rise still higher; <hi>Amos. 4.</hi>
Bethink you then how oft God hath Smitten and Saved
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and how desolate he hath made the Churches of
<hi>France, Hungary, Bohemia, Alsatia</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> they
were oft Smitten, oft Delivered, and at last are laid utterly
waste; and do we hold our Mercies by a firmer Charter
then they did? Have we past under less methods of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
than they? Hath God waited longer on them
than you? Is God's Honour more concerned in our Ruin
than in theirs? Will not your Sins cry as loud in God's
Ears? are not the men God employed to Correct them,
the Popish Enemies to God's Cause as well as ours? And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106656:15"/>
were there not some Faithful Godly Praying Protestants in
those places as well as among us? Oh then, what can allay
your Fears or uphold your Hopes, that you the Protestants
of <hi>Ireland</hi> may think to Sin on and prosper, or at most be
but gently Smitten still! Flatter not your selves when
you see God is managing his Controversie with others, by
utter Desolations; it's a time of Jealousie, therefore awake:
Reformation must be your Safe-guard, or you delude your
selves, and will but dream your selves out of the Gospel,
the Plenty and the Peace you do now enjoy: You will
find that a Resolution to provoke God more, will end in
such Plagues as will devour your Mercies and embitter the
Remembrance of them; when God shall lay you waste
with his Judgments, and pursue you with his Wrath,
wherever you flie.</p>
            <p>Oh that these things which ought to perswade, may by
the blessing of God, force and fix such Resolves as these!
I will by the Grace of Christ faithfully search what needs
Amendment, and Reform to the <hi>utmost</hi> of my Conviction,
whatever I find amiss in my self and Family; that so we
may not Forfeit our present Enjoyments, and bring utter
woe upon our selves and others. Yea I will <hi>Contend with
the Wicked,</hi> and do my utmost to restrain their Sins, that at
least they may not cry so loud as to make the Nation
Desolate.</p>
