            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author might here (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laudable custom of Prefaces) entertain the Reader with a Discourse of the Original, Progress, and Rules of <hi>Satyr,</hi> and let him understand, that he has lately Read <hi>Casaubon,</hi> and several other Criticks upon the Point, but at present he is minded to wave it, as a vanity he is in no wise fond of. His only intent now is to give a brief account of what he Publishes, in order to prevent what censures he foresees may colourably be past thereupon: And that is, as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55776:3"/>What he calls the <hi>Prologue,</hi> is in imitation of <hi>Persius,</hi> who has prefix'd somewhat by that Name before his Book of Satyrs, and may serve for a pretty good Authority. The first Satyr he drew by <hi>Sylla's Ghost</hi> in the great <hi>Johnson,</hi> which may be perceiv'd by some strokes and touches therein, however short they come of the Original. In the second, he only follow'd the swing of his own Genius. The Design, and some passages of the third were taken out of the <hi>Franciscan</hi> of <hi>Buchanan.</hi> Which Ingenuous confession he thinks fit to make, to shew he has more modesty than the common Padders in Wit of these times. He doubts, there may be some few mistakes in Chronology therein, which for want of Books he could not inform himself in. If the skilful Reader meet with any such, he may the more easily pardon
<pb facs="tcp:55776:3"/>
them upon that score. Whence he had the hint of the fourth, is obvious to all, that are any thing acquainted with <hi>Horace.</hi> And without the Authority of so great a President, the making of an Image speak, is but an ordinary Miracle in Poetry. He expects, that some will tax him of Buffoonery, and turning holy things into ridicule. But let them Read, how severely <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius, Lactantius, Minutius Felix,</hi> and the gravest <hi>Fathers,</hi> have railly'd the fopperies and superstitions of the Heathen, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether those, which he has chosen for his Argument, are not as worthy of laughter. The only difference is, that they did it in Prose, as he d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es in Verse, where perhaps 'tis the more allowable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55776:4"/>As for the next Poem (which is the most liable to censure) though the World has given it the Name of the <hi>Satyr against Vertue,</hi> he declares 'twas never design'd to that intent, how apt soever some may be to wrest it. And this appears by what is said after it, and is discernable enough to all, that have the sence to understand it. 'Twas meant to abuse those, who valued themselves upon their Wit and Parts in praising Vice, and to shew, that others of sober Principles, if they would take the same liberty in Poetry, could strain as high rants in Profaness as they. At first he intended it not for the publick, nor to pass beyond the privacy of two or three Friends, but seeing it had the Fate to steal abroad in Manuscript, and afterwards in Print, without his knowledge; he now thinks it a justice due to
<pb facs="tcp:55776:4"/>
his own Reputation, to have it come forth without those faults, which it has suffer'd from Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers and the Press hitherto, and which make it a worse Satyr upon himself, than upon what it was design'd.</p>
                  <p>Something should be said too of the last Trifle, if it were worth it. 'Twas occasion'd upon Reading the late Translations of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> which gave him a mind to try what he could do upon a like Subject. Those being already fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal'd, he thought fit to make choice of this of the same Poet, whereon perhaps he has taken too much liberty. Had he seen Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> his Translation before he begun, he never durst have ventur'd: Since he has, and finds reason enough to despair of his undertaking. But now 'tis done, he is loath to burn it, and chooses rather
<pb facs="tcp:55776:5"/>
to give somebody else the trouble. The Reader may do as he pleases, either like it, or put it to the use of Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi>'s Works. 'Tis the first attempt, he ever made in this kind, and likely enough to be the last, his vein (if he may be thought to have any) lying another way.</p>

                  <l>Of gallant Youth, that grac'd the <hi>Carian</hi> Court,</l>
                  <l>Could charm the haughty Nymphs disdainful heart,</l>
                  <l>Or from a Brother's guilty Love divert;</l>

                  <l>But Honour, Shame and Blood alike forgot:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Caunus</hi> alone takes up her Thoughts and Eyes,</l>
                  <l>For him alone she wishes, grieves and sighs.</l>
                  <l>At first her new-born Passion owns no name,</l>
                  <l>A glim'ring Spark scarce kindling into flame;</l>
                  <l>She thinks it no offence, if from his Lip</l>

                  <l>With loose embraces oft his Neck surround,</l>
                  <l>And Love is yet in debts of Nature drown'd.</l>
                  <l>But Love at length grows naughty by degrees,</l>

                  <l>Insensibly that thing she does not know:</l>
                  <l>Strict honour yet her check'd desires does bind,</l>
                  <l>And modest thoughts on this side wish confin'd:</l>
                  <l>Only within she sooths her pleasing flames,</l>
                  <l>And now the hated terms of Blood disclaims:</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Could wish't unsaid, and rather <hi>Byblis</hi> hear:</l>
                  <l>Nor dare she yet with waking Thoughts admit</l>
