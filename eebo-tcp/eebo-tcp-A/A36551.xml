            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As a weary Traveller takes up his Lodging, not at the beſt but at the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inn. Be not thou a new Inſtance, to confirm that unhappy Obſervation. For want of ſome pains, many Chriſtians are ſtrangely Ignorant, and through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, uncertain like Glaſſes, which may be blown into any ſhape you pleaſe; or Weather-Cocks, that are indifferent to any Point of the Heavens. To leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen thy pains ſomewhat, I have endeavoured to give thee the moſt material Arguments, by which thoſe Truths are ſupported, in as plain and familiar a way as I could, and as the Nature of the ſubjects would bear. Particularly, be at ſome pains, to underſtand the right uſe of Reaſon, about theſe ſacred Myſteries. Namely, that it is not to judge of the Truth of the Propoſitions, contained in the Scriptures, but of their Connexion: Take an Inſtance, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 13. If there be no Reſurrection from the Dead, then is Chriſt not riſen.</hi> The Propoſitions, that the dead ſhall be raiſed, and that Chriſt is raiſed from the dead, are <hi>de fide,</hi> or matters of Faith: but the Connexion, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Socinians, who pretend, that we are not to believe any thing to be of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which is not evident to our reaſon, do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover but little of that reaſon, which they would be thought to have Ingroſſed to themſelves: For, does not Reaſon tell us, that the Nature and Works of God are above our reach? And that God were not God, if he could be comprehended by a Creature; nor are the Creatures <hi>ad aequate</hi> effects of God their cauſe.</p>
            <p>And indeed their Principle takes away the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Divine Knowledge and Faith. Where is there any room for an aſſent to Truth, <hi>Propter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem revelantis,</hi> upon the credit of Gods word, if we are to believe nothing, but what antecedently to Divine Revelation, is evident to reaſon in its next cauſes, or proper Effects. Nor can I ſee what uſe Miracles can be of to a <hi>Socinian;</hi> the Intendment of which, is to inforce a belief of thoſe Doctrines, which are inevident to Reaſon: It being a Principle, which no man will contradict, that God will not put the Seal of his Immediate Power to a Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

To the ſecond, <hi>That Chriſt is then a Son without a ſubſtance.</hi> I anſwer, that though the Son, as God, is from himſelf; yet as God the Son, he is from the Father, the perſon and ſubſtance being inſeparable. As for the place, he refers me to <hi>Col:</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the inviſible God, I</hi> ſee not how it oppoſes my expoſition. God is taken there perſonally for the Father, not eſſentially for the God-head, or divine nature, which <hi>I</hi> prove, becauſe Chriſt is ſaid to be the Image of God; which if meant of God eſſentially, then Chriſt muſt be the image of himſelf, which cannot be. And that Chriſt is God by nature, appears by <hi>v.</hi> 16. where he is ſaid to be the firſt cauſe, and laſt end of all things. For the tranſlation, it is good enough, <gap reason="foreign">

And for my own part, though <hi>I</hi> know ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons do deny <hi>W. P</hi>'s affirmative, yet <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not joyn with them therein. For to me it ſeems
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66114:14"/>
evident, that God is free in his determinations, what attribute he will manifeſt, and in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and manner. Had Man ſtood, God had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted remunerative juſtice (as he does in the elect Angels:) when Man fell, God might only have manifeſted vindictive juſtice (as he does upon the reprobate Angels or Devils:) or ſparing mercy only (as he does in the Perſons of elect Men.) This variety gives ground to believe, that between theſe properties, or attributes of juſtice and mercy (not to ſpeak of others) and their effects, an act of his meer will intervenes. And neither of theſe is wronged by the manifeſtation of the other, and concealment of it ſelf. For the internal glory of none of the divine attributes, receives either addition or diminution by the external glory or manifeſtation of them, in their proper effects. And as for the way of redemption by Chriſt, we may well conclude it to be a free choice, by thoſe emphatical phraſes, whereby it is ſet forth, <hi>The counſel of Gods own will,</hi> Eph. 1. 11. <hi>The myſtery of his will, his good pleaſure.</hi> v. 9.

As for the poſſibility, or impoſſibility
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66114:14"/>
of forgiveneſs without ſatisfaction, we need not much conteſt, ſeeing the cauſe does not depend upon either apprehenſion.

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. From the proportion, which Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteouſneſs to us, bear to the matter of our Juſtification, which (as we have ſhewn before) being the Righteouſneſs of another, cannot be made ours any other way, than by Imputation.

            <p>This laſt Argument ſuggeſts an Anſwer to <hi>W.

            <p>AGainſt this Error, I urge two Arguments: 1. If no meer Man ever attained to any ſuch ſtate, then it is not attainable. But no meer Man ever did, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The conſequence carries great probability of truth. As for the minor, that no Man ever did attain a ſtate of perfection, we may prove by the inſtances of the eminently holy Perſons in the Scripture, who in all likelihood would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, had it been attainable. I know the <hi>Quakers</hi> do give inſtances of meer Men in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that were perfect: but their miſtake lies in the different uſe of that word (as we ſhall ſee by and by.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If there be a continual need and uſe of faith, and repentance in this life, then a ſtate of freedome from ſin is not attainable in this life. But there is a continual need and uſe of faith, and repentance in this life; Therefore a ſtate of freedome from ſin is attainable in this life. The Conſequence is evident; What need can he have of repentance for ſin, that hath no ſin to repent of? or of faith in Chriſt for pardon and power againſt ſin, who is already free from what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts guilt and defilement? That there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66114:33"/>
uſe of faith (and there's the like reaſon of repentance) appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Now abide, Faith, Hope and Charity, theſe three, but the greateſt of theſe, is Charity. See <hi>p.</hi> 33.</p>

            <p>Another Branch of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Errour, as to Ordinances, refers to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> of which they affirm, that <hi>they ceaſe upon the appearance of Chriſt within.</hi> A.

            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66114:41"/>
Againſt which Errour, I oppoſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; one for both Ordinances, the other for Baptiſm in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are ſtanding Ordinances, [or ſuch as we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to uſe, during this life] then they do not ceaſe upon the appearance of Chriſt within, [or are not made uſeleſs or unneceſſary by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of attainments in this life.] But the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
            <p>That they are ſtanding Ordinances, appears, becauſe no formal repeal can be produced, either <hi>in terminis,</hi> or by any due conſequence from Scripture; nor yet any virtual repeal, as in Laws made for a time, and at the expiration thereof, of courſe, ceaſing to oblige.</p>
            <p>That then they do not ceaſe as to our need of them, follows evidently, becauſe it is not to be ſuppoſed conſiſtent with Chriſt's wiſdome, to continue an obligation upon us, to the uſe of a means, when the end is obtained already.</p>
            <p>All that can be ſaid with any colour, is, that they are of perpetual obligation, <hi>till the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt within;</hi> that is, a full appearance, or ſtate of perfection. But we having proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is no ſuch ſtate attainable in this life; then if thoſe Ordinances oblige, till we be arrived at perfection, they oblige, and ſo are of uſe, during term of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2 If Baptiſm be a Foundation-Doctrine, (as I may call it) then it is of uſe during this life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:66114:41"/>
That it is ſuch, appears by <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. where the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Doctrine of Baptiſm a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;</hi> by which phraſe of the Apoſtle, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the uſe and intendment of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by thoſe, who had or were to receive it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eems to be meant. The conſequence is good, If it be an Ordinance, all Chriſtians are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and improve, then they muſt receive it. Being baptized into Chriſts death, cannot be an argument to induce the unbaptized to a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſin, which the Apoſtle urges upon the baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews to leave this Principle or Foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, verſ.</hi> 1. I anſwer, that by leaving it, the Apoſtle cannot mean relinquiſhing the practice thereof. For then by force of the ſame phraſe, applyed to Faith and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe graces muſt alſo be left, (the contrary whereto I have before proved) but the Apoſtle explains himſelf, that they ſhould not ſo ſtick in the foundation, as not to proceed to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, or higheſt points of Chriſtian doctrine. I could never meet with any thing, that looked like an Argument, for their opinion, but that place, which ſpeaks of <hi>ſhewing forth the Lord's Death,</hi> in the Supper, <hi>till he come,</hi> which they interpret, <hi>till he come in the ſpirit.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26.</p>

And I wonder he ſhould not ſee, that his Argument may be retorted upon him thus. If the God-head be in Three Manners or Forms, then the God-head in one manner, muſt needs be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Subſiſtent, and diſtinct from the God-head in the other two manners: Or more plainly thus; If the ſame God-head be in Father, Son, and Spirit, then they muſt needs be diſtinct one from another, and any one compleat without the other two. God the Father cannot be God the Son, nor can God the Son be God the Father: Though both Father and Son are one God. For the Perſons are formally Conſtituted by their relative Properties, and ſo the God-head conſidered with its Three rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Properties, admits of a Three-ſold distinction from it ſelf abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
