            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>a Prince that there did raine:</l>
               <l>Who had to name <hi>Cophetua,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>as Poets they did faine.</l>
               <l>From Natures workes he did incline,</l>
               <l>For sure he was not of my minde,</l>
               <l>He cared not for women kinde,</l>
               <l>but did them all disdaine.</l>
               <l>But marke what happened by the way,</l>
               <l>As he out of his window lay,</l>
               <l>He saw a beggar all in gray,</l>
               <l>which did increase his paine.</l>

               <l>from heauen downe so high:</l>
               <l>He drew a Dart and shot at him,</l>
               <l>in place where he did lye.</l>
               <l>Which soone did pierse him to the quick,</l>
               <l>For when he felt the arrow prick,</l>
               <l>Which in his tender heart did stick,</l>
               <l>he looketh as he would dye.</l>
               <l>What sudden chance is this quoth he,</l>
               <l>That I to loue must subiect be,</l>

               <l>A thousand heapes of care did runne,</l>
               <l>within his troubled head.</l>
               <l>For now he meanes to craue her loue,</l>
               <l>And now he séekes which way to prooue:</l>
               <l>How he his fancie might remoous,</l>

               <l>A salue to cure him of his care,</l>

               <l>PAssing along through Redriffe,</l>
               <l>I heard one sore complaining:</l>
               <l>Then streight I drew me neere to him,</l>
               <l>to know the cause and meaning.</l>
               <l>Of this his sorrow, care and griefe,</l>
               <l>which did his minde disaster:</l>
               <l>Alasse sayes he what shall I doe,</l>
               <l>my wife will needs be maister<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>For I may did wo worth the time,</l>
               <l>that ere with her I matched:</l>
               <l>For with her nailes that are so sharpe,</l>
               <l>my face she hath bescratched.</l>
               <l>To a Surgion I was driuen to run,</l>
               <l>for to goe beg a plaister:</l>
               <l>So thus God knowes vnto my greefe,</l>
               <l>my wife will be my maister.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I drndge I droile I tosse I toyle,</l>
               <l>till that the day be ended:</l>
               <l>At night I make to her account,</l>
               <l>what monny I haue spended.</l>
               <l>Or else my pockets she will search,</l>
               <l>and say I am a waster:</l>
               <l>Thus like a mome I liue at home,</l>
               <l>and she will needes be maister.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For all the paines that I do take,</l>
               <l>yet still she will be chiding:</l>
               <l>Crcept siue groats each night I bring,</l>
               <l>at home thers no abiding.</l>
               <l>She saies that I am good for nought,</l>
               <l>but for some foolish Ieaster:</l>
               <l>With angry browes and deadly vowes,</l>
               <l>she sweares to be my master.</l>
            </lg>

               <pb facs="tcp:19733:48"/>
               <l>Thus honnest friend as you haue heard,</l>
               <l>I daily liue in sorrow:</l>
               <l>Of neuer a neighbor that I haue,</l>
               <l>dare I once lend or borrow.</l>
               <l>If I should liue as many yeares,</l>
               <l>as euer did King Nestor:</l>
               <l>Yet in my mind it still me feares,</l>
               <l>that she would be my maister.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I dare not stir forth of her sight,</l>
               <l>but when I am a working:</l>
               <l>For her iealous mind doth thinke I am,</l>
               <l>with one or other lurking.</l>
               <l>And if at any time I should,</l>
               <l>but chance to spend a teaster:</l>
               <l>Sheele call me knaue, base rogue and slane.</l>
               <l>and sweares sheele bee the maister.</l>
