            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving received yours of the 4th of this inſtant, ſigned by your ſelf and ſome others: You are pleaſed to ſignifie your apprehenſions of our undertakings, and your hopes that we have received from our Brethren in <hi>England</hi> ſuch ſatisfaction as we may acquieſce in, in their late actings. I have ſent to you by this Gentleman theſe encloſed Papers, wherein you will fully be informed of our endeavours and pains, to keep a right underſtanding with our friends and fellow Souldiers: But we ſincerely profeſs to you, That we cannot be convinced of any ſuch neceſſity or ſence of duty, that could engage them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſo violent and unwarrantable, contrary to ſuch late and ſolemn Engagements: Indeed it makes our hearts mourn in ſecret, to confider what the iſſue of this dangerous and raſh change of the Government may be: but we hope we ſhall be found in the way of duty, and ſhall walk according to Gods Word, in that we have borne our Teſtimony according to our Conſciences againſt that which is evil; and we humbly deſire you to lay to heart the great diſhonour that will lye upon the holy Name of God, by our inconſtancy and (I wiſh I could not ſay) treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Are we not an Army that have the Higheſt Engagements upon us? Never ſuch a profeſſing Generation for God! yet to make no Conſcience of obedience to thoſe God ſets over us; Nay, ſuch whoſe Authority hath been witneſſed to, by Almighty God, in many ſucceſſes; and for reſtoring of which we were, but the other day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and praiſing God; and for the aſſerting whoſe juſt Authority, our Brethren in <hi>England</hi> ſo lately hazarded to bloud, from whom we have all received Commiſſions and encouragement:and this to be done without half an hours deliberation! We tremble to conſider of it, and that a few perſons, and of them ſome unknown to us, to be intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Power of aboliſhing <hi>Laws,</hi> raiſing <hi>Moneys,</hi> chuſing <hi>General Officers,</hi> creating new Models of Government, making Peace and War; and this derived from the Officers of a few Regiments quartered in <hi>England;</hi> and our conſent to all this, Authoritatively required. We cannot but witneſs againſt ſuch proceedings, as muſt needs make us a ſcorn to our Enemies, a ſhame to our friends, and odious to all the people of God in the world. Is this the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> the defence of the Parliaments Priviledges, to diſſolve them with the greateſt contempt? Are the peoples Rights now ſecured, when their Conſciences, Eſtates and Perſons, are abandoned to the will and pleaſure of <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten Perſons?</hi> Are the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt like to be protected, when the encouragement of the MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTRY of the CHURCHES is to be removed? Now we beſeech you, in the bowels of the Lord Jeſus, to lay to heart theſe things, and conſider whether our jealouſies and fears be not real. And we declare in plainneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, (as in the preſence of God) with you, that our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> are very dear to us in the Lord; that it wounds us deeper to conſider theſe actings, then the wounds we have received from our Enemies; for then we could have borne them. We bleſs the Lord that you are ſo ſenſible of the hazard and bloud that may follow. So we beg of you to remember what bloud hath been ſhed, and who will anſwer for it, if we be worſe then thoſe God caſt out before us. We bleſs God that we need no umbrage, for our actions; but teſtifie before God and man, that we will not admit any <hi>Single perſon</hi> whatſoever, nor <hi>Houſe of Lords;</hi> that we deſire <hi>Succeſſive Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Councils of State</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>Authority of Parliament</hi> for the <hi>Government of theſe Nations;</hi> and that there may be a <hi>Legal Foundation and Succeſſion.</hi> We deſire you our <hi>Brethren in Ireland,</hi> to joyn with us, in your deſires to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in England,</hi> That <hi>this Parliament</hi> may be reſtored, and <hi>put a legal period to their ſitting;</hi> and ſettle ſuch <hi>Expedients</hi> as may be for the ſecuring of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> againſt the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi> And we ſhall take this as a renewed Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your brotherly love and kindneſs to us. And having no further to trouble you, but to let you know, that I am,</p>
