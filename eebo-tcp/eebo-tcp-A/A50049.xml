            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Psalms</hi> are a portion of Scripture, very usefull for all sorts of Christians to be acquainted with. Singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is an Ordinance of God, and a duty very profitable and comfortable to a true Saint, being rightly performed: But as a man must pray, so must he sing with understanding, and have his heart affected answerably to the matter; therefore I should conceive it very requisite for any that would perform this excellent Duty to their spiritual advantage, to make use of some good Expositor on the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> that they may compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently understand the <hi>Psalme</hi> before they sing, and so perform reasonable service. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 5. <hi>Who so privily slandereth his neighbour,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> hath, <hi>He that speaketh with a third tongue against his neighbour:</hi> And so <hi>Psal.</hi> 140. 11. <hi>An evil speaker, or a man of tongue shall not be established on the earth,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> there also hath, <hi>The man that speaketh with a third tongue.</hi> The slanderer is said to use a third<note place="margin">Lud.

If these Observations have a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reception, it will excite me to a quicker dispatch of my Annotations upon the Greater and Lesser Prophets, which I suppose will be a fair Folio, and so I may, if incouraged, proceed after to <hi>Genesis,</hi> and all the other Books of the Old-Testament, even to <hi>Job.</hi>

                  <p>I. Concerning good men, the summe of which is, a good man is happy. He and his happiness are described:</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. He doth not walk in, that is, practise the counsell of evil or ungodly men; that is, the evil which men of corrupt natures do in their own mindes like of and advise to do, and also perswade others to do. He neither approveth and liketh of sinne to practise it out of that liking himself hath to it, nor yet is ruled by the ill perswasions of evil men seeking to approve such bad courses.</item>
                     <item>2. He doth not stand in the way of sinners, that is, he doth not go on in the practise of those evils which corrupt men habituating themselves in the waies of wickedness, do with constancy and greediness follow. Evil men notes the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption, sinners the habit of evil by constant practise.</item>
                     <item>3. He doth not sit in the seat of scorners, he is not so setled in sinne, as to mock, scorn and deride admonitions, reproofs and threatnings, as the wicked which have attained the highest degree of sinfulness are accustomed to do, neither is he a companion with such sinfull men.</item>

                  <p>The Title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the Prophet came unto him after he had gone in to Bathsheba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inscription shews four things:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The person to whom the writing was committed, <hi>viz.</hi> The chief Musician. For when <hi>David</hi> had appointed singers and players of Instruments for the Temple, he did also divide them into several Companies, and over every company there was one chief to whom the ordering of the Song and Tune did appertain, and as it may seem also one principal overseer of all, to whose custody the Psalm was delivered, and by whose appointment it was sung in the Temple at fit times, as may be seen, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. The whole number was 288, and they were divided into 24 compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, twelve in a company.</item>
                     <item>2. The Nature of the writing, <hi>A Psalme,</hi> that is, holy matter framed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to musical numbers, and fitted to be sung upon an Instrument or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</item>
                     <item>3. The Authour or Penman of the Psalm, <hi>David,</hi> the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> who is famous for his sweet singing, and excellent Psalmes left unto the Church.</item>
                     <item>4. The Occasion thereof; 1. Nearer, the coming to him of a certain man, set out here by his name, <hi>Nathan,</hi> which signifies a gift, and by his Office a Prophet, chosen of God to admonish him for his sinne. Prophets were men appointed by God in a special manner to direct the Church of God in his truth and service. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was an extraordinary Prophet, he came to <hi>David.</hi> The Errand on which he came, and his manner of behaviour in doing his Errand, is fuilly and plainly related 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3 2. More remote, his sin in going in to <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> in committing adultery with her, as the Hebrew phrase modestly signifieth. <hi>See</hi> 2 Sam. 11. &amp; 12. Chapters.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Verse 1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindenesse: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Deal graciously with me, or be favourable to me, <hi>q. d.</hi> Whereas I by my sinnes have deserved to be cast out of thy favour, and do finde and feel in my self the sense of thy displeasure, I beseech thee be pleased graciously to receive me into thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and cause me to know that thou hast freely and undeservedly loved me.</p>
                  <p>Kindnesse is a word of a larger signification than either grace or compassion, and it signifies the excellent property of Gods Nature, whereby he is apt for his own sake to do good unto his creatures, which are weak and need his goodnesse, and cannot be happy without it; this is well alledged as a reason of craving Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for therefore is he ready to accept into favour those which have deserved his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95699:36"/>
displeasure, and are no way able to merit his favour, because the excellent sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and kindnesse of his Nature makes him ready to shew goodnesse unto all those creatures which depend upon him. Grace cannot be shewed but to a sinner which hath offended, kindnesse is, and may be shew'd unto those creatures which have not offended, by bestowing a good estate upon them, and establishing them in that good estate that they cannot fall from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The multitude of thy tender mercies.</hi>] Bowels, that is, by a Metaphor, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moving and earning of the bowels, which in a kinde disposition is stirred up by beholding the misery of another.</p>
                  <p>Here are three phrases in this and the second verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blot out my rebellions.</hi>] Sins are rebellions, or acts of disobedience done by any under government against the Authority and Rule of the Governour, sinne is a lifting up of our souls against the Authority and Power which God hath over us, by preterring our own will before his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blot out.</hi>] Sinne is compared to a debt written in a debt-book, to make the Debtor obnoxious to the Creditor; and remission of sins is compared to the blotting out the debt, that it may no longer stand in force to make the Debtor liable to an action of debt.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 2. <hi>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin</hi>]<note place="margin">Tecabbeseni, David <hi>may seem to allude to</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>where the three words here used for sin are.</hi> Id quod macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est vesti, illud est peccatum ipsi animae. <hi>Muis.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second phrase here is, <hi>Wash me throughly</hi> (or multiply to wash me, or play the Fuller upon me) from mine iniquity. The Hebrew word signifies crookedness or wrinesse; Sinne is a crookednesse of the soul or actions, bowing it from the straight Rule of Gods will, wash it away, so as no stain nor blemish thereof may remain behinde to defile me; Sinne is here compared to bodily filthinesse, or foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of any kinde, which disgraceth him in whom it is, and makes him unfit to be received into any good company; and remission of sinne to the cleansing of such foulnesse by means of often and much washing with water, till it become altogether pure and clean, and free from spots.</p>
                  <p>The third phrase is, <hi>Cleanse</hi> or <hi>purge me from my sinne,</hi> where sinne is compared to the legal pollutions of the old Law, which did make a man unclean and unfit to partake in the Tabernacle of any of the services of God, and remission of sinnes is compared to those purgations appointed in the Law to deliver the party from all such uncleannesse, that he might approach to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 3. <hi>For I acknowledge my transgressions; and my sinne is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>It was an ancient custom for the accuser to stand before the accused, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 10. the Prophet alludes to this, that is, sometimes I have my eye upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser,<note place="margin">It is <hi>verbum forense,</hi> alwayes standing up in his face, and pleading against him.</note> sometimes on the Judge, as the malefactors at their trial.</p>
                  <p>That is said to be before a man, which is just in his sight, before his eyes or face, so that he looketh still on it. He did present sinne before his own minde willingly, and took those thoughts into his minde that tended to make him more and more see and detest it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That is, Wash away my sin with the bloud of thy Son, which is shadowed in the legal sprinklings made with hyssop.</p>

                        </gap>8. 17.</note> figurative speech taken from the custom of men, who when they are angry with any person or thing, do inflame their wrath yet more by earnest looking upon that thing or person. By Gods face is meant his angry displeasure which <hi>David</hi> beseecheth him to hide from his sins, that is, from him in regard of his sins, <hi>q. d.</hi> Look not so upon my sins, as to shew thy self angry against me for the same. In the repetition, <hi>Blot out all mine iniquity,</hi> he useth the same word that he had used in the first verse, only here adding the note of generality to the subject of his Petition, which he understood.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</hi>] To create signifies properly to make of nothing, and <hi>David</hi> using this word not as if he had not already some beginnings of sanctity; but that God must work it in him out of nothing (he had wisdom before this, and therefore sanctity) but to encourage himself from Gods omnipotent power secretly included in the word <hi>Create.</hi> He alludeth to the making of the world at first, intimating that if he were as destitute of grace now, as once all things were of being, yet God that gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to things that were not, is able also to give grace to him.</p>
                  <p>By the word [<hi>heart</hi>] is figuratively meant the inward faculties of the soul, chiefly the thoughts, motions, affections and desires. The word <hi>clean</hi> or pure sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that which is free from the admixture of any base stuff which may impair its beauty and worth.</p>
                  <p>To renew is to repair or make sound again that which by age or other casualty is decayed or perished, and this word being used after that of creating, shews that <hi>David</hi> in prayer did gather more comfortable sense of the work of Sanctification. For he that asks to have a thing created, finds nothing of it in himself; he that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have it renewed, finds some remainder and reliques which needs some mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and addition.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> is signified the whole inward man in all the faculties of it, and <hi>David</hi> useth both the words of heart and spirit, which in Scripture are used to note the whole man, because he wisheth an universal reformation, wherein every part shall be amended in its kinde.</p>
                  <p>The word translated <hi>right,</hi> in the Text, is <hi>Constant</hi> in the Margin; The

                  <p>That is, Deprive me not of that happy union with thee, and that assurance and enjoyment of thy love. By the word Spirit joyned with this epithete Holy, is still meant in Scripture the Spirit of Sanctification, working holinesse in the hearts of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 12. <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>] To restore a man to any thing, is to give him that again which once he had, but now hath not.</p>
                  <p>Restore hath five things in it: 1. That once he had a sense of Gods love. 2. He remembers that he had it. 3. It was now lost. 4. He saw a way to gain it. 5. By prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joy of thy salvation.</hi>] That is, the comfort I had in the work of thy grace, strengthening me against sinne, and assuring me of eternal happinesse.</p>
                  <p>The salvation of God is that work of his grace by which he delivers his people from every evil work and thing, and bringeth them safe to his heavenly kingdom, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 18. The joy of Gods salvation is that comfort, delight, content, satisfaction of heart, which the heart is filled withall, out of the assurance of this work of grace. It is therefore as much as if <hi>David</hi> had said, Lord, time hath been that I had great comfort in the sense of the work of thy grace, delivering me from sinne, and all the enemies of my soul, and the assurance of the continuance of this work, till it had brought me safely to the Kingdom, but now I have long wanted this comfort, I humbly beseech thee vouchsafe to give it me again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Establish or uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi>] That is, so confirm me by thy Spirit in the wayes of goodnesse, that I may no more run into such grosse and soul sins, as my weaknesse otherwise will quickly carry me into.</p>

                  <p>Vers. 14. <hi>Deliver me from bloud guiltinesse, O God.</hi>] Or, as the word signifies,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Vers. 16. <hi>For thou requirest not Sacrifice, else would I give it, thou delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not in Burnt-offering.</hi>] First, God never required Sacrifices compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that is, in comparison of a broken heart it's nothing, it is not to be compared with it, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 13.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.] A broken heart</hi> is opposed to a whole heart, which is insensible, unhumbled for sinne, a sensible heart, and afflicted for sin. Contrite is that which is broken to pouder, ready to receive any impression. <hi>A Miosis,</hi> that is, highly esteem, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 18. <hi>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Sion, build thou the walls of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.] Sion</hi> was a hill in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where <hi>David</hi> had placed the Ark of God, and it signifies the state of the Church in regard of things Ecclesiastical and spiritual. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> was the chief City of the Kingdom, which <hi>David</hi> had wonne out of the hands of the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> and signified the State Civil or Temporal, and by building up the walls thereof, is meant fortifying and defending it against all sorts of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; The sense is, Beftow upon us all good things necessary for Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, and save us from all evil things that may be harmfull to either of them.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 19. <hi>Then shalt thou be pleased with the Sacrifices of righteousnesse, with Burnt-offering, and whole Burnt-offering, then shall they offer Bullocks upon thine Altar.</hi>

                  <p>THis Psalm is a Psalm of praise, stirring up the people of God to that duty by a three-fold exhortation. The first in the three first verses. The second in the fourth and fifth, the third in the four last.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet layes down the grounds of the duty:</p>
                  <p>1. Gods universal Sovereignty over all things.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 1. <hi>The Lord reigneth.</hi>] Exerciseth kingly Authority, which is supream Sovereign and absolute, having no Superiour nor partner.</p>
                  <p>2. His gracious presence in his Church set out figuratively in that phrase, <hi>He sitteth between the Cherubims.</hi> The Cherubims were Images of flying men, which shadowed the Mercy-seat, or covering of the Ark with their faces toward one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and looking downward upon the Ark, and seem to have been types of the holy Angels, both looking into the great Mystery of Christs Incarnation, and the Redemption of mankinde wrought by him, and also standing prepared and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to yeeld their service unto Christ, as ministring spirits for the good of his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95699:49"/>
Church in any imploiment, and from thence did God give answers to his people by the Ministry of the High-priest, and there did he vouchsase some visible sign of his Divine Majesty, so that it was a testimony to Gods people of his being graciously present with them in Christ to do all spiritual good for them.</p>
                  <p>3. The effects of both these, <hi>viz.</hi> the trembling of all people, and shaking of the earth. Trembling and shaking are effects of a great measure of fear, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the person in whom it is, and leaving him destitute of all power to resist and oppose, or flie from the thing feared. The meaning seemeth to be, that all men, yea, and all things shall even faint and shrink before the Lord, as utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to stand against him when he comes to fight for his Church, and defeat their projects and practices against it.</p>
                  <p>4. Gods greatnesse in his Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all people.</hi>] By <hi>Zion,</hi> a part put for the whole, is meant the whole Church, where Christ is acknowledged, and the name of God called upon in him. God is said to be great there, because in the Church, and for the maintenance and guidance of it, he principally declares his greatnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>High above all people</hi>] Not alone in respect of authority or right to govern, but also in respect of strength, power and sufficiency, so that he is able to effect his own will amongst and against them, and they cannot hinder his designs and purpose, or effect any thing contrary to his good pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Prophet layes down the duty it self:</p>
                  <p>In the third verse is the matter of the Exhortation, with a reason to confirm it also, <hi>Let them praise</hi>] Or, They shall or ought to praise; it is so an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a duty, that it also shews a necessity, and fore-tels the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy great and terrible Name</hi>] That is, thy self that art great and fearfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For it holy</hi>] So it is concisely in the Original, and may be meant of the name of God or himself, all is one; for when the name of God is said to be holy, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, Himself is, and known so to be. The Name of God signifies his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown and honour, and sometimes those things by which he is made known and called, and sometimes himself so called and made known, as here.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 4. <hi>The Kings strength also loveth Judgment</hi>] By it here may be meant wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and understanding to moderate justice. Justice is,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Commutative, which stands in the right behaviour of one person to another in all things, as also toward the Governour.</item>
                     <item>2. Distributive, which is proper to Superiours and Governours, and standeth in the right ordering of their Inferiours by punishing and rewarding them according to their works.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou dost establish equity</hi>] To establish equity is to appoint and ordain by his powerfull authority, the doing of that which is right and equal, to ratifie it as a<note place="margin">

                  <p>To exalt is to lift on high, not in place but worth, so termed figuratively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes him eminent, the meaning is, take notice of, confesse, acknowledge, make known and set forth Gods excellency.</p>

                  <p>Some will have these fifteen Psalmes together to have the name of Songs of Degrees, 1. From the history, because they were penned, or at least repeated and sung by the Jews in their ascending or coming up from <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country, and this conceit is the more probable, because some of the Psalmes speak expresly of their return from Captivity.</p>
                  <p>Others deduce it from the Ceremony or Rite used in the singing of them, who say that the Priest sang these Psalmes upon the stairs or steps, as they marched up into the house of the Lord, which were fifteen steps between the peoples Courts and the Priests, and these Psalmes were sung in order, as they went up those steps; so <hi>Grotius:</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.</p>
                  <p>A third sort from the musick they say these Psalmes were sung with, ascensions or raising up the voice by degrees: as it is said, the Levites praised God with a great voice, or a voice on high, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 20. 19.</p>

                  <p>IN this ninth Chapter <hi>Salomon</hi> shews the vanity of the creature in regard of the promiscuous event, or like dispensation of all things in this life,</p>

                  <p>4. In regard of their outward estate and enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>Vers. 1. <hi>No man knoweth either love, or hatred, by all that is before them.</hi>] That is, as <hi>Junius</hi> expounds it, the thing he either loves or hates by reason of the sicklenesse of his affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> saith not, No man can simply know the love or hatred of God to him; but in a compound sense, that no man can know it by the outward events of this life, yet it may be known by the testimony of Gods Spirit renewing us, as <hi>Cathari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himself a Papist expounds it.</p>

                     </note> thus, Love also hatred, a man knoweth not all in the face of them. With least imitation we translate the words thus, <hi>A man knoweth not love or hatred,</hi> that is, what is love or hatred, by all that is before them, and then the meaning is plain, by outward things, the things that are before our faces, man knows not whether he be loved or hated of God, whereof the reason follows, <hi>All things come alike to all.</hi>

                  <p>Vers. 12. <hi>A garden enclosed is my sister my spouse: a spring shut up, and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sealed.</hi>] Which is not only in respect of defence, that none can destroy and spoil her, but that others cannot come at her, they cannot drink and smell the sweetness that is in her.</p>

                  <p>That is, of admirable and perfect beauty: The mixture of these two colours makes a good complexion. White in the purity of his conversation, ruddy in the hue of his passion. White in his life, and ruddy in his death. These are tokens of the strongest health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The chiefest among ten thousand.</hi>] The Spouse useth a metaphor taken from the warre, as also putteth a number certain for uncertain, to express the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her beloved. The banner or ensign is a warlike instrument, and commonly the bearer thereof one of the chiefest, tallest, and mightiest men.</p>
                  <p>The scope of the Church is not to set forth the members of Christs humane body, but the glorious excellencies and spirituall perfection of Christ as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour of the Church, according to the manner of lovers, who are taken with the beauty of their spouses in all their members.</p>
                  <p>The Spouse sets forth Christ as the perfection of beauty, begins first with his Head.</p>
