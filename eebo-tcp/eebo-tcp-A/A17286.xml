            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a common ſlander that hath been raiſed, and vile aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath been, and ſtill is caſt upon the wayes of godlineſſe; That they diſ-ennoble mens ſpirits, (which <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of eleven hundred <note place="margin">Sal. l. 4 de Gab. 1. Dei.</note> yeares agoe, <hi>Si quis ex nobilitate conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ad Deum coeperit, ſtatim honorem nobilitatis amittit; o quantus in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano populo honor Chriſti eſt, ubi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio ignobilem facit!)</hi> That they make men rigid, melancholy, ſowre, uncivill; That they dull their parts; That they take them off from the delights of the things in the world; That if men take up the power and ſtrictneſſe of them, they muſt reſolve never, to keep any correſpondence with their friends
<pb facs="tcp:7448:3"/>
who are of rank and quality in the world; and therefore although thoſe who have little of the world, and little to doe in the world, may live ſtrict lives; yet it is not for ſuch who are borne to great things, whoſe fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are raiſed higher than other mens, who have references to many of quality &amp; place; it cannot be expected that they ſhould bee ſo ſtrict; this muſt needs hinder them in their outward accompliſhments; if they begin to take ſuch a courſe, it is impoſsible they ſhould be compleate every way, as beſeemes ſuch as they are: and thus many are compelled to be evill, leſt they ſhould be eſteemed vile, as <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> complaines of his time; <hi>Mali cogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eſſe ne viles habea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur:</hi> a notable ſpeech of his, fully ſutable to our times. The firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance (that I remember) I had of this place in <hi>Salvian,</hi> was from your Lordſhips ownhands, ſhewing it to me in him, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion that your Lordſhip was much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with. But theſe men do not conſider how much they ſpeak againſt themſelves; were this true, it were a ſnare, a judgement to be raiſed in outward excellencies above others. No; it is not honour, they are not riches, parts, dignities that hinder godlineſſe; it is the baſeneſſe and corruption of mens ſpirits,
<pb facs="tcp:7448:3"/>
in the enjoyment of theſe that hinders; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe raiſeth the excellencies of them, it drawes out the chiefe good in them, and puts a higher beauty and glory upon them. God hath raiſed up your Honor, to convince the world of the falſeneſſe, malice, impiety there is in this evill report that is brought up, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good and bleſſed wayes of godlineſſe. Malice it ſelf cannot but acknowledge, that godlineſſe in the ſtrictneſſe of it, &amp; naturall excellencies in the eminency of them, have a bleſſed conjunction in your Honour; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe as the enameling of Pearls in thoſe golden naturall endowments with which God hath mercifully &amp; plentifully enriched you: and were it but for this ſervice only to God and his Church, in convincing the world of the vileneſſe of this ſlander; I may ſpeake without ſuſpition of flattery, happy that ever you were borne; and I know, that thoſe who know your Lordſhip, will juſtifie me in that I ſay. In this God hath honored your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipe exceedingly; were there no other end for which you ſtill live in ſuch a generation, as you doe, but onely this; yet in this you have great cauſe to bleſſe your ſelfe in God, and in this great honour he hath put upon you, to make you ſo publike and worthy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb facs="tcp:7448:4"/>
of his. Who is it that lookes upon you, and ſees your wayes, but muſt needs confeſſe, Now I ſee that ſtrictneſſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Religion, may ſtand with a moſt noble, generous, ſweet, amiable, courteous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; I ſee it raiſeth and ennobleth parts; and though it baniſheth baſe and ſordid pleaſures, which are beneath the dignity of a man, much more of ture Nobility and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſneſſe; yet it knowes how to make uſe of the delights that God affords in this world, and orders and guides them ſo, as by it they are injoyed with a double ſweetneſſe, farre above that which others finde.</p>
            <p>And yet further, there are two more bleſſed conjuctures which adde much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to you; the one is a facile yeeldablenes of ſpirit to any (though much inferiour) in anything, where good may bee done; and yet a ſtrong, unmoveable, ſledfaſt, reſolute ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt that which is evill. It was the high commendation that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> gave of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that hee was <hi>Magnes, &amp;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nazian. in Encom. Athanaſ.</note> 
               <hi>Adamas,</hi> A Loadſtone in his ſweet, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, drawing nature; and yet an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in his reſolute ſlout carriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who were evill.</p>
            <p>The other is this (which makes all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb facs="tcp:7448:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and lovely indeed) though God hath raiſed you high in birth, in abilities, in the eſteeme of men both good and bad; yet the luſtre of the humilitie of your ſpirit ſhines beautifully thorow all, manifeſting it ſelfe in much gentleneſſe and meekneſſe; and this is the height of all true excellency. A man of underſtanding is of an excellent ſpirit, ſaith <hi>Salomon, Prov. 17. 27.</hi> the word in the Originall, is, <hi>A coole ſpirit. In alſo poſito non altum ſapere diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile eſt, &amp; omnino inuſitatum; ſed quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inuſitatius, tanto glorioſius,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard, ep. 42.</hi> The Lord carry on your truely noble and generous ſpirit, that you may long hold forth the power, beauty and excellency of his grace. Let the height of all your deſignes be, to liſt up the Name of the great God. <hi>2 Cor. 5. 9. We labour,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whether preſent orab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to bee accepted of him:</hi> the word tranſlated, <hi>Labour,</hi> loſeth the elegancy of it, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; we love the honour of it; it is ſuch a labour as we account it our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory: We are ambitious; to have high deſignes for God is a holy and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ambition; whereas the ambition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men is low, &amp; baſe: <hi>Infoelix prorſus
<pb facs="tcp:7448:5"/>
ambitio, quae ambire magna non novit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> Account your ſelfe bleſſed <note place="margin">Bern. pag. 1010.</note> when your God is bleſſed. It was the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Shem, Gen. 9. 26. Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Shem; the chiefe of <hi>Shems</hi> bleſsing was, that his Lord God was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That which I ſeeke, is to ingage your Lordſhip for God, and to ſtirr you up to anſwer fully the eſteeme, the expectations that men have of you, whoſe eyes are upon you as a publike bleſsing, &amp; an ornament to the proſeſsion of the truth. And yet this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Lordſhip would conſider, (as I know you doe) that Religion is a greater honour, and ornament to you, than you are to it; it doth and will more honour you, than you ever did, or can honor its Your birth made you honourable, but oh how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable have you beene, ſince you have beene pretious in Gods eyes! <hi>Eſay 43. 4.</hi> Your parts were alwayes hopefull, but how apparently have they beene raiſed ſince grace hath ſanctified them? Although God takes it well at the hands of thoſe whom hee hath raiſed in the things of the world higher than others, when hee ſeeth them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſetting out his praiſe; yet he would not have them thinke that he is beholding
<pb facs="tcp:7448:5"/>
to them, as if the honour of God depended ſo upon them, as it would faile, did not they put to their helpe. No, God can raiſe his honour by other meanes, he can glorifie himſelfe, and get himſelfe a great name, by low, meane, and contemptible things: It is not becauſe God hath need of honour from you, but becauſe he delights to honour you, that he is pleaſed to uſe you in his ſervice; It is an advancement to whatſoever great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you have in the world, to bee imployed for God, were it but in the meaneſt ſervice he hath to doe. Where the heart is right, even in that, it gloryeth more than in all the dignity that earth can put upon it; But yet the greater Inſtruments the Lord rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up for his glory, the greater ſervices he cals them unto, the greater things may wee hope he intends for his Church.</p>
            <p>When S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Elders caſting downe their crownes before the Throne, ſaying; <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive glory, and honour, and power,</hi> Apoc. 4. 10. ſoone after S. <hi>John</hi> heard <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature in heaven, and on earth, and ſea, ſaying, Bleſſing, honour, glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and unto the Lambe for
<pb facs="tcp:7448:6"/>
evermore,</hi> cha. 5. 13. And ſoone after that, hee ſaw Chriſt with his Crowne upon him, going forth <hi>conquering, and to conquer</hi> Chap. 6. 2. What great mercies might we expect, did we ſee God rayſing up truely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and generous ſpirits, more generally in the great ones of the earth? did we ſee the Elders and Nobles, caſting downe their Crownes before the Throne of the Lambe, willing to deny all their glory, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and eſtates, for the raiſing up the glory of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Certainly, God hath great things to doe in this latter age of the world, and hee is a God with whom there is as great abundance of ſpirit as ever, when his time comes, how ſoone will ſuch a thing bee, as the raiſing mens ſpirits to higher and more noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, than now we can imagine?</p>

               <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> would not defile himſelfe with the portion of the Kings meat, nor with the wine which he dranke; hee had rather eat pulſe than defile his conſcience.

Happily ſome temporizing politician will charge <hi>Daniel</hi> of indiſcretion: no, it was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his ſpirit, that in caſe of danger, and that of life, he would not ſeparate external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from inward faith, when God ſhould loſe by it: And what, doſt thou charge him with indiſcretion, whom the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for his wiſdome?

Such ſpirits have true excellency in them, &amp; are not ſhie of the wayes or ſervants of God, when the flouds of iniquity overflow, &amp; threaten to beare down all.

It is the honour of Religion, to have ſuch Diſciples as will own her, and ſtand for her at all times, and that with an undaunted courage, <hi>Acts 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

               <p>Herein, firſt, what this other ſpirit is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wherein the excellency of it lies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, apply it.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; it is, firſt, a ſpirit that hath other principles, a better princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled <note place="margin">1</note> ſpirit than the ſpirit of the world. The ſpirits of worldly men have baſe corrupt principles, by which they judge of things, by which they are led, according to which they favour &amp; rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh whatſoever is propounded to them. The vileneſſe and power of theſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7448:15"/>
in the wayes of the world; but the ſpirits of the godly are acted by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, heavenly, holy principles, that carry them to God, to divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; they carry them by a kind of naturall inſtinct; the frame of their ſpirits is ſo principled, that by as it were a naturall inſtinct, (naturall, I mean the new nature) they ſavour of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and heavenly things; their hearts worke after them, cloze with them, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themſelves to them, finde much ſweet and contentment in them, are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſetled unto them. What is the reaſon the ſame truths propounded, ſet before divers ſpirits, whoſe naturall parts are equall; one ſees much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them, receives them, relliſhes them; the other looks on them as mean and fooliſh things, wonders what men ſee and finde in them, they are unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, their hearts turne away from them? This is from their divers principles. Where the ſpirit is well principled, it is carryed on ſweetly and ſtrongly in Gods wayes; though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts bee weake, though obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>Every life hath principles accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7448:16"/>
to the nature of it, receiving to it ſelfe things ſutable, or turning from things diſagreeable to it; the vegetative life according to the nature of it, ſo the ſenſitive, and the rationall life, and the life of grace according to it. Moſt mens ſpirits are led by the principles of a ſenſitive life, few live ſo high as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principles reach to. There is a death of the ſoule in this reſpect; onely God puts in by a common worke of his Spirit, ſome common notions, which appeare in ſome, which give but a glimmering light, and are very weake; but where the life of grace is in any ſoule, there are principles of an higher nature, full of light and beauty, carrying the ſoule to high, ſpirituall, ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, for the attaining to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the higheſt good. Other creatures under the rationall, are made for the enjoyment of no higher good, than is within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of their owne natures; &amp; therfore their principles are onely to receive in ſuch good things as are ſutable to thoſe natures, and in them they reſt ſatisfied; for they are capable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7448:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of enjoyment of no higher; I ſay, they cannot enjoy any higher: indeed they are of uſe to, and were made for that end, that they might be ſerviceable to ſome higher good than themſelves; but this they enjoy not. The deſtruction of their natures, is the higheſt uſe that creatures which are above them, have of them. But the rationall creature was made for a higher good than is within the compaſſe of its own nature, and was to enjoy this; and the fuller it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, the more perfected it is. Now then, there are required principles of life accordingly to carry theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures higher than their owne natures, to have the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that good they were made for, and to bee bleſſed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. Now theſe are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Grace, with which this other ſpirit is indued, higher above the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon, than the principles of reaſon are above the principles of ſenſe; and thus it is another ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it works by another rule: every thing is guided to its end by ſome rule, which is a beame of Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7448:17"/>
no creature under the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, knowes either its end or rule, but is acted by God to that it was made for: but the reaſonable creature is of ſuch a nature, as is capable of the knowledge of both, and therefore cannot bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py without the knowledge of both, and working accordingly. Now it is a great mercy not to miſtake in the rule that leades to eternall life, to ſee it, and act by it; moſt of the world miſtake here, their ſpirits are led by falſe rules, they goe according to ſenſe, according to their own carnall apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of things, accordings to their owne wils, would have the rule of their actions from their own ſpirits, or elſe <hi>according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of the world,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. That which men bleſſe themſelves in, that they goe according to the common courſe, is one of the moſt apparent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that is, that yet they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the way of life; but the godly they make the Word their rule, they looke up to the minde of God, to ſee the beame of Divine wiſdome let down from heaven, to guide them in their

way; they looke to it for direction, give up themſelves to it, dare venture their comforts, eſtates, ſafeties, ſoules upon it: <hi>Thou ſhalt guide mee by thy counſell,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, and ſo bring mee</hi>

A godly man thinkes it a moſt diſhonorable thing to make the examples of men his rules; it is for beaſts to follow the Herd: Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men cannot ſatisfie his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A godly man workes for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore is carefull to worke by rule; as a man when hee workes in a worke that concernes his life, erects a frame that muſt be for continuance; he makes ſure of his rule, layes often his rule to his worke. When God erected the frame of the world, which was to laſt but for a ſew yeares, hee made all by waight and meaſure: The frame of mans actions here, muſt be for eternity; and therefore a godly man dares venture upon no other rule but that which is divine; hee lookes at the Word, not only at the notions of it, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and beauty he ſees in it, ſhining a great way off; but as a light to his feet,

a Lanterne to his ſteps; holds it cloſe to his feet, to guide him in his going; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that every ſtep he goes, is either to hell or to heaven; and this doing, he may look up with comfort for that bleſſing of God upon his ſervants: 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 9.

Thirdly, <hi>another ſpirit.</hi> that is, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about other things; it is not for meane, baſe ſervices; but ſet on worke about high and honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As men of place and dignity have, or ought to have other ſpirits dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from ordinary ſpirits; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be employed in mean and diſhonorable workes: no, thoſe fit for meane, baſe ſpirits. While other mens ſpirits are buſied about low, poore things, and are content in theſe, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing higher; they are buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout great affaires of State, the high things of the Kingdome, conſultations about, and tranſactions of the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of the Common-wealth.

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7448:19"/>

               <p>Thus godly men account it too mean a thing, for their ſpirits to bee buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout low baſe employments; while the ſpirits of other men are buſied about meat, drink, clothes, play, money, luſt, and are taken up in theſe poore things; the ſpirits of the godly are taken up in contemplation of the glory of the bleſſed God, the beauty and high excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, the great Counſels of God, in the greateſt worke that ever he did, the worke of mans Redemption, the great myſteries of the Goſpell, the glorious things of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, the great things of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the intereſt they have in all the good in God, Chriſt, Heaven, about the ſetting out the glory of the bleſſed God in the World, lifting up his Name, working together with God in glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelfe, obſerving Gods wayes

in his glorious workes of Creation, and Providence, preparing and fitting themſelves for the glorious appearing of the great God; joyning with thoſe bleſſed creatures, the Angels and Saints in heaven, magnifying, praiſing, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and adoring the Lord of all; theſe are things fit for the ſpirits of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are not ſuteable to the ſpirits of the world, as <hi>Pſal. 92. 6. A brutiſh man knowes not, neither doth a foole underſtand this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A godly man ſometimes may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in meane low things, but his ſpirit not contented, not taken up, not ſatisfied in thoſe things, as adequate objects for him, as the ſpirits of the world are, they are objects adequate to any principles they have: A man ſometimes that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, may condeſcend to ſport with children in low things, but theſe take not up his ſpirit, as adequate objects to what hee hath in him; if indeed hee ſhould take content and ſatisfaction in ſuch things, it would argue a childiſh ſpirit in him; So here.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this ſpirit is carried to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">4</note>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7448:20"/>
ends; the ſpirit of the world looks at eaſe, pleaſure, honour, gaine, and <hi>Selfe</hi> in all; it is a low ſpirit in an ill ſenſe, ſubjecteth not only ordinary actions, but the beſt things it doth, even the duties of Gods worſhip to baſe, low, unworthy ends: At the higheſt, the moſt excellent of the Heathen, who had the moſt brave ſpirits the World had in their time, aimed no higher than to work according to reaſon, to ſatisfie the dictates of rationall principles, and a naturall conſcience; knew not what it was to honour God; to aime at God in all they did: but the ſpirit of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a raiſed ſpirit, looks at God and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in all it doth, carries things up to the higheſt good, reſtleſſe till it gets through all creatures, and cloſes with God; it accounts the excellency of what it is, and what it hath, to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God, and directs what it doth to him, and in this comes as neere the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God himſelfe, workes as like him, as may be; it is the glory of God to bee the firſt cauſe, and laſt end; and to worke from himſelfe, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7448:20"/>
No creature can worke from it ſelfe, but as it hath his principle from God, ſo it workes for him, giving him the glory, as the firſt cauſe, and laſt end: and this is the great worſhip that God hath from his creature, both in this world and eternally in heaven.</p>
               <p>We ſpeake much of honouring God, and ſerving God, and worſhipping of him; wee doe nothing except wee doe this; God made the world that hee might have ſome creatures to worke thus, to make him the higheſt and laſt end of all; many who have excellent naturall parts, are often buſied about deeper things then other men, but their ſpirits being corrupt, not carried to God in that they doe, they dive deepe, but all comes to nothing; are like children diving deepe in the water, and bring up nothing but ſhels and gravell.</p>
               <p>Now where the ſpirit is carried to <note place="margin">1</note> God as the laſt end, there firſt, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, glory of what ever it hath or doth, is iudged according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it hath to God; Its true, I have theſe mercies, I do ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7448:21"/>
things; but is God honoured by all? al things are as dead to this ſpirit, where it ſees not Gods Name lifted up: and ſo the excellency and beauty of what others have or do, if God is not honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, it lookes on them as dead things. Secondly, all it hath, is, or doth, lies in an abſolute ſubiection under God, to bee at his diſpoſe; all things are abſolutely ſubject to the laſt end. Thirdly, where God is aimed at, as the higheſt end, there Gods glory is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led infinitely; no limits, no bounds ſet to the deſires, or endeavours of the ſoule after it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, thjs ſpirit hath other qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; the ſpirits of the godly are <note place="margin">5</note> glorious within: As, 1. it is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned <note place="margin">1</note> ſpirit; the light of the glory of God, in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, hath ſhined into it, and transformed it into the ſame image. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 11.

The Devill will not ſet upon ſuch with ordinary temptations, hee knowes it is in vaine; when he comes upon them, it is with temptations of a higher nature, of ſtronger efficacy; as ſome mens bodies are of ſuch ſtrong conſtitutions, as that which will work mightily upon others, will not ſtirre them: So it is with mens ſpirits, the devill need not trouble himſelf much about many; the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſleighteſt temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are enough
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7448:28"/>
to draw them to what hee would have: yea, and ſuch who account themſelves to be of brave, of more than ordinary ſpirits too, who can ſtand out ſtrongly againſt GOD, and his truth, againſt the ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; the drawing motives, the powerfull perſwaſions of the Word, they move them not at all; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poore temptation of the Devill drawes them any way; they have no power to reſiſt, but are led as the Oxe to the ſlaughter, and as the foole to the ſtocks. The godly man is ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 10. Other men are ſtrong in their luſts, and in the power of them againſt the Lord and his truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they can overcome ſtrong corruptions: temptations from without have not ſuch power, as corruptions that are within; yet when theſe riſe up like a flood, <hi>This ſpirit of the Lord in them, ſets up a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard againſt them, Eſay</hi> 59. 19. Yea, by a contrary ſtreame oppoſeth and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7448:29"/>
overcomes them. The more ſutable any corruption is to the naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the more powerfully it hath heretofore prevailed, the more ſtrongly it would now put forth it ſelfe, the more doth this ſpirit keepe it under above all others. Every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpirit can oppoſe, and be able to reſiſt ſome meane, contemptible ſinne, which brings little pleaſure, or profit with it: when ſin is, as it were, weakned and benummned by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; then they can caſt it off: when the ſtrength of it is abated for want of fewell, for want of opportunities of acting, for want of bodily ſtrength to put it forth; then they can leave their ſinne: as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> came upon the <hi>Sichemites</hi> when they were ſore, and overcame them; ſo they can come upon their ſinne, in times of affliction, and overcome it; &amp; this they thinke to be repentance, which is a miſtake. But this ſpirit can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſinne, when it is in the vigour and ſtrength, and activity of it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it then. Let God put this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7448:29"/>
Spirit into one who is yong &amp; ſtrong, whoſe bones are full of marrow who hath the world ſmile on him, and may have opportunities to the full to enjoy his luſt; yet now he ſhall be able to overcome his corruption, &amp; prevaile againſt the ſtrongeſt luſt. As it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Hebr. 11. 25. When he was of full years,</hi> he then could deny himſelf, and refnſe the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh.

               <p>Thirdly, it is ſtrong to bear ſtrong afflictions, as a ſtrong bodyed man <note place="margin">3</note> can indure cold and hard weather, which others dare ſcarce put out their heads into; ſuch difference is there in the ſpirits of men, in regard of their bearings of afflictions; ſome are alwayes complaining, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">Invalidum om ni naturâ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A little thing will break the ſpirits of theſe men, a little thing will cauſe them to ſinke and pine away, and in a deſperate ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſſe to make away themſelves. <hi>If thou fainteſt in adverſity, thy ſtrength is ſmall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 24. 10.

                  <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was of a bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſpirit, and exceeding ſcornfull in time of his proſperity; he went on with a high hand againſt God, as if he meant to conteſt with heaven it ſelfe: but marke in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11. when he was brought into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what a poore, baſe ſpirit he had: he runnes amongſt the thornes, he hides himſelfe in the buſhes, and from thence he is taken, and bound in Fetters.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7448:32"/>
Will your comforts hold out in ſore and grievous diſtreſſes? this were a ſigne of ſtrength of ſpirit indeed. The ſpirit of a man can ſuſtaine his infirmity, ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi> This is the ſtrength of a mans ſpirit, to be able to carry it ſelfe bravely, undauntedly in the middeſt of greateſt afflictions; your ſpirits can beare nothing, they are childiſh, poore weake ſpirits, not to be accounted the ſpirits of men. <hi>Lactantius</hi> boaſts of the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Noſtri (ut de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris taccam) pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri &amp; mulierculie tortores ſuos ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citi vincunt, &amp; expromere illis gemitum nec ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis poteſt, <hi>Lib. 5. cap.</hi> 13.</note> of the ſpirits of the Martyrs in his time, in this reſpect; Our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and women (not to ſpeake of men) doe in ſilence overcome their tormentors and the fire cannot fetch ſo much as a ſigh from them.</p>

No, ſaith he, this is mercenary; but I will chooſe a friend, that I may have one, to ſhew love unto, to viſit if hee bee ſick, to help if hee bee in want: So for men to chooſe a God unto themſelves, that they may be helped out of troubles, that they may have their eſtates bleſſed, that they may get ſuch and ſuch things by, to make this the higheſt end is merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and too low for a true, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, generous ſpirit; but to chooſe a God, to be my God, that I may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, love, fear, worſhip him for ever, this is true Chriſtian generouſneſſe.</p>

               <p>A generous ſpirit ſtrives to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in doing good, and leaves it ſelfe with God, let God doe with him what ſeemes good in his eyes; it doth not maintain jealous, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of God, as if it were beſt to provide for it ſelfe, and not dare to venture upon God: Baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſpirits diſcover themſelves much in this; they will part with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but firſt will ſee what they ſhall have; they muſt have preſent pay, bee ſure of it in the hand; they are jealous and ſuspicious of every one, they are conſcious to themſelves of baſeneſſe this way, and therefore look upon all others, as if there were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7448:39"/>
onely for themſelves too: but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit findes in it ſelfe a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ready to doe good to others, though they can doe little for him; yet if they need, and he able, he finds hee can freely, and readily doe it; and this makes him to venture upon others, that they will likewiſe out of freedome and generouſneſſe, bee helpfull to him, if occaſion, if need ſerve, though they ſhould not receive recompence from him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not ready to entertaine jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; ſuſpicious thoughts, as other baſer ſpirits doe.

But one of a generous ſpirit knowes in himſelfe, that he can love others, not onely becauſe he receives good from them, but that he may do good to them; and therfore ſees this to be infinitely more in God, and therefore can relie upon Gods love in ſenſe of his owne unworthineſſe. Though the Lord can receive no good from me, yet he can doe good unto me; and this I beleeve is the glorious excellency of the Lord, and therefore my ſpirit ſhall not give way to ſuſpicious thoughts of his love: As <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>my houſe bee not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

is the ſtrongeſt Motive to draw it up to holineſſe; yea, <hi>To perfect holineſſe in the fear of God, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And therefore it caſts out jealous &amp; ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thoughts of the goodneſſe, and love of the bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> as fruits of baſeneſſe of ſpirit.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7448:41"/>
it was in the other. Though a godly man minds high things above others, yet can be well contented to be uſed in the meaneſt ſervices for the good of others; though he be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, yet judges himſelfe leſſe than the leaſt of the Saints: Though he aimes at the higheſt pitch of godlineſſe, yet bleſſe <hi>God</hi> for, and makes much of the leaſt breathings of his Spirit; and ſuch a heart is pretious indeed in <hi>Gods</hi> eies: this, <hi>O Lord, thou canſt not deſpiſe, Pſa.</hi> 51. 17. ſo the words are. <hi>God</hi> can deſpiſe Kings and Emperours, <hi>God</hi> can deſpiſe the glory and luſtre of the world; but a humble broken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Lord cannot deſpiſe. There is no object that <hi>God</hi> accounts worth the looking at in the world, but ſuch a one: <hi>Eſa. 66. 2. To him will I looke,</hi> ſayes <hi>God.</hi> The higheſt heavens, and the loweſt heart, are the two places of <hi>Gods</hi> moſt glorious reſidence.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it is a publike ſpirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged for publike good; not a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <note place="margin">7</note> baſe, ſtraightned ſpirit. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7448:41"/>
doth mightily enlarge the heart of a man: The Lord perſwade <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem;</hi> the words ſignifie, The Lord enlarge the heart of <hi>Iaphet.</hi> When a man is converted, his heart is enlarged; and it muſt needs bee ſo, for now the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes after the enjoyment of God, an infinite univerſall good: now it opens it ſelfe to receive and imbrace a God, in whom it expects all good; before it followed after ſome poore drops of good in the creature; but now findes all is to bee enjoyed in God himſelfe; and being thus enlarged to receive an univerſal good, it deſires to enlarge it ſelfe, as much as it can, to be an univerſall good, but that is proper to God: yet a publike good it may be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpreads it ſelfe as farre as it can. Now it loves good as good, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular private grounds; and therefore the more good, the more beloved. It mindes good, as in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God; and therefore where God may bee moſt honoured, there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7448:42"/>
the heart moſt ſollicitous, moſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious: it is willing therefore to empty it ſelf of it's private good, that the publike may bee furthered. If Nature will venture it's own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good, for the generall, (as heavy things will aſcend contrary to their natures, to keep out vacuity, and ſo to preſerve the Univerſe) much more then will Grace. Every godly man, one way or other, according to the abilities he hath, is a publike bleſſing to the place where hee lives. The Saints of God are compared to a cloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. the compariſion is true in this reſpect; a Cloud waters the earth as a common bleſſing, ſo are they; not as water-pots, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but a few ſpots of ground in a garden. And this publikeneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is then right, and truely gracious;</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it is content to doe publike good, where it ſelfe ſhall be taken little notice of; as, many times the Engine that doth all in great workes, is (inward, hidden) not taken notice of.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:7448:42"/>
Secondly, when he can bee glad, that any publike good worke goes on, and proſpers, though others bee uſed in it, and not himſelfe, to the eclipſing of his light.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when he is willing to be uſed in any ſervice, though but to prepare worke for others, which they, not hee, ſhall have the glory of after he is gone. As <hi>Luther,</hi> writing to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> encouraging him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrong oppoſition that they met with in the cauſe of God; <note place="margin">Potens eſt Deus cauſam ſuam la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentem ſervare, lapſam erigere; ſi nos digni non erimus, fiat per alios. <hi>Melchior A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. in vit.

                  <hi>God</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>is able to preſerve his owne cauſe falling, and to raiſe it fallen; if we be not worthy, let it be done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Such a publike ſpirit as this is, is an excellent ſpirit indeed.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it is a ſanctified ſpirit: 1 Theſſ. 4. 8, <hi>He hath made us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his holy ſpirit:</hi> Chap. 5, 23. <hi>I pray God ſanctiſie you throughout, your whole ſpirit and ſoule.</hi> Sanctified, that is,</p>

but is pure; purity conſiſts in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from mixture with that which is of a baſer nature, if mixt with that which is of a ſuperiour nature, that doth not make the thing impure; as when ſilver is mixed with gold, but when it is mixed with lead or droſſe. The ſpirits of the godly are mixed with grace, but that makes them more excellent and pure; ſuch mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſpirituall excellency that is above the excellency of the ſoule, their ſpirits cloſe with: but if there come any mixture with that which is baſe, beneath the excellency of the ſpirit, this defiles, and this their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot cloſe with, but are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the evill of it, and never leave working till they have purged it out from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Sanctified, that is, God hath <note place="margin">2</note> ſet them apart for himſelfe; as <hi>Pſal. 4. 3. Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelfe,</hi> and they have devoted, dedicated, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated themſelves, to and for God; they are ſpirits reſigned, given up to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:7448:43"/>
3 All the parts, abilities, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of this Spirit are ſanctified, <note place="margin">3</note> a higher excellency is put upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than they have in the ſpirits of other men; weake, naturall parts in theſe, are more excellent than the ſtrongeſt not ſanctiſied: As the conſecration of Wood, and Leather, and meane things, put greater excellency upon them, than Gold and Silver had, that were not ſo conſecrated; yet the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the naturall parts are of a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſpirit, the more excellent it is.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is able to make a ſanctified uſe of what it meddles withall, of <note place="margin">4</note> what it hath to deale in; of all the workes and wayes of God, it makes all to be holy to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It is a true heroicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; none have ſuch brave heroicall ſpirits as Gods ſervants have; it is not diſcouraged by difficulties, it wil ſet upon things a ſluggiſh ſpirit thinks impoſſible; it will goe through that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſuch a one thinks can never be; it breaks through armies of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it might goe on in its way,

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7448:44"/>
godly man can ſhake them off, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Viper that hung upon his hand, and feele no hurt; it beares off many hardſhips, that are like to bee very grievous to fleſh and bloud, that it is like to meet with, which diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the hearts of many, both from beginning to enter upon Gods ways, and from continuance in them after ſome entrance made; as the other Spies that were ſent with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> their hearts fainted, they tell of great difficulties are like to bee met with; The land indeed is good, but there are children of <hi>Anak</hi> there, and walls that reach up to Heaven; but this was the brave heroicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> their ſpirits were undaunted, they would goe up and poſſeſſe the Land, let what ever could bee ſtand in their way. Thus many have convictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of conſcience that the wayes of God indeed are good, but the great hardſhips that they are like to ſuffer in thoſe ways, keep them off; But a true godly ſpirit, is willing to embrace Religion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7448:45"/>
with all the hard terms annex'd unto it; it is a poore, meane ſpirit that muſt indent with God a forehand: If I were ſure to hold out, to have at laſt that which I deſire, then I would venture upon the wayes of godlines; but I am afraid it will never be: and ſo ſinks, and hath no mind to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work.

If the Worthies of God in former times, had ſtood upon every difficulty, what had been done in Gods cauſe? No, this ſpirit ſets upon that which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7448:45"/>
God cals it to, doth what it can, and leaves it ſelf, and the iſſue of its work to God, as <hi>Ioab 2 Sam. 10. 12. Let us play the men for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good:</hi> It was a brave ſpeech of him, that ſhewed an excellent brave ſpirit in him.</p>
               <p>A poor low ſpirit, thinks every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty an impoſſibility; but this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not eaſily entertain thoughts of impoſſibility in ſervices that are noble and worthy of choice ſpirits; it will rather thinke with it ſelfe; Was there never any ſuch thing done before? or was there never any thing that had as much difficulty as this in it? that was as unlikely as this, to come to a good iſſue and yet was at laſt accompliſhed? why may not this then be done? and ſo ſets about it, without any more obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings againſt it, with this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Quic quid ſieri potuit, poteſt;</hi> That which hath been done, may be done. Such a ſpirit as this is aſhamed to ſee and heare, &amp; reade what great things
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7448:46"/>
have beene done by others, and what poor things it hath all this while been imployed in. <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> that ſeeing <hi>Alexanders</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he fetched a deepe ſigh, becauſe he at that age had done ſo little. Yea, ſo farre is a true heroicall ſpirit from being diſcouraged by difficulties, as its raiſed by difficulties; thus its ſaid of a true godly man, that <hi>hee ſtirres up himſelfe againſt the hypocrite, that hee holdes on his way, and growes ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger,</hi> Iob 17. 8, 9. When a difficulty, when any oppoſition, or danger comes in Gods wayes, now it ſees an opportunity offered of ſhewing ſo much the more love to Ieſus Chriſt, ſo much the more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and power of grace, to bring ſo much the more honour to God and his cauſe, and in this it rejoyces; this was the reaſon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, rejoyced ſo much in their ſufferings for Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the ſpeciall qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this other ſpirit, theſe are the bright gliſtering Pearles, with which a godly ſoule, the Kings daughter, the Spouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full within, and enlightned, free, roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſublime, humble, ſanctified, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, heroicall, ſerious, active, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirit; this is another ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not the common ordinary ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, another ſpirit, it feeds upon <note place="margin">6</note> other comforts, differing from thoſe that common ſpirits feed upon: Every life draws to it things ſutable to the nature of it, and findes ſome kinde of content and comfort in the enjoyment of ſuch things. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count life no life, except it hath the fillings of it, with things ſutable,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7448:49"/>
from whence it may have comfort, according to the variety of ſeverall principles, whereby every creature that hath life, lives; ſuch is the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of comforts in the world: So the life of this ſpirit muſt have comforts ſutable to it, and becauſe it differs from the life of other ſpirits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comforts of it are different, it lives upon other comforts. The life of a Dog is maintained by carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a Swine by ſwill, of a Toade by poyſon; but what doth a man care for theſe? though Carrion lie in the ditch, though Swill bee in the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, though poyſon caſt upon the dunghill, he cares not for them; for his life is maintained by, and hee feeds upon other comforts. Thus though the men of the world living by ſenſe and luſt, have no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to feed upon, but ſuch as are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them; but the godly having a life that hath higher and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principles, they feed upon high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more noble comforts.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> lived the

life of a beaſt, hee fed on graſſe; but after, when he was reſtored to his Kingdome, and began to live the life of a King, he had other comforts to feed upon, and delight himſelfe in. The joy of the ſpirits of the godly are like the light of the Sunne, fed by heavenly influence; but the joyes of other men, are as the light of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, fed by baſe and ſtinking matter: for ſo <hi>Solomon,</hi> makes the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Prov. 4. 18. <hi>The righteous is as the Sunne, that ſhines more and more unto the perfect day;</hi> and the joyes of the wicked he compares to a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, Prov. 24. 20. <hi>The Candle of the wicked ſhall be put out.</hi> The men of the world <hi>have ſeduced ſpirits, they ſeed upon aſhes, Eſa.</hi> 44. 20.

                  </gap>, the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the minde; noting that all true mirth muſt come from the right frame of the minde. As for other mirth, I have ſaid of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, What doſt thou? As when the humours of the body are all in a right temper, there is a ſweet ſenſitive delight in the body; much more in the ſpirit, when the faculties and the frame of it are in a right temper. Spirituall comforts are ſuch as are above the ſoule, and therefore put an excellency upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7448:51"/>
it; the comforts that are in things beneath the faculty, cannot but bee meane, and doe debaſe it. How much beneath the excellency of the ſpirit of a man, is the fleſh of beaſts, the juyce of the Grape, or any vaine ſports, or whatſoever may give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the ſenſitive part? but there are comforts that are above the ſoule, ſpirituall, heavenly, divine things, and theſe this ſpirit feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are comforts that the ſpirit rejoyces in before the Lord: That a ſweet and bleſſed joy indeed, that is enjoyed before the Lord; and when the Lord moſt preſent, moſt enjoyed. Other vaine ſenſuall ſpirits have joy, but not before the Lord; the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the preſence of the Lord damps all: and therefore they deſire <hi>not to have mention made of the Name of the Lord,</hi> Amos 6. 10.

feed upon ſuch comforts, is a choyce bleſſing indeed. They are ſpirituall comforts, for they are adminiſtred to the ſoule by a ſpeciall worke of the Holy Ghoſt: it is the office that the Holy Ghoſt is deſigned to, by the Father and the Sonne, to bee the Comforter, to bring in ſutable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to the ſpirits of his ſetvants; and ſurely the holy Ghoſt will not be failing in this worke of his, as the Father and the Sonne have been full and glorious in all their workes, ſo is the Holy Ghoſt in his; and therefore ſuch muſt be the comforts of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Gods ſervants, as muſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a glorious worke of the Holy Ghoſt, in the diſcharge of that he is ſent to doe by the Father and the Sonne.

of the godly, by the appointment of the Father and the Sonne? Surely theſe muſt needs be ſoule-ſatisfying, ſoule-raviſhing conſolations: God is the God of all conſolation, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here are all conſolations. There is ſurely infinite good &amp; ſweetneſſe, treaſures of all excellency in God, and what are they all for, but to bee comforts for the ſpirits of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to rejoyce in? theſe are not for common ordinary ſpirits, they have meate the world knowes not of; a ſtranger ſhall not intermeddle in theſe joyes: men of ranke &amp; quality, as they are in higher condition than others, ſo their comforts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are much different from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of ordinary people. As God hath raiſed the condition of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple higher than other men, ſo he hath raiſed their comforts; Childrens bread from the Lords owne table, is provided for them, while husks and ſwill ſerves worldly ſpirits. Their comforts ſuch, as are the delights of God himſelfe, &amp; of Ieſus Chriſt;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7448:52"/>
they partake with them in their joyes: and ſurely, ſuch joyes as they come and joyne with them in, muſt needs be ſweet and glorious indeed. <hi>I and my Father</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>will come and ſup with them, and they ſhall ſup with mee.</hi> They have dainties which their ſpirits feed upon, that are ſavoury even to the Father and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Surely, the world miſtakes, who thinks the life of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe not to be a comfortable life; as if the moſt excellent and higheſt life ſhould have the worſt and loweſt condition: ſurely, it is a groſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, to think that the ſpirits of the Saints ſhould bee the moſt ſad and melancholy ſpirits: Gods Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of them, that they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Spiritus Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus est ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

filled with joy. The Birds doe not uſe to ſing when they are on the ground, but when got up into the ayre, when on the top of trees, then they ſing ſweetly. If they be ſad and melancholy, it is becauſe they differ no more from the world than they doe, becauſe they retaine ſo much likeneſſe to your ſpirits, ſtil in them; were they freed altogether from the likeneſſe there remaines in them to your ſpirits, they would never be ſad more, but their ſpirits would be filled with everlaſting joy: For the preſent they joy in things ſutable to them, and ſutablenes is the thing that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes comfort in any creature. If the Swine could expreſſe it ſelf, it would tell you, that no ſuch comfort as in Swill and Dung, and wonders that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature can take comfort in any other thing like to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is the moſt ſutable to their natures: Thus worldly brutiſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, becauſe theſe low vile things are ſo ſutable to them, they thinke there can bee no ſuch comfort in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

thing; theſe things they rejoyce in, for they know no better: but if their natures were changed, their greateſt comfort would be in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and vilifying ſuch comforts. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before his converſion, <note place="margin">Quàm ſuave iſtis ſuavitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas carere.</note> could not tell how hee ſhould want thoſe delights hee found ſo much contentment in; but after, when his nature was changed, when hee had another ſpirit put into him, then he ſayes, O how ſweet is it to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe former ſweet delights! You thinke we have no comforts, or at leaſt not like yours; know, we can taſte naturall comforts as well as you, if the poyſon of ſinne bee not mixed with them; and God gives us leave to reioyce in them: God hath made theſe outward comforts for his ſetvants. Surely God hath not made the flowers for Spiders and Frogges, but rather for the Bee to ſuck honey out of them: wee can taſte another manner of ſweetneſſe in them, than you can; for we can taſte the love of God through them;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7448:54"/>
we can taſte them as the comforts that flow from that God, in whom all comfort is; we can taſte them as fore-runners of eternall comforts. A Bee can ſucke her honey out of a flower, that a Flie cannot doe.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe, there are other conveyances of comforts, through which our ſpirits finde comforts to feed on; namely, the Ordinances, where the Lord lets out himſelf in a bleſſed ſweet manner, to the ſoules of his ſervants; and yet beſides, <hi>God</hi> communicates many comforts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, 2 Theſſ. 2. 16. <hi>Now our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and GOD even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlaſting conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Doe you thinke we have no comforts?

Hence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26. it is ſaid, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man if hee gaine the whole world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7448:55"/>
it is ſaid in another Evangeliſt, <hi>Luke 9. 25. What ſhall it proſit a man if hee gain the world, and loſe himſelfe?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpirituall excellencies are the higheſt excellencies; as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, theſe ſpirituall excellencies have this propriety in them, they <note place="margin">1</note> make a man a better man, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are, which bodily excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies doe not, nor all the riches nor honours in the world: A man is not the better man becauſe he hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, cloaths, honours, better dyet than others; theſe are but outward things added to him, no intrinſecall excellencies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe ſpirituall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are the beginnings of eternall <note place="margin">2</note> liſe, the ſame life we ſhall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and hence the work of Gods Spirit in the ſoule, is called, <hi>The Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Spirit;</hi> not a pawne, but an Earneſt: for a pawne is to be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, but an Earneſt is part of the whole ſumme that is to follow. That which we have of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is part of the ſame glory we ſhall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7448:55"/>
have fully in heaven; it is not onely an evidence unto us that there is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comming, but it is a beginning of the glory, the fulneſſe whereof is to come afterward. Such a ſpirit as hath this life, lives a life farre above the common life of the world, even the life of heaven, the ſame life that Angels and Saints do live in heaven, the life of thoſe bleſſed ſpirirs there. Wee miſtake if wee thinke eternall life is only in heaven; eternall life is in this world, in the excellent frame of the ſpirits of Gods ſervants, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 15. Life is the chiefe excellency communicated to the Creature, and the higheſt life, the higheſt excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. There is more diſtance between the excellency of the meaneſt, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt godly man in the world, and the moſt eminent man for parts &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts onely, than betweene the meaneſt and weakeſt godly ſoule, and the moſt eminent glorified Saint in the higheſt heavens; the weakeſt godly man excels him that is moſt eminent in common gifts, more than
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7448:56"/>
the moſt eminent Saint in heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells him: for the glorified Saint is onely higher in ſome degrees in the ſame excellency, which in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yea, and in ſome luſtre, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Saint on earth hath; hee hath that which will at laſt grow up to heavens glory: but the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him, and the man who onely hath the excellencies of parts, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, common gifts, it is eſſentiall: All parts and common gifts in the world can never grow up to this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yea, this is not onely the life of Angels, the life of heaven, but <note place="margin">3</note> the life of God himſelfe; for ſo it is called by God himſelfe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. <note place="margin">Ratio nihil ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udeſt, quam in corpits huma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>. 3. yea, a higher degree than all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the excellencie of this ſpirit is ſuch, as it is one ſpirit with <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. He that is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord, is one ſpirit.</hi> It was the excellencie of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> that hee had the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon him; of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that hee had the ſpirit of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah;</hi> what is it then to have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe? yea to be one ſpirit with him.

               <p>Fourthly, this makes him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">4</note> it is, fit to glorifie God in the world, and ſo the ſoule thus endued, is not onely a glaſſe to repreſent, a living glaſſe to enjoy the comfort of what it doth repreſent; but as a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7448:57"/>
glaſſe to reflect upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of God himſelf, the glory of his own Image, and that by a principle within it ſelf. Other glaſſes can reflect upon the thing whoſe image it hath, if acted by a hand externally; but this by an inward living principle, and ſo gives God his glory actively, which no other creature can doe, but Angels, and mens ſoules, who have theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall excellencies in them. Were it not for a few of theſe ſpirits, what glory would God have in the world? how little would he be minded, or regarded? But theſe are they who have high thoughts of God, who have trembling frames before him, who do reverence, feare, adore, love, cleave to, truſt in, magnifie the Name of the great God in the world; theſe ſanctifie his Name in his worſhip, they worſhip him as a God, they worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and ſuch worſhippers God ſeeks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 23. as theſe he highly eſteemes of, and much rejoyces in; theſe take notice of him in all his creatures, in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7448:58"/>
the wayes of his providence, and uſe the creatures for him, from whom they are; the glory of God is deare and pretious to theſe; this is the excellencie of their ſpirits, they are not ſunke in the dregs of the world, but being kept in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their purity, they worke up to God, doe as it were naturally flow to God, as to their Center.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, theſe are ſuch as are fit to ſtand before the Lord, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <note place="margin">5</note> and enjoy communion with him. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 4. we reade, that thoſe that were judged fit to ſtand in the Kings pallace, before King <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadaezzar,</hi> they muſt have no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, they muſt bee well-favoured, and skilfull in all wiſdome, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in knowledge, &amp; underſtanding ſcience, and taught the learning, and the tongue of the <hi>Caldeans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every ſpirit is not fit to ſtand before the King of heaven, to have converſe with him; none but the reaſonable creature is capable of any ſuch thing as communion with God, and it muſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7448:58"/>
bee the reaſonable creature thus rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they muſt bee men of other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. A man of an excellent ſpirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure converſe with baſe ſordid ſpirits; much leſſe can God, who is that bleſſed holy Spirit. No creature can have communion with another, but ſuch as live the ſame life; hence the beaſt cannot have communion, with man, becauſe mans proper life is rationall; theſe are the ſpirits who being partakers of the life of God, are fitted for converſe and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: Likeneſſe is the ground of all liking in communion, it is the likeneſſe they have to God, that makes God to delight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them; God loves to dwell with theſe, and that in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner. 2 <hi>Corin. 6. 16.

near enough communion with them, <hi>Pſal. 4 1. 12. Hee ſets them before his face for ever,</hi> as loving to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Now how great, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable a dignity is this, for the poor creature to have this neare communion with God? Curſed bee that man, ſaies that noble Marqueſſe, <hi>Marcus Galeaceus,</hi> that prizes all the gold and ſilver in the world, worth one dayes enjoyment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Ieſus Chriſt; he was a man of another ſpirit, who ſpake from his owne experience, of that ſweet he had found of communion with Chriſt, who had parted with much honour and riches for him. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> who were men of other ſpirits in their generations, are ſaid to walke with God: God tooke them up even in this world to walke with him; many a ſweet turne have theſe ſpirits with their God; God delights to have them neare him, that he might reveale and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelfe to them; theſe know much of Gods minde; the ſecrets of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7448:59"/>
the Lord are with theſe, and to them he reveales his Covenant, God doth not love to hide his face from theſe. That hidden wiſdome which the Princes of the World knew not, <hi>which eye hath not ſeene, eare heard, neither hath entred into the hearts of men to conceive, yet hath the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them to us by his Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corin. 2. 10. even by that Spirit, that ſearches the deepe things of God,</hi> and by vertue of this communion, theſe can prevaile much with God; As it is ſaid of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen.</hi> 32. 28. as a Prince hee had power with God and prevailed.

               <p>Sixtly, this ſpirit is fit for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, any employment God cals it <note place="margin">6</note> to; it is a veſſell of mercy, ſitted for the Maſters uſe; Many honourable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7448:60"/>
ſervices God hath to be done in the world; men of ordinary common ſpirits, are not ſit for them; if they ſhould be ſet about them, they would ſpoile the work, and diſhonour God in it. If a man have a choice peece of work, he will not employ one that hath not abilitie to reach to it; hee knowes the work would faile, and it would be his diſgrace. When God would imploy ſome about building his Tabernacle, hee fils them firſt with his Spirit, ſo he ſaith of <hi>Beza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> and <hi>Aholiab.</hi> If a man bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in government, hee had need be a man in whom the Spirit of God is, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 4 1. 3 8. When <hi>God</hi> choſe <hi>Saul</hi> for government, hee gave him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpirit, ſo that hee was another man: When <hi>God</hi> had a peece of work to doe of high eſteeme, beyond <hi>Sauls</hi> reach, hee lookes out for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had a more excellent ſpirit than <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſaith, I have found a man according to mine owne heart, who ſhall fulfill all my will. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7448:60"/>
of a thing is in the uſe of it: What can it do? The excellency of the Angels is, in that they are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits; and the excellency of man is to be ſerviceable; his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is not, that he can eat, and drinke, and ſport, and goe fine, but that he is of uſe, fitted for what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>God</hi> hath to doe in the world, that he can further <hi>Gods</hi> ends in his workes, that <hi>God</hi> may ſay of him, I have found a man according to mine owne heart, that is prepared to fulfill all my will. When <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 6. had his ſpirit purged, ſignified by that ſigne of one of the Cherubims, touching his tongue with a coale from the Altar, he preſently ſhewes the excellency of his ſpirit in this, that when <hi>God</hi> had a choice piece of worke to doe, and askes whom he ſhall ſend, The Prophet readily and cheerfully anſwers, <hi>Lord here am I, ſend me:</hi> doe but ſet the truth of <hi>God</hi> before theſe, it is enough; their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being gracious cloſe with it, yeeld to it, obey it, ſet about the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7448:61"/>
work it ſhewes they ſhould doe; but when mens ſpirits are corrupt and unſavory, there is ſuch a ſtirre to convince them of <hi>Gods</hi> mind, in that which is not agreeable to them; ſo much a doe to prevaile with them to the practice, though convinced, that it would grieve a man to have to deale with them.</p>
               <p>The excellency of the ſpirits of <hi>Gods</hi> people, is ſet out to us very ſweetly in that expreſſion of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſalm. 18. 44, As ſoone as they heare, they ſhall obey me.</hi> There is a wilingneſſe of ſpirit to their worke, what <hi>God</hi> would have, what ever it be; if they apprehend it above their reach, they caſt not off their worke but ſeeke to <hi>God</hi> for ſupply of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, knowing that there is ſpirit enough in <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath wayes enough to enable the ſpirits of his ſervants unto, and carry them on in any worke he ſets them about; they know that <hi>God</hi> will never put any man, upon any ſervices, but by one meanes or other, he will fit his ſpirit
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7448:61"/>
for them: for it is the great delight of God, to have men in ſervice, to be of ſpirits fitted for ſervice. When the Devill himſelfe hath any worke to doe, he chooſeth men who have ſpirits fitted for his worke, and in them he delights; If the worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires boldneſſe and impudence, he hath men of daring ſpirits, who will ſet upon it, and goe thorow with it; If it requires ſubtilty, hee chooſeth men of more moderate ſpirits, who can keepe in their paſſions, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and inſenſibly worke their owne ends. Wee reade, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. the Devill there oppoſeth Gods Saints in fiery and open violence, as a Dragon; but afterward, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. he gives his power to the Beaſt who had ſeven heads, who would worke with more ſubtilty, to draw the world after him; and as wee reade, <hi>Hoſ. 7. 4, 6, 7, verſes,</hi> thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſet up the Calves in <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> were as hot as an Oven in their purpoſes, intentions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but becauſe they ſaw the beſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7448:62"/>
way to have the worke ſucceed, was not to carry it on at firſt by open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, therefore they were content to ſtay; As the Baker ceaſeth from <note place="margin">Cornel. à Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in locum.</note> raiſing after he hath kneaded the dough untill it be leavened, and when it is once leavened, then hee puts it into the Oven; ſo they were content to forbeare a while, untill they had ſent fit inſtruments abroad amongſt the people to leaven them, to prepare them, by perſwading them, that if ſuch a thing were done, it were no great matter; they ſhould ſtill worſhip the true God; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was but the circumſtance of the place; and thus when they were leavened, then they were fit for the Oven; that is, for the purpoſes and intentions, of thoſe who deſired to ſet up the Calves, which were as hot as an Oven. According to any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the Devill hath for men, he hath devices to raiſe their ſpirits to that height of wickedneſſe, as ſhall fit them for it.

Thus you ſee, how the Devill will have mens ſpirits fit for their worke, and when they are fit, then he uſes them, and not before; much more will God looke to have the ſpirits of his ſervants fit for their employments, and then onely he delights to uſe them, and thoſe are the ſpirits who are higly accounted of, who are exceedingly honourable in the ſight of God, who are fitted for his owne ſervice.</p>

Eighthly, this ſpirit makes men fit for any condition that God ſhall put <note place="margin">8</note> them into; they know how to yeeld to God, to ſinde out Gods meaning, to carry themſelves in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as to worke out that which God would have by it; which men of ordinary ſpirits cannot doe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man of a moſt admirable ſweet ſpirit, and he ſhewes it much in this; <hi>I know</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>how to want and how to abound; how to be full, and how to be empty.</hi> Hee could goe through good report and evill report, and keep his way ſtill, and carry his work before him. It is the weakneſſe and vanity of our ſpirits that makes us thinke, that if wee were in ſuch and ſuch a condition, then we could doe thus or thus; this is a temptation to hinder us from the duties of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, by putting our thoughts upon another. It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ones ſpirit, if the preſent condition bee not ſutable to the minde, to make the minde ſutable to the condition, that the preſent which

               <p>HEnce let the men of the world ſee, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; the ſpirits of the godly. There are men indeed of excellent ſpirits, God hath ſuch in the world, in whom he delights, with whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom he employes in high and excellent ſervices: but you are of baſe, ſordid, uncleane ſpirits; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of whoredome, of lying, ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vanity, folly is in you; your ſpirits droſſie, ſenſuall, froward, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, profane, ſleight, empty, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, unfaithfull, perverſe: What delight can the Lord, who is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, holy, glorious Spirit, take in ſuch? How farre are theſe from any communion with God? No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell though nothing of God, or any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7448:66"/>
ſpirituall thing bee ſavory to them. Oh the corrupt principles that mens ſpirits are poſſeſſed with, the corrupt rules they goe by, and corrupt ends they have in what they doe! the baſe imployments they put their ſpirits to, the noiſome diſtempers of them, and baſe comforts they feed upon! <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth,</hi> ſayes the Scripture, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 20. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps your Lands, your houſes may be ſomething worth, but what are your hearts worth? they are worth nothing, full of chaffe and droſſe; like childrens pockets, full of ſtones and dirt, while the ſpirits of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are Store-houſes of moſt choice and pretious treaſures.</p>
               <p>When Grace is gone from the ſoule, the excellency is departed from it; as it was ſaid of <hi>Ruben,</hi> his excellency was departed, in reſpect of that ſinne of his. How many a man or woman, who have faire comely bodies, good complexion, beautifully dreſſed up; but within, ſpirits moſt ugly and horrid; ſpirits
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7448:66"/>
full of filth, full of venome &amp; loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſtempers; ſpirits full of wounds and putrified ſores, breeding filthineſſe continually; nothing elſe but filth and corruption iſſuing out from them: Men of corrupt mindes, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes? How unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any who have the leaſt of God in them? If the Lord ſhould give men but a view of the horrid defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſſe, and filthineſſe of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it would amaze them, and ſinke their hearts in wofull horrour; they could not but abhorre themſelves, as loathſome creatures, fit to be caſt out from the Lord, as an everlaſting curſe: eſpecially, if together with the filth of their owne ſpirits, they had a ſight of the infinite brightneſſe, and glory of the holines of God, who is an infinite, pure, glorious Spirit. God abhorrs not any other filthineſſe, but the filth of ſpirits. The Devills are abhorred of God, becauſe they are uncleane ſpirits. There is no other object of Gods hatred, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſpirits. God made mans
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7448:67"/>
ſoule at firſt, a moſt excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the very glaſſe of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſedome and holineſſe; but now, what an ugly, baſe, loathſome creature is it, where it is not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If mens bodies were deformed, and ranne with loathſome iſſues, and putrified ſores, how dejected would they be in their owne thoughts? But certainly this ſpirit-defilement is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably worſe. If mens bodies were ſo putriſied, that they bred ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine continually (as it is reported of <hi>Maximinus)</hi> how grievous would it be to them? Their ſpirits have theſe loathſome diſeaſes upon them, by which they are infinitely more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. If they had ſuch a diſtemper of body, as their excrements came from them, when they knew not of it; this would be accounted a grievous evill: but their ſpirits ſo corrupt, that much filth comes from them, and they know not of it. Many are ſo deeply putrified in their ſpirits, that they uſually ſweare and ſpeak filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and know not of it; and think this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7448:67"/>
a ſufficient excuſe, that they did not thinke of it.</p>
               <p>It is a rule in nature, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the beſt thing, is alwayes the worſt; as a ſtain in fine Cambrick worſe than in a courſer cloth: So by how much the ſpirit of a man is more excellent naturally, than the body which is the brutiſh part; by ſo much the corruption of the ſpirit is a greater evill than any the body is capable of. The reaſon why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are ſo vile and miſerable now, is becauſe ſinne ſeized upon natures which by Creation were moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. When diſeaſes ſeize on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſpirits in the body, they are the moſt dangerous &amp; deadly. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſeaſes, of al diſeaſes are the greateſt evils, and uſually prove deadly; yea, the leaſt ſpirit-corruption would moſt certainly prove deadly, were it not for the application of that blood that is more pretious than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds. Spirit-defilement is ſuch a defilement as defiles every thing you meddle with; as, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7448:68"/>
                  <hi>To the impure all things are impure.</hi> Of what uſe are men whoſe ſpirits are ſo vile? many make no other uſe of their ſpirits, but to be, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid of the ſenſitive ſoul of the Swine, it ſerved for no other uſe, but to be as ſalt to keepe the fleſh from ſtinking. How are many mens ſpirits employed about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to make proviſion for the fleſh, and the filthy luſts of it? O that an immortall ſpirit capable of eternall communion with the bleſſed God, and to be employed in ſuch high and heavenly exerciſes, as for which it was made, ſhould now come to be ſo farre degenerated and debaſed! Eſpecially, how vile is this, that men who in regard of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and place, are raiſed above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and be truſted with large and bleſſed opportunities of worthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for God and the Church; but they minde nothing but ſatisfying their luſts, to have their ſports; let the cauſe of God, Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth lie bleeding, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7448:68"/>
not. What a lamentable thing is it, to have the weight of great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of conſequence, to depend upon ſuch weak-ſpirited men, who minde nothing but vanity and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? they have no worthy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in their thoughts, their ſpirits ſo effeminated, that they will do or ſuffer any thing for the ſatisfying of their luſts? Others there are, who have remaining in them many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts, pretious naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but of what uſe are they, but to enlarge their ſpirits to be capable of more wickedneſſe than the ſpirits of other men are, wiſe to doe evill, the fitteſt inſtruments for Sathans depths?

               <p>IF the godly be of ſuch excellent ſpirits, learne wee then hence to have a right eſteeme of them; they ſurely are worthy of pretious account, of moſt honorable eſteem, who are men of ſuch excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Let them bee what they will, in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7448:70"/>
regard of their outward condition, though never ſo meane and poore. No matter what the Ring bee, if the Pearle in it be pretious. Many moſt pretious ſpirits have very mean out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. The Tabernacle was beaten Gold within, but the out ſide cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Badgers skines. If the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be rich, what though the veſſell be earthen? Surely, theſe are the excellency of the earth, the very light and beauty of the world, the glory of Gods Creation; they give a luſtre to the places where they live, to the families in which they are; eſpecially if they walke cloſe and faithfully with God indeed, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the excellency of their ſpirits in their wayes; ſo that when they are taken away, the very places where they lived, are darkened. This other ſpirit of the godly makes a <hi>Iob</hi> ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his ſoares on the dung-hill, and a <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſticking in the myrie dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more glorious than Kings and Princes ſitting crowned upon their Thrones: theſe are glorious within.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7448:71"/>
God is a Spirit, and he looks on men, to ſee what they are in their ſpirits; and he eſteems accordingly of them; and ſo ſhould we. What doth brave cloathing, what doth money, what doe titles of honour raiſe the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? what? are theſe to the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of mans nature? No certainly; the excellency of man muſt bee that which muſtmake the moſt excellent and noble part truly excellent, which is the ſpirit of a man. If a man would know the excellency of any thing, as of a ſword, or of any other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he judges it not by the Hilt, or the inferour part; but by what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the principle part hath. There is a ſpirit in man, and the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is from the Almighty; a ſpirit inſpired by the Almighty, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with his heavenly graces; this innobles a man indeed; it is the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the hidden man of the heart, the glorious cloathing of that which makes truely beautifull and glorious. How did many of the Heathen high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prize thoſe, in whom they ſaw any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7448:71"/>
naturall excellency of ſpirit, differing from other men? Thoſe amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who were called the <hi>Curii,</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>abritii,</hi> they lived very poorly and meanly, yet being perceived to have more excellent ſpirits than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, they were taken from their dinner of Turnips and Watercreſſes, to lead the Romane Armie: How much more ſhould we honour men in whom we may ſee Divine ſpirits, the luſtre of heavenly graces ſhining in them? But to ſhew more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that godly men are to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prized in regard of this other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as they have received a ſpirit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from other men, ſo they are to have eſteem and honour differing from other men; not to bee looked at as common men for,</p>
               <p>Firſt, this difference of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from other men, is a certaine <note place="margin">1</note> ſigne of the eternall love of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; it comes from the treaſure of Gods everlaſting love, of that choyce ſpeciall love of God, from the bowels of Gods deepeſt mercies:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7448:72"/>
it is a moſt infallible argument, that God hath ſet his heart upon them for good; as for other favours, a man may have them more than other men, yet they are no ſuch but may ſtand with Gods hatred, and with his eternall wrath: and this is a great difference betweene ſpirituall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and outward mercies, which ſets an exceeding high prize upon ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mercies aboue all others: theſe are the diſtinguiſhing mercies, which others are not. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſpirit receiving <note place="margin">2</note> theſe ſpirituall excellencies from Gods choyce everlaſting love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives likewiſe all other mercies from the ſame fountaine; though in their owne nature they bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercies, yet where this other ſpirit is, there they are received from another Fountaine than other men receive them, which addes much ſweetneſſe and excellencie to the mercies we have; they come as fruits of the common bounty and generall goodneſſe of God to ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7448:72"/>
men; but to men thus differenced from others, they come out the ſpring of the rich treaſures of Gods grace, tending to the furtherance of eternall mercies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord hath an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye upon and delight to dwell <note place="margin">3</note> with theſe, who are of choice and excellent ſpirits; <hi>Hee will dwell with the contrite heart, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, Eſay</hi> 57-15. Hee hath a ſpeciall care of theſe ſpirits, that they doe not faile before him; hee puts under his hand, to ſupport, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, revive them. When wee beate ordinary ſpices, we heed not ſo much every duſt, but ſome flies out and falls on the ground; But if Bezar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or ſome ſpeciall choice coſtly ſpice bee beaten, then there is care had of every duſt, that the leaſt bee not loſt; So though God may afflict the choiceſt ſpirits of his ſervants, yet hee is very carefull that their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits faile not before him; as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common ordinary ſpirits, hee cares not much to let them faile, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7448:73"/>
ſinke in their affliction, but this is the mercifull care of God over thoſe ſpirits, whom he highly eſteems of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The excellencies of this ſpirit, are eternall excellencies, <note place="margin">4</note> they ſhall abide for ever, not vaniſh, not be taken away as common gifts and other mercies ſhall, as, <hi>Ezech. 46. 17. If a Prince give of his inheritance to one of his ſervants, it is to bee his but for a time, and to returne unto the Prince againe; but his inheritance ſhall be to his ſonnes, for them for ever:</hi> So when God gives any thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men, who are but his ſervants at beſt, it muſt returne againe; GOD will call for all his mercies from them againe; but theſe ſoule-mercies of his children, ſhall be their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ever. Hence God calls his Church, <hi>an eternall Excellency, Eſay</hi> 60. 15.</p>
               <p>But fifthly, and principally, theſe other ſpirits are moſt honourable <note place="margin">5</note> creatures indeed, becauſe they are reſerved for other mercies; GOD gives common mercies to common
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7448:73"/>
ſpirits, but hee reſerves his choice mercies for choice ſpirits. <hi>With the pure, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe pure,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 27. The words are, with the choice thou <note place="margin">Electis.</note> wilt ſhew thy ſelfe choice. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> a bottle of water and a few raiſins, and ſent them away; but the inheritance was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So God gives to other men a few ordinary mercies, but his glorious mercies hee reſerves for theſe peculiar ones: and, as it is ſaid of <hi>Iehoſaphat, 2 Chron.</hi> 21. 3. he gave his other ſonnes great gifts of ſilver, gold, precious things, fenced Cities, but the Kingdome he gave to <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt borne: So God gives theſe outward mercies to other men, but the mercies of his Kingdome, are reſerved for theſe men of choice ſpirits, who are the firſt borne, the chiefe and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all Gods creatures in this world. <hi>Now we are the ſonnes of God,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iohn, but it appeares not what wee ſhall bee;</hi> there is more to come
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7448:74"/>
hereafter, they have not ſpirits that will be ſatisfied with the things of this world, and therefore are not as ordinary men, who have their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the things of this world. God delights to fill the capacities of all his creatures with ſutable good; now theſe other ſpirits, by that choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of them, are made capable of farre higher mercies than the world can afford; they muſt be the good things of another world that can fill them, and thoſe are reſerved for them. The bodies of the Saints, becauſe they are joyned to ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoules, ſhall be like the glory of the Sunne, yea, excell in glory. How glorious then ſhall their ſouls be, for whoſe ſake their bodies ſhall bee thus glorious? Wee look upon great heires, who have great inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to come, with high eſteeme, though they have little for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Theſe are the great heires of heaven, Coheires with Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe; theſe they are, who are delivered from the wrath to come
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7448:74"/>
and to be made partakers of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is to be revealed. The Lord gives them no great matters in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon now, becauſe hee hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much for them afterwards. As nature is not very exquiſite in her worke in inferiour things, where ſhe intends ſome higher excellency; So the God of Nature, intending ſuch high and glorious things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for his Saints, doth no ſo much regard to give them theſe inferiour things for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But what are thoſe reſerved mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies you ſpeake of, that God hath for theſe?</p>
               <p>Not entending a Treatiſe of that glory, that <hi>God</hi> hath for his choice ones, onely take theſe five generals.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe mercies are prepared mercies, prepared before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations <note place="margin">1</note> of the world were laid, and againe prepared by Ieſus Chriſt, who is gone before to heaven to that end, as hee tels us himſelfe, <hi>To prepare Manſions for us, Iohn</hi> 14. 1. Now this is ſpoken after the manner
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7448:75"/>
of men, who do not uſe to make long and great preparations but for ſome great worke in hand: Surely, theſe mercies muſt needs be great, which the wiſedome, power, and mercy of <hi>God,</hi> hath been from all eternity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than <hi>Adam,</hi> than Man-kinde <note place="margin">2</note> ſhould have had, than they could have attained unto, if he had ſtood in his innocencie. Man indeed ſhould then have beene for ever happy, but not according to that height of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and glory that now is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thoſe, who are the beloved of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe reſerved mercies, are ſuch as muſt ſet out Gods Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, <note place="margin">3</note> that God may ſhew to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all his creatures what his infinite wiſdome, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can do for poore creatures, to raiſe their conditions to a height of glory; ſurely that glory muſt needs be high, that is raiſed for that end. If a King ſhould doe any thing of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7448:75"/>
purpoſe to ſhew his magnificence, it muſt needs be ſome great thing; it is not a common ordinary thing, that can ſet forth the Magnificence of a King; much leſſe that can ſet forth the Magnificence of the great God. When <hi>Ahaſbuerus</hi> would make a feaſt, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> would build a Pallace, to ſhew to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their greatneſſe, they were great things; ſo ſurely here, that which muſt ſhew the greatneſſe of the great God, muſt needs be great indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe mercies muſt be ſuch, as may ſhew to Angels and all <note place="margin">4</note> the world, how infinitly well pleaſed God the Father is with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Sonne, in giving himſelf up to death, for the purchaſe of, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Surely that mercy thus purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed muſt needs be great. If there had beene no higher good for man, but to eat and drink, and to have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the fleſh, certainly Chriſt would never have died, to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed this; but there were higher things then theſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Chriſt look'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7448:76"/>
at, theſe are but poore things for God to ſhew by them how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is well pleaſed with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſonne to the death; that which muſt demonſtrate this, cannot but bee very great what ever it bee, and that, yea the fulneſſe of that, is the mercy reſerved for theſe choice ones.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Other mercies (in ſome reſpect higher) than the very bleſſed <note place="margin">5</note> Angels themſelves have;</p>
               <p>For, 1 Mans nature is more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced than theirs, being hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically united to the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>2 The righteouſneſſe whereby the Saints come to glory, is a higher righteouſneſſe, a more excellent righteouſneſſe than that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; though theirs be perfect in its kinde, theirs is the righteouſneſſe but of meere creatures, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Saints, is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of that Perſon, which is both God and man.</p>
               <p>3 The ſonneſhip of the Saints,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7448:76"/>
is founded in a higher right, then that of the Angels, namely in the Sonneſhip of the ſecond Perſon in Trinity.</p>
               <p>4 They are the members of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo in a nearer union with him then any other creature.</p>
               <p>5 They are the Spouſe of the Lambe, whereas the Angels are but miniſtring ſpirits, as the ſervants of the Bridegroome, but the Saints are the Bride.</p>
               <p>Surely then, the mercies reſerved for theſe choice ſpirits, are choice and glorious, not onely other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies then others have, or they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have now, but other mercies then they are able to imagine; theſe therefore wee are to looke upon, as moſt bleſſed and honourable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

What? ſhall the worke of Gods grace, wherein the glory of God conſiſts, which is the life of God, the Image of God, the Divine Nature, as hath been ſhewne; ſhall it be the debaſing, the beſotting, the befooling of mens ſpirits? What? doth holineſſe, that makes God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, make man contemptible and vile? doth that which makes God ſo honourable in the eies of the bleſſed Angels and Saints, make man a ſott, and a foole in the eyes of men? Oh! that ever there ſhould bee ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the hearts of men, againſt the grace of God, ever to have ſuch vile conceits of it; pray, if it be poſſible, that this thought of thy hart may be forgiven thee.

Yet when men are godly, their parts are not by their godlines
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7448:79"/>

That is baſeneſſe of ſpirit, and want of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that makes a man a ſlave to ſin, and the Devill; ſo a ſlave, as he hath no heart to any worthy ſervice, to free himſelfe from it; but lies down under it, and carries the fetters and yoake of his bondage about with

Though all the Tiles of the houſes in the City of Wormes, were Devils, yet thither would I goe to teſtifie to the truth, ſaith <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, it is not a turbulent ſpirit; <note place="margin">3.</note> for turbulency of ſpirit makes men cruell and malicious; this ſpirit cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes men to love their enemies, to do all the good they can to them: tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirits ſeeke onely their own ends, they care not what becomes of others; ſo it bee that they may but warme themſelves, they care not what houſe bee on fire: They are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7448:81"/>
boyſterous in things that concerne themſelves. But the Saints of God, in whom this other ſpirit rules, they are meeke and gentle, and yeeldable in their owne cauſe, ready to put up wrong in all quietneſſe: take them in things that onely concerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and you ſhall find none ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, ſo freely, ſo chearfully denying themſelves, as they. And againe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirits doe not love to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine things by rule, to call things to account, but follow their owne fiery humour, and ſet upon their own will with violence: but godlineſſe takes off men from this ruggedneſſe and turbulency of ſpirit, &amp; makes them gentle and peaceable: let them bee never ſo active, never ſo forward, never ſo zealous in any thing, yet if you wil call them to examine things by rule, they will meekly and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently heare you; yea, a childe ſhall leade them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 6. And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; turbule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they are not, for none more obedient to authoritie than they; none ſee that Majeſtie of God
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7448:81"/>
in Autority, as they doe; none obey Authority out of conſcience ſo as they doe. If the will of men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, rather than authority, ſhall require any thing that the authority of Heaven forbids, that they do not; becauſe they cannot obey, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: And ſo ſacred do they account Authority, that they would have no obedience performed to it, but obedience for conſcience ſake. Blind obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Church of God hath long agoe exploded, as too ſervile for Chriſtian ſpirits: this were more ſervile than ſelling mens bodies in the Market for ſlaves, which Chriſtianity abhors. It were too uncharitable a conceit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates, to thinke that they ſhould require of, or expect from any, other obedience, than in, and for the Lord; and in this obedience, thoſe who are godly, are ſo forward, as they are judged turbulent, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-forward to maintaine the honor of Authority, as ſome think; when according to their places they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7448:82"/>
promote the execution of laws made by authority, and that of thoſe lawes which are of the higheſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the furtherance of Piety and Peace.</p>

Thoſe who are the delight of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yea, of God himſelfe, how are they abuſed in this wicked world, as if they were dogges, or the baſeſt ſcumme and filth of the earth? What ſcorne and contempt is caſt upon them? the moſt abject of men think themſelves good enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and abuſe them. Were it not a grievous ſight to ſee ſome baſe drudge to have power over the body of ſome noble Prince, to abuſe it by ſtripes, or any other contumelious ſordid manner? but a more grievous thing it is to ſee the vile and baſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the world, who are nothing but ſinks of filth themſelves, to abuſe men of ſuch noble and excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7448:83"/>
as if they were more vile than dirt? It was the bitter complaint of <hi>Ieremy Lament.</hi> 4. 2. that the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſonnes of <hi>Sion,</hi> comparable to fine gold, were eſteemed as earthen pitchers. Such as bleſſed ſpirits would honour, if they had them with them, yet here they are caſt out as filth. What griefe ſufficent to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſeeing of ſuch filthy ſwine to trample under their feet ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pearles? in all ages thus it hath beene. Thoſe who were indeed the true honourable upon the earth, ſuch pretious and excellent ſpirited men, as of whom the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and yet they have beene moſt vilely abuſed, and are ſo ſtill by this wretched world, who know not wherein true worth and excellency conſiſts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. Chriſt telling his Diſciples how ill the world would uſe them, he tels them, they have as good uſe from it, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had before them. How was <hi>Micaiah</hi> (a man of a very ſweet and excellent ſpirit) contumeliouſly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?

hee was ſtrucke on the mouth, ſhut up in priſon to be fed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; bread; yea, with the water and bread of affliction, while 430 falſe Prophets, moſt baſe ſpirited men, were fed delicately at <hi>Ieſabels</hi> table. How was <hi>Ieremiah</hi> uſed? hee was thrown into the dungeon, ſtuck up almoſt to the eares in the myre; the Word of the Lord was made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him daily. <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, (a man in whom Gods ſoule delighted, yet he) complaines of himſelfe, that he was a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the people: all that ſaw him, laughed him to ſcorne; they ſhot out the lip, and ſhook their head at him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 6, 7. and <hi>Iob</hi> before him, he was made a by-word of the people, and as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret unto them; as he ſayes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 6. The ſame uſe had the bleſſed Apoſtles, who were filled with the Spirit of God; none more ſcorned, perſecuted, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, than they.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7448:85"/>
and worke with his ſpade; to get his living. Whoſe heart bleeds not to heare of theſe former examples, and divers others, men of moſt pretious ſpirits thus ill uſed by this unworthy world, even ſuch in whom Chriſt rejoyces that ever he ſhed his blood for them? <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 11. ſuch as hee will glory in, before his Father, and the bleſſed Angels; yet thus are they abuſed by this wicked world: The more eminently the ſpirit of Chriſt appeares in any, the more is the rage of evill men againſt them. As it is reported of <hi>Tygers,</hi> that they rage when they ſmell the fragrancy of Spices; the fragrancy of the Graces of Gods ſpirit in his people, which are delightfull to God &amp; his Saints, puts wicked men into a rage; when as baſe ſpirited men have the world ſmile on them according to their hearts deſire. Oh the providence of God, who ſuffers ſuch indignities to bee offered to his moſt pretious and choice ſervants! but by this meanes the excellency of their ſpirits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7448:85"/>
in greater brightnes, their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhine in the more cleare luſtre. All Gods ſervants have his ſpirit in them, but when any of them ſuffer reproach and ill uſe of the world, then the Spirit of God, and glory reſts on them, then the glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the promiſe of God unto them, 1 <hi>Pèt.</hi> 4. 14. and they may in part perceive, even while they are uſing them ill, that they are men not of common, not of ordinary ſpirits, who are thus ill uſed by them: they may ſee in that meekneſſe, that patience, that humility, ſelfe-denyall, faith, holy carriage, requiting good for evill, praying for, doing all the good they can to thoſe who uſe them worſt; that conſtancy, ſpirituall chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſweet contentedneſſe; that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boldneſſe, humble courage, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly magnanimity, that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their conſcience ſhould not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, even while they are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them; that their conſcience doth not tell them, Surely theſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7448:86"/>
men we doe miſtake in, they are led by other principles than we know of; they have ſomething within that doth ſupport them, wee underſtand not. It is a wonder men are not afraid to abuſe them as they doe. As <hi>Num.</hi> 1. 2. 8. The Lord ſaid to <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they ſpoke againſt him, <hi>Were you not afraid to ſpeake againſt my ſervant Moſes?</hi> The words are very emphaticall in the Hebrew, they are thus, <hi>Were yee not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant, againſt Moſes?</hi> Were hee onely my ſervant, though he were not <hi>Moſes,</hi> were you not afraid? but when my ſervant, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ſervant of mine, in whom ſo much of my Spirit appeared, were you not afraid to ſpeak againſt him? Certainly, the Lord will not alwayes ſuffer pretious choice-ſpirited men to be trampled under feet; he lookes upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in their loweſt eſtate as his Jewels, even while they are in the dirt; but time wil come when he will make up his Jewels; as, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. 17.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7448:86"/>
and then there ſhall be ſeene a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the righteous and the wicked; betweene him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. God will owne the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the ſpirits of his ſervants, to be the Image of himſelfe; and what confuſion will this be to the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the world, when the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men and Angels ſhall own that, for the luſtre and beauty of his owne excellency, which they, when time was, made matter of their ſcorn, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their hatred? when God ſhall come to them, as <hi>Gideon</hi> to <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmana, Iudges 8. 18. What manner of men were they,</hi> ſayes <hi>Gideon</hi> to them, <hi>whom ye ſlew at Tabor? They anſwered, As thou art, ſo were they; each one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Children of a King.

were thoſe men, and what did they, whom yee ſo hated and abuſed? what? were they ſome vile-ſpirited men? how did they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Your conſciences ſhall be forced then to anſwer; O Lord, we muſt confeſſe, They were thoſe who kept themſelves from the common pollutions of the world, they lived ſtrictly in their wayes, they walked unblameable in their courſe; they were very forward in the duties of the worſhip and ſervice of God. The Lord ſhall then anſwer; What? theſe men they were my Saints, this was my holineſſe, my image, my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; theſe were not common ordinary men, theſe were my choice ones; men pretious in my eyes, ſeparated from the common ſort of the world for my praiſe: If you had loved them, prized them, and honoured them as the choice of the earth; if if you had followed their example, I had not ſlain you; but now you ſhall periſh everlaſtingly.</p>

                  <p>No diſhonor to be ſingular Seven notes to diſcover that godly mens dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from other men proceeds not from proud humourous ſingularity, but from the choiceneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of their ſpirits.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF godly men be men of another ſpirit, and this be their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; why then ſhould any account it to be a diſhonour to be ſingular from the world? Singularity is caſt upon Gods ſervants as their diſgrace, but certainly it is their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they are ſingular, and their wayes are ſingular, it is true, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch it, they rejoyce in it, and bleſſe God for it; it is impoſſible but that it ſhould be ſo, for they are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit, a peculiar people, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the world, ſet apart for God, their ſeparation is a wonderfull ſeparation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 16. So ſhall we bee ſeparated, ſayes <hi>Moſes,</hi> I and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7448:88"/>
thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth; the word is in the Originall, We ſhall be wonderfully ſeparated; No marvell then, though their ſingularity bee ſuch, as the world, who knowes not their principles, wonder at it. Their wayes are different from other men; I, that is true indeed, who can thinke otherwiſe? Their principles, their eſtates, their dignites, their hopes are raiſed higher then other mens. Would <hi>Saul</hi> have been offended, if his former acquaintance had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; Oh, now, <hi>Saul,</hi> hee mindes other things, goes on in other waies, lives after another faſhion then we doe; I, that is true indeed, for his condition is altered, his eſtate is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed higher then yours, he hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit: To complaine of Gods ſervants, that they are ſingular from others, is all one, as if you ſhould complaine of Pearles, that they are more gliſtering than dirt and gravell. Their way, their lives are ſingular; Why? how would you have them
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7448:88"/>
live? would you have them live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common courſe of the world? they cannot, for they have not received the ſpirit of the world, but another ſpirit.</p>
               <p>When the Spirit of God would ſet out, the greateſt miſery of men, when they are the children of wrath, without God in the world, without hope, it is, that they lived according to the common courſe of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. And thoſe two are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, living according to the common couſe of the world, and according to that ſpirit, that rules in the children of diſobedience: So long as they were acted by that ſpirit they did live ſo, but now there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpirit, that they are acted by, and would you have them live ſo ſtill as they did before? Certainly it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; You cry out of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that juſtly; But what is diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, if this be not? where there is not a ſutableneſſe between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles, the inward frame, and diſpoſition of the ſpirit, and the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7448:89"/>
outward actions: Now if Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not live ſingular lives, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their outward actions would not be agreeable to the inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, frames, and diſpoſitions of their ſpirits, for they are ſingular, differing from other mens. As there may be diſſembling, for a man to ſeeme better than he is; ſo there may be diſſembling, to ſeeme worſe than we are; Is there not as much evill in a life differing from the ſpirit, as in a ſpirit differing from the life? If a man ſeemes to be godly, and is not, it is an argument the man is vile, who will thus play the hypocrite; but it is a commendation to godlineſſe, that men will account the very ſeeming of it to be honourable; but if a man hath godlineſſe in his heart, and yet his life be no other than other mens, this would argue that a man were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of godlineſſe it ſelfe; here godlineſſe it ſelfe would ſuffer; as if it were ſuch a diſhonourable thing, as would bring ſhame to a man, if it did appeare; as if though indeed it muſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7448:89"/>
be reſerved in the heart, for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſake, yet it muſt be kept downe, not ſuffered to appeare in the life, for feare it be a diſgrace to men. Is not here then as great an evill, in this way of diſſimulation as in the other? Better all the men of the world had ſhame caſt upon them, than that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſhould have the leaſt ſtaine. Surely then, where the ſpirits of men be other ſpirits, ſingular choice ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, their lives ought, and muſt needs be other lives, ſingular from other men. Their conſcience witneſſe to them, that their ſpirits are changed, that they are other from that they were; yea, and witneſſes for them, that their lives are other lives, ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from other men; and in this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their ſoules rejoyce.</p>
               <p>But is there not a proud phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſingularity? may not pride, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſſe, and fancie, carry men on in ſingular wayes, differing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, conceiting themſelves to be wiſer than others, loving to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſome odde humours of their own?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7448:90"/>
If it were any choiceneſſe, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their ſpirits, it were another matter, we would not ſpeake againſt them; but it is this proud, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, humorous ſingularity, we ſpeake againſt.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; If you indeed ſhould do as they doe, if you ſhould live after a different manner from the common courſe of the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other principles than thoſe you have, it would certainly bee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, pride, hypocriſie, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in you; and thus your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would tell you, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you had not principles to carry you out in this way, you have not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſutable to it; and you judging of others, by that you ſeele in your ſelves, this makes you to thinke, the different wayes of Gods ſervants, is onely from pride, and humourous ſingularity; yea, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know, that there was a time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, where in if they ſhould have done, as now they doe, it would have beene no other in them, then that you
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7448:90"/>
now accuſe them of namely, when their ſpirits were, as other mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are; but now they know, they have other principles, other qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of ſpirit then formerly they had. But ſurely, you doe not thinke indeed, that their different lives doe come from proud, and humourous ſingularitie; for if you did, why doe your conſciences ſo well approve of them, when you lie on your ſicke beds? when you apprehend your ſelves going before the great God, then you could wiſh it were with you as it is with them.</p>
               <p>But what ſay you? if you thought it were not from this pride, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe you ſpeake of, then you would thinke it were well; then you would joyne in juſtifying of them, if you were ſure it were from a choyce, excellent ſpirit in them.</p>
               <p>Well then, let Gods ſervants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, that they know it is not from pride, that it is not from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that they run not into exceſſe of riot as others doe, but from the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7448:91"/>
worke of God upon their ſpirits, and this witneſſe they have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this they have to encourage themſelves in, that if the men of the world did but know their principles from whence they worke, as they know them themſelves, even they would juſtifie both them and their wayes. But further, wee muſt know there is a way of God that is reall, that tends to life; what ever way it be, this is certaine, it muſt be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common courſe of the world; and if this be not it, in which Gods people doe walke, tell us what is that way, and wee will walke in it. The Scripture tells us, the way to life is narrow, and that few walke in it; and the other way is broad that tends to death; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore but feare, when we ſee the marke of a way that leads to death. Chriſts flocke is but a little flocke, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. Feare not little flocke: there are two diminutives in the Originall, the word tranſlated, <hi>flocke,</hi> ſignifies a little flocke; but <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:7448:91"/>
that the exceeding littleneſſe of it might appeare, Chriſt addes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word, ſo the words are, Feare not little flock. And S. <hi>Iohn 1 Epiſt.</hi> 5. 19. ſaith, the whole world lies in wickedneſſe, but wee know that wee are of God. What a ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was this in S. <hi>Iohn?</hi> how doth he difference a few odde contemptible people from the whole world? We are of God, and yet the whole world lies in wickedneſſe, and the world ſurely is not growne better ſince. But that you may ſee, that the way of the godly is not from ſingularity, or humour, take theſe Evidences, and judge according as conſcience ſhall tell you is truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Where humour and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">1</note> ſingularity prevailes with men, there is no evenneſſe, no conſtancy in their wayes, no porportion of one thing with another in their courſe; they are ſingular and humourous in ſome odde fooliſh things; but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things where they have as much reaſon to bee ſingular, they doe as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7448:92"/>
others doe; But in Gods people you ſhal ſee an evenneſſe, conſtancie, and proportion in the courſe of their lives; that which makes them ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in one thing, makes them ſo in all other of the ſame nature; They are not as humourous people who have their fits, and take them out of their fits, they are other men, they are as different from themſelves, as they are from other men; But where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God guides, though there be more difference from other men, yet there is leſſe difference from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe who doe things <note place="margin">2</note> out of ſingularitie, they care leſſe for ſuch things they doe out of that principle, when they come to bee common, then they did before; But it is not ſo here in the wayes of godlineſſe; the more common they grow, the better they are, the more doth Gods people rejoyce and bleſſe themſelves in them, they are the more lovely, and amiable in their eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:7448:92"/>
Thirdly, Humourous ſingular men differ exceedingly one from <note place="margin">3</note> another, one will bee ſingular in one thing, and another in another; but Gods people goe all the ſame way, they have the ſame courſe with ſuch as they never ſaw; Obſerve the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and wayes of godly men in all places of the world, though their education, their conſtitution, their employments, their former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be exceeding different, yet now for the maine, they are the ſame, they favour and relliſh the ſame things, they delight in the ſame way of holineſſe, which evidently ſhews, they are led, acted, by one and the ſame ſpirit; though they may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome things of leſſer moment one from another, yet they differ very little amongſt themſelves, in things wherein their difference from the world principally lyes; in thoſe things for which the world diſlikes them and their wayes, there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall agreement in the ſpirits of all godly men in ſuch things; As in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7448:93"/>
of the leaſt ſinne, as a greater evill then any outward miſery; in loving the ſtricteſt waies of holines; in labouring to keepe themſelves pure, as much as they can, from the ſinnes of the times, and places where they live. &amp;c. In theſe and ſuch like things, which are moſt proper to godlineſſe, and for which they are judged ſingular, there is a generall agreement of all the ſpirits of the godly throughout the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, proud, conceited ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity acts it ſelf eſpecially in things <note place="margin">4</note> that are taken notice of by others; if others looke not after them, and will not vouchſafe to take notice of them, they quikly grow weary of that they doe, and this is the beſt way to deale with ſuch people, to neglect them; Let them perceive no body thinks them worthy of regarding, of once minding them, and this makes them ſooner weary then all the oppoſing of them that can bee: The end of ſingularity is, that it might bee obſerved; this is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7448:93"/>
of theſe people, they would faine bee taken notice of for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, let it be what it will bee; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance is the thing that feeds this humour; where this is not, it ſoone growes weary of it ſelfe; and hence when theſe people are alone, when none can obſerve them, they doe but as other men doe. But now the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of godlineſſe, wherein Gods people differ from other men, in which their ſoules moſt delight, and are moſt fully exerciſed in, it is in ſecret things, not ſubject to the view of the world, <hi>The Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within;</hi> If there bee a little godlineſſe outwardly, there is much more inward, as where there is a little wickedneſſe without, there is abundance in the heart; Godly men are moſt eminently godly in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; The countenance and voice of the Church, is moſt ſweet and comely in ſecret places, <hi>Cant. 2. 14.

thy voyce, for thy voyce is ſweet, and thy ſight is comely:</hi> Godly men dare not indeed, but be godly before men, for ſo Chriſt commands them, <hi>Let your light ſhine before men, that others may ſee your good works;</hi> but it is one thing to do that which may be ſeen, and another, to do it to that end that it may be ſeene, and to make that the higheſt end. If they make their end, that the light may be ſeene, and not that themſelves may be ſeene; and that their Father in heaven may be glorified, and not themſelves glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it is no other than Chriſt would have. But betweene God and their owne ſoules, there is the chiefe work of godlineſſe; there the ſoules of Gods ſervants doe moſt expatiate themſelves, there they are moſt themſelves, there is their moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element; wherefore ſurely it is not a humour of ſingularity.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If it were humourous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, it would not bring them ſo <note place="margin">5</note> much ſweet peace, and heavenly joy when they are upon their ſick beds,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7448:94"/>
and death-beds, and when they have to deale with God in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; when they are to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great God, to receive the ſentence of their eternall doome, when they are to enter upon eternity; how many then bleſſe God that ever he put it into their hearts to go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, not according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of the world? Though humour and conceitedneſſe may pleaſe, and give content for a while, yet it can never bring ſuch peace, and joy in ſickneſſe, and death, and when the ſoule ſees it hath to deale with ſuch an infinite, holy God, ſuch a dreadfull Majeſty; none apprehend the glory and Majeſty of God, ſo as the godly doe; none underſtand what eternity means ſo as they doe; the ſight of theſe things would ſhake men out of an humour: it is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that can ſtand before God, and the eternall miſery, or happineſſe of the creature rightly apprehended; it is time now to lay aſide humours, and conceits; and yet then when theſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7448:95"/>
things are moſt clearely, moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully apprehended by Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, even then they are moſt for the wayes of God, in which they differed from the world, than ever they were before; it is now their greateſt griefe, that they have no more differed from them than they have, and if they were to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they would differ farre more than ever they did.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Surely it is not humourous conceited ſingularity, becauſe moſt men who have enlightned conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, when they are moſt ſerious in their beſt moods, are of this mind.

How much more ſhall your Father in heaven, give good things to them that aske him?</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. bringing in Chriſt ſpeaking upon the ſame occaſion, ſayes, <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Ghoſt to them that aske him?</hi> as if all one to give his Spirit, and to give all good things: Spirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings make all outward croſſes light and eaſie, as <hi>Prov. 18. 14.

And further, it is the excellency of ſpirituall bleſſings, to keep downe the body, and to carry the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the body.

their ſpirits were ſo ſatisfied with mercies they had, that they ſo little regarded their bodies, when they ſuffered grievous torments, as if they had not been their own; Thus <hi>Zozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> reports of them. Spirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are ſuch, as inable men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all other bleſſings they enjoy: without theſe, the greateſt of other bleſſings would prove to bee the greateſt curſes to us; and yet further: Theſe bleſſings upon our ſpirits, coſt God infinitely more, than other bleſſings doe. Other bleſſings God can give at a lower rate, but theſe coſt the deareſt heart blood of his owne Sonne, and therefore above all let God have the praiſe of theſe. Outward bodily mercies we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of, but when we conſider of theſe, let us ſay as <hi>David, Pſal. 66. 14.

This S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals to minde, to ſtirre up himſelfe and others, to praiſe God for that bleſſed change he had wrought in his, and in their ſpirits: <hi>Tit. 3. 3.

The adviſe of godly men, in things concerning God, is much to be prized. It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Shechaniah</hi> to <hi>Ezra, Chap. 10. 3.

Let me in the name of the Lord plead with you for more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice for the Lord, than he hath from others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, your birth is from him, you are borne of God in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">1</note> than others are, and therefore it muſt not be with you as it is with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

a cuſtome amongſt the Heathen, they were wont to derive the pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their valiant men from their gods; to this end, though the thing were not true, yet they beleeving themſelves to be a Divine off-ſpring, they might upon confidence there of, undertake higher attempts than others, with the more boldneſſe: Much higher things ſhould thoſe endeavour after, who are indeed borne of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath put forth an other manner of power out upon <note place="margin">2</note> your ſpirits, than upon other men; other men have but a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon influence of Gods power let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſpirits: but he hath manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the exceeding greatneſſe of his power in you; as, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. obſerve the gradation there; the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the power of God, put forth upon thoſe that doe beleeve, expreſſes it in a ſixfold gradation.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is his power; onely the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a God could doe it.</p>

Therefore well may the Lord expect from you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of ſervice and honour, than he hath from other men.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, more depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds upon you, <note place="margin">7</note> than upon others; the waight of many ſervices depends all upon you, which are no wayes expected to bee performed by others: What ſhall become of Gods Name, his Glory,

How often hath God appeared to your ſoules? What gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s have your ſpirits had from him?

While <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Magicians ſaw, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did no more than they could doe, they were not convinced; but when <hi>Moſes</hi> did that which they could not doo; then they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the finger of God: So it is here, while wicked men ſee thoſe that are religious, doe onely ſuch things as they could doe if they would, as going to Sermons, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of good things, they are never convinced by them; but when they fee them do ſome thing, which their conſciences tell them they cannot do, then they are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there is a reall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in godlineſſe which they have not, as Chriſt ſaid once, <hi>If I had not done thoſe things that no man did,

The world is much for brave and Noble ſpirits; we deſire your ſpirits may be ſo: onely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not the true Nobleneſſe, the true excellencie of ſpirit; certainly it is inthat which may bring you nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to God, the higheſt excellencie: You can no way be ſo honourable, as by the raiſing of your ſpirits by grace: Wiſdome with an inheritance is good, wiſedome with birth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of place is a great bleſſing indeed; to be rich in goods, and rich in goodneſſe, is a happy connexion. You would account it a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace not to have education ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſutable to your birth and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; what can be ſaid more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of a man than this, He hath left him indeed a great eſtate, and is of a great houſe, but he hath no bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?

How is this, to ſleight the very glory of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to contemne the higheſt dignity men or Angels are capable of?

               <p>Firſt, you had need of other ſpirits; more need than others for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of thoſe great mercies that you have above others. As ſome fowle that have great wings, yet can flie but little; ſo many men have great eſtates, but not having ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to improve them, they are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe. Know, that your eſtates are either mercies or miſeries, bleſſings or curſings to you, according as you have hearts to improve them: if they be improved for God, as advantages to honour God by, to doe good withall; they are then great bleſſings
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7448:114"/>
indeed: and that is as great an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of grace, as any, to be as earneſt with God for an heart to improve an eſtate, or a place of dignitie for God, as to rejoyce that <note place="margin">Divites ſunt, non qui divitias ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, ſed qui u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur illis ad opera juſtitiae. <hi>Lactant. lib. 5. cap. 16.</hi>
                  </note> you have ſuch an eſtate for your ſelves, or that you are in ſuch an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, whereby you may get honour to your ſelves.

               <p>Secondly, you had need of other ſpirits, for the improving of the large <note place="margin">2</note> opportunities of ſervice for God and his Church, that you have more than others; theſe are as great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as your eſtates, or any dignities
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7448:115"/>
you have above others. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts you with much, in giving you ſuch large opportunities of ſervice, for the honour of his great Name. If your birth be high, your eſtates high, and your ſpirits indued with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie from on high, how fit then are you to be uſed by God in high and honourable ſervices? Hence the converſion of a great man is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great conſequence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo loath to loſe the Converſion of the Deputy <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Paulus,</hi> who began to liſten to his preaching; of whom we reade <hi>Acts 13. verſe</hi> 7. and ſo on: Therefore when <hi>Elymas</hi> withſtood him in this work, ſeeking to turne away the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie from the Faith, the ſpirit of S. <hi>Paul</hi> roſe againſt him with much indignation; and being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, hee ſet his eyes on him, and ſaid, <hi>O full of all ſubtilty and all miſchiefe, thou childe of the devill thou enemy of righteouſneſſe, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord? And now behold the hand of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7448:115"/>
the Lord is upon thee, and thou ſhalt bee blind.</hi> As if S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, What? will you hinder me in ſuch a great work as this, wherein God may have ſo much honour in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Noble-man, this man of publike and eminent place? this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is to be full of all miſchiefe, to bee an enemie of all righteouſneſſe. Thus you ſee how his ſpirit was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when he was put in feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred in ſuch a notable prize as this: As a man when likely to have a great draught, there comes in one and diſturbs him, and is like to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him of it. Surely, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw that it was a wonderfull great bleſſing to the Church, to have great men to be brought in, to the obedience of the faith, and to be added to it.</p>
               <p>And further it is obſerved, that God going along with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and finiſhing the work of the converſion of this great man; that upon this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had his name <hi>Paul</hi> given him, being changed from <hi>Saul,</hi> and called <hi>Paulus,</hi> from that notable
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7448:116"/>
worke of the converſion of this <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Sergius.</hi> As many great Captains amongſt the Heathen were wont to have their names changed upon their ſucceſſe in ſome noble enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and great victories; as <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> hee was called <hi>Africanus</hi> from his Conqueſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>

What great pity is it, that ſuch bleſſed opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of ſervice, of honouring God, themſelves, and families, as you have, ſhould be loſt for want of ſpirits? Were it not more honorable to you, and your houſes, to be imployed as publique bleſſings to Church and Common-wealth, to have thouſands of ſoules bleſſe you, and bleſſe God for you, than for you to go ſiner than

What ever evill is ſeene in you, is not onely followed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but uſed as a plea to maintaine and encourage that which is evill in many others. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was wont to ſay, that as the Ecclipſe of the Sun is a foretoken of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; ſo the errours and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights of great men, bring with them great perturbations to the places where they live.</p>

The high eſtate of great outward dignitie, is a very dangerous eſtate, if God gives not an extraordinary ſpirit.

It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Scipio Aſricanus,</hi> that when he took new <hi>Carthage,</hi> he took a young Gentlewoman priſoner who was ſo faire that ſhe raviſhed all mens eyes; this <hi>Scipio</hi> then ſaid, If I were but a common ſouldier, I would enjoy this Damſell, but being Commander of an Armie, I will not meddle with her: and ſo preſerving her entire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her to her friends. Thus he, though a Heathen, thought wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe too meane for, and unſutable to greatneſſe. Sinne is uncomely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where, much more uncomely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt great ones; and grace is comely where ever it is, much more to the great ones of the earth. As <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> was wont to ſay concerning learning, I may ſay the ſame concerning godlineſſe; Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men ſhould eſteeme learning as ſilver, Noble men ſhould account it
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7448:118"/>
like Gold, and Princes ſhould prize it like Pearles. Thus if godlineſſe be as ſilver to ordinary men, it is to be accounted as gold and pearls to you. The Scripture compares beauty in a woman without wiſdom, to a Pearl-in a Swines ſnour, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 22. as a thing unſutable: Thus are all outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies where there is not grace.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And would it not be a grievous thing to you, to ſee poore, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, meane men and women to be lifted up to glory, &amp; your ſelves caſt out, an eternall curſe? have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them moſt excellent pretious ſpirits? doe they not doe God farre more ſervice than you? doe they not bring more honor to his Name, than ever you did? Think then with your ſelves, Why ſhould God put thoſe who are of ſuch choice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirits, into ſuch a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and raiſe me to ſuch an high? Is it not becauſe he intends to give me my portion in this life, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves better mercies for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? It would bee very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7448:119"/>
indeed if it ſhould prove ſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The hopes we have of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our peace in the happy enjoyment of thoſe pretious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Goſpel, that in ſo great mercy have been continued unto us, depends much upon the worke of Gods grace upon your ſouls: If God takes off your ſpirits from common vanities, the pleaſures of the fleſh, from the poore low things of the world, from your own private ends, and cauſes the feare of his great Name to fall upon them, and raiſeth them to the love of, and delight in the great things of godlineſſe, to be given up wholy to him, to lift up his great Name; we ſhall then look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as the joyfull hopes of our ſouls, that God ſtill doth &amp; will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the bleſſing, peace &amp; proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his people: But if we ſee dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon your ſpirits, then a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall night of darknes is upon us. As when we ſee it wax dark in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, we ſay, it is towards night; if it begins to be dark upon the hills, it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7448:119"/>
is nigh night; but if it be dark in the skie, it is night indeed: So where we ſee the workes of darkneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, it is a ſigne that a night is comming; but where we ſee them in thoſe of a higher ranke, in the Gentry, it makes us feare that the night is nearer; but if in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the great men, then it is a diſmall night indeed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore be you exhorted in the Name of the Lord, to labour much that you may have more gracious and holy ſpirits than others, together with your dignities, whereby you are lifted up above others. Wee envie not your honours, we deſire that they may be raiſed higher by grace. Grace may well ſtand with the enjoyment of all your dignities, yea, grace is the only thing that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, and advanceth them.</p>
               <p>And you whoſe ſpirits God hath raiſed above others, in the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of your parts, and many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent endowments of learning you have, who are men of larger under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7448:120"/>
of higher apprehenſions than others, and can looke upon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men as low and meane in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the difference between your parts and theirs: Do you labour yet to raiſe your ſpirits higher by grace and godlineſſe, that as you differ from them in naturall excellencies, ſo you may differ from them much more in ſpirituall and divine? How eminent would you be in grace, if thoſe parts and abilities of learning you have, were ſanctified for God? What bleſſed inſtruments might you be of glory to God, of comfort and encouragement to his people? but otherwiſe your parts and gifts are poiſoned; a ſinfull wicked heart will poiſon all. It may be ſaid of many, as it was of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he was a man of great Learning, and great Eloquence, with a mixture of great hypocriſie: If it may bee thus ſaid of any, He is a man indeed of excellent parts, very learned, of ſtrong abilities, but he hath a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſpirit; he is a man of a corrupt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7448:120"/>
minde; ſurely theſe parts are all poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; no marvell then, though ſuch men ſwell ſo much by reaſon of them. Parts unſanctified doe exceedingly enlarge mens ſpirits, to be ſo much the more capable of ſpirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, more than others of meaner and lower parts can be; your parts will aggravate all your ſinnes, and increaſe your damnation: It is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing that ſuch excellent parts and abilities as many have, which might be of ſo great uſe, for God and his Church, yet that they ſhould vaniſh into froth.</p>
               <p>It was the great complaint of one <hi>Robertus Gallus,</hi> a famous man, an oppoſer of the corruptions of thoſe times in which he lived, which was in the 13.

It is in his writings upon the fourth Commandement, which he makes the third; It is to ſhew, how the holineſſe of the ſpirits of meane and unlearned men, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found great underſtanding learned men, where there is not the like godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>In the time of the Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> he tells us, There were two Cardinalls riding to the Councell, and in their journey they ſaw a ſhepherd in the field weeping; one of them pitying him, ſayes, that he could not paſſe by, but he muſt needs go to yonder man and comfort him; and comming neare to him, hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, why he wept? he was loath to tell him at firſt; but being urged, he told him, ſaying; I looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Toad, conſidered that I had never praiſed God as I ought, for
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7448:122"/>
making mee ſuch an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a man, comely and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I have not bleſſed him, that hee made not me ſuch a deformed Toad as this. When the Cardinall heard this, hee was ſtruck with it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that hee had received greater mercies than this poore man; and he was ſo ſtruck, as hee fell downe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently dead from his Mule; his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants lifting him up, and bringing him to the Citie, hee came to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and then cried out; Oh Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> how truely didſt thou ſay; <hi>The unlearned riſe, and they take hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and we with all our learning, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in fleſh and bloud!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You therefore, whom God hath honoured with excellent parts, that you may not be thus confounded an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day, before the Lord and his bleſſed Angels, and Saints, bee you reſtleſſe in your ſpirits, till you finde God hath added a further beautie to them, even the beautie of holineſſe, the ſanctifying graces of his Holy Spirit, that may make you lovely in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7448:123"/>
his eyes, truely honourable before him, and for ever bleſſed of him. Take heed you reſt not either in gifts of learning, or in gifts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie; the gifts of moralitie are yet a further ornament to mens ſpirits, but yet they come ſhort of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencies of ſpirit, that will make it bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Wee reade of many, who were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent in morall excellencies, and yet altogether ſtrangers from the life of grace. As for example, <hi>Ioſephus lib. 15. c.</hi> 8. reports of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, that which would make one thinke, hee was raiſed to very high morall excellencies: once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſpeech to his Army, amongſt other paſſages he hath this; <hi>Perhaps ſome men will ſay, that right and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is on our ſide, but that the greater number of men, and meanes are with the other; but this their ſpeech is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of my followers: for with thoſe with whom juſtice is, with thoſe alſo God is, and where God is, there neither wants multitude, nor fortitude.</hi> And

That <hi>Herod</hi> likewiſe which S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeakes of in the 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. who was ſmote by the Angel, and eaten of wormes, yet even this man had many excellent morall gifts: <hi>Ioſephus</hi> reports of him, That hee was a man of a moſt milde <note place="margin">Ioſeph. lib. 19. cap. 7.</note> diſpoſition, readie to helpe thoſe which were in adverſitie, free from outward groſſe defilements, and that there was no day paſt him, in which he did not offer Sacrifice; and for a teſtimony of his mild &amp; gentle tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he tels a notable ſtory of him, that when one <hi>Simon</hi> a Lawyer, in his abſence, had ſcandalized him with many grievous accuſations before the people; As that hee was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane man, and that upon juſt cauſe he was forbidden to enter the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: when <hi>Herod</hi> was certified of theſe things, and came to the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, he commanded that this <hi>Simon</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:7448:124"/>
ſhould be brought to him, and would have him ſit downe next to him, and in peaceable and kinde manner hee ſpake thus to him, <hi>Tell me, I prethee, what thing thou ſeeſt fault-worthy, or contrary to the Law in me?</hi> This <hi>Simon</hi> not having any thing to anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to pardon him; the King grew friends with him, and diſmiſſed him, beſtowing gifts on him. What a ſhame is this example to many Chriſtians? and yet wee would all be loath to bee in this mans conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is reported likewiſe of <hi>Titus,</hi> whom God made a grievous ſcourge to the Jewes, yet hee was ſo meeke, ſo liberall, ſo mercifull, of ſo milde and ſweet a nature, that he was uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, The love and delights of <note place="margin">Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Suetonius</hi> tels of him, that hee was wont to uſe this ſpeech, That <hi>none ſhould goe away ſad from ſpeaking with a Prince.</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things are likewiſe reported of <hi>Trajan,</hi> he was accounted a patterne
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7448:124"/>
of upright dealing, in as much as when a new Emperour was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards elected, the people were wont to wiſh him The good ſucceſſe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the uprightneſſe of <hi>Trajanus:</hi> and yet the perſecution of Chriſtians under him was very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. It is likewiſe ſaid of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Philoſophus,</hi> that he was of ſuch a ſweet temper, that hee was never much puft up in proſperity, nor caſt downe in adverſitie.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, men may have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts of morality, and yet all theſe but as the flowers that grow on brambles, far different from thoſe graces of this other ſpirit that wee ſpeake of, which only growes upon the tree of life: As many a faire flower may grow out of a ſtinking root, ſo many ſweet diſpoſitions, and faire actions may bee, where there is onely the corrupt root of nature. It is true, learning and moralitie are lovely, they are pearles highly to be eſteemed, they are great bleſſings of God; but there is a pearle of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7448:125"/>
price that is beyond them all, which the true wiſe Merchant will labour to get, and will be content to ſell all to obtaine, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 45, 46. And this pearle of price is that, by which this other ſpirit comes to be ſo excellent above all that learning and morality, or any common gifts can make it. It is ſaid in that place of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> That the wiſe merchant ſought other goodly pearles: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts are to bee ſought after, as things that have much excellency in their kind; but it was that one pearle of great price that hee ſold all for: It is that grace of God in Chriſt, that raiſes the ſpirit above all other excellencies, and is to bee prized and ſought after above all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And that you may know, that there is a great deale of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, morall vertues, and true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall excellencies; that this other ſpirit is farre beyond the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of theſe, take theſe notes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

they ſay, God forbid; they thinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that ſinne ought not to bee committed; but they doe not thinke it ſo great an evill, as to procure ſo great miſeries; but if their ſpirits were right, they would apprehend ſinne, as oppoſite to an infinite good, and ſo having a kind of infiniteneſſe of evill in it; they would not onely yeeld to the Juſtice of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but acknowledge, that there are greater and more fearefull miſeries due to it than can be conceived: yea, they would ſee cauſe, that if God ſhould bring thoſe evils upon them for their ſinne, that there is infinite equitie that they ſhould lay their hands upon their mouthes, and take ſhame to themſelves, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Lord to bee righteous for ever.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, where there are onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall excellencies, they <note place="margin">6</note> do not raiſe the ſoule to a love of the ſtricteſt wayes of God; they thinke of accurateneſſe and exactneſſe in Gods wayes to be but niceneſſe and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7448:129"/>
too much preciſeneſſe; luke-warme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the onely temper ſutable to them; they thinke wiſedome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the remiſſion of godlines, not in the improvement of it; &amp; what is beyond their temper, they judge as weaknes and folly; and it muſt needs bee that morall men muſt have ſuch thoughts of the ſtrictneſſe of the wayes of God, becauſe that good they have is ſuch as ariſes from the principles of naturall reaſon, and makes a naturall good its end; and therefore all their vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes muſt be ſuch as muſt not ſtretch nature, but muſt be ſubſerviet to that naturall good they frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now the obſerving of ſome Rules and Duties of Religion, will ſuite well with this; and ſo farre they approve and like well of Religion: and here they ſticke, and thinke any thing that is further than this, is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more than needs. The worke of godlineſſe in the power of it, muſt needs be diſtaſtefull to them, becauſe it ſeekes to empty a man of himſelf,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7448:130"/>
to cauſe him to deny himſelfe; to fetch all from principles beyond himſelfe, &amp; to be for a higher good than himſelfe is, which is an infinite good: and therefore, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it would work infinitely towards it, but howſoever, it will ſet no limits to it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, where there is onely nature or morality, there is no ſenſe <note place="margin">7</note> of the breathings of Gods Spirit in his Ordinances; the Ordinances are dead and flat things to them: a meere morall man can like well enough of preſenting himſelfe in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but he feeles no vertue in them, no impreſſion that they worke upon him, that abides on his ſpirit after the Ordinances are done; he knowes not what it is to enjoy God in them, he knowes not what it is to ſtirre up himſelfe to take hold on God in the exerciſe of them; thoſe excellencies that hee hath, are not drawne out, maintained or increaſed by ſpirituall objects and duties; but it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe where true ſpiritual excellencies
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7448:130"/>
are; ſuch a one goes to Ordinances and holy duties with expectation to meet with the Lord there: Hee can diſcerne and feele the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord; he findes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord breathing graciouſly upon his ſpirit, and rofreſhing his ſoule with much quickening, and life and ſweetneſſe; hee findes his ſpirit drawne out by them, his heart much inlarged, his graces much increaſed in the uſe of them; or if at ſome times he wants this, then hee is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the want of it, of that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that now hee feeles betweene that which ſometimes hee hath had, and that which now hee wants; but the other is ſenſible of no ſuch want, all times are alike with him.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how you may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſpirits, whether the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of them be naturall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be onely morall, or truely ſpirituall. By theſe Notes you may ſee, that to bee true of your ſelves, that our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples in another caſe; <hi>You know not of what
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7448:131"/>
ſpirit you are.</hi> Though God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you many excellent bleſſings, beautified your ſpirits with many excellents endowments, which are in themſelves lovely &amp; deſirable; yet he hath not raiſed your ſpirits to that true ſpirituall excellency that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to raiſe the ſpirits of his people unto, even in this world. There are yet other higher excellencies to be attained to, to be ſought after, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all the other you have will vaniſh, and never bring up your ſoules to the enjoyment of God as yours in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould be done that we <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> may get another ſpirit?</p>
               <p>Worke what you can upon your <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> hearts what ever truth may further <note place="margin">1</note> convince you, of the difference of ſpirits; that you may bee throughly convinced, that there is indeed a vaſt eſſentiall difference, and that you may ſee into the evill of your ſpirits, and bee ſenſible of the want of this true ſpirituall excellency, and lie downe before God dejected, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7448:131"/>
humbled in the ſight thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, bee much in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <note place="margin">2</note> of the godly. When <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets, the Spirit of God came upon him, &amp; he began to propheſie too. <hi>Elijah</hi> told <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that if he were with him when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, then hee ſhould have his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit come upon him; wherefore <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> kept cloſe to him, &amp; would by no meanes leave his company. By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much in the company of the godly, you will come to ſee ſome beams of the excellency of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſhine out to you, whereby you will ſee that your ſpirits are not like theirs; that they are in a happier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than you; that they are men in a nearer reference to God than you; you will ſoone diſcerne, that ſurely the world is miſtaken in theſe men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, frequent the Ordinances <note place="margin">3</note> of God, where the Spirit uſes to breath; ſet your ſoules before the worke of Gods Spirit: The Spirit breaths where it liſteth, therefore it muſt bee attended upon in thoſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7448:132"/>
wayes which it ſelf chuſeth. Though your ſpirits bee never ſo dead, and polluted, who knowes but that at length in the attending upon God in his way, the Spirit of God may breath upon you, may breath in you the breath of life? it hath breath'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as dead, polluted ſpirits as yours, and it hath cleanſed them, ſanctified them, it hath filled them full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and glorious excellencies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, nouriſh and make good uſe of thoſe common workes of <note place="margin">4</note> Gods Spirit you have already; they have much excellency in them; &amp; if they be not reſted in, but improved, they may be very ſerviceable for the worke of Gods grace; but as Chriſt ſayes of the riches of the world, If you bee not faithfull in them, who will truſt you with the true riches; ſo if you be not carefull to make uſe of the common works of Gods Spirit, how can it be expected that the Lord ſhould bleſſe you with further mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy this way? Bee ſure you doe not wilfully go againſt the rules of right
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7448:132"/>
reaſon you are convinced of; do not darken that light of reaſon that <hi>God</hi> hath ſet up in you; do not extinguiſh thoſe ſparkes in naturall conſcience that God hath kindled there; do not dead thoſe principles you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your education; uſe that ſtrength of reaſon, reſolution, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſcience you have, to keepe in your ſpirits, that they bee not let out to feed upon ſinfull delights. With what face can you complaine of weakneſſe, and yet feed your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers? There is little hope of ſuch as have extinguiſhed the light of their common principles, which once they had in an eminent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner; their light of reaſon once was at leaſt as a faire Candle-light, but now it is like the ſnuffe in a ſocket, almoſt drowned &amp; quenched with their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſts. How juſt with God were it, that theſe men ſhould be left to die and periſh for ever in their filth?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſeek earneſtly from God to renew, to ſanctifie your ſpirits; it is <note place="margin">5</note> he that is the Father of ſpirits, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7448:133"/>
the ſpirit of man is under no other power, but the power of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and he hath the command of all, and with him there is abundance of ſpirit, and he is willing; yea, hee hath promiſed to give his Spirit to them that aske it, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, how can I pray <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> without the Spirit?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, put thy ſelfe upon prayer, and who knowes but aſſiſtance and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> bleſſing may come? preſent thy ſelfe before the Lord, tell him what thou apprehendeſt of the vileneſſe, of the filthineſſe of thy ſpirit; what convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thou haſt of the neceſſitie of the renewing of it, of the excellencie thou ſeeſt in the ſpirits of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; tell him of thoſe deſires thou haſt to be bleſſed with ſuch a ſpirit: O Lord, thou haſt given me many bodily bleſſings, great bleſſings of my eſtate more than others, many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts; but Lord there are other mercies my ſoule wants; Oh that thou wouldeſt give me another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! As this <hi>Caleb, Ioſhua</hi> 15. 19.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7448:133"/>
gave his daughter <hi>Aohſah</hi> a bleſſing, namely, the <hi>upper ſprings,</hi> and the <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpring,</hi> ſo doe thou ſeeke of God, that as he hath given thee the bleſſing of the nether ſprings, ſo hee may give thee the bleſſing of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; namely, that he may bleſſe thy ſoule with true ſpirituall bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, be ſure thou lookeſt up to <note place="margin">6</note> God in Chriſt, to ſeek this mercy in him; look on him as annoynted by the Father with the fulneſſe of the Spirit; look to him in whom all the fulneſſe of the God-head dwels bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, that out of this fulneſſe, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſings may bee conveyed to thee; for otherwiſe whatſoever thou ſeekeſt for of God, and not in this way, thou ſeekeſt but in a naturall way.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, be carefull to obſerve <note place="margin">7</note> the beginnings of thoſe ſpeciall ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Gods Spirit in thee, thoſe gales that ſometimes thou mayeſt feele, and then put on what poſſibly thou canſt; then ſollow the work of Gods grace, make much of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7448:134"/>
give up thy ſelfe to the power of them; turne the motions of Gods Spirit into purpoſes, and thoſe purpoſes into endevours, and thoſe endevours into performances, and ſeeke that thoſe performances may bee eſtabliſhed. Wee doe not know what we loſe, when at any time we loſe the ſtirrings of Gods Spirit in our hearts. Who knowes but that thy eternall eſtate may depend upon thoſe ſparkes that hee is now kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in theé? It is a great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſtifle the child in the wombe, when it is new conceived; and is it not a great wickednes to ſtifle thoſe bleſſed motions that are conceived by the worke of the Holy Ghoſt? And for a concluſion of this point, let thy ſpirit be for ever reſtleſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou feeleſt God graciouſly comming in unto thee; let no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſatisfie thee, till God gives thee ſoule-mercies, and bleſſes thee with his choice ſpirituall bleſſings, ſuch as are peculiar to thoſe who are good in his eyes.</p>

Chriſt ſaith, that, Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one jot or tittle of his

Word. As if he ſhould ſay, If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth were in one ballance, and any jot or tittle of my Word in another, and if one of them muſt needs periſh, I had rather that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhould periſh, than that one jot or tittle of my Word ſhould faile: The Authority of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven puts weight on things, that are never ſo little in themſelves. If mans authority doe this, how much more Divine? Man cannot beare diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in little things; though the things be very ſmall in themſelves, yet if commanded by Authority, it is juſtly expected that they ſhould be much regarded. Shall mans authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make ſmall things to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great, and ſhall Gods Authority doe nothing? Obedience in ſmall things is due to Magiſtrates, much more to God: <hi>Give to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods, Matth,</hi> 22. 21. It is obſervable in that place, the Article is twice repeated in the Greeke Text, when hee ſpeaks of

               <p>Fiftly and laſtly, not to inſtance in more particulars, the ſoule that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes God fully in all duties, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">5</note> to follow him in duties wherein it muſt go alone; it is willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God in folitary paths. Many men, were it that they might have company in the way, in following the Lord, they would be content; but to go all alone in ſuch ſolitary wayes, wherein they can ſee none goe before them, wherein they can have none along with them, few or none are like to follow after them; this is tedious. But a childe of God thinkes he hath enough, in that he hath God with him, that he walkes along with God; this is company e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let the way be what it will be: As <hi>David, Pſal. 23. 4. Though I walke through the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, yet thou art with me.</hi> God promiſes that he will goe before his people; that is enough, though there
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7448:143"/>
be none elſe. It is true, company in Gods wayes is delightfull, and it is a ſad thing, that there is ſo little a tract in Gods paths. It was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Gods people, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 4. that the wayes of <hi>Sion</hi> did mourne, becauſe none came in them. But if company cannot be had, it is enough we have the Lord. 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. At my firſt anſwer,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, no man ſtood with me, but all men forſook me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord ſtood with me. Elijah</hi> thought he was left alone, he could ſee no man goe that way hee did; yet he continues in his fervour and zeale, following the Lord. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſhould the rather follow the Lord, becauſe we ſee ſo few follow him: What? ſhall he have none to follow him? as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, when many forſook him, <hi>Will you alſo forſake me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee by theſe ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in difficult duties, in diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced duties, in duties wherein we can ſee no reaſon, but a bare command, in duties that ſeeme to be
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7448:144"/>
ſmall and little, and in duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we follow God we muſt follow him alone; that the ſoule that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes God fully, will follow him in theſe, and ſo by the ſame reaſon in all other duties that God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to follow him in: And this is that pretious choice ſpirit we ſpake of before, which ſhewes it in this, that it is thus willing to follow God fully. You know it is requir'd of us to be perfect, as God himſelf is perfect, to bee holy as God is holy; yea, this the Goſpell requires of us; but how can that be? Yes, thus; Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and holineſſe is made known to us in his will, in his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; now look how large they are ſet forth to us in theſe, ſo large muſt our obedience be: though we cannot attaine to the degree, yet our hearts muſt inlarge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to the things, to what ever part of Gods will, God makes knowne his perfection and holineſſe by. Thy Commandement is very broad, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> yet godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inlargeth the heart to every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7448:144"/>
it cals for: there is a grace within the ſoule ſutable to every duty the law requires.</p>
               <p>It may be this is indeed, may ſome thinke, in thoſe who are eminent in grace, upon whom God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a great meaſure of his Spirit; but is this in every one that hath any truth? Wherefore for anſwer let us know, there is this perfection, or elſe there is no truth at all; onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I doe not ſpeake now of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees; in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts the right ſtraightnes of a mans heart. A ſtraight line wil touch with another ſtraight line in every point, but a crooked line wil not, it toucheth but only here &amp; there in ſome: ſo ſtraight hearts will joyne with Gods law in every part, but crooked and perverſe hearts, onely in ſome, onely ſo farre as may ſerve their owne turnes. In this conſiſts the true plainneſſe of a mans ſpirit: you know, plaine things will joyne likewiſe in every point one with another, but round and rugged things will not: ſo proud,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7448:145"/>
ſowlne hearts, and rugged ſpirits will not cloſe fully with Gods truths; but where there is plainneſſe of ſpirit, there is a full cloſing, a thorow uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is a great dangerous miſtake about this point, which yet is a generall miſtake; multitudes of people miſcarry everlaſtingly upon this miſtake; they think becauſe we cannot in this life attain to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſſe in the degrees, therefore there is no perfection at all neceſſary, but that they may be ſaved without it: they think therfore that if they do ſome good things, if they obey ſome Commandements, it is ſufficient, though they take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to themſelves in other things; they finde they can yeeld in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet other things of Gods will are exceedingly unſutable unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Be convinced of your miſtake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: a godly man indeed is weak, and cannot attain to the performance of every part of Gods will, but the frame of his heart is to every part; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part is ſutable to his ſpirit: He
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7448:145"/>
eſteemes all the Precepts of God concerning all things to be right, and he hates every falſe way. He findes the Law of God in the latitude of it, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 128.</note> written in his heart; there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God that is not dearer to him than all the world. Marke that place in <hi>Iob, Chap. 8. verſe 20. God will not caſt away the perfect man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he helpe the evill doers:</hi> The perfect man is oppoſed to the evill doers, who ſhall be caſt away. If you be not perfect in this ſenſe that hath been ſpoken of, then you are an evill doer, who muſt be caſt away, how glorious ſoever many of your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ſeeme to be. That place in <hi>Ezechiel, Chap. 18. verſe</hi> 21. that is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually taken for the place of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mercy in all the Scripture, &amp; by many is exceedingly abuſed; yet ſee what that requires of men in their repentance: the words are uſually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up thus, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repents him of his ſin, I will blot out all his iniquities, ſaith the Lord.</hi> There are not thoſe very words in any
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7448:146"/>
place of Scripture, but there are to the like effect, which are in this place of <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> And in no other place is Gods mercy to a ſinner, more fully revealed: There is no Text in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes nearer to that which men ordinarily take up, than that <hi>verſe</hi> and the 27. 28. <hi>verſes</hi> in the ſame <hi>Chapter:</hi> and ſee what of Gods mind wee have made knowne there; the words of the Scripture are thus, <hi>If the wicked will turne from all his ſinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all myſtatutes, and doe that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and right, he ſhall ſurely live:</hi> and againe, <hi>Verſe 28. Becauſe he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and turnes from all his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Thus you ſee, that God in the largeſt promiſes of his mercy to thoſe who have the leaſt meaſure of grace, he requires the turning from all ſinnes, and the keeping of all his Statutes: and this God brings to ſhew the infinite equity of his wayes towards ſinners. As if he ſhould ſay, Except this be, no mans conſcience in the world but muſt acknowledge
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7448:146"/>
it to bee infinitely juſt and equall, that he ſhould periſh everlaſtingly; if there bee any way of wickedneſſe reſerved, if any ſtatute of mine bee neglected, if he thinks to have mercy without an univerſall turning from his ſin, without an univerſall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; his conſcience will tell him, that it is an unequall and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, that hee ſhould ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. And yet further, becauſe you think that this univerſalitie of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be expected only from ſome who are eminent in grace, who have attained to a great meaſure of godlineſſe; conſider what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of poore widdowes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10. They muſt diligently follow every good work.</p>

And fifthly, they muſt ſo follow, as they muſt be well reported of for it.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſixthly, they muſt doe all this, or els they muſt not be received into the Church. Surely, then it is a ſhame for any man, eſpecially of parts and abilities, to plead weakneſſe, when ſo much is required of poore women; certainly it is not weaknes, but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, that is contrary to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie of obedience, to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Lord fully in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. The Veſſell of honour is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the veſſel of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. by this Character, that it is one that is ſanctified and prepared for every good worke. You know what S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap. 1. verſe 26. If any man ſeeme to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and bridle not his tongue, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his owne heart, this mans religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in vaine.</hi> It is an heavie cenſure, that all a mans religion is in vain for one fault, and that but for a fault in the tongue; and yet this is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Holy Ghoſt. No queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch men who were guilty herein,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7448:147"/>
would reaſon thus with themſelves, We cannot be perfect in this life, we doe performe many duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; &amp; therefore we hope though we faile in this one thing, that yet we ſhall doe well enough, God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of us. No, ſaith S. <hi>Iames,</hi> hee deceives his owne heart; ſuch a one ſhall never be accepted. To the like effect is that of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn 5. 44. How can you beleeve on me, which receive honour one of another?</hi> This was enough to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off for ever from Chriſt; and yet this was but an inward ſin, no outward groſſe crying ſin in the eſteem of the world. Let a man be never ſo glorious in never ſo many duties of Religion, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the giving liberty to himſelfe in any one luſt, is enough to keepe him off for ever from God, from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of good in him. As if a wife be never ſo officious to her husband, yeelding to him in never ſo many things, ſeeking to give him content in his deſires never ſo many wayes, yet if ſhe entertaines any other lover
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7448:148"/>
beſides himſelfe, it is enough to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his ſpirit from her for ever.</p>
               <p>That which God ſayes to <hi>Salomon, 1 King.</hi> 9. 4. is very obſervable to our purpoſe: After <hi>Salomon</hi> had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that glorious Temple, for the honour of the Lord, after he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled all the Elders of Iſrael, all the heads of the Tribes, the chiefe of the Fathers of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to bring up the Arke of the Lord with all ſolemnitie, to that Temple he had made for it, after hee had made ſuch an excellent prayer before all the people; and when that was done, that hee might ſhew his further reſpect unto the Lord, he offered to the Lord two and twentie thouſand Oxen, and one hundred and twenty thouſand ſheepe, and in his rejoycing in this great worke, hee made a great feaſt to the people ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, and to them he added ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes more, and ſent away the people with joyfull and glad hearts: Here were great things done in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, yet all this would not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7448:148"/>
ſerve <hi>Salomons</hi> turne, but <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 4. After all this, God ſayes to him, <hi>If thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> walke before mee, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart and uprightneſſe, to doe according to all that I have commanded thee, then I will eſtabliſh the Throne of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> As if hee ſhould have ſaid, Doe not thinke to put me off with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing thou haſt done; though the things be great things, yet I expect walking according to all that I have commanded thee, or elſe all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; And therefore, as before you heard, he was charged by God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 6. that hee did not goe fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord: One would have thought thoſe glorious actions that he did, had been enough to have got him the commendation of going fully after God; but we ſee it would not be: there muſt bee beſides theſe, a walking according to all that God commands, a keeping his Statutes, and his judgements, yea, and that is obſervable that wee have in the 6. <hi>verſe</hi> of this 9. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:7448:149"/>
ſayes after all this, <hi>That if you ſhall at all turne from following me, you, or your children, &amp;c. then will I cut off Iſrael.</hi> Wee muſt take heed of the leaſt failing in our following the Lord. <hi>God</hi> threatens <hi>Salomon,</hi> after he had done ſo much, that if hee did at all turne from following him, hee would cut him off. It is not our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in ſome good things, it is not our ſerviceablenes in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and worthy employments, that will ſerve our turnes, if we make not conſcience of every duty, of ſecret duties, and that conſtantly. <hi>God</hi> hath ſo connexed the duties of his Law one to another, that if ſo be there be not a conſcionable care to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all, it is accounted as the breach of all, according to that of S. <hi>Iames, Chap. 2. 10. Whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> The bond of all is broken, the authority of all is ſlighted; and that evill diſpoſition that cauſeth a man to venture upon the breach of one, might the breach
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7448:149"/>
of others ſerve for his own ends as well as that, it would make him ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the breach of any.</p>
               <p>To draw to a concluſion of this Argument, let us know, that if the heart be right, it is willing to be caſt into the mould of the Word, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatſoever print the Word will put upon it, to be in whatſoever forme the Word will have it: as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that are caſt into a mould, they receive the print of the mould, print for print in every part; and this is the heart that doth indeed follow God fully.

If there bee any thing in the world that you are not willing to part withall, if any thing that you are not willing to ſuffer, you cannot follow mee fully. In this conſiſts the uprightneſſe of heart, to goe in a right line to God; what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes betweene God and us, yet not to fetch a compaſſe, but to goe thorow it; for if we fetch a compaſſe, the line is not right: we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrike thorow all troubles and hazards we meet withall, ſtill keepe our way, not break the hedge of any Commandement to avoid any peece of foule way. Many thinke they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to follow God, but when they meet with ſome trouble in their way, then they would fetch compaſſe to baulke that, and yet hope to come to God well enough at laſt; they would bee loath not to bee accounted fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7448:154"/>
of God: But let ſuch know that this fetching compaſſe, which they thinke to bee their wiſedome, it is the declining from uprightneſſe. Many follow God, as the Dog fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his Maſter, till he comes by a Carrion, and then he lets his Maſter goe, and turnes aſide to it. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeem to be forward in profeſſion of Religion, till they meet with ſome opportunity of ſatisfying their luſts, then they leave off, and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to the enjoyment of them: But the heart that fully followes God, is not onely willing to part with any luſt for Chriſt, but it gives up it ſelfe to the diſpoſe of God, to become of his eſtate, credit, liberty, comforts, life, what God pleaſes; it is not ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about theſe things; the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that it hath to do, is to follow the Lord; it knowes that it is the work of the Lord to take care for it about theſe things, while it is in following of him.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah, 2 Chron.</hi> 25. 2. That he did that indeed which

was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart; he did many good things, but he had not a heart to follow God fully: and this was one Argument of it, which wee have, <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. that he was ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about his money; for when the Man of <hi>God</hi> came to him, and told him the minde of <hi>God,</hi> that hee muſt not have the Army of Iſrael go with him, becauſe hee had hyred the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with an hundred Talents; hee was very ſollicitous what he ſhould doe for his money; for ſo he ſaith, <hi>But what ſhall wee doe for the hundred Talents which I have given to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Iſrael?</hi> Whereas if his heart had been right and full in following God, as it ſhould have beene, it had beene enough for him to have knowne the command of <hi>God,</hi> let be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the hundred Talents what they will.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, to follow <hi>God</hi> fully, is <note place="margin">7</note> to follow him onely, ſo as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dedicate, to devote whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>God</hi> lets us ſtill to enjoy, to <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:7448:155"/>
alone: If wee have any gifts, any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, any eſteeme in the world, all ſhall bee imployed for <hi>God</hi> alone, all ſhall be laid out for him. As we muſt be willing to loſe all things for him, when he cals for them, (of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſo wee muſt endeavour to uſe all things for him, while we doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them. To ſollow God fully, is to follow him as the higheſt good, as the onely good, as the All-ſufficient good, as the Fountaine of all good, as the Rule of all good; to follow him ſo, as to follow nothing elſe but God; not onely to follow God chiefly, that is more than to follow any thing elſe, but to follow him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But how is that? I meane thus; we muſt follow God in our follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing elſe, wee muſt follow all for God, in reference to God, in ſubordination under God, and then we cannot be ſaid to follow the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is God that is followed in it. As when God is followed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and ſubordination to any good in the creature, it is not then
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7448:155"/>
God, but the creature that wee ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſo when the creature is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſubordination to God, it is God, and not the creature that is followed. As thus; when <hi>David</hi> was in the dry Wilderneſſe, no queſtion, he deſired water; yet, <hi>Pſalm. 63. 1. I thirſt after thee, O Lord, in a drie and barren Wilderneſſe, where no water is:</hi> Hee doth not ſay, I thirſt after water, but after thee; be cauſe hee ſought all in reference to God; and ſo it was God alone that he thirſted for. When we deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when we ſeeke after nothing, when wee lett out our hearts to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,, uſe, enjoy nothing, but in order to God; when all the good, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſweetneſſe, deſireableneſſe in any creature is in the reference it hath to God, ſo farre as God is in it, as God is honoured, or enjoyed by it; when God alone is lifted up in the heart, in the uſe of every creature, this is to follow God fully. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> thou ſhalt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7448:156"/>
the Lord thy God, and him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhalt thou follow. Chriſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Jewes, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 44. that they did not ſeeke the honour that came from God onely; and this was that which kept them off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving: this is enough to keep us off from God for ever. If wee would have our hearts come up fully to God, it is not enough to ſeeke the honor that comes from <hi>God,</hi> but we muſt ſeeke the honour that comes from <hi>God</hi> onely: and this is the true ſinglenes of heart which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes of, when it ſingles out this object, and eyes it alone.</p>
               <p>The doubleneſſe of a mans heart conſiſts not ſo much in that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe within, than that it appears outward, but in that it is divided to divers objects; it doth not fixe upon <hi>God</hi> as the onely object: and as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded men have double ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo they have double motions: as the Planets that are carryed in their motion one way by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, but have beſides a private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7448:156"/>
of their owne; ſo, many are carried to God by ſome externall, yea, it may bee, internall Motives; but yet they have a private motion of their owne another way to other things; God alone is not the Center of their hearts.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the ſoule then followes <note place="margin">8</note> God fully, when it carries thorow the worke it undertakes, againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and hinderances: As a Ship comming with full ſayle, bears all downe before it.

Wherefore have wee faſted, and thou

As <hi>Gideon</hi> and thoſe three hundred men that were with him, <hi>Iudges</hi> 8. 4. though they were faint, yet they went on purſuing; ſo here, though there may bee much faintneſſe and weakneſſe, yet the ſoule doth not thinke of turning backe againe, but goes on ſtill, purſuing in that way it hath begun; it is glad it hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for <hi>God,</hi> and it reſolves ſtill to doe more, how ever God pleaſes to deale with it. Though he may be weary in his following the Lord, yet hee is is not weary of following the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7448:157"/>
Lord. Many follow the Lord, as a beggar followes a man, onely in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Almes, he followes him a furlong or two, begging; but if he ſees the man goes ſtill from him, hee leaves off, and lets him goe: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will pray, and heare, and ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God for a while; but if they feele not that come in, which they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, they grow weary, and leave off. Duties that bring preſent comfort with them, many can be content to be exerciſed in, but if they finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comming in by them, then their hearts ſinke in diſcouragement, they have no heart to doe anything. As it is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ. 10. 11. Ephraim is as an Heifer, that loves to tread out the Corne: Ephraim</hi> loved to tread out the Corne, but not to Plow: The Heifer while it was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the Corne, did feed upon the Corne, and ſo had preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that work it did; but the Heifer that plowed, did labour, and ſpend its ſtrength, but had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment till after the worke was
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7448:158"/>
done: Thus it is with many; that worke, that hath preſent joy, that hath preſent refreſhment in it, while they are about it, they can take content in it; but if they muſt worke and tire the fleſh, and yet have no preſent refreſhing, but muſt continue working a great while, and ſtay till the accompliſhment of the worke, before any benefit comes by it, this they like not: But one that followes the Lord fully, reſolves to follow him, though hee hides himſelfe; as <hi>David, Pſal. 101. 2. I will behave my ſelfe wiſely, in a perfect way; oh when wilt thou come unto mee? I will walke within my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> ſhould have ſaid, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to walke before thee in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way, and yet I have not thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence with mee; oh when wilt thou come unto mee? but ſtill whatſoever becomes of mee, I am determined to continue walking within my houſe with a perfect heart.

Samuel ſaid unto the people, Feare not; ye have done all this wickedneſſe, yet turne not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart, and turne you not aſide: for then ſhould
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7448:159"/>
you goe after vaine things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſit nor deliver, for they are vain.</hi> Thus the ſoule that followes the Lord, reaſons with it ſelfe; Though it is true I have ſinned, mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are great, God may juſtly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and for ever reject me, yet I will not turne aſide from following him: I know there is no good to be got elſ-where: though I be unworthy of mercy, yet God is worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and therefore what ever I can doe, I will, that God may have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though I periſh; yea this ſoule though it receives many a repulſe, yet ſtill it will follow. As the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though Chriſt called her Dogge, yet ſhe leaves not off; ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth her ſelfe to be a Dog, yet ſtill ſhe ſeekes. Yea, though God ſeems to go croſſe wayes, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that the ſoule expected, yet ſtill this ſoul will follow him even in thoſe wayes. As when the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Abraham</hi> to follow him into a Land that ſhould flow with milke and honey, <hi>Gen. 12. 1. Abraham</hi> was
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7448:159"/>
content to leave his owne countrey, his fathers houſe, his kindred, and all his friends; and notwithſtanding as ſoone as he came into that Land, he found there was a famine in the land, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. ſo that he was forced to get into Egypt, and that with the perill of his life, or elſe he muſt have ſtarved. Fleſh and blood would have murmured much at this, and have ſaid, What? is this that Land that <hi>God</hi> ſaid hee would ſhew me? is this that fruitfull Land for which I muſt leave my Country and all my friends? and now as ſoone as I come into it, I am ready to ſtarve in it: and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> followed God ſtill in all the wayes he was pleaſed to lead him in. Againe, when God promiſed to multiply his Seed as the Starres of heaven; yet for twenty yeares after this, <hi>Sarah</hi> was barren; God ſeemed to neglect his promiſe: and after when he had a childe, in whom all the Nations of the earth were to be bleſſed; yet this Child <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt kill: And here God ſeemes to goe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7448:160"/>
croſſe to his Promiſe, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> followes God ſtill. One who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes God fully indeed, lookes up to the goodneſſe of God in himſelfe, and in his Promiſe; not to it as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to ſenſe: hee ſees more good in the Promiſe, then in all the things in the world; though hee ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though hee ſeeles nothing in himſelfe, nor in any creature for the preſent; and what worke hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the Lord in, hee will not leave imperfect; he will not give over, till hee ſees ſomething come of it: if he followes God for a broken heart, he will pray and meditate, and pray and meditate again, and again, if it were a thouſand times, and a thouſand times over again, till the worke comes to ſome effect: And ſo for power over a corruption, and ſtrength in any grace; where there is truth of grace, there will bee working, like fire that never leaves working till it breakes forth, and gets the victory. Hence that place of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. where hee ſayes, hee
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7448:160"/>
will not quench the ſmoaking flaxe, nor breake the bruiſed Reed, till hee ſend forth Judgement into victory. If wee obſerve the place of the Prophet from whence this is taken, which is <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. 3, the words are, <hi>He ſhall bring forth judgement unto truth:</hi> noting that whereſoever there is truth, there will bee victory: Chriſt will nouriſh the ſmoaking flaxe, that is, the leaſt worke of grace, till Judgement, that is, this worke of ſanctification bee brought into victory, and overcome what oppoſeth it. If hee brings any beginnings of grace to truth, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is already gotten. It is reported of Maſter <hi>Bradford,</hi> that he would never leave off when hee was in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, till hee found ſomething comming in; as in confeſſion of ſinne, till hee found his heart melt and breake for ſinne; in ſeeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, till hee found ſome quieting of his ſpirit, in ſome intimation from God of his love; and ſo for grace, till hee found his heart warmed and quickned. It is an excellent thing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7448:161"/>
indeed, to reſolve to follow the Lord in duty howſoever, though nothing ſhould come in by it to our ſelves: but yet the heart that is right, will never be ſatisfied in the performance of a duty, till it finde ſome manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Gods preſence in it; ſome worke of God put forth upon it, by it; it will not reſt in duty performed; it is not ſatisfied in good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in good deſires it hath, nor in gifts it receives, nor in comforts it findes in the creature, nor in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements and more inward joyes, but it muſt have grace, and God; it muſt have ſome impreſſion of God upon it, to carry with it as a Seale of that preſence of God it did enjoy in the dutie: it ſo ſtrives with the Lord, as it reſolves not to let him goe, till it hath got a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>It is a very full expreſſion that S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath to this purpoſe, in two or three words; Oh what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were it, continually to enjoy that <note place="margin">Nunquam ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How often doth God ſend us empty away from his preſence, which we ſhould account a ſore and grievous affliction? But here's the miſery, we are not ſenſible of this; if wee have our deſires in the creature, we are quieted and ſatisfied: whereas if our hearts were fully after the Lord as they ought, when wee are before him, wee ſhould crie to him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Exod. 33.

No ſurely, for <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. the Text ſayes, that <hi>all Iudah rejoyced at the oath;</hi> and this reaſon is given, <hi>Becauſe they had ſworne with all their heart, and ſought him with their whole ſoule.</hi> When any ſeek God with their whole heart, with their whole ſoule, they are not only willing to engage themſelves to God, but they rejoyce in their engagements: Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> whoſe heart was fully ſet
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7448:162"/>
for God, did himſelfe, and got the Princes, the Prieſts, Levites, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make a ſure covenant, to write it, to ſeale it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 38. And as if this were not engagement enough, they further enter into a curſe, and into an oath, to walke in Gods Law, to obſerve and doe all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, and his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Statutes. Thus <hi>David</hi> diſcovers the fulneſſe of his ſpirit in following after the Lord, in that he not onely promiſes, but ſweares hee will keep the righteous Judgements of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 106. It is a ſigne that mens hearts are not fully taken off from their ſinne, when they doe not fully come off in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Lord.</p>
               <p>No, may ſome ſay, it is becauſe wee often covenant with God, and finde wee are overcome againe, and doe breake covenant with him, and therefore we are afraid to enter into covenant any more. Is it not better not to covenant, than not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:7448:163"/>
I anſwer, It is true, if men cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and wilfully neglect, they were better not covenant at all; but if when wee enter into covenant, wee have the teſtimony of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we labour as in the ſight of God, to fulfill our covenants wee make, and it is the burthen of our ſoules that we ſaile in them, then I ſay, that wee are ſtill to goe on, and engage our ſelves further; our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants doe not aggravate our ſinne, but in time they will help us againſt our ſinne; this is one way that God hath appointed to ſtrengthen us; and therefore, wee muſt not complaine of weakneſſe, and yet neglect any way appointed by GOD, to get ſtrength by.</p>

make ſuch a breach betweene him and his father, as there ſhould never be any hope of reconciliation, and ſo hee might bee the ſurer to keepe conſtant to him, and the people that joyned with him, and therefore hee adviſed, that <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſhould goe in to his fathers Concubines upon the houſe top, in the ſight of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 21, 22. It is the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that he may have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers never to leave him; to make ſuch breaches betweene ſinne and their ſoules at firſt, ſo as there may never bee hope of peace betweene them againe. As the Devill when he would draw one to be his for ever, hee ſeekes to make great breaches betweene God and him, that if hee ſhould have ever any thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, he may diſcourage and ſinke his ſpirit with thoughts of deſpaire, telling him there is no hope of good in returning that way, and therefore it were better for him to continue as he is, as <hi>Ier. 2. 25. Thou ſaidſt, there is no hope; No, for I have loved ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7448:165"/>
and after them will I goe.</hi> When the Devill gets one who hath beene forward in the profeſſion of religion to Apoſtatize, hee labours to make ſuch a breach betweene him and his former courſe, as not onely to fall off from it, but to hate it, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure it, and to turne deadly enemie to it, and then both the devill and wicked men think, they are ſure of him for ever: and indeed it is very ſeldome that ever ſuch a one returns. Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> in a Sermon before King <hi>Edward,</hi> tells of one who fell away from the knowne truth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell to mocking and ſcorning it, and yet was after touched in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for it; beware of this ſin, ſayes <hi>Latimer;</hi> for I have knowne no more but this one man, that ever fell from the truth, and afterwards repented; I have known many fall, but never any but this repent. Now the breach betweene ſinne and the ſoule in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is as great as betweene God and the ſoule in Apoſtacy; yea, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for there is a poſſibility of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7448:165"/>
in the one, but never in the other: and therefore as the one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this great breach betweene God and his ſoule, doth follow the Devill, and his deſtruction for ever; ſo the other, becauſe of the breach betweene ſinne and the ſoule, doth follow the Lord, and his ſalvation for ever: as in the one, the gifts of Gods Spirit are ſo caſt out as uſually they never returne againe; ſo in the other, the uncleane ſpirit is ſo caſt out, as it never comes back againe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A ſecond Reaſon, why that man <note place="margin">2</note> that followes the Lord fully, muſt needs follow him for ever, is, becauſe at the firſt giving up himſelf to God, hee was content to let goe all other holds, and all other hopes in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts whatſoever, and ſo to venture himſelfe upon God, is to be content to be miſerable for ever, if he finde not enough in God to make him happie: he hath ſo let all other things goe, as if he ſhould faile here, hee hath nowhither to retire, hee hath reſerved no way, no meanes for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7448:166"/>
to helpe himſelfe by, if hee ſhould miſcarry here; hee hath laid all the waight of all his comforts, of all his hopes, of all his happineſſe upon the Lord; he hath no other prop that he doth or can expect any ſupport by: there is a bleſſed neceſſity upon him to follow the Lord for ever, and this neceſſity the ſoule is glad of: and this is the reaſon why God in his firſt bringing a ſoule home to himſelfe, uſeth ſo much meanes to take it off from all other things; namely, that it might follow him for ever. As it is reported of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, when hee came to invade <hi>England,</hi> and had landed his Souldiers, he ſent backe his ſhips, that ſo they might have no hope of retreating back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo they were put upon a neceſſity of fighting it out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Thus the <hi>Lord</hi> takes off the ſoul from all its former hopes and props, that it may have no lingrings after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but himſelfe, but thorowly ſight the good fight of faith, &amp; with reſolution hold on its courſe to the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7448:166"/>
end. But it is otherwiſe with a falſe, unfound heart; though ſuch a one may follow God in many glorious performances, yet it ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſomething in caſe of failing here; when it enters upon Gods wayes, it is enlightned ſo farre, as it thinkes ſome good may be had here: yea, it hath a taſte, it may be, of much ſweetneſſe in theſe wayes, but dares not venture all upon them; he would bee glad to have ſome thing to retire to, in caſe he ſhould faile here; hee reſerves a back doore, that he might turne another way, if this way ſhould prove troubleſome and dangerous; hee enters upon Gods wayes, not without ſome ſuſpitions and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that poſſibly hee may meet with ſuch inconveniences as may make him to wiſh he had been more wiſe, and not put himſelfe in too farre; he ſees many others, who being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged, and gone on ſo farre in thoſe wayes, wherein they meet with much trouble, many ſore and heavy afflictions; and he thinkes they doe,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7448:167"/>
or at leaſt may repent themſelves, and wiſh they had not ventured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo farre, as that now they know not how to goe backe againe; and if they were to begin againe, he thinks they would bee wiſer, and hearken to grave adviſe for more moderation.</p>

It was once the ſpeech of a deep po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, that it was good to follow the truth, but not to follow it too neare at the heeles, leſt it daſht out his braines. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> would bee Chriſtians, they would joyne with the Apoſtles, they ſaw great things were done by them; their poſſeſſions muſt be ſold, and the money laid at the Apoſtles feet; but ſomething muſt be reſerved, in

caſe they ſhould want afterwards, and then repent them they had gone ſo farre, when it ſhould be too late; and this is the very roote of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But it is otherwiſe with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart that followes God fully; in ſuch a one there is a holy kind of deſperatneſſe, ſo to caſt it ſelfe upon God, and his wayes, as never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any comfort, any good, but there; and therefore this is that it muſt reſt to for ever, and follow after for ever.</p>

Thus it is with a mans heart, while it ſtickes partly in the mud of the World, or filth of any luſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience ſtrives to raiſe it, but it is not fully taken off, there is nothing but vexation and trouble in that ſoule: but when it is taken off, and gives up it ſelfe fully to God in his bleſſed and holy wayes; Oh that ſweet and bleſſed eaſe that now it findes! When a man halts, the way is tedious to him, hee is ſoone weary, and gives over; but when hee is ſound, the way is eaſie, he holds on his way to the end: ſo when there is falſeneſſe in mens hearts, they do but

The reaſon that Philoſophers give why the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are incorruptible, is, becauſe the forme of them is ſo excellent, as it wholly fils up the utmoſt capacity of the matter; ſo the reaſon of the holding on of the upright heart, is, the full ſatisfaction of it, the filling up the full capacity of it, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and delight in Gods ways.

                  <p>The excellency of this frame of ſpirit, in foure things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſecond thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the point, was, to <note place="margin">2</note> ſhew wherein the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch a kind of frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7448:169"/>
lies, take it in theſe foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt this is truly to honour God <note place="margin">1</note> as a God; except God be honoured as infinite, hee is not honoured as God; now it is the full following him that onely honours him as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; where God is followed and not thus, hee is followed no otherwiſe than a creature may bee followed; this is not therefore to honour him as a God, but rather it is a diſhonor to that infinite excellency &amp; bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his, whereby he is infinitely above all that creatures are, or that they are any way capable of. The great thing that God aimed at in the creating of the heavens and earth, was, that he might by Angels, and men, bee honoured as a GOD, and therefore that which gives him this, hath true and much excellency in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this full following of God, doth much honour the work of <note place="margin">2</note> Grace, and the profeſſion of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it ſhewes a realitie; power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and beauty in it; it ſhewes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7448:169"/>
that it proceeds out of the fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch as hath high and heavenly principles; when there is power, proportion, and conſtancy in a mans wayes, there muſt needs bee much beauty in them; there is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of conviction from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of evill men by them: this takes away all pretences from men that they know not how to ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of the wayes of godlineſſe; they know not how to oppoſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them; when they can ſee no flaw, when, though they watch what they can, yet they can ſee nothing unſutable to their principles. The principles of godlineſſe for the moſt part are acknowledged by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the worſt, who have any light in them; &amp; therefore when all a mans wayes are ſutable to theſe, it puts wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a ſtand; they know not what to ſay againſt ſuch men, nor againſt their way; but their owne thoughts tell them, that ſurely there is ſomething in theſe men, that hath realitie, and power, and divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7448:170"/>
in it, that is from none other but from God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this hath ſuch excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it, as that God himſelfe boaſts <note place="margin">3</note> of ſuch as theſe are; as they glory in the Lord, and bleſſe themſelves in the Lord; ſo the Lord ſeemes to glory in them, and to account his name bleſſed by them; as you may ſee how God rejoyces in, and makes his boaſt of <hi>Iob, Chap. 1. verſ. 8. Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect, and an upright man?</hi> And ſo of <hi>David, I have found a man after mine own heart, which ſhall fulfill all my will:</hi> So of thoſe wee read of in <hi>Revel. 14. Theſe are they which were not defiled;</hi> and againe, <hi>Theſe are they which follow the Lambe whitherſoever he goeth;</hi> and again in the ſame verſe, <hi>Theſe were redeemed from among men, being the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lambe, and in their mouth was found no guile.</hi>

               <p>As firſt, ſome are convinced, their judgements and conſciences are for <note place="margin">1</note> God, but their luſts carry them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently another way: Oh the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torment of theſe mens ſpirits, while their conſciences draw one way, and their luſts another! it is not ſo great an evill to have wilde Horſes tyed to the members of ones body, tearing of them by drawing contrary wayes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, others reſt in their good inclinations, their good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; <note place="margin">2</note> they ſay they would faine doe better, and they hope God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the will for the deed; they like
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7448:171"/>
of Gods wayes, and ſpeake well of good men, and therefore they thinke their hearts are for God: but theſe deſires and good motions, are but as little buds and ſprigs that come out of the roots of trees, or from the middle of their body, which come to nothing, they never grow up to beare any fruit; theſe are yet farre from following the Lord fully and ſavingly; for,</p>

               <p>Thirdly, others have good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions <note place="margin">3</note> now and then in ſome good moods; the truths of God come dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in with ſome power, as they cannot but yeeld to them, and then they are reſolved that they will doe better, that it ſhall not be with them as it hath beene; they will ſet upon a new courſe of life, things ſhall bee reformed, and their lives ſhall bee changed; but yet theſe vaniſh too, they follow not God fully; They are as thoſe in the 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. who ſeemed to have ſtrong reſolutions to walke in Gods wayes; <hi>Goe thou neare,</hi> ſay they to Moſes, <hi>and heare all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeake thou unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeake unto thee, and we will heare it, and doe it:</hi> But as the Lord ſaid there, concerning them, <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. So I may ſay of theſe, <hi>Oh that there were ſuch a heart in them;</hi> How farre are they from having yet a heart to follow God fully?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:7448:174"/>
For, 1 Their reſolutions are not fruits of their deepe humiliation, for their former neglect of God, and the former ſinfulneſſe of their wayes; They are only to procure peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves for the preſent, their hearts being ſtirred by the power of the truth darted in.</p>
               <p>2 They ariſe not from changed principles, from a renewed nature, from out of love to the Lord, &amp; his bleſſed wayes; hence they vaniſh, and they never bring them up unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, others have ſtrong, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affections, they feele ſometimes <note place="margin">4</note> ſome meltings, in ſorrow for ſinne, in hearing the bleſſed truths of God revealed to them; they feele ſome ſweetneſſe in the working of truths upon their hearts, they are ſenſible of ſome joyes in good things, they have a taſte of the powers of the world to come: When they heare Chriſt preached, or ſee his body broken, or his blood ſhed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they think with themſelves;

Oh that Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould come from heaven, to ſave ſuch poore wretches as we are, that hee ſhould ſhed his pretious blood, that hee ſhould die for ſuch vile ſinners! yet theſe are a great way off from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord fully:</p>
               <p>For, 1 theſe affections are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <note place="margin">1</note> and flaſhing; the truths of God paſſe by them, leaving a little glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering behinde them, or as water paſſeth thorow a Conduit, &amp; leaves a dew; but they ſoake not into the heart, as the water ſoakes into the earth to make it fruitfull.</p>
               <p>2 Theſe are ſtirred with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, <note place="margin">2</note> comforting, ſaving mercies of God, but not with the humbling, renewing, ſanctifying mercies: when the word puts them upon any hard thing to fleſh and blood, it is unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury to them, their hearts turne from it; If the word urgeth to ſtrict examination of themſelves, if it puts them upon the finding out of the deceits of their ſpirits, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions, and would ſtraine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7448:175"/>
them to higher duties than their prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples reach unto, then their ſpirits fly off; they ſeeke to bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that they have already, and think that theſe things trouble peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more than needs &amp; if God ſhould not bee mercifull to ſuch who finde ſuch affections, ſuch ſtirrings of heart as wee doe, then Lord, what ſhall become of us?</p>
               <p>3 Theſe flaſhy affections doe not ariſe from ſpirituall judgement, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the ſpirituall excellencies of godlineſſe, after a ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; their apprehenſions of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and heavenly things, are too too carnall and ſenſitive: Hence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they come to finde the good things of the wayes of God to be ſpirituall, and heavenly, not ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe apprehenſions they had of them, their hearts are then taken off, as thoſe wee reade of in the 6. of <hi>Iohn 34. verſe;</hi> When Chriſt told them, <hi>That the bread of God is hee which commeth downe from heaven, and giveth life unto the world,</hi> Oh ſay
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7448:175"/>
they, <hi>Lord ever give us this bread;</hi> their hearts were up &amp; exceedingly ſtirred; Well, as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, You ſhall have it, <hi>I am the bread of life; hee that commeth to mee ſhall never hunger, hee that beleeveth in me ſhall never thirſt;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid; This muſt bee done by faith, you muſt feed upon my fleſh by faith, and drinke of my blood by faith. But now they having appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a ſtrange kind of bread from heaven before, and afterwards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of no other, but comming to Chriſt, and beleeving in Chriſt, they were deceived of their expectations, and ſo were offended, and now their affections fall; for <hi>verſe</hi> 41. they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to murmur at him, and <hi>verſe</hi> 60. they ſaid, <hi>It was an hard ſaying, who could heare it?</hi> and <hi>ver. 66. From that time many of them went backe, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked no more with him.</hi> The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample wee finde in the <hi>Galathians,</hi> at the firſt they would have pluckt out their eyes for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo ſtirred by his Miniſtery,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7448:176"/>
they apprehended ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the meſſage of the Goſpel that S. <hi>Paul</hi> brought, but afterwards, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that thoſe great and excellent things that the Goſpel ſpake of, were onely ſpirituall, which their carnall hearts had little skill of, and could not reliſh, their affections were ſoon cooled, &amp; they fell off from S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Take heed therefore of reſting to theſe flaſhy affections, for if you do, when theſe are gone, your hearts will bee left in darkeneſſe. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are knowne of ſuch, who have proved to bee moſt vile Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; yet time was, wherein they have had many meltings, much ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtrong joy, ſo as they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the joy they have found hath beene ſo great, that if it had continued but a while, they could not have lived, but their ſpirits would haue expired. A ſolid worke of the ſoule proceeding from an humble broken heart, caſting it ſelfe upon the faithfulneſſe, and freeneſſe of the grace of God in the promiſe, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7448:176"/>
and ſanctifying mercy, and there reſting, ſo as willing to venture it ſelfe there for ever, though it hath no preſent ſenſe of joy, yet it is farre more to be prized than the ſtrongeſt of theſe ſudden flaſhes of affection. Theſe flaſhy affections which have not principles to maintain them, are like to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duits in the City, running with wine at the Coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſome other great triumph, but it will not hold: they are like Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods, which ſeeme to bee a great ſea, but come to nothing in a day or two; As there may be flaſhes of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and yet no true feare of God. The Iſraelites were terrified when the Law was given, and yet God ſaith, <hi>Deut. 5. 29. Oh that there were a heart that they would feare me:</hi> So there may bee flaſhes of joy, deſire, ſorrow, and yet no true ſanctified joy, deſire, or ſorrow at all. There is much deceit in mens affections; Affections not well principled, not well grounded, ſoone vaniſh; time will weare them away. The people
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7448:177"/>
of Iſrael at the giving of the Law, had their affections much ſtirred, ſo that one would have thought, they had been engaged unto the Lord for ever; and yet within fourty dayes, their hearts were ſo taken off from God, and his Law, as if God had never made himſelfe knowne unto them; they call to <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them gods to goe before them, and ſay to the Molten Calfe, <hi>Theſe be thy gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example wee have of people whoſe affections are ſtrong for the preſent, and yet worne away in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, in the 13. of <hi>Hoſea 1. When Ephraim ſpake, trembling, hee exalted himſelfe in Iſrael; but when he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Baal, hee died: When Ephraim ſpake,</hi> that is, when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sanctius</hi> in Hoſea 13.</note> was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his purpoſe to alter the worſhip of God, the people at the firſt were exceedingly affected with it, &amp; they ſtood all trembling at ſuch a ſtrange thing as that was; the very thought
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7448:177"/>
of it made their hearts to ſhake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew how jealous a God the Lord was; <hi>But Ieroboam exalted himſelfe in Iſrael,</hi> hee went on reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in his way, and would bring his purpoſe to effect; then the people in a little time, were brought to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>then they died,</hi> and they became a dead, ſottiſh, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe people, fit to receive, or do any thing though never ſo vile.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, others follow the Lord, <note place="margin">5</note> but they follow him in a dull, heavy manner; there is no ſpirit, no heat, no life in their following of him, &amp; therefore they doe not follow him fully: They reſt themſelves in a middle temper, in a lukewarme courſe; they like well of Religion, and profeſſion, but what need men goe ſo farre, what need they doe ſo much? As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, <hi>Exod. 8. 28. I will let you goe, onely you ſhall not goe farre away.</hi> The judgement of theſe men is for a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way; they are mixed ſpirited men, like <hi>Ephraim, Hoſea</hi> 7. 8. mixed
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7448:178"/>
with the people, as a cake not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, halfe baked and halfe dough; they goe on in an ordinary track of performing the duties of Religion without any growth, or any ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the want of growth; they ſet upon ſome faire way of Religion, which they perſwade themſelves is enough, and that they meane to hold to; they are content to make uſe of Chriſt, and the profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo farre as may ſerve their owne turnes; but to entertaine Chriſt, and his truth, as an abſolute Lord to rule them, that their ſpirits cannot beare; in their converſe there is no ribaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, no filthineſſe; ſo there is no warmth, no heat to refreſh and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any gratious ſpirit, that hath to deale with them; in all the Duties of Religion that they perform, they take no paines with their hearts, to work them to God. <hi>Luther</hi> cals ſuch kind <note place="margin">Cainiſlae ſunt, of ſerentes non per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7448:178"/>
hopes of Gods mercy upon weake, and unexamined grounds; they never trouble themſelves in calling things into queſtion, about their conditions and their eternall eſtates; they never lay to heart the miſeries of Gods Church; and the publike cauſe of God is not deare unto them; they have not heat enough to cauſe a mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting ſpirit, for the diſhonor that God hath by themſelves; much more is that heat wanting, that ſhould keepe their hearts melting for that diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which God hath from others.</p>
               <p>Now this temper is ſo farre from following the Lord fully, as it is loathſome and abominable to the Lord; ſo loathſome, as he threatens to ſpue ſuch out of his mouth. It is <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 16,</note> obſervable, that of all the ſeven Churches we read of in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there is ſome good ſaid, every one is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for ſomthing; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> excepted which was a luke-warme Church; and of this there is no good at all ſaid; and yet none of the Churches had
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7448:179"/>
that high eſteeme of it ſelfe as this had; none of them conceited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">1</note> to be rich, and encreaſed with goods, and to have need of nothing, as this did. No people doth ſo bleſſe themſelves in their way, as luke-warme people doe; and yet no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more abominable to God than they. What a diſhonour is this luke-warme temper to God, as if God were ſuch a God, as ſuch flat, ſleight, dead-hearted formall ſervices, as are performed by them, were ſufficient to honour his holy, great, dreadfull and infinite Majeſtie? God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeth a curſe in <hi>Malac. 1. verſe</hi> 14. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who doe not offer the beſt that poſſibly they can, in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to him; and gives this Reaſon of it, <hi>Becauſe my Name is dreadfull, and I am a great King, ſaith the Lord:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Therefore onely the moſt high and excellent things that can bee performed by the creature, are fit for to be tendred up to mee. This luke-warme temper wrongs Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt exceedingly, as if there
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7448:179"/>
were no other life and vertue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, than to inable a man to doe as they doe. What? hath Chriſt laid down his life, &amp; ſhed his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood for the renewing of Gods Image in man, and is it nothing but this? if Chriſt had never come into the world, men might have done as much as this comes to. It is a wrong to the Holy Spirit likewiſe, for it is the ſpecial office of the Holy Ghoſt, for to bee a Sanctifier, to frame the heart to God, to quicke the ſoul with the life of grace, and holineſſe; and is this all it doth? this were a poore worke, if there were no other but this. It diſhonours holineſſe, which is the moſt glorious thing in the world; the life of God, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; this makes it as if it were nothing but a morall, liveleſſe, dead-hearted, empty thing; this puts holineſſe in ſubjection to humane reaſon, to carnall wiſedome; it muſt bow to their diſcretion, to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wayes of men; and in truth, to their baſe luſts, though it be in a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7448:180"/>
more cleanly way, than in others. Be convinced then, that this is not that following the Lord fully, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the honour of Gods people in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, ſome go beyond this dull luke-warme temper, they are very <note place="margin">6</note> forward in ſome things, but in other things their hearts ſticke; they come not off fully in them. <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that <hi>Paul</hi> had almoſt perſwaded him; the words are, <hi>Thou perſwadeſt mee a little.</hi> The hearts of theſe men are divided, as it is ſaid of <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> thoſe in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10. 2. they will not let goe their profeſſion, but will keepe their corruption too. As <hi>Camden</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Redwald</hi> King of the Eaſt Saxons, the firſt Prince of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was baptized, yet in the ſame Church had one Altar for Chriſtian Religion, and another for Sacrifices unto Devills: Thus theſe men joyne Religion and their luſt together. If they let out their hearts inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any contentment, and take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſometimes in ſatisfying ſome luſts, they thinke to make up all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7448:180"/>
by ſome forwardneſſe and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt devotion in ſome other thing; as many who get ſurfets think they can ſweat and purge them out again.</p>
               <p>This diviſion of heart the Lord cannot endure, and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in that place of <hi>Hoſea, They ſhall be found faulty;</hi> or as the words are read by ſome, <hi>Now ſhall they bee made deſolate:</hi> for in the Hebrew, the word ſignifies both to bee guilty, and to bee deſolate. It is too much boldneſſe and preſumptuouſneſſe in men, to venture to take liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to chuſe wherein they will yeeld to God in ſome things; but in others preſume to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; this is not to caſt downe our ſoules before the Lord, as poore, condemned, vile creatures, to lie at his mercy in an humble, faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves up to him, in all wee are, or have, which is that honour that God expects from us, and is infinitely due unto him. While our hearts are thus divided betweene God and other things; God doth
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7448:181"/>
not account himſelfe obeyed, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured at all in any thing; all that we ſeeme to doe, in truth, is nothing at all. Hence in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32. 23. the Prophet chargeth the people with this, that they neither walked in Gods Law, and that they had done nothing of all that God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to doe; and <hi>Ver.</hi> 30. he ſaith, they had only done evill: and in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. the people are ſaid to feare the Lord, and ſerve their owne gods, <hi>Verſe</hi> 33. and yet in <hi>Verſe</hi> 34. the Text ſayes, that they feared not the Lord: ſhewing unto us, that where the heart is divided betweene God and other things, there God hath not the heart at all, God is not feared, he is not honoured at all. If wee joyne the counſels of the fleſh with the ſpirit, we fruſtrate all.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, there are others who cannot bee ſo eaſily convinced in <note place="margin">7</note> what particulars they forſake God in any of his wayes; they ſeeme to have a generall forwardneſſe in that which is good, but the truth is, they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7448:181"/>
follow themſelves, and not God in all; they riſe no higher than <hi>Selfe</hi> in all they doe; which their owne conſciences, upon ſearch made, will tell them; the Commandement of God may be made the pretence, but <hi>Selſe</hi> is the chiefe Engine, <hi>Selſe</hi> is the great mover in all. As Phyſitians putting in many operative ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents into their Phyſick, and they are the things that worke; but beſides, they put in ſomething to give a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or a little taſte, which neither doth good nor hurt, that hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration at all: Thus it is in many mens Religion; ſelfe-ends are the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative ingredients in that they doe, and the ſhew of obedience to God, is but that which gives the colour, that that which they doe may have the better apperance. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that a man which ſeekes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould come up to this fulneſſe of ſpirit that is required in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Lord. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 1. it is ſaid, That Iſrael is an empty Vine; Why ſo? he bringeth forth fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7448:182"/>
himſelfe; hee brings forth fruit, but yet is empty, becauſe hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it forth unto himſelfe. Where ſelfe-ends are the chiefe movers, <note place="margin">Fructus adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus eſt ei; ſo the old Latine.</note> there is no further latitude or degree of godlineſſe minded, but ſuch as may be ſerviceable unto them: Now they cannot but bee low, ſtrait, narrow, in compariſon of thoſe who lift up God in all they do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their profeſſion muſt needs bee empty and ſcant; not full and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as it is in the other. A ſelfe-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart is alwayes an empty heart, but a gracious heart is fruitfull in all manner of pleaſant fruits, new and old: And what is the reaſon? <hi>I have laid them up for thee, O my beloved Cant. 7. v. laſt.</hi> Obſerve the difference, Iſrael is an empty Vine, hee brings forth fruit to himſelfe; but the Church here brings forth all manner of pleaſant fruit; for ſhee layes them up for her Beloved; ſhee brings them not forth for her ſelfe, as Iſrael did.</p>
               <p>Eightly, others follow the Lord <note place="margin">8</note>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:7448:182"/>
earneſtly a while, but afterwards they forſake him, they turne Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, they doe not fill up their worke they have begun, but undoe all againe; of whom it may be ſaid, as <hi>Lament.</hi> 4. 8.

bleſſed promiſes, full of mercy, and encouragement for you, that God will make good to the full unto you; yea, they ſhall come to you fuller of goodneſſe, and bleſſing than you can imagine. <hi>Caleb</hi> challenged this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to him made in this place, upon this ground, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> 14. 8. five and forty yeares after it was made; for hee was but forty yeares old when hee went to ſpie out the Land, and when hee challenged this promiſe in this place, bee ſaith <hi>verſe 10.

God ſeemed to deferre a long time that promiſe he made to <hi>Abraham, That hee would make his ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven;</hi> for two hundred and fifteene yeares after this promiſe was made, there were but
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7448:190"/>
ſeventy ſoules that came out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> loynes, namely, when <hi>Iacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt;</hi> which if we compute the time, wee ſhall find to bee juſt two hundred and fifteene yeares: for <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſeventy and five yeares old when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made; hee was an hundred yeares old when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was forty yeares old before he married, and hee continued twenty yeares without a child; and <hi>Iacob</hi> was one hundred and thirty yeares old when he went into <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that the time fals to bee juſt two hundred and fifteene yeares, which was juſt halfe the time, from the promiſe till the people of Iſraels comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. was foure hundred and thirty years. Now obſerve, that whereas God halfe this time did but little for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> in the fulfilling of this his promiſe, yet becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him fully, ventured himſelfe wholly upon the faithfulneſſe of the Lord, ſee how fully God came in
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7448:190"/>
with his mercy at the laſt; for, in the ſecond two hundred and fifteen yeares, hee ſo encreaſed his ſeed, that from ſeventy ſoules, they were growne up to bee ſixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and three thouſand, and five hundred and fifty, <hi>Num.</hi> 1. 45, 46. and theſe onely from twenty yeares old and upward, ſuch men as were able to goe to warre; there was thus many of theſe, beſides all children and women, which it is like were far the greater number; yea, and the Tribe of Levy was not numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt this number; there were two and twenty thouſand and upwards of them beſides. Thus you ſee, how fully God comes in at the laſt in his mercy, and making good his word of promiſe to ſuch who follow him ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Be you as full as you can in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord, the Lord will bee as full towards you, in doing good unto you; Gods mercy ſhall be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as full, as your obedience can bee, 2 <hi>Sam. 22. 26. with the upright thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe uprigh:</hi> The words

               <p>God certainly will remember the kindneſſe of thoſe who are willing to follow him through the wilderneſſe of difficulties and diſcouragements, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 2. 2. You who doe thus, ſhall die without ſtaine, without any blur, which few doe; your memories ſhall be ſweet, and bleſſed, when you are dead and gone: You ſhall have <hi>an entrance miniſtred unto you abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into the everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 11.

                  <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding eternall waight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is glory, and this word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone implies that there is exceeding <note place="margin">1</note> much in it; but further, it is a waight of glory, yea, an eternall waight of glory; and more than that, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eternall waight of glory; as if yet it were not expreſt fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, hee addes further, a farte more exceeding eternall waight of glory; and what expreſſion can bee fuller than this? This was that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that incouraged <hi>Moſes</hi> in his full following the Lord, forſaking the pleaſures, the riches, the treaſures of Egypt, that hee migh follow the Lord fully; <hi>For hee had,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>a reſpect unto the recompence of reward, Hebrewes,</hi> 11. 26.

                  <p>An Exhortation to follow the Lord fully.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw the Lord carry our hearts fully after himſelfe: As the two blinde men, <hi>Matth. 20. verſ. laſt,</hi> as ſoone as their eyes were opened, they followed Chriſt; ſo were our eyes opened, wee would certainly follow after the Lord; were they fully opened, our hearts would follow fully. Many of you have ſome convictions, ſome incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſtirrings of affections, good reſolutions; you begin to have good thoughts of Gods wayes, you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaded: Oh that the work were throughly done! it is pity but that theſe beginnings ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. When Chriſt ſaw the good inclinations of the young man, when he came unto him, the Text ſaith, He looked upon him, and loved him:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7448:194"/>
thoſe beginnings are lovely; but how lovely then would the full worke be, if theſe beginnings were brought to perfection?</p>
               <p>In this Vſe we ſhall ſhew, firſt, the Motives which may draw our hearts to the following of the Lord fully.</p>
               <p>2 What it is that hinders the ſoule in this worke, that it may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>3 What it is that would bring off the heart fully indeed.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; there is infinite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note place="margin">1</note> that our hearts ſhould bee fully after the Lord: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is a fulneſſe of all good in God; hee is worthy; <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive glory, honour, and power, Revel.</hi> 4. 11. Thou art worthy to receive the higheſt honour that any of thy creatures can by any meanes give unto thee. The Heathen gods were honoured, as thoſe who were onely Authors of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good things; and therefore there were ſuch a multiplicity of them: one was honoured as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7448:194"/>
of one good thing, and another as the author of another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore particular honour was ſufficient for them. There was no reaſon that that any of them ſhould have the whole ſoule, working in the fulneſſe of the operations of it after them; but our God is not ſo; he is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall good, in whom there is all good, and from whom all good flowes, and by whom all good is preſerved in the being it hath; and therfore it is a moſt abſolute, univerſall honor and ſervice that is due to him; if wee had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſoules, and if they were all of ten thouſand times larger extent than they are; yet infinite reaſon there would bee, that they ſhould all in the full latitude, extent, &amp; ſtrength of them, work after this our God, to honour and magnifie, and worſhip this God for ever. As that bleſſed Martyr once ſaid, What, have I but <note place="margin">Iohn Ardley.</note> one life to lay downe for Chriſt? If I had as many lives, as there are haires upon my head, they ſhould all goe for Jeſus Chriſt: He ſaw Chriſt
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7448:195"/>
worthy of all hee had, yea, of more than he had. This was Gods own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me, and be upright;</hi> bee perfect, for I am God al-ſufficient, I have all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in me, and therefore be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider God might <note place="margin">2</note> have had full glory in your deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let him not bee a loſer in his ſhewing mercy to you. How much better is it for you, that hee ſhould have the fulneſſe of his glory, in his mercy to you, than the fulneſſe of it in his judgements upon you? This he might have had long agoe: yea, and the fulneſſe of his glory hee will have; if you give it not to him, hee will force it from you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath fully gone <note place="margin">3</note> thorow the great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he would never leave it till he had fully accompliſhed all, and ſaid, It is finiſhed. This was a mighty work, for the accompliſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he paſſed thorow more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than ever thou art like to do, in
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7448:195"/>
the fulleſt meaſure of following the Lord, that poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, yea, Gods mercies for <note place="margin">4</note> the preſent, are very full towards you; his pardoning mercies, and his ſupplying mercies, with all things needfull; when hee receives thee to mercy, he fully pardons all thy ſins, hee leaves nothing upon the ſcore; he remits all thy puniſhments. This was <hi>Davids</hi> Argument, <hi>Pſal. 103. 1, 2, 3 Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and all that is within mee, bleſſe his Holy Name:</hi> and bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, again; as if he ſhould ſay, O let God be fully bleſſed by me: why? what was that, that raiſed and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Davids</hi> heart? It followes, <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and heales all thy diſeaſes;</hi> and <hi>verſ. 4. He crownes thee with loving kindneſſes;</hi> and <hi>verſ. 5. He ſatisfies thy mouth with good things.</hi> God gives his ſervants a fulneſſe in all they doe enjoy; his grace exceedingly abounds towards them in every thing. That place in 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9. 8. is very remarkable for
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7448:196"/>
the ſetting out of the abounding of Gods grace towards his people; <hi>And God is able</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>to make all grace abound towards you, that ye alwayes having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> What ever God is able to doe for us, by faith wee make it as if it were done. And this power of God is ſet forth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as a Motive to perſwade them to full o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that they might abound to every good work; which if they did, they ſhould have this power of God active, fully working for them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe large expreſſions wee have of it in this Scripture. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeverall expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Then all grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then all grace abounding.</p>
               <p n="4">4 A ſufficiency.</p>
               <p n="5">5 An all-ſufficiency.</p>
               <p n="6">6 An all-ſufficiency in all things.</p>
               <p>And 7. alwayes an all-ſufficiency in all things. And is not here an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument full enough, to cauſe them
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7448:196"/>
and us, and all Gods people for ever, to abound in every good worke. How often doth God fill our cup with mercy, and make it even runne over; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 5? If there ſhall be an All-ſufficiency in all things, then there will be an all-ſufficiency in our greateſt ſtraits, in our greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, in our greateſt ſeares: As it is ſaid of the wicked, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 22. in the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency, hee ſhall bee in ſtraits; the contrary is true concerning Gods people; in the fulneſſe of their ſtraits, they ſhall be in all-ſufficiency. God cauſeth all his Attributes, and all the wayes of his Providence, and all his creatures to work for the good of his people; All that is in God, all that God doth, and all that belongs to God, is for them; therefore infinite reaſon there is, that all they are, that all they doe, that all they have, ſhould worke for his honour.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all there is in God 1 is for <note place="margin">1</note> them, <hi>Ierem. 32, 41. I will rejoyce over them, to doe them good, and I will plant
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7448:197"/>
them in this land aſſuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole ſoule:</hi> God cals for no more from thee than he is willing to give unto thee; hee would have thy whole heart, &amp; thy whole ſoule for his honour, and hee promiſeth to give thee his whole heart, and his whole ſoule, for thy good. Againe, all that God doth, is for thee; <hi>Pſal. 25. 10. All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto ſuch as keepe his Covenant and his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> The pathes of the Lord, are the wayes of God, in the paſſages of his Providence; not onely ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts, but the track of God in his wayes, his pathes: Now all theſe pathes of God, that is, all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of God in the waies of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they are mercy unto ſuch, they work mercifully for their good. And further obſerve, they are not onely mercy, but mercy in truth: God hath ingaged his truth, that they ſhould thus worke for them; God hath tyed this mercy to them by his truth. See here the difference
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7448:197"/>
between Gods mercy to his people, and his mercy to other men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome of Gods pathes may be mercy to other men, but not all; or ſome particular acts of God, rather than his pathes: God doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily goe on in a track and courſe of his mercies with them, as hee doth with his people: As their obedience is onely in ſome particular acts, and no continued courſe; ſo Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them, which comes from his generall bounty, is manifeſted onely in ſome particular acts of his, and not in any conſtant courſe. But it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in his dealings towards his people; they goe on in a conſtant courſe of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; they make Gods Commandements their pathes, and therefore God goes on in a conſtant courſe of loving kindneſſe towards them, hee makes his mercy to them the ordinary pathes wherein hee walkes: As, <hi>Pſalm. 36. 10. O continue thy loving kindneſſe to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſſe to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</hi> The word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7448:198"/>
is, <hi>Draw out thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Gods mercies to his owne, are a continued <hi>Series,</hi> they are drawne out from a conſtant Spring, they come forth from a never-failing Fountaine; there is a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one mercy and another; but as for others, God now and then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſts his favours on them.</p>
               <p>And obſerve a ſecond difference; all Gods paths are mercy to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not ſome few; there are none of Gods dealings, but ayme at good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; if God ſhould cauſe one favour to follow another towards ſome wicked man, out of the fulneſſe of his bounty; yet it cannot be ſaid of any wicked man in the world, that all the pathes of God are mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. God hath his pathes of wrath and judgement, wherein he is comming towards him, though hee bee little aware of it: But this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all the pathes of God being mercy, is a peculiar bleſſing to ſuch as follow the Lord fully, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of their hearts, in all the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7448:198"/>
pathes of ſervice and obedience.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, obſerve yet a greater <note place="margin">3</note> difference than the former: All the pathes of God are not onely mercy, but mercy and truth to his people: though God may ſhew mercy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet he hath not tyed his mercy to them by his truth; they cannot challenge mercy from him by vertue of his truth; if they have mercy, it is more than they could have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; they cannot be ſure of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it one houre; they have nothing to ſhew for their mercy; they doe not hold their mercy upon that Tenor of Gods truth which his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe. Nay, when God comes to make good his truth, to give his truth the glory of it, then there is an end put to their mercy; it is cut off from them; but there is a bleſſed connexion between Mercy &amp; Truth in the good which Gods people doe enjoy; according to the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the forenamed 36. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 10. the loving kindneſſe and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God are put both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7448:199"/>
as the portion of an upright heart. And hence the mercies they have, are no other than ſuch as they may expect, as they may build upon, before they come; ſuch as are made over to them by the truth of God; and when they are come they may bee ſure to hold them, becauſe they hold them upon ſuch a bleſſed Tenure as GODS owne truth. And hence the Scripture calls them <hi>ſure mercies.</hi> See how confident <hi>David</hi> was of holding Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>Pſalm. 23. 6. Surely good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy ſhall follow mee all the dayes of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, all that God hath, is for their good; the heavens, and earth, and all Creatures are theirs, and worke continually for them: <hi>Hoſea 2. 21. 22. I will heare the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and they ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall heare the Corne, and the Wine, and the Oyle, and they ſhall heare Iezreel:</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23: <hi>The world, life, death, things preſent, things to come, all are yours, and yee are Chriſts,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7448:199"/>
and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>And we know that all things worke together for good, to them that love God.</hi> This is a myſterie that the world is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, but we know it, ſaith the Apoſtle. The world may thinke, that things worke againſt us; yea, all things in the world ſeeme to work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; but we know that all things doe work for good, &amp; they work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good; though ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things conſidered apart, may worke for good to other men; yet take all together, and they worke their ruine; but altogether workes for good to us; although the good doth not ſeeme yet to come forth, yet it is a working for us; ſtay but till the worke bee done, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: Good it will bee, though it may bee not the ſame good that wee thinke of, yet a good that will bee better for us; a greater good than we imagined or deſired. Now then, if all that is Gods bee for thee, and workes thus fully for thee, is there not reaſon then, that all that is thine
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7448:200"/>
ſhould be for God, and worke as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him? Thine did I ſay? the truth is, there is nothing thine; for all is Gods; God hath a greater propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in, and right to whatſoever thou art, and haſt, than thy ſelfe; but God is pleaſed to let it bee called thine, that thou maiſt freely give it to him: and if it bee his owne, why ſhould hee not have it fully? If he thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth himſelfe towards thee, how unequall is it, that thou ſhouldeſt be ſcant in thy ſervice to him, and in thine honouring of him?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, wicked men doe fully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">5</note> after that which is evill; an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſhame &amp; confuſion then would it be to us, an infinite diſhonour like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto God, if wee ſhould not as fully follow the Lord in that which is good? <hi>Eccleſiaſtes 9. 3.

                  <hi>men is fully ſet in them to doe evill:</hi> The Seventy tranſlate this, <hi>The heart of man hath a Plerophorie to evill;</hi> it is ſet upon it without any doubt, or
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7448:200"/>
ſuſpition; there is a plerophorie of boldneſſe to ſinne in them; why ſhould there not bee a plerophorie, (that is) a full perſwaſion of faith in Gods ſervants to that which is good? <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 3. the Scripture ſaith, that wicked men doe evill with both hands, earneſtly: <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 5. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there are ſaid to inflame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Idols; and <hi>Ieremy Chap.</hi> 8. 2. they are ſaid, 1. To love their Idols: 2. To ſerve them: 3. To walke after them: 4 To ſeek them: 5. To worſhip them: all theſe 5. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions together in one <hi>Verſe,</hi> to ſet forth the earneſtneſſe and fulneſſe of the ſpirit of Idolaters towards their Idols. Where have we five ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions together, to ſet out the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the worke of mens ſpirits in following after the Lord? It was ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that hee ſold himſelfe to work wickedneſſe; what a fulneſſe of ſpirit was there in him, in doing wickedneſſe? <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 10. It is ſaid there of the people, that their courſe was evill, and their force was not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7448:201"/>
right. That <hi>vis,</hi> that ſtrength, and force that was in their ſpirits, was not right; it was not after God, but after the wayes of ſinne. How many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties will men paſſe thorow for their luſts? what coſt will they bee at? how great things will they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? nothing is ſo deare unto them, but they will be content to part with it for, and beſtow it upon their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. How ſoon did the people, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 32. break off their golden Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings from their Eares, to make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll withall? and ſhall not then our hearts and lives bee more fully after the bleſſed God? Wee ſee wicked men ſticke cloſe to their wicked principles; they are bold, they will not bee daunted, they will goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with the worke they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, what ever come of it; ſhould not wee much more ſtick to our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhould not wee much more bee undaunted in our way, and goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with our worke?</p>
               <p>I remember I haue read a paſſage in Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> how he brings in the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7448:201"/>
devil triumphing over Chriſt in this manner; As for my followers, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyed for them, as Chriſt did for his; I never promiſed them ſo great reward, as Chriſt hath done to his; and yet I have more followers than hee, and they doe more for mee, than his doth for him. O let the thought of our giving the devil occaſion thus to triumph over Chriſt in our ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and negligence in following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, cauſe ſhame and confuſion to cover our faces: and yet to put on this Argument a little more cloſe; It may bee you your ſelves hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have followed ſinne fully, your hearts have beene ſtrong after evill, and your lives have beene fruitfull in it; it may bee you have beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in putting forth your ſelves ring-leaders in that which was evill; not onely ſtout and perverſe your ſelves, but maintainers, encouragers of much evill in others; you gave up yours members, your eſtates, and what you had, to the ſervice of ſin; much time was ſpent, much ſleepe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7448:202"/>
broke, in plotting and contriving wickedneſſe, much paines taken in the execution of it, and now your hearts and wayes ſeeme to bee for God; and is a poore, ſleight, ſcant, dead-hearted ſervice ſufficient for him? Oh bee aſhamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thy thoughts, let Conſcience judge betweene God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Doeſt thou thus requite the Lord? is this thy kindneſſe to him? Is there not infinite reaſon, that as you have yeelded your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to uncleannes, &amp; to iniquity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iniquity; even ſo you now ſhould yeeld your members ſervants to righteouſneſſe unto holineſſe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. Marke the oppoſition there; there are three <hi>to's</hi> in the expreſſion of the ſervice to ſinne, <hi>To</hi> unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>To</hi> iniquitie, <hi>Vnto</hi> iniquitie; but in the ſervice of God there are onely two, <hi>To</hi> righteouſnes, <hi>Vnto</hi> holines. It is true, in this life there will never be that fulneſſe of ſpirit in following after God, as there was in following after ſinne; becauſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7448:202"/>
but ſinne in the ſoule before, no other ſtreame to abate it; but now there is ſomthing elſe beſides grace; a ſtreame of corruption to oppoſe it: but yet wee ſhould bee aſhamed, that there ſhould be ſuch a difference; the thought of it ſhould cauſe a dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart within us, and we ſhould judge it infinitely equall &amp; reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we ſhould indeavour to the utmoſt wee are able, to follow God as fully now, as ever wee followed ſinne before. Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26. 11. confeſſeth, that in his former way he was madd in the perſecution of Gods ſervants; and when God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſtreame, others judged him as mad in the other way; 2 <hi>Corinth. 5. 13. For whether we bee beſides our ſelves, it is to God; the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us.</hi> And hence we may obſerve, that the ſame word that ſignifies to perſecute, he uſeth to ſet out his earneſt preſſing towards the Marke; <hi>Phil. 3. 14. I preſſe towards the Marke, for the price of the high calling of God.</hi> The word that is there

               <p>Sixthly, the more fully we follow <note place="margin">6</note> God, the more full ſhall our preſent peace, and joy, and ſoule ſatisfying contentment be. <hi>Pſal. 119. 130. The entrance of thy words giveth light;</hi> the beginning of following God, is ſweet and good, but the further wee doe goe on, the more ſweet we ſhall finde, as they who walked toward Sion, <hi>Pſalm. 84. 7. They went from ſtrength to ſtrength:</hi> ſo they who walke after the Lord, they goe from peace to peace, from joy to joy, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one degree of comfort unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; for if the entrance into our way be ſo good and ſweet, what will it bee when wee come into the midſt of it? <hi>Prov. 8. 20. I lead in the way of righteouſneſſe, in the midſt of the pathes of judgement;</hi> marke what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7448:203"/>
there, <hi>verſe 21. That I might cauſe thoſe that love me, to inherit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and I will fill their treaſures.</hi> Then doth the ſoule inherit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance indeed, then are the treaſures of it filled, when wiſedome leades it, not onely in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but in the midſt of the paths of judgement. The way of the juſt is compared to the ſhining of the light, <hi>that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18. The further hee goes on his way, the more light hee hath, the more glorious ſhine is upon him. <hi>Pſal. 36. 8. They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied, and they ſhall drinke of the River of pleaſures.</hi> Who are thoſe that ſhal be thus abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, and ſhall have this River of pleaſures? they are <hi>verſe 10. the upright in heart.</hi> That ſoule that walkes on before the Lord in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of it, ſhall not want ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſhall not want pleaſure. <hi>Pſal. 119. 165. Great peace have they which love thy law.</hi> It is more to love Gods law the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do the thing that is
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7448:204"/>
commanded in it. That ſoule which doth not onely ſubmit to the Law, but loves it, will be abundant in duty, for love is bountifull; &amp; great peace hath ſuch a ſoule, that thus loves Gods Law. Every good motion in the ſoule is as the budd of the Lord, and that is beautifull and glorious; but how excellent and glorious is the fruit of it then? the good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which are as the budding of the Pomegranate, and the putting forth of the tender Vine, are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God and to the ſoule; but how pleaſant then is the fruit when it comes to ripeneſſe?</p>
               <p>The more fully we follow on in Gods wayes, the more full will the teſtimony of the witneſſes both in heaven and earth bee, in witneſſing our bleſſed eſtate unto us: Thoſe three witneſſes in heaven, the Father, Word, and Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe three on earth, the ſpirit, water, and the blood, of which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 1 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 5. 7, 8. they will all come with their full teſtimony, to that ſoule
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7448:204"/>
which followes God fully. By fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord fully, wee keep our evidences cleare; ſinne blots and blurs our evidences, that oftentimes wee cannot reade them; but when the heart keeps cloſe to God, and walks fully with him, then all is kept faire. The Kingdome of God conſiſts in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy; the more fully wee are brought into his Kingdome, the more fully wee are under his government; as there will bee the more righteouſneſſe, ſo the more peace, and joy. <hi>Eſ. 9. 7. Of the encreaſe of his government, and peace, there ſhall bee no end,</hi> ſaith the Text. The more encreaſe there is of Chriſts government in the ſoule, the more full it is, the more peace will be there.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, there is great reaſon that wee ſhould walke fully after the <note place="margin">7</note> Lord, becauſe the way that God cals us to walke in, is a moſt bleſſed and holy way: In the 21. <hi>Revelation, 21. verſe;</hi> The ſtreets of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (that is, the wayes of Gods people
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7448:205"/>
in his Church, wherein they are to walke) they are ſaid to bee of pure gold, and as it were tranſparent glaſſe; they are golden wayes, they are bright ſhining wayes. <hi>Prov. 3. 17. The wayes of wiſdome are the wayes of pleaſantneſſe; and all her paths are peace.</hi> There is not any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, wherein hee would have us to follow him, but it is very lovely, there is much good in it: God requires nothing of us, but that which is moſt juſt and holy: as God is holy in all his workes, ſo he is holy in all his Commands; they are no other, but that which if our hearts were as they ought, wee would chooſe to our ſelves. A righteous man is a law to himſelfe, he ſees that good, that beauty, that equity in all Gods Lawes, as hee would chooſe them to himſelfe were hee left at his owne liberty. What one thing is there in Gods Law that could bee ſpared? What is there that thou couldſt bee glad to bee exempted from? It may bee in the ſtrength of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7448:205"/>
temptation, when ſome luſt is up working, the fleſh would faine have ſome liberty, but upon due ſerious thoughts, looking into the bottome of things, a gracious ſoule cloſeth with the Law, and loveth it as gold, yea, fine gold, and breakes for the longing it hath, not to the reward of obedience to Gods Statutes, and Judgements, but to the Statutes and Judgements of God themſelves, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith his ſoule did. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our path in following the Lord may ſeeme rugged and hard to the fleſh, in regard of the afflictions and troubles it meets withall in it; yet where there is a ſpirituall eye, the way of holineſſe appeares to it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding lovely and beautifull. Though <hi>David Pſa.</hi> 23. ſuppoſed the worſt that might befall him in his way, as that he might walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death; yet he cals his way greene paſtures, and ſaith, Godwill leade him by the ſtill waters. It is true, the wayes of God are grievous to the wicked, but
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7448:206"/>
very good and delightfull to the Saints, becauſe they are the wayes of holineſſe, as <hi>Eſay 35. 8. And a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhall be there, and it ſhall bee called, the way of holineſſe; The uncleane ſhall not paſſe over it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, the conſideration of the end of our way, ſhould bee a ſtrong <note place="margin">8</note> motive, to draw our hearts fully after the Lord in it; the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is ſweet, the midſt of it more, as before we have ſhewed; but the end of it moſt ſweet of all; there is that comming, that will fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all.</p>
               <p>Conſider of the ſweetneſſe of the end of our way;</p>
               <p n="1">1 In that period of it that will be at death, and 2, In that glorious reward we ſhall have in heaven.</p>
               <p>That ſweet and bleſſed comfort, that the full following of the Lord brings at death, is enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all the trouble and hardſhip, that wee meet withall in our way, while we are following of him: This hath cauſed many Saints of God to
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7448:206"/>
lie triumphing, when they have been upon their death-beds, bleſſing the Lord that ever they knew his wayes, that euer he drew their hearts to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after him in them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> received the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of death, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 2, 3, he turned his face to the wall, and ſaid, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight; and Hezechiah wept ſore:</hi> O the ſweetneſſe that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the heart of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which did flow from the teſtimony of his conſcience, that hee had fully wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after the Lord with a perfect heart! the <hi>verbe</hi> there, <hi>I have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Luther,</hi> who was a man <note place="margin">Oſian hiſt. Eccle. cent. 16. l. b. 2 cap. 56.</note> whoſe ſpirit was exceeding full in his love unto, and walking after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt while hee lived; and when hee came to die, his ſpirit
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7448:207"/>
was as full of comfort, and joy, as before it was full of zeale, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; theſe expreſſions brake from him; <hi>O my heavenly Father, O God the Father of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the God of all comfort, I give thee thanks that thou haſt revealed thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt to mee, whom I have beleeved, whom I have profeſſed, whom I have loved, whom I have honoured, whom the Biſhop of Rome, and the reſt of the rout of wicked men have perſecuted, and contemned; and now I beſeech thee; O my Lord Ieſus Chriſt, receive my ſoule, my heavenly Father; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my body is to be laid downe, yet I certainly know that I ſhall for ever remaine with thee, neither can I by any be pulled out of thy hands.</hi> The grace of Gods Spirit oftentimes appeares moſt in the glory of it, when death approacheth, becauſe grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is then about to meet. That ſoule that hath followed God fully here, when it comes to depart out of the body, it onely changeth the place, nor the company; which was the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7448:207"/>
ſpeech of a late reverend holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of ours, a little before his death. <hi>I ſhall change my place,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>but not my company:</hi> meaning, that as he had converſed with God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Lord here in this World, hee was now going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, and to follow after him more fully in a better World. Death to ſuch a ſoule, it is but Gods calling of it, from the lower gallery of this World, to the upper gallery of Heaven, to walke with him there. Here the converſe that Jeſus Chriſt hath with the ſoules of his people, is compared to that converſe, that friends have one with another, in their walkings together in their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, <hi>Cant. 7. 5. The King is held in the galleries:</hi> hee doth not only walk with his Beloved there, but is as it were bound, he is kept there by the bands of love, and when death comes, then the ſoule is called up, to the upper roome, to heaven, there to follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:7448:208"/>
Wee reade of a notable ſpeech, that <hi>Hilarion</hi> had when hee was to die; <hi>Goe out, goe out my ſoule, why doſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Egredere, quid times? egredere anima mea, quid dubitas? ſeptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gintaprope annis ſerviſti Chriſto, et mortemtimes? <hi>Hicronym, in vit. ejus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>thou feare, why doſt thou doubt? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most theſe ſeventy yeares haſt thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt, and doſt thou now feare death?</hi> And if the end of our way at death, hath ſo much good in it, how much good will there be in the end of our way, that we ſhall enjoy, when we come to heaven?</p>
               <p>As the conſideration of the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven, was made uſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as an encouragement to thoſe who doe fully follow the Lord; ſo now wee make uſe of it, as a ſtrong motive to draw up our hearts to the full following after him. It was S. <hi>Pauls</hi> motive to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Epiſtle</hi> 15. 58. perſwading them to <hi>hee ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the work of the Lord; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they knew that their labour was not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> We doe not follow after ſhadowes, and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in following the Lord, but wee ſeek for glory, honour, immortality;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7448:208"/>
wee follow after an incorruptible crowne, a glorious kingdome, an eternall inheritance, the glory of heaven; the treaſures of the riches of God himſelfe are ſet before us, to draw up our hearts fully to him. It was the argument that S. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed to worke upon his owne ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>Phil. 3. 14. I preſſe toward the marke for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How full is the worke of many mens ſpirits, in their working after ſome poore, little, ſcant good in this world? whereas if they had all the world, they had but an empty husk, in compariſon of that glory that is ſet before us: They pant after the very duſt; what cauſe is there then, that our hearts ſhould pant in the ſtrong workings of them, after thoſe high and glorious things, that are reſerved in heaven for us? It was the goodnes of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was a ſtrong motive to draw <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuahs</hi> heart fully after the Lord, through many difficulties. <hi>Canaan</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:7448:209"/>
was but a darke Type of the glory of Heaven, which God hath promiſed to reward the full followers of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withall. It was once a ſpeech of <hi>Anſelme,</hi> If a man ſhould ſerve God zealouſly here a thouſand yeares, yet ſhould hee not thereby deſervedly merit to bee one halfe day in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let us bee as forward, let our hearts bee as ſtrong and zealous in Gods wayes as poſſibly they can be; yet I may ſay as <hi>Abigail</hi> did to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in that particular caſe, <hi>it ſhall not repent my Lord when he comes into his Kingdome;</hi> ſo it ſhal never repent you of any thing that ever you have done for the Lord, when you come into your Kingdome. But if it were poſſible there could be ſorrow in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you would be ſorry that you did no more. It was a ſpeech of one <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> a Martyr, that the threats of his enemies were but as ſeedes, from which he ſhould reape immortality, and eternal joyes; ſo all the hardſhip and troubles that we meet with all in our way here, in following the Lord,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7448:209"/>
are but increaſers of that glory that is to be revealed: why then ſhould any thing hinder us, or ſtop us in our way? And thus I paſſe to the ſecond thing propounded in this Uſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſhew what are the Cauſes that hinder men from following the Lord fully; and they are five eſpecially; which I ſhall but name.</p>
               <p>Firſt, low apprehenſions that men <note place="margin">1</note> have of God; they ſee not God in his glory, in his greatneſſe; ſurely, they know not God, and therefore it is that their hearts work ſo poorly after him: <hi>Ier. 9. 3. They are not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for the truth upon the earth:</hi> and what is the reaſon? <hi>For they know not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Did they know me, certainly they would be valiant for my trruth: <hi>They that know thy Name,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. they will put their truſt in thee;</hi> ſo they that know Gods Name, will love him, will feare him, will be zealous for, will fully follow after him. The knowledge of all truthes, concerning Heaven, and hell,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:7448:210"/>
ven, and hell, or any other thing that can bee knowne, can never raiſe, can never inlarge the hearts of men ſo after the Lord, as the knowledge of God himſelfe; and therefore where God is little knowne, no marvell though he be ſo little followed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, unſound beginnings in <note place="margin">2</note> the profeſſion of Religion, are the cauſe why men doe not fully follow after the Lord; their hearts are not throughly broken, not deepely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the truths of God not deeply rooted at firſt, their ſoules not well principled, the foundation not well laid: If men be not well principled at firſt, in their entrance into the wayes of God, they are like to prove but ſhufflers and bunglers in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their dayes. If cloth bee not wrought well at the firſt, though it ſhews faire in the Loome, yet it will ſhrinke when it comes to wetting: the cauſe why many doe ſo ſhrinke in the wetting, when they come to ſuffer any thing in the wayes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it is, becauſe their hearts
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7448:210"/>
were not well wrought at firſt.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe is the ſtrength of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; their hearts are ſo wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <note place="margin">3</note> in them, ſo glued to them, as it is exceeding painfull to get them looſened from them, they are ſo near and deare to a corrupt heart: As it is ſaid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> hee looked on the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and it was ſo red; ſo they looke upon their ingagements, and they are ſo full of content; it is ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be taken off from them, that they rather ſuffer their hearts to bee taken off from God himſelfe: when engagements have taken poſſeſſion of the heart, then how hard is it to work any thing upon the judgements of men? it is hard to get the minde to view the truths of God, to get it to ſearch into them, to conſider of them; it is ready to cloſe with the leaſt objection againſt them, to catch hold of the leaſt advantage to caſt them off; and if truths bee ſo cleare as a man cannot but ſee them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for the preſent is over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, yet if the heart bee
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7448:211"/>
not taken off from ingagements, it will fetch about againe, to ſee if ſomething may not bee gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe truths, to breake the ſtrength of them; but where the heart is taken off from ingagements, how eaſily do the truths prevaile? how ſoone is the heart brought fully to cloſe with them? 2 <hi>Sam. 22. 33. God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, maketh my way perfect:</hi> the word is, He frees my way, <hi>Solvit,</hi> ſo it is tranſlated by ſome, Hee frees it from ſnares; and this is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Hence, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 18. 32. Where this thankſgiving of <hi>David</hi> is againe repeated, there the word is tranſlated <hi>Dedit,</hi> Hee hath given my way to be perfect; this is a good gift indeed, for God to make a mans wayes free and cleare before him, to take off the temptations that did ingage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare his ſpirit; and then, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 34. of that place in <hi>Samuel, He maketh my feet as Hindes feet:</hi> O how ſwiftly and powerfully then may the ſoule runne in Gods wayes, when it is thus freed! <hi>Pſalm. 119. 44, 45. I ſhall keep
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7448:211"/>
thy Law continually, for ever and ever, and I will walke at liberty.</hi> When the heart is at liberty, then it goes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, for ever and ever, in following after the Lord: but if there be any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ingagement in it, it will be weary, and one time or other will leave off: a man that is fettered, can neither go apace, nor continue long.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing that hinders men <note place="margin">4</note> in following God fully, it is, going out in the ſtrength of their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, not in any ſtrength that they receive out of the fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; they truſt more to their owne promiſes, than to Gods. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther</hi> reports of <hi>Staupicius</hi> a Germane Divine, that hee acknowledged of himſelfe, that before he came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand aright the free and powerful grace of Jeſus Chriſt, that he vowed &amp; reſolved an hundred times againſt ſome particular ſin, and never could get power over it; at laſt he ſaw the reaſon to be, the truſting to his own reſolutions.</p>
               <p>A fift cauſe, is the meeting with <note place="margin">5</note>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:7448:212"/>
more difficulties in Gods ways than wee made account of: when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thinke onely of the good and ſweet that they ſhall meet with in Gods wayes; but they doe not caſt in their thoughts, what the troubles are like to bee, that they ſhall finde in them; like <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who dreamed of his preferment and honour that hee ſhould have above his brethren, but dreamt not of his ſelling into Egypt, nor of his impriſonment there: Chriſtians ſhould at the firſt entrance into Gods wayes, expect the utmoſt difficulties; they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon thoſe termes, to incounter with great troubles, if they meane to ſollow God fully in them. It is a ſhame for any Chriſtian to account any trouble that he meets withall in Gods wayes, to be as a ſtrange thing unto him. Becauſe the Lord had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a choſen veſſell unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and purpoſed to draw his heart fully after him; obſerve how God deales with him in his firſt entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his way, <hi>Acts 19. 16. I will ſhew him
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7448:212"/>
how great things hee muſt ſuffer for my Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what then would take off the heart, and carry it fully after the Lord?</p>
               <p>Theſe three things will doe it.</p>

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God leads his people weeping, and with ſupplications, then hee brings them into a ſtraight way, wherein they ſhall not ſtumble, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 9. and againe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 4, 5. the Lord ſaith, that his people ſhall goe weeping, and ſeeke the Lord their God, they ſhal aske the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with their faces thither-ward, ſaying, Come let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant, that ſhall not be forgotten. When they are led weeping in the thorow ſenſe of their ſinne, then their faces are ſet toward <hi>Zion,</hi> and then they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to joyne themſelves to God, in a perpetuall Covenant.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that will take off the heart fully, is the cleare ſight of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7448:213"/>
God in theſe two conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In relation to our ſelves, to ſee how there is all good in him for <note place="margin">1</note> us to enjoy fully, though wee have nothing but him alone; what ever wee would have in any creature, in any way ſo farre as is good for us, it is to bee had in him; when the ſoule is thorowly convinced of this, it comes off ſweetly, and flowes fully after the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider God in relation to all other good; thus, that nothing <note place="margin">2</note> elſe hath any true goodneſſe in it, but in reference and ſubordination to him.</p>
               <p>The third thing that will take off <note place="margin">3</note> the heart fully, is the feare of God, and the feare of eternity powerfully falling upon the ſoule, and deeply ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king impreſſion in it: For the feare of God, take that place, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 1. Perfect your holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> The feare of God is a great means to bring your holineſſe to perfection; and for the ſecond, that place in <hi>Phil. 2. 12. Worke out your ſalvation

                  <p>That it is the choiceneſſe of a mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that cauſes him to follow GOD fully.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom the reference that this <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> following of <hi>God</hi> fully hath to the excellency of <hi>Calebs</hi> ſpirit; The Doctrine that ariſeth is this, That it is the choiceneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a mans ſpirit, that cauſeth him to follow <hi>God</hi> fully.

It is not ſtrength of parts that will carry a man thorow, nor ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor ſtrength of conviction, nor ſtrength of naturall conſcience, nor ſtrength of reſolution, nor ſtrength of common grace; it is onely this choice excellent ſpirit; that <hi>other ſpirit,</hi> of which wee have ſpoke ſo much before.</p>
               <p>In this point I ſhall follow theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:7448:214"/>
                  <item>1 Wee ſhall ſhew what there is in this ſpirit that doth carry on a man fully.</item>
                  <item>2 Why onely this can doe it.</item>
                  <item>3 Apply it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, it is the choiceneſſe of a mans ſpirit that cauſeth a man to goe fully after <hi>God:</hi> for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By this a man comes to have a more full preſence of <hi>God</hi> with him, <note place="margin">1</note> than any other man can have; ſuch a man is nearer unto <hi>God</hi> than others, hee hath more of the nature of <hi>God,</hi> than others; is more capable of the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> than others; and <hi>God</hi> delights to let out himſelfe more to him than to others: Theſe are filled with all the fulneſſe of <hi>God,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that expreſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 19. Now this fulneſſe of <hi>God</hi> in their ſpirits muſt needs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on, becauſe it ſo ſatisfies them, as they feele no need of other things. Empty ſpirits are alwayes ſucking and drawing of comfort from the creatures that are about them, &amp; hence it is that their hearts
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7448:215"/>
are taken off from <hi>God</hi> ſo much. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a ſpirit that is filled with <hi>God,</hi> is not ſo ſenſible of any evils that are without, ſo as empty ſpirits are; as it is in the body when it is filled with good nouriſhment, with good blood and ſpirits, it is not ſenſible of cold, and alteration of weather, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is that is empty, and filled onely with winde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the choiceneſſe of a mans ſpirit raiſeth it to converſe with high <note place="margin">2</note> things, and ſo carries it above the rubs, the ſnares and hindrances that are below; and being above theſe, it goes on freely and fully in its courſe, and is not in that danger of miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as other poore ſpirits are, who converſe ſo much with the things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth: as Birds that flie high, are not catched by the Fowler, they are not taken by his Lime-twigs, by his Net or Pit fall ſo as others are, who are much below upon the ground. <hi>Broverb. 15. 24. The way of Life is above to the wiſe, that hee may depart from hell beneath;</hi> It is the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7448:215"/>
keeping in his way above, that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him from the dangers &amp; ſnares that are laid for him below. Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Lightnings, tempeſts and ſtormes, make no alteration in the higheſt Region; ſo the threats and oppoſitions againſt the wayes of godlineſſe, and all the troubles that the world cauſeth, make no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in heavenly hearts, that keepe above. When the tree growes low, it is ſubject to bee bitten by the Beaſts, but when it is growne up on high, it is out of danger: The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the heart is, the nearer the earth, the more danger; but when it is got up on high, the danger is paſt; and now, what ſhould hinder it from the growing up to the full meaſure of it in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the choiceneſſe of a mans <note place="margin">3</note> ſpirit changeth his end, and ſo carries him on fully after the Lord; for when the end is changed, all is changed; when there are but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular changes it is a certaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the higheſt end is not
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7448:216"/>
changed; but when that is changed, there muſt of neceſſity bee an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall change upon theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe the laſt end is alwayes loved for it ſelfe, and therefore infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely loved.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is the rule of all other things that are under it; the good of all things under it is meaſured by it, and is ſubordinate to it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this choiceneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cauſeth a ſuteableneſſe, a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <note place="margin">4</note> between the frame of the heart, and the wayes of holineſſe: Now ſympathies firſt, are alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the generall natures of things, and not individuals, not particulars; as thus, where there is a ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one creature and another, it is alwayes betweene the whole kind of thoſe creatures; whereſoever ſuch Natures are found, there will be this agreement. Wee may ſee it more clearely in that which is contrary; that contrariety of nature which wee call <hi>Antipathy,</hi> it is not betweene any particulars ſo much, as betweene the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7448:216"/>
whole natures of things; as between the Wolf &amp; the Sheep, there is ſuch a contrariety: Now the nature of the Wolfe is not contrary ſo much to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular ſheep, but to the whole nature of ſheepe, whereſoever the nature of it is found, and therefore to all ſheep; Thus it is in the ſoule, where there is ſuch a kinde of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it againſt ſinne, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any particular ſinne ſo much, as againſt the whole nature of ſinne, whereſoever it is; ſo where there is ſuch an agreement, which wee call a ſympathie, it is not ſo much with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular way of holineſſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Act, but with the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of holineſſe, whereſoever it is found, and therefore ſuch a ſoule muſt needs follow <hi>God</hi> fully. Againe, ſympathies doe alwayes worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour and paine, and therefore where there is ſuch an agreement betweene the frame of the heart, and the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> the heart muſt needs worke fully, becauſe it workes delightfully: and yet further, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeablenes
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7448:217"/>
of ſympathie is deepely rooted in the very principles of the creature, it is founded in the very being of it, and therefore it muſt needs worke ſtrongly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Vaine reaſonings, carnall obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſubtill arguments, ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions can never prevaile againſt that ſoule, where there is this deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted agreeableneſſe betweene the frame of it, &amp; the wayes of holineſſe. But that you may ſee further what a wonderfull agreeableneſſe Grace makes betweene the ſpirits of the godly, and the Law of <hi>God,</hi> which is the rule of thoſe wayes wherein <hi>God</hi> would have the ſoule to follow him in: obſerve the ſeverall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by which the Scripture ſets it out.</p>

                  <item>Fourthly, they love it above gold, above fine gold.</item>

Fifthly, their hearts breake for the longing it hath after it.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, they lift up their hands to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 48.</item>
                  <item>Seventhly, their mouthes talke of it, <hi>Pſal. 119. 13. ver. &amp; 46. ver.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Eighthly, their feet run in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32.</item>

                  <item>Tenthly, they will never forget it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 16.</item>
                  <item>Eleventhly, they give up their members as inſtruments of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And laſtly, to name no more, (though there be many more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Scripture to ſet this out) they apply their hearts to it, to fulfill it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies even to the end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 103.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This choiceneſſe of ſpirit <note place="margin">5</note> cauſeth a man to looke to his duty, and not to regard what may follow. The thing that hinders moſt in their following the Lord, it is want of this; it is not want of conviction what ſhould be done, but the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7448:218"/>
of their heart, about the hard and troubleſome conſequences that will follow, if the things bee done: But a true gracious heart ſaith onely, Let mee know what is my duty, let the right bee done, though heaven and earth meet together.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The choiceneſſe of a mans <note place="margin">Fiat juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tia, etſi mundus ruat. 6</note> ſpirit cauſeth a man, that if he doth looke at any conſequences, that may follow upon his way, he lookes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the laſt iſſue of all, what his way will prove in his laſt concluſion; how things will goe with him when he comes to the laſt triall, what will be the <hi>ultimate</hi> end of all: Will it then be peace? ſhall I then be glad of theſe wayes I now walke in?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The choiceneſſe of a <note place="margin">7</note> mans ſpirit ſtrengthens it againſt the impreſſions that ſenſitive objects uſe to leave upon ſoft and weake ſpirits. Moſt men have their ſpirits formed, and faſhioned according to ſenſitive objects; it is not what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in abſtract notions, that works upon them, let them bee what they
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7448:218"/>
will; yet, when they have to deale with ſenſitive things, the ſweetneſſe, deſireableneſſe, glory of them, works the moſt powerfully; their hearts are altered according to the impreſſion that they leave upon them, and this is great weakneſſe, and an effeminate ſoftneſſe of ſpirit: Hence the word tranſlated <hi>Effeminate, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> ſoft-ſpirited men. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per in the ſpirit, is like that in the fleſh, when it is corrupted with the dropſie; the fleſh is ſoft, and if you put your finger to it, the impreſſion of your finger ſticks in it, and pits the fleſh; ſo the impreſſion of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive objects, ſticks in diſtempered, weake, ſoft ſpirits, as it was in the other Spies who were ſent with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhuah;</hi> the terrible things they ſaw in the land, ſtucke mightily in their hearts, they brought with them the impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them faſtened in their ſpirits: hence <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 33. according to the tranſlation of the Greek Tranſlators, it is, <hi>They brought the feare of the land with them:</hi> But <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:7448:219"/>
this choiceneſſe of ſpirit that was in <hi>Caleb,</hi> and is in thoſe who are truely godly, keepeth from this: and there muſt bee this firmneſſe in the ſpirit of a man, or elſe it will never cary him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord fully, 2 <hi>Sam. 22. 26. With the upright thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;</hi> the word tranſlated <hi>upright,</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſtrong and perfect:</hi> There is required ſtrength, and that more than ordinary too, to cary on the ſoule to perfection.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what there is in this choice ſpirit, that caries it on fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord: Now there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be this, or elſe this full follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord will never be, nothing elſe will doe it. And that;</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe the wayes of God are ſupernaturall, and therefore there muſt bee ſomething in the ſpirit of a man which is ſupernaturall, that muſt reach to them; this which is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall in the ſpirits of godly men, wee ſee it in the effects, and we know it is above reaſon, and all naturall principles whatſoever. But what
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7448:219"/>
is, is very hard to expreſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men of parts in the World, are madde to think, that any ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that thoſe who are of weaker parts than themſelves, ſhould have any thing in them, to carry them on in other wayes, than they walke in; which they doe not underſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not know, what that ſame thing is, which is called ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; they will rather think it a conceit and phanſie, than any reall excellency: becauſe they can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend other things better than others, they thinke, why ſhould they not apprehend this better than others, if there were any reall excellencie in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The wayes of God are not only above nature, but contrary to nature, and therefore there muſt bee needs, ſome ſpeciall choyceneſſe of ſpirit, to carry a man on in them; there muſt bee a contrary ſtreame, to over-power the ſtreame of nature, and this ſtreame muſt be fed by ſome living fountaine, or elſe there will
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7448:220"/>
never bee a holding out. In follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Lord, all naturall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and common grace will doe no more but ſtop the ſtreame of corrupt nature; they cannot ſo overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it, as to carry the ſoule another way; but the worke of grace in this choiceneſſe of ſpirit will doe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſtreame of times, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men, are exceeding ſtrong, and it is not a little matter that will carry on the ſoule againſt them. The dead fiſh is carried down the ſtreame, though the winde ſerves to blow it up: all naturall abilities of the ſoule, will no more helpe a man againſt the ſtreame of examples, than the winde can carry the dead fiſh up the ſtream; but if there were life put into the fiſh, it were able then to move againſt the winde and ſtreame too.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There are ſo many ſtrong allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring temptations, where in the wiles, ſubtilties, depths of Satan, are very powerfull to draw the heart away from God, that except there bee ſome ſpeciall worke of Gods grace
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:7448:220"/>
to give wiſdome to diſcerne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of ſin, to make the ſoule ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubtill, to find out the cunning devices of Satan, and to diſcerne the danger of them, the ſoule moſt certainly could never hold on in the way of its following after the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5 There are ſo many troubles, oppoſitions, that it meets withall in this way, that moſt certainly would drive it out, were it not for ſome choyce Worke of Gods grace in it; but this choyceneſſe of ſpirit, will carry a man through all them: It is Gods promiſe, <hi>Eſay 59. 19. That when the enemy ſhall come in like a floud, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him.</hi> We made uſe of this Scripture before, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſtrong corruptions; but it is true here now, for the reſiſting of ſtrong ſpirituall enemies, of ſtrong oppoſitions; when they come in like a floud againſt the ſoule, to carry it out of Gods wayes, the Spirit of God in it doth lift up a ſtandard againſt
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7448:221"/>
them, &amp; were it not for this, it could not hold: It is this good and ſound conſtitution of the ſoule that makes it endure thoſe oppoſitions that it meets withall. An aguiſh heat may bee greater, than that which ariſeth from a good conſtitution, but it is not able to reſiſt cold: ſo there may be a naturall violence in a mans ſpirit for a while, in the profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which may ſeeme to be zeale, but not ariſing from the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſoule, when troubles come, it vaniſhes, giving no ſtrength at all.</p>
               <p n="6">6 There are ſo many ſcandals and reproaches that riſe againſt the ways of God, ſo many aſperſions that are caſt upon them, that if a man hath not more than an ordinary ſpirit, hee moſt certainly will be offended: <hi>Bleſſed are they that are not offended in mee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. It is a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing when there fals out ſcandals, and when we ſee grievous aſperſions caſt upon Gods wayes, yet not to be offended; there needs be ſome more
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7448:221"/>
than ordinary light to diſcover to a man, the certainty of that good there is in the ways of God; he had need be ſure of his principles, and know in whom he hath beleeved.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Yea, God many times hides himſelfe from his ſervants, while they are following after him, and this oftentimes proves the ſoreſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, and a greater diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then all the reſt: for as for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſcandals, reproaches, theſe are things they make account of, and can often lightly paſſe them over; but when God hides his face, this puts them at a ſtand, now they are in the dark, and know not what to doe; Chriſt was not much troubled at the reproaches of men, at the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee met withall from them; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He deſpiſed the ſhame, and endured the Croſſe;</hi> but when his Father hid his face from him, then he was in an agony, then his ſpirit began to bee amazed, then his ſoule was ſorowfull to the death, then hee fals groveling upon the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:7448:222"/>
ground, then he ſweats drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bloud, then hee cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee?</hi> Theſe ſpirituall deſertions in their degree, Gods ſervants often meet withall in their way, ſo as, if they had not choice ſpirits, ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of God in their ſoules, they would certainly fall and ſinke in it. Now put all theſe together, and we ſee, it is not every ordinary ſpirit, that is like to goe on fully after the Lord; it muſt needs bee ſome thing extraordinary, that preſerves a ſpark in the midſt of waves, that preſerves a candle light, in the midſt of ſtorms and tempeſts.</p>
               <p>Never wonder then, or bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſee ſo many to fall off from <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> God; few men have choice ſpirits; thoſe who are godly expect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from moſt profeſſors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not troubled when they ſee this fall out; <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Wicked men are offended, becauſe they know not what the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7448:222"/>
worke of grace meanes; and hence, if they ſee a man make profeſſion of Religion, they make no difference, as though there were as much to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, as from another; as though the cauſe of God fell when he fell; no ſuch matter; If you ſee mens ſpirits proud, ſlight, earthly, ſenſuall, or carried with a greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than their principles will beare; I doe not meane, though their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may ſometimes goe beyond their knowledge; but by principles I meane, the rooted graces of God in their hearts, as one may perceive in ſome, there are not graces rooted ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their expreſſions, &amp; outward wayes; and when you ſee not an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the wayes of men, then never expect from them any full follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord: and if they fall off, be not troubled, let it be no more than you made account of before-hand would be.</p>
               <p>Hence the world is miſtaken, who <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> judge it ſtoutneſſe, and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit in Gods ſervants, that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7448:223"/>
will go on in the wayes of godlines; they are a kind of inflexible people, there is no perſwading of them, there is no dealing with them: No, it is no ſtubbornneſſe; it is the choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſpirits, that makes them to doe as they doe; you judge it ſtubbornneſſe becauſe you doe not know the principles upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they goe. I confeſſe, if I ſee a man ſtand conſtantly in his way, and will not bee moved by the perſwaſions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if I doe not underſtand the reaſons upon which hee goes, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke it ſtoutneſſe, and this is your caſe; but if you did but know, what are their reaſons, what are their powerfull motives, that draw them on in the wayes of God, you would not have ſuch thoughts of them; <hi>Their ſpirits within them conſtraine them,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſayes of himſelfe in another caſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 32. 18.</p>
               <p>Take theſe convincements that it is not ſtubbornneſſe, but choiceneſſe of ſpirit, that carries them on ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in their way.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:7448:223"/>
1. In other things they are as yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as tractable, as eaſie to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded as any men; it is only in the matter of the Lord their God they are thus. They can beare burthens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſhoulders, and cry out, and reſiſt as little as any; if you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to goe a mile, they will be content, if it may do good, to goe two, yea, as far as the ſhooes of the preparation of the Goſpell of peace will carry them; who can beare wrongs and injuries from men better than they? ſtubborne-ſpirited men cannot doe thus.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Stubbornneſſe is joyned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge; but in theſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is all pity and compaſſion; they pray for thoſe who doe oppoſe them; when they are reviled, they revile not againe; If ſometimes their corruptions ſhould bee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are aſhamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in their own thoughts, for that they have done, they mourne and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the bitterneſſe of their ſpirits for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:7448:224"/>
Thirdly, ſtubborne diſpoſitions are not contracted on a ſudden; it is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and continuance of time that <note place="margin">3</note> alters nature; but this diſpoſition of being unmoveable in Gods wayes comes many times even of a ſudden, as ſoone as ever the heart is turned, which is an evidence of a new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put into it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſtubborne hearts doe <note place="margin">4</note> not uſe to ſeek God to uphold them, to ſtrengthen them, to bleſſe them in that way; they doe not bleſſe God for being with them, helping of them to perſiſt in their way, as Gods ſervants doe; they go to God to get ſtrength to inable them to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; they give God the glory of it, when they have found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inabled to withſtand temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, thoſe who are of ſtubborn diſpoſitions, doe not uſe to bee moſt <note place="margin">5</note> ſtubborne, when the heart is moſt broken with afflictions; ſtout hearts, though in their proſperity are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeeldable, there is no dealing with
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7448:224"/>
them then; their hearts are preſently up; if you move them to any thing they have no mind to, their words are ſtout, their anſwers are ſierce; but let afflictions come, then, as <hi>Eſ.</hi> 29. 4. Their hearts are brought down, and they ſpeake as one out of the ground, and their ſpeech is low, as one out of the duſt; then they are willing to heare what you ſay; As the young Gallant that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 5. there was no ſpeaking to him in his proſperity; but when his fleſh and body were conſumed, then he mournes at the laſt, and cries out, How have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproofe! I have not obeyed the voyce of my Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp;c. But now, thoſe that are godly, in their greateſt afflictions, when their hearts are moſt broken, when God humbles them moſt, even then they are moſt ſettled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in that way they walked in before, and it is then the greateſt griefe of their ſoules, that they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked no cloſer with God in it, than
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:7448:225"/>
they did. Have other thoughts then of Gods people, than you have had; do not accuſe that of ſtubbornneſſe, that you doe not underſtand; thinke with your ſelves, that there may be ſomething in their ſpirits, more than you know of.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe who have this excellent choice ſpirit, encourage themſelvs in <note place="margin">vſe 3.</note> this, that ſurely it will inable them to follow God fully; let them know,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that though they be weak, if <note place="margin">1</note> their ſpirits bee right, if of the right kind, they ſhall certainly hold out. That which Chriſt ſaid for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Revel.</hi> 3. 8, they may apply for theirs; <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and haſt kept my Word, and haſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed my Name.</hi> A little ſtrength, if it bee right, if it bee the ſtrength of a ſound ſpirit, it will carry on the ſoule to keepe Gods Word, and inable, not to deny his Name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, therefore is Chriſt filled with all fulneſſe of all grace, that out <note place="margin">2</note> of his ſulneſſe thou mayſt receive
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:7448:225"/>
grace for grace; that Spirit by which he is ſo plentifully annoynted, it is for thee.</p>
               <p>But I am afraid my ſpirit is not this choice ſpirit, and therfore I ſhall not <note place="margin">Object.</note> hold out in following the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, is it a broken humble ſpirit in ſenſe of thy weakeneſſes and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> wants? <note place="margin">1</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that which thou doſt, though but weakly, is it upon divine <note place="margin">2</note> grounds, and haſt thou divine ends?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, doth the ſight of thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe make thee cling, and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">3</note> Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when thou loſeſt God in following him, art thou ſenſible of <note place="margin">4</note> the want of his preſence, and doeſt thou never leave crying and ſeeking till thou enjoyeſt him again? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a true choyce ſpirit, that will carry on fully in following the Lord, when thouſands of glorious Hypocrites ſhall vaniſh and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>If it be this choiceneſſe of ſpirit, <note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> that is the only thing that will fully
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:7448:226"/>
carry after the Lord, then let us learn to looke to our ſpirits: Keepe thy heart with all diligence, for out of it come the iſſues of life: Doe not ſo much complain of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, troubles you meet withal; but look to your ſpirits, &amp; all is ſafe and wel. If there be the ſpirit of love &amp; of a ſound mind, there will be the ſpirit of power; for theſe are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> there need not be <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> the ſpirit of feare; for the ſpirit of a ſound mind, &amp; the ſpirit of feare, are oppoſed one to another in the ſame place. But wherein ſhould we looke <note place="margin">Object. Anſ.</note> to our ſpirits? Firſt, take heed to your judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, keep your judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts clear for <hi>God</hi> &amp; his truth; as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 33 <note place="margin">1</note> that wiſdom and knowledge ſhould <note place="margin">Eſay 33. 6.</note> be the ſtability of thoſe times; ſo, true wiſdome and knowledge preſerving the judgments of men right &amp; ſound, are the ſtability of mens hearts. Take heed your judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts come not to be altered, to thinke otherwiſe of Gods wayes, than you did before, to have other opinions of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Though there
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:7448:226"/>
may bee many weakneſſes, yet if the judgement be kept right, all may doe well; but if the Leproſie bee got into the head, then the ſoule is in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition: as <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 44. when the Prieſt ſhall looke upon a Leprous man, and ſee the plague is got into his head, the <hi>Text</hi> ſaith, he ſhal pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him utterly unclean, for the Plague is in his head. The Prieſt was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce none to be utterly unclean, but ſuch who had the <hi>plague</hi> in their <hi>heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, labor to keep conſcience <note place="margin">2</note> clear, take heed of pollution there, take heed of a breach in thy ſpirit there, for that will weaken it much: conſcience is the ſtrong Tower of thy ſoule, if the Truth of God be got out there, the ſtrength of the ſoule is gone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, labour to keepe thy heart low and humble; when the fleſh ſwels, <note place="margin">3</note> it cannot beare any hard thing upon it: though a member growes bigger when it ſwels, yet it growes weaker; ſo it is with the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, labour to keepe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">4</note> heavenly; mixture of droſſe will
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:7448:227"/>
weaken it, convince thy ſoule, that a little of the Creature will ſerve turne, to carry thee thorow this thy Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage well enough. One told a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; If you will be content to pleaſe <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> you need not feed upon green hearbs: The Philoſopher anſwers him, And if you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to feed upon greene hearbs, you need not pleaſe <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> So if men would be content with a little in the World, to be in a low and meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they need not flatter; thoſe things that draw others from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Lord, would not move them at all.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, labour to keep thy ſpirit in a <note place="margin">5</note> continuall trembling frame, abiding in the feare of the Lord all the day long; the feare of the Lord cauſeth men to depart from evill; meditate the feare of the Lord continually.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, keep thy ſpirit continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working; many things have much power in them while they are in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but weake when the motion ceaſeth; ſinne is very ſtrong while it
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:7448:227"/>
is in motion, but when affliction ſtops the motion, the truths of God have more power over it; ſo grace, while it is acting, it is ſtrong, but if it growes dull, it growes weake, and is ſoone turned aſide. Thus we look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſpirits, wee ſhall bee able to follow the Lord fully, and finiſh our courſe in peace.</p>
