            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

much felicity, to ſhew the greatneſs of
their power, deſtroyed their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and what no Enemy durſt attempt,
by an inteſtine war invaded the liberties of their native
Country.</p>
            <p>But this madneſs was not yet generall, when the ſeaſon of
the year, with the favorable influence of the heavens, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſo great a ſerenity in the air, that the Sea having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
divers days in an undiſturbed calm, the inhabitants
of the coaſts of <hi>Leontium</hi> reſorted in troops to the ſhore, there
to enjoy the freſhneſs that in the evening came off from the
Main; and whilſt ſome recreated themſelvs with their country
ſports upon the ſands, others more active ſhewed their addreſs
in rowing, and thoſe whoſe profeſſion it was caſt out nets for

fiſh the chief Lord of the place, and of many adjacent villages,
a perſon of eminent rank and condition, who being retired
from the great affairs of the world, choſe rather to live beloved
in his own Province, then through vain ambition to tempt the
hazards of fortune, in a State by civil diſſentions expoſed to
ruine; and though not inſenſible of his Countries ſufferings,
yet not ſo far dejected with the ſenſe thereof, as to debar him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of ſuch delights as were neceſſary for the preſervation of
his health; with two Gentlemen, his attendants, came down
to the Sea-ſide; and after ſome ordinary civilities paſſed
amongſt the chiefeſt of the Country-people that were his
neighbours, entred into a Fallocque that waited for him, which
was covered with Crimſon-dammask, and ſlightly gilt and
painted with the Arms and Devices of his Family, rather to
ſhew a diſtinction from the vulgar, then any way to boaſt either
his birth or quality.</p>
            <p>The Steerſ-man, as ſoon as his Maſter was ſeated in the
Boat, directed his courſe towards a great point of Land that
lay out into the Sea, where with more privacie he might enjoy
the benefit of the air: And whilſt they advanced gently into
the Main, he entertained his company with ſeveral diſcourſes,
to which they were exceeding attentive, all that had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be neer him, finding that they profited more by his
ordinary familiar talk, then they could ever attain to in the
Schools of the Philoſophers; for they ſtudy only to diſpute,
but he ſtudied the truth; and with thoſe reaſons on which he
had founded his own judgment, would communicate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
to others: Yet at that time he was not upon any deep
ſubject, but only relating divers paſſages and occurrences of
State, in which himſelf had been a principal actor; and from
the unexpected alterations that had happened, arguing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of mans condition. When having gained the Point
whither he was going, he diſcovered a tall Ship, with her fails
flaging about her maſts, that lay becalmed about two leagues
from the ſhore, which at the ſame inſtant firſt hung out a white
Flag, and then ſtruck her main Top-ſail, intelligible ſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Mariners of a friendly approach; and if ſhe were not
in ſome diſtreſs, that either ſhe deſired Boats to land paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
or elſe a Pilot to conduct her upon thoſe Coaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Syneſius,</hi> ſo was this noble perſon called, whatſoever the
meaning were, being ever ready to perform the office of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
preſently commanded his men to row back agen with
all the ſpeed that was poſſible; and having taken care himſelf
to ſee a Fallocque well manned, gave them order to go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
aboard the Veſſel, to be informed what ſhe was, and
if they found her a friend, as he imagined, to do them all hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſervices that their occaſions did require. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the diligence that was uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that time they were
ready to launch, the Sun had finiſhed his courſe for that day;
yet the dawn of the evening, with the brightneſs of the Moon
in a cleer sky, encouraged the Sea-men to a prompt obedience,
though otherwiſe obſervant enough of their Lords commands,
who was not more reverenced amongſt them for his authority,
then beloved and honour'd for his hoſpitality.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had doubled the Point, they preſently ſaw
the Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſtill lay hulking in the ſame manner, and at
that time again with beat of drum and ſound of trumpet made
all the noiſe that was poſſible; which cauſed the Mariners the
more vigorouſly to purſue their courſe: But before they had
advanced far, they perceived, a good diſtance from them, two
things floating upon the water, which at firſt they ſuppoſed to
be either by chance, or on purpoſe, caſt out of the veſſel; but
by the diſturbance of the Sea in ſo great a Calm, they ſoon
found their miſtake, yet could not imagine what they ſhould
be; for their motions yielded ſometimes ſuch a reſplendent
brightneſs, and ſuch a ſparkling light, as if againſt nature the
Ocean had caſt up flakes of fire, or elſe Stars ſhot from the
firmament had remained floating upon the ſurface thereof.
Some conjectured one thing, ſome another; and the wiſeſt
amongſt them would needs have the reſt imagine that it was
nothing elſe but the reflection of the Moon upon the breaking
of the water, cauſed by Porpices or ſome other great fiſhes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61061:7"/>
and began to wiſh their buſineſs diſpatched, apprehending,
as it is commonly believed among Sea-men, that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe creatures preſaged a ſtorm, or at leaſt a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the weather.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were thus reaſoning amongſt themſelves, they
approached ſo neer the object of their wonder, that the diſpute
ceaſed, though not their admiration: For they plainly diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two young men of an excellent beauty ſwiming towards
them; one whereof carried in his hand a naked Sword of a
rarely poliſhed mettle, and the other had about his neck a
Tablet mervailouſly enriched with diamonds. The former
ſeeing an unexpected aſſiſtance ſo neer, launched himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with a wonderfull force, and catching hold of one of
the Oars, with the help thereof leaped aboard; then waving
his ſword above his head, immediately with both his hands
laid the hilt thereof, which was curiouſly enchaſed with rubies,
to his heart, and caſting up his eyes to heaven ſmiled a little,
as if by that he had overcome the preſent, and meant to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
all future danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at the ſame inſtant the other, his
ſtrength failing him, began to ſink, and he had undoubtedly
periſhed, if the mariners, notwithſtanding their ſurpriſal by ſo
ſtrange an accident, had not been very ſpeedy in giving him
aſſiſtance, and as he riſe agen above the water, taken hold of
his Taſſata breeches, which were all the garment he had on,
and by them lifted him into their Fallocque.</p>
            <p>At the firſt, though he were not altogether without life, yet
he was in a manner paſt ſenſe; but by bending his body for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and other uſual remedies that Sea-men in ſuch caſes
practice, having voided a great quantity of water, which
overcharged his ſtomack, he ſoon came to himſelf again, and
immediately feeling for the Tablet that was about his neck,
with great reverence kiſſed it, holding up his hands to heaven,
as in token of thankfulneſs, that ſince his life was preſerved,
that Jewel was ſo likewiſe, which he ſeemed to value not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the other: Then kiſſing it agen, and fixing his eyes
upon the Characters artificially formed with Diamonds of an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61061:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ineſtimable value, after a deep ſigh cryed out, Ah <hi>Mariana!</hi>
and having pronounced that name ſo ſacred to his memory;
preſently ſtoped, as if in that one word he had ſaid all that
could be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>But at length calling to mind his condition, he looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
about him to conſider into what hands he was fallen;
when perceiving his companion that had run the like hazard
with himſelf, and in the ſame manner as he thought preſerved,
they preſently embraced, with infinite teſtimonies of joy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating
each others ſafety; and had continued longer in
thoſe expreſſions, if the mariners deſiring to finiſh their work,
had not interrupted them with ſigns that they made, for they
perceived they were ſtrangers, and ſpake another language,
to know whether they ſhould return back, or elſe go on to the
ſhip, of which they ſuppoſed they were: but underſtanding
they deſired rather they ſhould return, having accommodated
them the beſt they could with garments, of which two of the
Sea-men willingly ſtript themſelves, they inſtantly tackt about,
and a freſh gale then riſing from the ſea, almoſt in a moment
arrived upon the ſhore.</p>
            <p>The Country-people, partly in curioſity to hear news, for
by reaſon of the war ſome novelty or other happened almoſt
every day, but the better ſort to wait upon <hi>Syneſius,</hi> attended
the return of the Fallocque; which no ſooner touched upon
the Beach, but they all flocked to the Sea-ſide, and when they
were ready to land, He with his Gentlemen being come to the
head of the Boat, when they ſaw the ſtrangers, were ſeiſed with
a kind of admiration, in beholding two ſuch goodly perſons in
a habit ſo unſuitable to their demeanure, and preſently ſtep'd
to give them their hands; which civility, as ſoon as they were
on ſhore, they returned with great demonſtrations of gratitude,
and by their deportment gave teſtimony of a birth and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
far above their preſent condition.</p>
            <p>They were both of equal perfections, though ſomthing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in years, the eldeſt being about two and twenty, the
other not above nineteen; the one of a moſt deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61061:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the other of a more manly vigorous compoſition;
the one the people were ready to adore as the God of war, the
other emblemed that Youth for whom the Goddeſs of Love
herſelf ſuffered ſuch an ardent paſſion; and both had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
ſuch characters of manhood and beauty, as promiſed
an aſſured victory in the contentions either of Love, or
War.</p>
            <p>The elder was of a ſtature more then the ordinary ſize of
men; his hair, which was brown, hung in great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings dangling
upon his ſhoulders, his beard appeared only like young doun,
his eyes were gray, yet full of a majeſtick gravity, and his face
though ſomething enclined to leanneſs, was the index of a moſt
daring mind, and more generous ſpirit; in brief, nature had
framed his body, as if to ſhew the perfection of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ex both
in comelines of proportion, and addreſs in all manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.
The other was about half the head lower, and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
that made all others neer him ſeem to have none; his
hair flaxen, with ſuch a gliſtering brightneſs, as that alone was
ornament enough for any one man; but all the reſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
was anſwerable, large gray eyes, a wide forehead, a mild
cheerfull countenance, and a ſhape ſo compleat as drew the
eyes of all the beholders into admiration.</p>
            <p>The worthy <hi>Syneſius</hi> took ſo ſtrict a ſurvey of theſe rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
that he aſſured himſelf they were perſons to be
treated with more then a common civility: On the other ſide,
his grave deportment, the honour that was rendred him by the
people, and the extraordinary reſpect he uſed towards them,
were ſufficient teſtimonies that he was a perſon of eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and quality; wherefore they made their addreſſes to him
with great ſhews of humility, being ready to give him all the
dues belonged to his quality, as willing for the preſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their own. So that after the firſt ſalutations were paſt
with equal complements and careſſes on either ſide; Sir, ſaid
the elder ſtranger, We deſire you will be pleaſed to look upon
us as perſons, after infinite ſufferings, at length by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of the Gods expoſed to your charity; and though we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61061:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already owe you for our own preſervation, before we can
ſcarcely acknowledg that debt, we muſt implore the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
thereof towards the men left in our Veſſel, which lies not
far hence in the road, but hath ſprung ſo many leaks, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſent aſſiſtance they muſt all certainly periſh. <hi>Syneſius</hi>
not ſuffering him to proceed farther, replied, If I have any way
obliged you, I perceive you are Cavaliers of ſo much worth,
that I eſteem my ſelf happy in the occaſion; and for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
it is my duty to perform what you deſire: But you have
already ſuffered too much in your own perſons, therefore I
beſeech you to take ſuch refreſhment as my poor habitation
not far from hence will afford, and doubt not of my care in
ſending preſent aſſiſtance to your ſhip. Whereupon turning
about to <hi>Nicander,</hi> he gave him order and full authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to man all the Boats upon the coaſt, and to conduct
them himſelf into the Road.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was giving ſuch directions as were neceſſary, it
being ſomething late, and the sky begining to be darkned with
clouds, his Chariot was come to the place, with ſome of his
ſervants, to wait upon their Lord home; and immediately the
wind begining to riſe by degrees, ſuch a ſudden ſhower of rain
poured down upon them, as forced him with his gueſts, and
<hi>Eleutherius</hi> the other Gentleman that accompanied him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
farther complement or ceremony to enter into the Chariot,
and diſſipated the reſt of the company to their ſeveral homes;
only <hi>Nicander</hi> calling the Sea-men about him, remained under
the ſhelter of a poor Cottage, to put in execution thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
which his Lord had left with him concerning the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
in the road.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Syneſius</hi> houſe were but a little way diſtant from
the ſea, yet the ſtorm was ſo ſudden and violent, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed with
ſuch terrible thunder and lightening, that the horſes being hot-metled
could not be governed by the driver; yet with the help
of the Footmen, though with ſome diſorder, they were made
to advance, till being come under the ſhelter of certain trees,
which planted in four ranks made a ſpacious ſhady aſcent up
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61061:9"/>
to the houſe, they began to go quietly of themſelves; and at
length being come into the Baſe-court, divers ſervants with
torches of white-wax attended at the gate: But when they
were deſcending from the Chariot, the younger of the two
Strangers was found in ſuch a condition, that they could
ſcarcely diſcern any life in him, which by reaſon of the noiſe
and diſorder cauſed by the tempeſt, was not till then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
wherefore he was carried upon mens arms, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by <hi>Syneſius,</hi> and his companion in misfortune, into a
chamber fit to receive ſo noble a gueſt, where all means were
uſed to recover his fainting ſpirits, cauſed, being of a delicate
complexion, through his ſufferings firſt in the ſhip, and the
over-violent force he uſed afterwards to recover the ſhore by
ſwiming. But being laid in a bed, and having taken ſuch
Cordials which <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſent for out of his Cabinet, he ſoon
came to himſelf agen, yet not ſo but that there remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
certain ſymptoms of a violent feaver; to prevent which,
nothing was judged more neceſſary for the preſent then a little
repoſe: wherefore <hi>Syneſius</hi> having expreſſed his ſorrow for ſo
ill an accident, and left a neceſſary attendance about him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
his other gueſt to another appartement, which was ſo
richly furniſhed, the feelings ſo nobly gilt, and the chimneys
and windows ſo adorned with porphyrie, and poliſhed marble,
that the Stranger could not think it leſs then a Princes palace,
or at leaſt a Subjects of the moſt eminent rank. Nevertheleſs
<hi>Syneſius,</hi> through his accuſtomed civility, made many excuſes
for the defects of the place, promiſing to ſupply them with
a ready obedience to all his commands; and thereupon it
being late, cauſed only a ſlight Collation to be brought up,
to refreſh him after his ſufferings at ſea: But as they ſate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
perceiving his Gueſt to be full of penſiveneſs, for that
time troubled him not with many queſtions, or much diſcourſe;
but the tables being taken away, told him that he thought reſt
was moſt ſuitable to one in his condition, and therefore for
the preſent he would leave him to it, aſſuring him that he
would not be deficient in any obſequious offices either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61061:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himſelf, or thoſe remaining in the ſhip; and that if the
ſudden tempeſt had not prevented it, they had already received
ſuch ſuccor as that Coaſt could afford.</p>
            <p>Sir, replied the Stranger, I find you ſo abounding in all kind
of courteſie, that I cannot but render thanks to heaven, that
after ſo many adverſities I am arrived in a place of ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
entertainment; yet I cannot but remain perplexed to ſee
my companion in affliction, though otherwiſe a ſtranger to
me, in ſo ill a condition; but as to thoſe in the ſhip, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
through a generous compaſſion he fetched a deep ſigh)
I fear the ſtorm hath prevented thoſe benefits you intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; however I cannot deſpair of their ſafety, ſince
you have been pleaſed to undertake their protection, whoſe
actions I perceive are favoured by the Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Syneſius</hi> told him, If the Gods were pleaſed to concur with
his deſires, there was no doubt of their ſafety; therefore earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly
entreated him to take ſuch repoſe as the time required:
And thereupon, after infinite acknowledgments of mutual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
and many civilities paſſed on either ſide, <hi>Syneſius,</hi>
leaving two Gentlemen to attend him, retired to his own
lodging, where as ſoon as he had given order to one of his
ſervants to go early the next morning for <hi>Caſsianus</hi> a famous
Phyſitian, who was then at certain medicinal wells about two
leagues off, went to his reſt, which he fell into with great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
having ended the day with works of ſo much hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
charity, yet not with a perfect content, becauſe of the fears
he conceived for thoſe ſtill remaining in the ſhip.</p>
            <p>The Stranger being now left to himſelf, having put on ſuch
linnen as lay prepared for him, ſoon diſmiſſed his attendants,
and caſting himſelf into his bed, the remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
misfortunes in the whole courſe of his life, came ſo thick
upon him, that overpreſſed with care and grief, at length he
yielded to ſleep which on a ſudden wholly poſſeſſed him.</p>
            <p>About two or three hours after, as ſoon as day began to
break, by which time the ſtorm was quite over, there was a
great noiſe of men and horſe about the houſe: whereupon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61061:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who was watchfull upon all occaſions, apprehending
Souldiers were come into thoſe quarters, and fearing his new
gueſts might be moleſted with tumults, immediately calling
for <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> deſired him to look out, and to bring word
what might be the occaſion of ſo early a diſturbance. But as
ſoon as he had cauſed the gates to be opened, and was going
out with half a dozen reſolute men, well prepared for any equal
encounter, <hi>Nicander</hi> entred into the Court, followed by a
great number of Sea-men and Country people, beſides horſes
and mules with ſeveral ladings, and amongſt the reſt two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who both by their habits and demeanure bore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſoon conjectured the truth, that theſe were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and goods come from the ſhip; yet deſiring to return
with full information, entreated <hi>Nicander</hi> to relate to him the
particular paſſages that had happened: Who readily conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to his requeſt, told him that immediately after his
Lord was departed, whilſt he was preparing Boats, there riſe
ſo great a wind, which came directly off from the Sea, that
the Captain ſeeing his Veſſel almoſt half full of water, and
deſpairing of all other means of ſafety, taking the advantage
thereof, commanded his men to make all the ſail they could,
and laying her juſt in the wind, ran in upon the ſhore, where
ſhe ſtuck faſt upon the ſand for a while; but being ſo neer, he
uſed ſuch diligence, that all the men, and goods of any value
were ſaved, and that immediately after by the force of the
waves beating upon her ſhe was broke into a thouſand pieces:
That among the reſt thoſe two Gentlemen, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs
<hi>Lyſander</hi> &amp; <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> made great enquiry after two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who rather then to run the hazard of periſhing miſerably
in the Veſſel, had expoſed themſelves, whilſt the Sea was calm,
to the mercy of the waters; And being aſſured they were in
ſafety, with great expreſſions of joy deſired to be conducted
to them with thoſe coffers which it ſeems were left in their
charge; but being very ſparing in their diſcourſe, and wary of
diſcovering themſelves, that he knew nothing more of their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61061:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtory then what their preſent condition declared.</p>
            <p>This was ſufficient: Therefore having deſired <hi>Nicander</hi>
to give all civil reſpects to the Gentlemen, and to entertain
the reſt in the beſt manner he could, according to their ſeveral
conditions, he haſted with the news to <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who was not
a little pleaſed that the men were ſo happily preſerved, and
deſired <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to communicate the ſame to his gueſts,
but by no means if they were repoſed to diſturb them.</p>
            <p>The one being indiſpoſed, he judged it moſt convenient to
go firſt to the others appartement, who being lodged on that
ſide the houſe next the gate, had heard much that paſſed, and as
<hi>Eleutherius</hi> came to the door, was ready, having caſt a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown
about him, to come out; and as ſoon as they met, after
the firſt ſalutations were paſt, he recounted to him all that had
happened, and how there were two Gentlemen, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and
<hi>Lyſander,</hi> that made great enquiry after him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Whereat the Stranger ſeeming much rejoyced, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
agen into his chamber, deſired <hi>Cleanthes</hi> might be
brought to him, which was immediately done, who as ſoon as
he ſaw his maſter, touched the ground with one knee, and
offered to kiſs his hand; but he not ſuffering it, raiſed him
up, and as he embraced him, pretending to kiſs his cheek,
whiſpered ſomething in his ear: which <hi>Eleutherius</hi> obſerving,
though it were only to advertiſe him that he ſhould not uſe
any ſuch ceremony, imagined he deſired to be in private, and
preſently withdrew.</p>
            <p>Being gone down ſtairs, paſſing through the great Hall, he
met <hi>Caſsianus</hi> the Phyſitian, whom <hi>Syneſius</hi> had ſent for to
viſit his ſick gueſt, and after a civil ſalute conducted him to
his Lords lodging, who being by this time ready, kindly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
him; and having firſt viſited his Lady to acquaint her
with what had paſſed, which as yet ſhe underſtood but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
immediately called for <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
him gave him his hand, which the other offered to kiſs;
but he not permitting that, ſaid, I ſhall perhaps return your
civility to your ſatisfaction, if you will take the pains to go a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61061:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
little with me. For underſtanding the other was private with
<hi>Cleanthes,</hi> he meant to viſit his ſick gueſt firſt; and entring
into the Ante-chamber, he was informed by the attendants,
that though he had taken a little reſt, yet he found no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of his feaver. Wherefore going ſoftly into the room,
they approached towards him with as little noiſe as might be:
but he hearing their tread, put back the curtain with his hand;
to ſee who they were; and as ſoon as <hi>Lyſander</hi> eſpied him,
without any ceremony, running to the bed-ſide, he kneeled
down, and holding up his hands ſaid, Ah my Lord and
Prince! Is it poſſible I ſee you ſafe here? Have the Gods
been ſo favorable to hear my prayers for your preſervation?
I can now no more doubt of a good ſucceſs to all our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
and that this Land will be propitious unto us, ſince
at our firſt arrival we have found ſuch humanity amongſt the
inhabitants, and ſo favourable an entertainment in this place.</p>
            <p>He would have ſpoken more; but the Prince putting his
arm about his neck, and laying his face cloſe to his, with a
cloſe embrace hindred his ſpeech, ſaying, How pleaſing this
encounter is, I leave to your ſelf to judge; but the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my life; and with my life this Jewel (ſhewing the
Tablet) which encloſeth the Idea of my ſouls happineſs, I
owe to this worthy Lord, pointing to <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who took
that occaſion to approach neerer to him, though with greater
reverence then before, underſtanding ſomthing of his quality,
and humbly deſired him not to call that a debt which was but
a duty on his part; for if he had done him any ſervice, both
the benefit and the honour redounded wholly to himſelf,
praying him for the preſent to think of nothing but the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his health, and thereupon preſented <hi>Caſsianus,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
him that he might rely upon his skill as the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and practiſed in his profeſſion, of the whole kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Prince having accepted his offer, and with a courteous
ſalute welcomed the Phyſitian, <hi>Syneſius</hi> preſently left the
chamber, deſiring <hi>Lyſander</hi> who remained there, to command
both himſelf, his houſe, and family in any thing that might be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61061:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uſefull for the Princes ſervice, who having made a due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his noble hoſpitality, and conducted him to the
ſtairs head, returned agen into the chamber to adviſe with
<hi>Caſsianus</hi> concerning the Princes indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>In this interim <hi>Cleanthes</hi> gave a full account to his Lord of
all that had happened in the ſhip after his departure; how the
mariners being wearied with their continual labour in pmp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the water came in upon them in ſuch abundance, that to
lighten her they were forced to heave all the lumber, and a
great part of their lading over board, and that amongſt the
reſt the coffer in which was the Cabinet with all his jewels,
was in the confuſion, by miſtake, caſt into the ſea. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
not ſeeming at all moved, he only asked whether his
Arms were ſafe; and underſtanding they were, replied, With
them, and this, pointing to his ſword, I muſt get more.
And thereupon <hi>Syneſius</hi> entring into his chamber, hearing
him coming he left <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and receiving him at the dore,
after mutual complements and civilities on either ſide, the
Company waiting in the outward room, they ſate down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and began to enter into diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but <hi>Syneſius</hi> had a great deſire to know
the perſon he had entertained, and ſomething of the paſſages
of his life, having as it appeared by ſome ſtrange accident been
brought upon that coaſt; yet he would not ſo much as by
circumſtance give any hint thereof, leſt it might diſpleaſe.
But the Stranger making many acknowledgments of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
he had received from him, and then compoſing his
countenance, began to ſpeak in the native language of the
Country; at which <hi>Syneſius</hi> was not a little amazed, and could
not ſo conceal it but the Stranger perceived an alteration in his
countenance. Whereupon he ſaid, I ſee you wonder that I, a
Stranger, having hitherto uſed another dialect, ſhould now
ſpeak in your own language: But I find you a perſon of ſo
much honour, that I dare not doubt to repoſe a confidence in
you; yet I have been hitherto ſo unfortunate both in my ſelf
and family, that if I were not inwardly aſſured by all your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61061:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proceedings, that you live by principles of honor and juſtice,
ſhould not ſo freely communicate my ſelf to you as I intend.</p>
            <p>When you know my name, you will know part of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes;
and as you are affected to your Kings ſervice, either
continue your friendly offices towards me, or elſe deliver me
into the hands of his and my enemies, who I very well know
have only for their own ends cauſed ſo many miſerable diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in this Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Syneſius</hi> finding him ſo well acquainted with the affairs of
the Country, replied, Sir, whatſoever my inward inclinations
are concerning the preſent war, or the differences between the
King and his People, you may be aſſured I can never betray a
truſt; and therefore you may freely communicate your ſelf
ſo far as you think I may be ſerviceable to your affairs, and
you ſhall not find me ſo impertinently curious as to enquire
farther.</p>
            <p>Then the Stranger, bending his body a little forward, with
a great ſigh ſaid, No, I know the worthy <hi>Syneſius</hi> is deſcended
of too noble a race, to be treacherous to the unfortunate, and
much wronged <hi>Philocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately <hi>Syneſius</hi> putting back his chair, riſe up, and
replied, Sir, you have told me enough to teach me my duty;
I now know the reſpect I ought to bear you, and you ſhall not
find yourſelf deceived in the truſt you have been pleaſed to
repoſe in me. But before he could proceed farther, Prince <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles</hi>
forced him to take his ſeat agen, and then he continued:</p>
            <p>Sir, if I am contented to be thus unmannerly in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
be pleaſed to impute it to a compliance with your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
for I ſhall humbly adviſe you will as yet conceal your
ſelf, and not make known who you are to any in this place: For
though my loyalty, and the relation I have ever had to the
Kings ſervice, will oblige me to be faithful to you, yet I am
not exempt from thoſe inconveniences which divers great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
in this Country now ſuffer, to have many neer to me,
and even my own Children, of contrary inclinations perhaps
to my ſelf; and though I believe they would not injure me
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61061:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much, as to do any thing unworthy of their birth, yet being
engaged with the other party, I cannot tell how far thoſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
may prevail with them above the reſpect they ought
to bear to you as a Prince, or the reverence which is due to me
as a Father.</p>
            <p>It is true, I have heard much of the calamities that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
your royal family, yet not ſo perfectly, but I ſhall, if the
requeſt be not unmannerly, deſire to be better informed, when
your diſpoſition, and the convenience both of time and place
ſhall concur to invite you to it; but for the preſent I ſhall with
leave retire, untill ſuch time as you make yourſelf ready to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of that homely entertainment which this poor place can
afford. And <hi>Philocles</hi> being exceedingly pleaſed with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
he had already held with <hi>Syneſius,</hi> not deſiring to paſs
farther for the preſent, willingly diſmiſſed him.</p>
            <p>During the time of this conference, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> having cauſed
the Coffers to be opened, had prepared cloaths and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for the Princes wearing, which he put on whilſt <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius</hi>
was giving order about his houſhold affairs.</p>
            <p>The one and the other were ſoon diſpatched: For <hi>Syneſius</hi>
lived in ſuch order and method, that his more ſerious thoughts
were ſeldom interrupted with petty domeſtick buſineſs; and
Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> was ſo much a Souldier, that he deſpiſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
adornments, and held thoſe unworthy the name of
Man, that would conſume any conſiderable part of their time
in thoſe affected vanities.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſoon after they had parted, <hi>Philocles</hi> having ſent
<hi>Cleanthes</hi> to viſit the ſick Prince, they met in the garden, which
was ſo ſtored with rare fruits of all kinds, ſo adorned with
Fountains, Grots, Canals, and Walks both artificial and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
and that part of the houſe which fronted upon the
Garden, was ſuch a noble, antient fabrick, that all conſidered
together, they ſhewed both the antiquity of the family to
which they belonged, and the continuance of it in greatneſs
and proſperity to thoſe latter times, which had furniſhed ſo
many rare inventions for pleaſure and magnificence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61061:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When they had a little recreated themſelves with walking,
and were diſcourſing of the pleaſant ſcituation of the place,
<hi>Eleutherius</hi> brought <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Caſsianus</hi> the Phyſitian to
them, who gave this account of his Patients condition, that
he was in a violent dangerous feaver, cauſed as he underſtood
by unaccuſtomed ſufferings in his voyage, yet, as he feared,
augmented by ſome inward paſſion of the mind; and that
beſides the remedies he ſhould apply, there was nothing more
neceſſary for the recovery of his health then a quiet repoſe, and
therefore that he deſired he might not be moleſted with any
company ſaving a neceſſary attendance for the ſpace of three
dayes, in which time he ſhould be able to give a ſure judgment
of his diſeaſe; doubting not if theſe orders were obſerved;
he would by the help of youth quickly recover his former
ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The Prince was exceedingly pleaſed with ſuch fair hopes of
his Companions recovery; and after mutual congratulations
between him and <hi>Lyſander</hi> for their ſafe arrival, notice being
given by the Steward that it was Noon, and <hi>Syneſius</hi> having
intimated to Prince <hi>Philocles,</hi> that to avoid the ſuſpition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to be concealed, it would be beſt to eat publikely, as a
private perſon with the reſt, all the Company went together
to his appartement, where by <hi>Syneſius</hi> directions the dinner was
prepared, and all things were ſerved with that decencie and
order as was ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, though not with
that ceremony and ſtate as was due to ſo great a Prince. But
<hi>Syneſius</hi> failed not to entertain his gueſts with variety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
in which he excelled moſt men of that age; and in
this differed from all others, that he never willingly ſuffered
any thing to be ſaid at his table of ſacred things belonging to
the worſhip of the Gods, nor of the preſent differences or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affairs, nor yet in cenſure of particular perſons of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or quality ſoever; but ever framed his diſcourſe ſuitable
to his company: With Souldiers, he would talk of martial
exerciſes, or Fortifications; with Courtiers, of Tennis, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or riding the great Horſe; with Scholars, of ſome point
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61061:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Philoſophie, or elſe compare hiſtories of antient times; and
was ſo generally knowing, that he pleaſed all of the meaneſt
capacities: For even with the Country Magiſtrates he would
ſeem to inform himſelf of their wayes of Judicature; and with
his neighbours talk of Husbandry, planting Trees, or breeding
of Cattel, with as much inſight as if he had been bred only in
ſuch employments. But at that time falling aptly upon it by
reaſon of the Princes ſickneſs, he propoſed a ſubject whereby
<hi>Caſsianus</hi> might ſhew his learning, concerning the Circulation
of the blood, which by reaſon of the novelty was very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and he proved it with ſuch ſtrong argumentations, and
ſolid reaſons, that all the company condeſcended to his
opinion.</p>
            <p>Dinner being ended, they returned agen into the garden;
where <hi>Philocles</hi> and <hi>Syneſius</hi> having withdrawn themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a private Walk ſhaded with Laurel, <hi>Syneſius</hi> with many
profeſſions of ſervice and fidelity humbly deſired the Prince
to acquaint him with the particular paſſages of his life: To
which he was very willing, but for the preſent excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as thinking it neceſſary in the firſt place to give a viſit to
his Lady: but <hi>Syneſius</hi> told him, that ſhe having intended a
journey to <hi>Palermo,</hi> the Metropolis of that Kingdom, to viſit
her Siſter, had choſen that time as moſt convenient, that the
houſe might be the more free for the entertainment of himſelf;
which inclination of hers he had farthered, as thinking her
abſence at that time not unneceſſary, and that ſhe was depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
early, to enjoy the cool of the morning.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſmiling, thanked him for his care; but in ſtead
of entring into the diſcourſe deſired, told him, You already
know much of my ſtory, or at leaſt ſo much as is publike to
the world; and for other particulars, I ſhall not fail to take
a time to acquaint you with them. But for the preſent I ſhould
requeſt you to make me ſome brief accompt of the ſtate of
theſe Kingdoms, the original of the War, and the proceedings
thereof, in which I am too ignorant being ſo neerly concerned,
having never yet, though I have been active enough in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61061:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe, met with any that agreed in their relations, or could
make a perfect diſcourſe thereof; yet if it pleaſe you, we will
for a while lay by both the one and the other: For this ſtranger
that is in your houſe, and who it ſeems is a Prince, hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
been drawn hither by ſome extraordinary adventure,
which perhaps would be of ſome concernment to know; and
the Phyſitian having ordained him ſo many dayes of repoſe,
it is not unlikely we may receive ſatisfaction therein from
<hi>Lyſander,</hi> who undoubtedly is acquainted with every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of his life.</p>
            <p>This Propoſition was very gratefull to <hi>Syneſius;</hi> therefore
they returned agen to mingle with the company, and having
ſeparated <hi>Lyſander</hi> from the reſt, when they were at a diſtance,
Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> without more circumſtance ſaid,</p>
            <p>Worthy <hi>Lyſander,</hi> I eſteem it one of the happieſt encounters
of my life, that offered an occaſion of my coming firſt into
your Princes company; and though we were ſtrangers before,
we have ſince been companions, at leaſt in our ſufferings; and
I have obſerved in him ſo great and generous a courage upon
all occaſions, that I cannot be blamed if I am tranſported with
a paſſionate deſire to know the ſtory of his life: Beſides, we are
both indebted to this noble Lord for our preſervation; and
he joyning with me in this requeſt, I ſuppoſe you will be ready
to give him that ſatisfaction, unleſs there be ſome notable
reaſon to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Sir, replied <hi>Lyſander,</hi> I eaſily imagined our noble Hoſt and
yourſelf, having ſeen ſo much of the Prince my maſter, could
not be without a curioſity of knowing more; and therefore
conceiving it juſt to comply with perſons of ſo much worth,
I took that time you were retired together into the cloſe walk,
to ask his conſent thereunto; which having eaſily obtained,
I am ready whenſoever you pleaſe to ſatisfie your deſires.</p>
            <p>They both returned him many thanks for his ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance;
and their curioſity not ſuffering them to defer it longer,
by <hi>Syneſius</hi> advice, for the more privacie, they went out of
the garden, through the houſe, into the Park, which was but a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61061:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hundred paces diſtant, and lay upon an eaſie aſcent, there being
a ſpacious Walk adorned with fountains, and ſhaded with well
grown trees, that led to a Mount covered with a great wood,
in the midſt whereof was a ſquare place cut out with ſeats of
marble, and an artificial Grot repreſenting <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> on the
top whereof ſtood a <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> from the impreſſion of whoſe
foot iſſued a Fountain, and round about it were placed <hi>Apollo</hi>
with the Muſes playing upon ſeveral inſtruments, which by
the motion of the water yielded a moſt pleaſing harmony, and
even raviſhed the beholders with delight.</p>
            <p>But having a while conſidered the beauty of the place, the
artificial conveyance of the water, and the pleaſant proſpect
they had from thence over a declining Lawn, (in the midſt
whereof, by a great Lake, fed a numerous Herd of Deer)
upon the houſe and gardens compaſſed in with a large river,
and bounded on the other ſide with fruitful hills, flouriſhing
with corn and wine; <hi>Syneſius</hi> invited them to ſit down, and
Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> not failing to put <hi>Lyſander</hi> in mind of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
he expecting it, being placed in the midſt of them, began
his relation after this manner.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Story of Prince DEMETRIUS.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>GReece</hi> is not ſo remote, nor the name of the renowned
<hi>Polidor</hi> ſo unknown to the world, that I need ſpend much
time either in the deſcription of the Country, or of the
noble race of which Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> my maſter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philocles</hi> at that name clapping his hand upon his breaſt, Is
this, ſaid he, that Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> whoſe actions have rendred
him ſo famous, and whoſe loſs of late hath been ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
throughout all <hi>Greece?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the ſame, replied <hi>Lyſander;</hi> and ſince you take ſuch
pleaſure in the diſcovery of the perſon, I doubt not but the
ſtory of his life will yield you ſuch content, that you will the

eaſilier pardon my defect of language in the relation of it.</p>
               <p>Then ſetling himſelf agen to continue his diſcourſe, they
heard in the wood cloſe behind them the treading of horſe,
and a ſound of harneſs; when ſtarting up to ſee what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould be, they perceived they were almoſt quite environed
by a company of twelve or fourteen armed men, who as they
came out of the Grot, ruſhing violently upon them, he that
ſeemed to command, cryed out, That is the other we look for,
pointing to <hi>Philocles,</hi> Seiſe upon him; and for the reſt, you may
if you pleaſe be ſecure, for there is no harm intended towards
you.</p>
               <p>But Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> being of too great a courage ſo tamely
to yield himſelf, ſtood upon his guard; and the firſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to lay hold of him, he encountred ſo luckily with the
point of his ſword beneath his arms, that receiving a mortal
wound in the belly, he fell dead from his horſe; and the
Prince at the ſame inſtant ſeiſing upon the reins, with a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
activity leapt into the ſaddle; when immediately the
whole Troop having ſurrounded him, one crying out, Yield
thy ſelf and thou ſhalt have quarter, thoſe words animated him
with ſuch a fury, that he ſoon ſtopt his ſpeech that uttered
them with a fatal thruſt, which entring in at his mouth pierced
him quite through the throat: Then ſeeking to diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from amongſt them, and finding one, who was the chief of
the party, had faſt hold of his bridle, with one mighty blow
he cut off both his hands, and ſo having freed himſelf wheeled
about to gain advantage for a ſecond encounter.</p>
               <p>Theſe more then actions of a man, ſeeing two of their men
killed, and their Commander in ſuch a condition, ſo daunted
the reſt, that they began to think of their defence; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that <hi>Syneſius</hi> and <hi>Lyſander</hi> having poſſeſſed themſelves
of the weapons of their ſlain Companions came likewiſe to
aſſault them, one taking their hurt man behind him, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſet ſpurs to their horſes, and with all the ſpeed they
could make fled towards a great Wood about five hundred
paces diſtant, not far from the Park-gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61061:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Philocles</hi> eager of an abſolute victory, purſued them cloſe:
<hi>Syneſius</hi> and <hi>Lyſander</hi> being on foot, could not accompany
him otherwiſe then with their eyes, which notwithſtanding
all their manhood were even ready to overflow with tears,
when they perceived it was impoſſible for them to give any
aſſiſtance to that gallant Prince, who being neer the Wood,
there iſſued out of the ſhelter thereof a body of about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horſe, which having on a ſudden hemmed him on every
ſide, immediately marched away quite out of their ſight.</p>
               <p>This unexpected ſurpriſal was ſuch an infinite affliction to
the noble <hi>Syneſius,</hi> that notwithſtanding the great reſolution
which in all accidents ever preſerved him in an equal temper,
he could not forbear to break out into moſt grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
that the hoſpitality of his houſe ſhould againſt all the
laws of civility be ſo barbarouſly violated; and <hi>Lyſander</hi> was
no leſs ſenſible of the Princes misfortune: But having both
been Souldiers, they very well knew that ſuch accidents were
the ordinary effects of war; and therefore returned towards
the houſe, with a reſolution to make all the force they could
and immediately to purſue after them. But as they were going
down the hill, they perceived four or five horſmen ſpuring up
towards them, which were <hi>Nicander</hi> with ſome other of the
domeſticks; who told his Lord, That he and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Park without any weapons, they were on a ſudden
ſet upon by a party of half a dozen horſe, and that not being
in a poſture to make any defence, they had ſeiſed upon <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi>
and carried him away with them; wherefore his intent
was to follow the ſame rout they had taken, and if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to deliver him out of their hands.</p>
               <p>No, no, replied <hi>Syneſius,</hi> it is too late: But immediately
return; and whilſt ſome make ready all the horſe in my own
ſtables, let others try what force they can raiſe in the village,
for we have preſent occaſion to uſe all our friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicander</hi> not ſtaying to reply, preſently returned; and by
that time <hi>Syneſius</hi> entred into the Court, the allarum which was
given had brought together a great number of Country-people,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61061:16"/>
who without asking the cauſe were ready to hazard
themſelves upon any deſign, and nothing ſeemed more irkſom
to them then delay of action. Nevertheleſs he declared to them
in ſhort the reaſon of their aſſembling; and having called for
his Arms, deſired ſuch as were ſenſible of the affront he had
received, to aſſiſt him in the juſt vindication of his honour: To
which all expreſſed a wonderfull readineſs, profeſſing to live
and die with him; and <hi>Lyſander</hi> having viſited Prince <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
yet with a great caution that he ſhould not acquaint
him with any thing that had paſſed, would needs accompany
him in the action; but <hi>Elentherius</hi> was left behind with order
to arm all the Mariners and Sea-men, that had ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
to defend the houſe, if occaſion ſhould be, from any
ſudden aſſault.</p>
               <p>They marched about two leagues upon the ſame rout which
they imagined the other took, without hearing any news of
them; but at laſt met a poor Peaſant, who being asked whether
he had not ſeen ſuch a troop, replied yes too lately, for they had
by force taken away his horſe to mount one of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that about a quarter of a league thence, in the valley,
lay their main body, conſiſting of fiveteen hundred horſe,
and that when they joyned they made great ſhoutings and
acclamations of joy, as in token of ſome notable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syneſius</hi> and <hi>Lyſander</hi> eaſily conjectured the cauſe of their
rejoycing, but were very much troubled at the report of their
number; and the Country-people, though before their coming
forth they were ſo hot and defied all the world, preſently upon
this news began to face about; yet at <hi>Syneſius</hi> entreaty were
content to make a ſtand, till himſelf with <hi>Lyſander</hi> and ſome
others went to the top of the hill to diſcover their ſtrength;
and finding it rather more then leſs then was reported, beſides
that they knew it would be impoſſible to make the men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
they ſaw indeed it would be but a vain attempt to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
them any further; and therefore with many thanks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing
the peaſants to their ſeveral habitations, he with <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61061:16"/>
and his domeſticks, though with ſorrowful hearts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
towards his own houſe.</p>
               <p>But when they were within ſight of the Park-wall, a little on
the right hand, behind a Wood, they heard a great claſhing of
weapons and arms: wherefore moved with curioſity to know
what ſhould be the occaſion thereof, <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſpuring his horſe,
took a path that led directly to the place from whence the
noiſe came, where he beheld a Knight in black Arms excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well mounted, that ſeemed to perform more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions: For of a dozen that had attacqued him, four
lay already dead upon the ground; and he with the help only
of his Squire, who having had his horſe newly killed under
him fought on foot, with admirable valour and addreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf againſt the reſt, yet ſo wounded in ſeveral
places, that through the loſs of blood it was impoſſible they
ſhould have held out long againſt ſo great a diſadvantage:
but at the ſame inſtant that <hi>Syneſius</hi> came in, having recollected
all his ſtrength, he charged the foremoſt with ſuch a mighty
force upon the head, that his helmet flew off, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
the blow, ſeparated his head from his ſhoulders:
which ſtruck ſo great an admiration into <hi>Syneſius,</hi> that he could
not forbear to cry out, Sir, I perceive your own valour is
enough to protect you againſt a multitude of enemies; but the
baſeneſs of theſe appears ſuch, that they deſerve not to fall by
your hands; thereupon giving one of them ſuch a wound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the right arm, that his ſword fell to the ground; and by
this time <hi>Lyſander</hi> with the reſt being come up to them, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in vain any longer to perſiſt in their attempt, they ſought
to preſerve themſelves by flight, which was no difficult matter,
for there was not any took care to purſue after them, believing
their own fears would carry them far enough from attempting
any new miſchief.</p>
               <p>But the ſtranger Knight finding himſelf diſencumbered of
his enemies, lighted immediately from his horſe, which he
delivered to his Squire; and <hi>Syneſius</hi> at the ſame time doing
the like, they embraced each other with great ſentiments of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61061:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
joy, the one that he had been ſo fortunate to ſuccor ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
a Cavalier, and the other in the encounter of ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
a Friend.</p>
               <p>But the Knight breaking ſilence firſt, ſaid, Sir, I know not
who you are that have thus obliged me; but I am ſure your
courteſie hath preſerved my life from the barbarous attempt
of theſe bloody villains; which I ſhall never hereafter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
my own, ſince in gratitude you ought to diſpoſe
of it.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Syneſius</hi> replied, That the Gods being ſenſible
of his late ſufferings, had bleſſed him with this occaſion to
perform a ſervice to a perſon of ſo much apparent merit; and
though he feared the aſſiſtance he had given him, in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
might be a detraction to his own valour, by
which alone he would undoubtedly have forced his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
to have paid the forfeiture of ſo vile a treachery with the
effuſion of their deareſt blood, yet he beſeeched him that he
would make a favourable conſtruction of his intentions, and
in token thereof (putting up his own beaver) fo far to honour
him, that he might know his face, whoſe vertue he ſo much
admired.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Knight thinking it diſcourteous not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his requeſt, having unlaced his helmet, diſcovered ſuch
a majeſtick beauty, that they all thought they never had beheld
any equal to it, though <hi>Syneſius</hi> who was no leſs raviſhed then
the reſt, ſuppoſed the air of his countenance was not altogether
unknown to him; yet not calling any thing perfectly to mind
that might avow ſuch an imagination, he only looked upon
him as the perfection of all the ſex: His eyes, when he fixed
them ſeriouſly, commanding an awful reverence in all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants;
and when he ſmiled a little, infuſing a kind of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
into their hearts.</p>
               <p>He was not above eighteen years of age, yet of the juſt ſtature
of the moſt accompliſhed men; his hair of ſo perfect a black,
that for colour and luſtre nothing could be compared to it
but Jet; which hanging in great curls below his ſhoulders, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61061:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wind blew it before his face, appeared like a cloud envying
the glory of the ſun; and his face which was full and round,
caſt ſuch reſplendeut rays through that cloud, that it even
dazeled the eyes of the beholders; and all together framed
ſuch a royal meine, that both knees and hearts were ready to
bow at his devotion. And though <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſtill lamented the
ill fortune of Prince <hi>Philocles,</hi> yet he could not but applaud
his own, which had miniſtred ſuch an opportunity to offer his
ſervice to this ſtranger. Therefore with great reſpect addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſpeech to him, he beſought him that he would be
pleaſed, though he could no way merit ſo great an honour,
that in regard of himſelf, having ſome wounds upon him,
which perhaps might require the aſſiſtance of a Chirurgion,
for the preſent to repoſe himſelf at his houſe, whither he
ſhould not preſume to invite him, but that he was aſſured he
had one there that was eſteemed the moſt skilfull Operator in
the whole kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Knight finding his condition required ſuch a one, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted his offer; and mounting agen on horſ-back,
having given <hi>Nicander</hi>'s to the Squire, they ſoon arrived at
<hi>Syneſius</hi> houſe, which was not above half a league from that
place; where having conducted the Knight to <hi>Philocles</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partement,
and called for <hi>Caſsianus,</hi> who was a moſt excellent
Chyrurgion as well as a Phyſitian. All retiring out of the
room except the Squire and ſome few attendants, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
laid into his bed; and <hi>Caſsianus</hi> having ſearched his
wounds, found none of them dangerous, and but one of any
conſequence, which was a deep c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t upon the fleſhy part of his
left arm: To which having applied ſuch remedies as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and by reaſon of his loſs of blood ordained him only
ſome comfortable Cordial for that night, would have left him
to his reſt; but the Knight would not let him depart untill he
had, in his preſence, firſt performed the ſame office to his
Squire, who had, beſides a great hurt on the head, a deep
wound on his left ſide under the heart, which raiſed ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of danger; and the Knight perceiving as much;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61061:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſed a pallat to be made for him in his own chamber, his
life being ſo dear to him, that he would not truſt the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
thereof to any but himſelf.</p>
               <p>It was now well advanced in the night, and <hi>Caſsianus</hi> not
permitting <hi>Syneſius</hi> to viſit any of his patients, aſſuring him
that <hi>Demetrius</hi> repoſed, and that the other had need of nothing
more then the reſt, ſupper was called for, of which both they
and <hi>Lyſander</hi> fed but very ſparingly, being full of thoughts
both for what was become of <hi>Philocles,</hi> and who this Stranger
ſhould be that was ſo barbarouſly aſſaulted by ſuch an unequal
number. But committing the care of the one to the Gods, and
doubting not in a ſhort time to ſatisfie their curioſities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the other, for that night they retired to their ſeveral
reſts; only <hi>Syneſius</hi> earneſtly entreated <hi>Lyſander,</hi> that he

in the hopes of a future happineſs, embracing a ſhadow
inſtead of a ſubſtance, and ſacrificing an ocean of tears to a
Picture that was inſenſible of his complaints.</p>
            <p>But the Knight ſuffered agonies too great for any breaſt to
contain but his, that was fortified with ſo much vertue: Yet
that vertue was ſo violently aſſaulted with vehement paſſions,
that the force thereof ſometimes tranſported him into moſt
bitter complaints; and at the time knowing none were neer

Wretch that thou art! wert thou only made great, to be
expoſed to the greateſt of all miſeries? Have the Gods that
favoured thy birth with ſo much happineſs, ſo ſoon forſaken
thee? Or elſe to ſhew the infiniteneſs of their power, made
ſuch a ſudden change in thy condition? Yet if they remain
juſt, why have they choſen thee for a ſubject of their anger,
that haſt ſcarce lived days enough to commit ſins anſwerable
to their puniſhments? Or if the guilt lie in our family, and
through a ſecret providence vengeance were reſerved only to
theſe times, have not the ſufferings of my Royal parents yet
ſatisfied your wrath? Will you ſtill perſecute them, and be
nothing mercifull to me? Or if by deſtiny I were involved
in the ſame fate, is it not enough that my infancie was expoſed
to all the barbariſms of a cruel war? That my daily paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were interrupted with mournfull ſpectacles of the blood
and ſlaughter of my deareſt friends? That I could never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
any but to certain ruine? And that thoſe who were
born to be my Subjects, uſe all manner of ſtratagems and
force for my deſtruction? But to add to all theſe, and at once
to cut off all poſſibilities of a future happineſs, have you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
deprived me of the divine <hi>Theophania?</hi> Heap afflictions
upon my parents; deprive them of their Empire, and me of
my ſucceſſion; deſtroy my friends; let the deſigns of the
people prevail againſt me; and beſides thoſe at home, raiſe
up foreign Nations to be my enemies, ſo you reſtore to me
agen that innocent Virgin. Let me enjoy her, and though the
whole world oppoſe me, I ſhall not doubt to vanquiſh their
malice. We were in our infancie bred together; and nothing
could have ſeparated us but a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

we meet agen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will I doub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not bring a general ruine to all
our adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Theophania,</hi> if thou beeſt yet in the world, why doeſt
thou not hear my complaints? and hearing them, find ſome
means or other to afford me relief? Or if thou art retired to
the manſion of the Gods, why doeſt thou not, by thy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
procure my deliverance from ſuch a world of miſeries?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61061:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But I am aſſured thou liveſt; for otherwiſe my ſoul hath ſuch
a ſympathie with thine, that it could not long remain behind:
beſides, immediately after thy birth, the Oracle declared to
thy Nurſe, who was curious to enquire after thy fate, that
thou ſhouldſt live to be the mother of many Kings; and if it
were not for this aſſurance, I would with my own hands ſoon
releaſe it out of this vild priſon, I would tear off theſe bands
and ſwathes, and not ſuffer ſo many plaiſters and medicines
only to prolong a miſerable life.</p>
            <p>Yes, yes, Thou liveſt, <hi>Theophania,</hi> and <hi>Alexandro</hi> lives to
be thy Champion, who will not leave any part of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

throne of this Iſland, where we will triumph over the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
of Princes, and the Kings that deſcend from us ſhall
remain a perpetual terror to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ervillius,</hi> who beſides the pain of his wounds, bore ſo great
a part in his Maſters ſufferings, that he enjoyed but little reſt,
plainly overheard all that he ſaid; yet knowing that the beſt
way to aſſwage his paſſion, was, not to interrupt the courſe
thereof, remained ſilent; and <hi>Alexandro,</hi> after infinite
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
both of grief and anger, his ſpirits being at length
waſted, ſleep ſeiſed upon his ſenſes, giving ſome intermiſſion
to the anguiſh of his mind, and the cool diſtillations of the
morning which then began to appear, yielding a general
refreſhment to mens bodies, <hi>Ervillius</hi> likewiſe fell into a
ſound repoſe.</p>
            <p>But if waking <hi>Alexandro</hi> endured all the torments of an
afflicted mind, ſleeping he enjoyed all the pleaſures that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
could afford: For, the Idea of her whom his heart
adored, appeared to him in a more pefect ſhape then ever he
had beheld her, and with a pleaſing countenance approached
neer to him, holding in her right hand a naked ſword, and
delivering it to him, ſaid, The Gods, <hi>Alexandro,</hi> have deſtined
me to be thine; and though I am now deteined from thee by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61061:20"/>
the cruel perſecutors both of my life and honour, with this
thou muſt make thy way to me through a multitude of
enemies.</p>
            <p>Whereupon immediately awaking, and having ſeiſed upon
his own ſword which ſtood ever ready drawn at his bed-ſide,
ſeeing it in his hand, he believed it more then a dream, and
began to cry out, Yes my <hi>Theophania,</hi> with this I will force
my way to thee, and through a ſea of our enemies blood ſwim
to thy embraces.</p>
            <p>But as he uttered theſe ſpeeches, his ears being ſtrucken as
from the next room with the heavenly ſound of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
harmonious voice, which he believed to be the very ſame
of his <hi>Theophania,</hi> he began to be confirmed in the reality of
the appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ition; and lying quietly down agen upon his pillow
as in a trance, was exceeding attentive, when to the raviſhing
touch of a Lute, with wonderfull admiration he heard theſe
enſuing words.</p>
            <l>Great <hi>Jove,</hi> in thee all power doth reſt</l>
            <l>To make men wretched, or elſe bleſt;</l>
            <l>But in our ſelves it doth remain</l>
            <l>Our lives unſpotted to maintain,</l>
            <l>And never yet a vertuous mind</l>
            <l>Though kingdoms have, hath ere declin'd.</l>
            <l>Then if my Love do live,</l>
            <l>To him this comfort give,</l>
            <l>That whilſt our lives and hearts are pure</l>
            <l>Midſt all our foes we're ſtill ſecure.</l>
            <p>This ended, he lay ſtill a while with his cheeks all bathed in
tears; then gently raiſing himſelf, opened his arms to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
her whom his fancie repreſented to him in the chief
perfection of her beauty; but after he had recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61061:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
finding he embraced nothing but empty air, and that
it was only a meer illuſion, he burſt out agen into theſe bitter
exclamations.</p>
            <p>Oh ye divine Powers! is the wretched <hi>Alexandro</hi> at length
become your ſport, that you thus delude his miſeries with vain
imaginations? Either direct me to a real fruition of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
or elſe in compaſſion free me from this languiſhing life,
and armed with all your thunder at once deſtroy me in an
inſtant.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words proceeded from him with ſuch a vehement
ſhril voice, that <hi>Ervillius</hi> being wakened therewith, though
with ſome difficulty, by reaſon of his wounds, riſe to comfort
him. But when he came to the bed-ſide, and ſaw ſuch a ſtrange
alteration in his countenance, that he was ſcarcely to be known;
his eyes, at ſo ſad an object, overſlowing with tears, Oh Prince,
ſaid he, will you thus by an obſtinate perſeverance in your
griefs, deſtroy both your ſelf, and all your hopes? Can the
vertue of <hi>Alexandro</hi> ſo much fail as to doubt of the protection
of the Gods, who ſo lately defended him from the fury of his
enemies? Are not thoſe bands and ſwathes teſtimonies againſt
you of the care they have of your preſervation? And your
heart, if it be not at defiance with heaven, muſt it not needs
confeſs it was providence guided the ſword which made this
wound in your arm, that otherwiſe might with more eaſe have
cleſt that aſunder.</p>
            <p>Alas my dear <hi>Ervillius,</hi> replied the Prince, how cunningly
doeſt thou argee, to render me impious againſt thoſe Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which thou thinkſt I do not with reverence enough
adore?</p>
            <p>The Gods lay afflictions upon men, to make them ſenſible
of their diſpleaſure; and if they ſlight their puniſhments, think
they contemn their power.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt been a conſtant witneſs of all my ſufferings; and
if thou canſt not deny they are beyond all examples of formes
ages, thou muſt needs confeſs my griefs ought to be ſo too, or
elſe they come ſhort of that ſenſe which in pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty I ought to
have of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61061:21"/>
But ſuppoſe my complaints have hitherto exceeded a mean,
there are no expreſſions anſwerable to the preſent pangs I
endure.</p>
            <p>The divine <hi>Theophania,</hi> through a charitable commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my ſufferings, came herſelf to encourage me to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fortitude, and on a ſudden ſhe was raviſhed agen out of
my ſight.</p>
            <p>I ſaw her here before me, ſhe ſpoke to me, ſhe directed me
what I was to do, and with her heavenly voice raiſed my ſoul
into ſuch an extaſie of joy, that I forgot all my former ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but by the deprivation of that bleſſed object am now
become far more miſerable then ever.</p>
            <p>Whereupon ſighs ſtoping his ſpeech, after he had lain a
good while ſilent, at length a torrent of tears iſſuing from his
eyes, he remained ſuch a ſpectacle of ſorrow, as would have
moved the moſt obdurate heart to pitty his condition; much
more the gentle <hi>Ervillius</hi> who participated ſo much of his
grief: For, all his former paſſionate tranſportations, to him,
that was acquainted with them, ſeemed only the effects of
an afflicted mind; but this was ſo tranſcendent, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
little leſs then the extravagancie of a broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed
underſtanding. Wherefore caſting a pittifull regard
upon him, and lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, as if at
the ſame inſtant his heart had broke, ſunk down breathleſs
upon the bed. Which the Prince perceiving, and that the life
ſo precious to him was ready to expire, he recollected himſelf
from that profound trance, and endeavoured to give him all
the aſſiſtance that he could; which doubtleſs had proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vain, if immediately thereupon <hi>Caſsianus,</hi> thinking
it time to open their wounds, had not by chance entred into
the chamber.</p>
            <p>But he was not a little ſurpriſed to find them in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
Nevertheleſs preſently calling the attendants to aſſiſt
him, he laid <hi>Ervillius</hi> agen upon his own bed, and giving him
a little Cordial, which he ever had ready for all occaſions,
ſoon brought him to himſelf agen; and then whilſt he had a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61061:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
little recovered his ſpirits, approaching to the Prince, by the
motion of his pulſe, conceived him to be poſſeſſed with a high
feaver; but by that time he had dreſſed his wounds, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thereof was ſo much abated, that it appeared plainly to
have proceeded from ſome other cauſe; wherefore without
difficulty he permitted him, having thrown a night-gown over
his ſhoulders, to riſe, whilſt <hi>Ervillius</hi> wound was opened,
which he preſently aſſured him was not at all dangerous in it
ſelf, though his feaver through ſome ill accident were a little
increaſed. Which was ſuch pleaſing news to <hi>Alexandro,</hi> that
he returned to his bed with ſo much ſatisfaction, that if <hi>Syneſius</hi>
and <hi>Lyſander</hi> thinking it their duty, had not come to viſit him,
he might perhaps have refreſhed himſelf with a little reſt, after
thoſe violent agitations which he had ſuffered in the night.
But the preſence of that perſon from whom he had received ſo
late an obligation was ſo grateful to him, that for the preſent
he was diverted from all other thoughts, but how to make an
acknowledgment equal to the benefit he had received.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who though he ſurpaſſed all
men in a general knowledge, and was likewiſe a moſt perfect
Cavalier, yet in this encounter he was ſtrucken with ſuch an
awe, that he could neither conceive expreſſions ſuitable, as he
thought, to the perſon to whom they were to be addreſſed, nor
yet expreſs thoſe conceptions which his heart prompted him
to utter. Wherefore with great reſpect approaching to the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
as <hi>Alexandro</hi> put forth his arms to embrace him, he with
wonderful ſubmiſſion kiſſed his hand; and then having fixed
his eyes upon him ſaid, Sir, in beholding you methinks I ſee
ſomthing ſo far above me, that I am almoſt ready to pay you
the ſame reverence that I would pay the Gods; but then I
confeſs there is ſomething in your countenance ſo familiar to
my knowledge, that it inwardly checks thoſe inclinations:
Yet not being able to make any certain conjecture, when I
conſider your courage, and beauty, the rays of majeſty that
encompaſs you, and the actions which I have ſeen you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
my Genius gives me an aſſurance that you have divinity
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61061:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about your perſon, and ſayes, <hi>Syneſius,</hi> thy life and fortunes
are all too little to ſacrifice to his ſervice whom thou haſt now
the honour to harbor in thy houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexandro</hi> ſtarting a little at that name, with a modeſt bluſh
replied, Noble <hi>Syneſius,</hi> if I were happy in the leaſt of thoſe
perfections which you are pleaſed to attribute to me, I ſhould
perchance think the life you have preſerved a fit Preſent for a
perſon to whom I ſtand engaged upon ſo great an accompt:
however I ſhall never fail in a due acknowledgment of thoſe
courteſies I have received from you, and hope you will never
find a cauſe to repent that you have placed them upon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
a ſubject.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Caſsianus,</hi> who whilſt they were in diſcourſe
had ſlipt out of the room to give a viſit to Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
came ſmiling to <hi>Alexandro,</hi> and ſaid, Sir, by what I had heard
before I admired your valour, but now by experience I muſt
applaud your skill in my own art, and, which thoſe of our
profeſſion ſeldom do, yield to you as a much better Phyſitian
then my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Prince not conceiving what he meant, with a pleaſed
countenance anſwered, that he was as far from knowing any
ſuch good quality in himſelf, as from avowing the other. It
may be ſo, Sir, replied <hi>Caſsianus;</hi> yet for ought I can perceive,
notwithſtanding the report theſe Gentlemen have made of
your actions, you may with more eaſe recover a thouſand men
that are ſick to their health, then kill one of your enemies;
for that I evidently ſee is not without ſome expence of your
own blood, but the mention of you only I find works mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
cures.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Prince deſiring him to explain his meaning,
he began in a more ſerious manner to tell him, that a ſtranger
who through many ſufferings at ſea had been ſeiſed with ſuch
a violent feaver, that he believed many days muſt have paſſed
before it was poſſible he ſhould have been able to quit his bed,
at the relation which <hi>Lyſander</hi> had made of his magnanimous
actions, was tranſported with ſuch a paſſion to ſee the perſon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61061:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that was maſter of ſo much vertue, that having quite forgoten
his diſeaſe, no perſwaſions almoſt could detein him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have the honour to kiſs his hands; and though he could
not truly ſay it was very ſafe for him to go out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
yet he abſolutely was of opinion that it was far leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then to debar him of a thing which with ſuch ardencie
he deſired.</p>
            <p>Oh ſaid <hi>Alexandro,</hi> ſmiling, I perceive it is not any thing in
me, but <hi>Lyſander</hi> who hath wrought the miracle; and indeed
it is little Ieſs then a miracle, that ſo mean a ſubject ſhould
furniſh matter for a diſcourſe of ſuch advantage to the author:
but ſince his eloquence is ſo powerfull, I could wiſh it were
employed amongſt my enemies, for by the effects I eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it would avail me more then an Army; and it is much
more glorious by the force of words only to conquer mens
affections; then by the ſword and violence to triumph over
their wils.</p>
            <p>Sir, replied <hi>Lyſander,</hi> my life is an unworthy offering with
devotion dedicated to your ſervice; and though I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of my own defects, yet I very well know that to a good
ſubject Eloquence is as neceſſary a conſequence, as harmony
from an excellent Lute well tuned, though touched by an
ordinary maſter: Nevertheleſs as thoſe who have not a muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ear are not affected with the ſound thereof, no more can
any but generous ſpirits be tranſported with the relation of
heroical actions.</p>
            <p>But the admirable ſympathic which we ſee between two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
ſet to the ſame note, that if you touch the ſtrings of
the one, the others will apparently move, the ſame is naturally
between vertuous minds.</p>
            <p>Your ſelves therefore contain within your ſelves the cauſe
of this wonder; and if either reſiſt thoſe motions which invite
to a mutual band of amity betwixt you, that party muſt needs
confeſs he enclines to a diſcord, and for the preſent doth a
little fail of his vertue; which defect I dare not ſuppoſe on
your ſide, in whoſe every part there is ſuch a perfect harmony
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61061:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the reſt; and of the other you have heard with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
he runs to your embraces.</p>
            <p>Neglect not then the proffered friendſhip of a ſtranger,
which I will preſume to ſay, if you knew ſome paſſages
of his life, you would eſteem worthy of your acceptance; and
though he that ſaith ſo hath a neer relation to him, yet he is
ſo far from flattery, that he dares avow even to your ſelf,
that he no leſs boaſts that relation, then he admires your
vertue.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken, <hi>Alexandro</hi> made only this anſwer;
That being bred a Souldier, he was ſo unaccuſtomed to ſuch
Courtſhips, that he knew not what reply to make to his civil
expreſſions; and though he had many imperfections, yet to
ſhew how ready he was to embrace the friendſhip of vertuous
perſons, he would preſently prepare himſelf, if he might be
permitted, to give his friend a viſit. To which <hi>Syneſius</hi> and
<hi>Lyſander,</hi> knowing with what impatience the Prince deſired to
ſee him, and that it would be dangerous for him to expoſe
himſelf to the air, though unwillingly, ſeemed to conſent;
and whilſt he put on his cloaths, withdrawing themſelves to
<hi>Ervillius</hi> his bed, gave him a kind of particular viſit; and
<hi>Caſsianus,</hi> to prevent <hi>Demetrius</hi> leſt he ſhould riſe, went to
entertain him in the mean while with diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexandro,</hi> who uſed little curioſity in adorning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
made them not attend long; for being inſtantly ready,
he put only a ſcarf about his neck to ſupport his arm, and
deſired they would conduct him to the ſtrangers lodging;
who as they entred into the chamber, notwithſtanding all the
reſiſtance <hi>Caſsianus</hi> could make, would have riſen out of his
bed; yet perceiving company enter, he lay down agen: But
when he ſaw <hi>Alexandro,</hi> who preſently went to embrace him,
inſtead of returning that civility, all his ſenſes were on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſeiſed with ſo ſtrange a ſtupidity, that falling backwards
upon his pillow, he fixed his eyes upon him with ſuch a ghaſtly
countenance, that they all thought he was at the ſame inſtant
yielding up the ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61061:23"/>
Whereupon the Prince, turning about to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> cryed
out, Is this ſympathie, that produces ſuch horried effects!
Oh <hi>Lyſander,</hi> now confeſs thy error; and that he whom thou
wouldſt have flattered into a belief that he was more then man,
is the vileſt of all creatures, that only by his preſence hath
brought this direful calamity upon thy friend.</p>
            <p>But whilſt he was ſpeaking, <hi>Demetrius</hi> by degrees began to
move his eyes; and raiſing his body, cryed out, Oh let me
for ever gaze upon that glorious object! Some heavenly
Deity in commiſeration of the languiſhing <hi>Demetrius</hi> hath
aſſumed that form, to reſtore him to a perfect happineſs.
When <hi>Alexandro</hi> once more approaching towards him, before
he could ſpeak, he proceeded; Diſdain not, divine creature,
a ſacrifice of that heart which hath been ſo long devoted to
thy ſervice: Thy preſence hath infuſed into me a new ſoul,
and I already feel ſuch an overflowing joy, that one pleaſing
look will enable me not only to overcome this trivial ſicknes,
but to vanquiſh even death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexandro</hi> was ſo far from ſhewing any content in his
looks, that on the contrary finding what <hi>Lyſander</hi> had ſaid
too true, he had ſuch a ſympathie with him in his ſufferings,
that his cheeks were all b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dewed with tears, to ſee ſo gallant a
Youth ſo miſerably oppreſſed, as he conceived, with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of his diſeaſe, believing all thoſe ſtrange expreſſions to
be the extravagant ravings of a mortal feaver.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs deſiring to pacifie him a little, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he could not forbear to reply, Sir, whatſoever repreſents it
ſelf to your imagination, I ſuppoſe you do not know me; for
till this hour to my remembrance I never had the happineſs to
ſee you, if it may be called a happineſs to ſee one whom I have
ſuch ſtrong inclinations to ſerve in ſo ill a condition.</p>
            <p>An ill condition, ſaid <hi>Demetrius,</hi> when I hear ſuch pleaſing
language from (the divine <hi>Mariana,</hi> he was about to ſay, but
recollecting himſelf a little, after a ſhort pauſe he continued)
one whoſe very ſhape I am ready to adore, and whoſe vertue,
by the relation I had heard of his glorious exploits, before I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61061:24"/>
had the honour to ſee him, I admired, though now I do not
at all wonder you ſhould with your ſword vanquiſh a few bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Aſſaſſins; for you ſtrangely reſemble, if you are not
the ſame, a perſon, whoſe leaſt regards are capable to ſubdue
and triumph over whole Nations.</p>
            <p>There was ſtill ſuch a confuſion in his ſpeech, but withall
ſuch a connexion, that <hi>Alexandro</hi> nor the reſt could not tell
what judgment to make thereof, yet finding him much more
compoſed, he began to comfort him in this manner.</p>
            <p>Noble Knight, I believe ſome providence hath directed
me to this place, where I have met a Cavalier of ſuch generous
ſentiments; and though there be nothing really in me worthy
of your eſteem, yet if I bear any reſemblance that may render
my ſervice gratefull to you, I ſhall eſteem this a moſt happy
encounter; for you ſeem endued with all thoſe perfections of
a man, to whom I would willingly and with ambition give
the name of Friend.</p>
            <p>I take you at your word, replied <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not your courteous offers, as ordinary civilities that you
paſs indifferently upon all, which I will not imagine, let me
embrace that perſon whoſe friendſhip I would have purchaſed
with my deareſt blood.</p>
            <p>Whereupon they flew into each others arms with ſuch a
mutual concurrence of affection, that they ſeemed to breath
their ſouls into each other boſoms. At which ſight the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by were moved with ſuch a tenderneſs, that they could not
refrain from tears; and the two Princes glorying in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions
of their ſeveral vertues, by the cheerfulneſs of their
countenances declared the inward content of their minds.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs on both ſides there was ſomething wanting to
accompliſh their felicity. The one, though his new friend
ſpake the language perfectly, yet perceiving him to be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and by all appearances of eminent condition, infinitely
deſired to be perfectly informed both of his birth and country.
And the other, the more he conſidered, the more ſtill fancying
within himſelf a reſemblance to his ſouls Idol, the beautiful
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61061:24"/>
               <hi>Mariana,</hi> could not longer have concealed his paſſion to know
more particularly the owner of thoſe rare perfections, if <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandro</hi>
preventing him, upon a ſign <hi>Caſsianus</hi> made, leſt his
ſpirits ſhould ſuffer too much agitation, had not at the ſame
inſtant began to take his leave of him for the preſent: But as
he was going away, by chance ſaying, that there was nothing
he deſired more then a confirmation of their friendſhip by a
better acquaintance; <hi>Demetrius</hi> taking hold thereof, and
thinking it would conduce to his own ſatisfaction in the ſame
kind, replied, That though his life afforded nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or worthy of his knowledg, yet he would willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him not only with every particular paſſage thereof, but
even with the moſt ſecret thoughts of his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexandro</hi> anſwered, Though he meant not then to have
made
that requeſt, yet he embraced his offer as an exceeding
obligation; and that when the Doctor ſhould think it might
be without prejudice of his health, he would challenge him of
his promiſe.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Caſsianus</hi> interpoſing, earneſtly deſired he
would finiſh the three dayes with repoſe, before he ſtrained
himſelf too much either with diſcourſe, or any other motion:
Which being ſeconded by the entreaties of <hi>Alexandro,</hi> he
promiſed that though he was then aſſured of his health, and
that nothing could endanger it more then ſuch a confinement
from his preſence, yet to ſhew an abſolute obedience to his
will, he would for the preſent ſubmit to the Phyſitians: And
to make the way more clear to compaſs his own deſires, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it would put him to the bluſh to recount things ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
of himſelf, deſired whilſt he was under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
that he would take the relation from <hi>Lyſander.</hi> Which
being agreed to on all ſides, after a multitude of embraces,
and infinite proteſtations of an eternal friendſhip, <hi>Alexandro</hi>
attended by <hi>Syneſius</hi> and the reſt, retired agen to his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partement,
where they found <hi>Ervillius,</hi> having in their abſence
taken a little reſt, in an apparent diſpoſition of amendment.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> being thus left to himſelf, his fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61061:25"/>
to work upon a thouſand ſeveral imaginations; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
taking the Tablet out of his boſom, when he had
opened it, conſidering the ſeveral parts of that viſage which
was then before him, and calling to mind thoſe of <hi>Alexandro</hi>'s
after a ſtrict ſurvey of every lineament and feature, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and proportion, he could obſerve no other difference,
but that the hair was not ſo perfectly black, the ſymetry of
the face not altogether ſo round, and the eyes, though of
equal majeſty, more inclined to ſweetneſs; yet ſuch an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
reſemblance in every part, that what he thought ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the one, he admired as excellent in the other.</p>
            <p>The one was the object of his affection, the other of his
emulation; to the one he dedicated a pure flame of chaſte
love, to the other a loyal breaſt full of friendly inclinations,
and to both an entire ſubmiſſion of his heart, where they
reigned as victorious conquerors over all the faculties of his
ſoul, yet their ſeveral Empires cauſing no civil diſſentions in
his breaſt.</p>
            <p>On the contrary he enjoyed ſuch an abſolute peace of mind
for the preſent, that through the tranſportations thereof he
fell into a gentle repoſe, which ſo refreſhed his ſpirits, that
<hi>Alexandro</hi> proved indeed the Phyſitian which reſtored him to
his perfect health.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Syneſius</hi> having commanded dinner to
be prepared, cauſed <hi>Alexandro</hi> to be ſerved alone in his Ante-chamber,
yet he forced him by many entreaties to ſit with
him, whilſt <hi>Lyſander,</hi> impatient to know his Princes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
after the late interview, returned agen to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partement.</p>
            <p>There paſſed not much diſcourſe between them at that time
by reaſon of the attendants; but dinner being ended, they
deſcended into the garden, where to avoid the heat, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into a ſquare arched room, ſupported with marble pillars,
and curiouſly paved with moſaicque work, built on purpoſe
for coolneſs at the end of a large Canal, in the midſt whereof
was a Fountain that by an artificial conveyance caſt forth an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61061:25"/>
abundance of water like ſmall rain, and cauſed a pleaſing
freſhneſs in the air, which rendred the place exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
even when the ſun was at the higheſt.</p>
            <p>But before they were entred into any ſerious talk, <hi>Lyſander</hi>
came to them with news that his Prince was fallen into ſuch a
ſound ſleep, that he thought it was impoſſible to wake him.
At which <hi>Alexandro</hi> and <hi>Syneſius</hi> having expreſſed a great
content, they deſired him then, ſince the time and place were
ſo convenient, to diſcharge the injunction that was laid upon
him by <hi>Demetrius</hi> to communicate to them the paſſages of
his life; which knowing he ought not to refuſe, being ſeated,
he began in this manner.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Continuation of the Story of Prince
DEMETRIUS.</head>
               <p>YEſterday by the command of the noble <hi>Syneſius</hi> I was
entred into this diſcourſe, when we were by a ſudden
accident interrupted; but not ſo far advanced therein,
that I ſhall need to make any repetition; only I muſt renew
my requeſt, That the perſon whoſe actions I am to relate may
not ſuffer through my want of expreſſions; for though I am
able to give a faithful account of every particular paſſage, yet
I cannot ſet them off with that advantage of language which
ſhould give them their proper luſtre. However, not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
too much with an apologie, I ſhall without farther cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
proceed.</p>
               <p>The Grecian Emperors having either by conqueſt or alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
gotten the poſſeſſion of many large and ſpacious domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
truſting in the vaſtneſs of their own power, ſo miſerably
oppreſſed their ſubjects with taxes and inſupportable burthens,
that they grew weary of their yoke: But above all, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabiting the Iſlands and Provinces bordering upon the
ſea, though they were not ſubdued by the ſword, but by a
marriage with the rightful Princeſs thereof annexed to the
Imperial crown, ſuffered ſuch violation both of their laws
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61061:26"/>
and liberties, that being no longer able to ſupport that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
government, by a general conſent they reſolved to
free themſelves from ſo cruel a ſlavery; and having addreſſed
their complaints to the renowned <hi>Polidor</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaia,</hi>
choſe him for their General, who in compaſſion undertaking
their protection, by his great valour and wiſdom not only
delivered them from their oppreſſions, but eſtabliſhed them a
free State, which in ſhort time grew ſo mighty, that it ſtood
upon equal terms of defiance with the Emperor himſelf, and
grew even a terror to all the neighbouring Nations. Which
great ſucceſſes rendred <hi>Polidor</hi> ſo beloved and popular, that
the people were ready to deliver up agen into his hands that
liberty, which with ſuch eagerneſs they had purſued; and
though he had not the title of King, he enjoyed in effect all
the prerogatives and priviledges of Soveraignty. Beſides, to
ſhew their gratitude, in caſe he ſhould dye, they declared his
young ſon <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Prince my maſter, then an Infant,
their General.</p>
               <p>Thus being in his cradle deſtined to the war, his Genius
ſo ſuited to his deſtiny, that in his childhood his only paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were martial exerciſes; and when he had attained to the
age of fourteen years, he always accompanied the Prince his
father in the Army, where not withſtanding the care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that was nſed to prevent him, he would many times go
out upon occaſions, and performed actions ſo far above his
years, that they were the admiration of thoſe that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him.</p>
               <p>But leſt this forwardneſs ſhould at ſome time or other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
him too far, the Prince, though he would not abſolutely
check his inclinations, thought fit to place ſome one of truſt
about his perſon that might have a care of his preſervation;
and though I was not then above nineteen years of age, he
was pleaſed to repoſe that confidence in me, believing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that being of noble birth, and not very much elder then
himſelf, I might the eaſilier gain upon his affections as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and by that means have a power to perſwade him to
any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61061:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Neither was the Prince deceived in his opinion: For I
knew ſo well upon all occaſions to manage his humour, that
in a ſhort time I was ſo much in his eſteem, that he would do
nothing either of recreation, or ſerious without me, but I
could when I pleaſed with as much eaſe divert him from any
raſh deſign, as he was apt of himſelf to engage in any action
of honour; and I have been ſo happy, that as he grew in
years, the affection which he bore me then hath ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
inſomuch that I have not only been privy to all the
actions of his life, but I believe very few of his thoughts have
been concealed from me.</p>
               <p>Two Summers paſſed in this manner, during which time he
performed many gallant exploits upon the enemy, ſometimes
as a private perſon, and ſometimes as chief of a conſiderable
party. But the third Prince <hi>Polidor</hi> thinking it time to make
the early vertue of his ſon known to the world, entruſted him
with the command of an Army deſigned for the aſſiſtance of
<hi>Philocles</hi> Prince of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> by the Emperor diſpoſſeſſed of his
Country: And though <hi>Philocles</hi> main Army, through a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
haſte to fight, were unfortunately defeated before
<hi>Demetrius</hi> could come to joyn with him, and himſelf forced
to flie for ſafety, <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> his brother, againſt whoſe advice
he had engaged, having rallied about a thouſand horſe of the
ſcattered Troops, before the Enemy was aware paſſed a river,
and by diligent marching came ſafe to our Army, bringing
himſelf the firſt certain news of his brothers defeat.</p>
               <p>This ſtoped <hi>Demetrius</hi> intended courſe, and made him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
enter into councel what new deſign to go upon.
Some would have continued their march to find out the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
army and to give them battel; but that was thought
vain, becauſe we were far inferior in number, and the Emperor
by his late victory having cleered thoſe parts, was marched
to joyn in perſon with thoſe Forces that were already ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others propoſed to take that advantage to make an inroad
into <hi>Philocles</hi> Country, and to ſeiſe upon ſome ſtrong places
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61061:27"/>
there: But that was rejected, becauſe if they ſhould take any,
they could not ſpare Forces to man them, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
they would preſently be loſt again.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Demetrius</hi> having with attention heard all, ſaid, No,
let us neither follow an Enemy that marches away from us,
nor loſe time in taking of places that cannot be kept. The
Emperor not ſuppoſing we have an army conſiderable enough
to annoy his dominions, is gone towards the borders to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the invaſion of the <hi>Perſians</hi> by an invaſive war; ſo that
the way lies open before us even to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the chief
City of the Empire; which though perhaps we ſhall not take,
yet the attempt is glorious, and it is more honor to ſtrike a
terror into the heart, then to wound any other member.</p>
               <p>This propoſition was generally applauded, not only as the
gallanteſt, but as the wiſeſt thing that could be undertaken.
Wherefore the whole Army, which conſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted not of above
twenty thouſand men, the word being given, immediately
faced about, and by the encouragement of the General made
ſuch long marches, that in a ſhort time, almoſt as ſoon as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
could be given of their approach, they were before the
wals of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If nothing were more attempted, <hi>Demetrius</hi> had already
obtained his end; for his approach ſtruck ſuch a general ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
not only into the inhabitants, but even amongſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
alſo, that they were ready to abandon the City, the
Commanders with much difficulty perſwading them to make
any defence; neither had they been able to prevail over them,
if <hi>Theodoſia</hi> the Empreſs with her daughters had not gon from
place to place themſelves, to ſee the Ports ſecured. Where
they ſaw any forwardneſs, animating them to the defence of
their capital City, her ſelf and Children, who were committed
to their truſt; and above all of their own honours, which
would ſuffer with perpetual infamy, if the ſight only of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Enemy ſhould make them abandon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
their Emperor, who was then hazarding his life for their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>leties, the dear pledges of his ſoul his Children, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61061:27"/>
Temples of the Gods to a certain deſtruction. On the other
ſide, where they found any neglect, reproaching their vile
cowardiſe; That if they were not corrupted by the Enemy,
they could not ſo baſely betray the whole Nation; and that
if they had but ſo much the hearts of men as to ſhew themſelvs
only, the very ſight of their numbers would gain the victory:
But ſince the Gods had deprived the Emperor of his ſon, they
did well to deliver up his daughters to the mercy of ſtrangers;
for even women would diſdain the ſubjection of ſo puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a people, and that it was far more honour for them to
live in perpetual ſlavery, then to have the dominion of ſuch
treacherous ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like ſpeeches ſo wrought upon them, that
partly through ſhame, partly through a ſenſe of honour, they
began to ſtand to their arms, and things being now in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
poſture of defence, ſhe retired with her daughters to
the Palace, where, beſides the ordinary guards, all the chief
Cavaliers and young Noblemen of the City aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for their defence.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not unmindful of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
That he was too far engaged in the Enemies country
to make any long ſtay, having ſo ſmall a force, leſt the paſſage
for his retreat ſhould be cut off; beſides the allarum being
once given, the Emperor with his whole power would come
upon him. But perceiving no Sallies to be made out of the
City, imagining the true cauſe thereof, that his ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
had ſtruck them with a panick fear, being informed
by <hi>Emilius</hi> a principal Officer, who the year before had been
priſoner in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of the ſcituation of the place, with
the ſeveral advenues and approaches, and that the Palace was
a ſpacious building by it ſelf, on the one ſide compaſſed in by
the Sea, on the other ſeparated from the City with ſtrong
wals and towers, and that part which lay expoſed to the
Campagne very well fortified in the ſame manner; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
agreed ſo in all points with the ſeveral Planes he had
ſeen, that imagining he knew enough thereof, a little before
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61061:28"/>
Sun-ſet calling me to him, he ſaid, Now, <hi>Lyſander,</hi> is the time
to make a trial of our valour, and either to dye gloriouſly, or
to live with eternal fame.</p>
               <p>Whereupon communicating to me his whole deſign, I
thought it an undertaking, though of wonderful hazard, yet
nothing impoſſible; and withall of ſuch infinite honour, that
I could not but applaud the generoſity of his reſolution.</p>
               <p>Wherefore giving preſently order that the Souldiers ſhould
refreſh themſelves, and repoſe till midnight, he divided the
Army into two bodies, the one under the command of <hi>Hyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpes,</hi>
and the other of <hi>Telamon</hi> his Lieutenant-General, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
them at that houre, having left ſome horſe to guard
the baggage, to aſſault the City in two ſeveral places at once;
and reſerved to himſelf, for a particular ſervice, only a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſelected men, that were the eldeſt and moſt experienced
Souldiers, which <hi>Emilius</hi> and my ſelf choſe out of the whole
Army.</p>
               <p>Things thus diſpoſed, he rid out himſelf with a ſmall party
of horſe to view the wals; and being returned, commanding
<hi>Emilius</hi> and me to draw out thoſe thouſand reſerved men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
coming to the head of them, made a ſhort ſpeech to this
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fellow-ſouldiers, I have from my infancie been bred among
you, being in my cradle deſtined to be your General; and to
ſhew my ſelf worthy of ſo great an honour, I would do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy of that birth which advanced me to it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
amongſt thouſands of others I have made choice of your
tryed valour to aſſiſt me in an enterpriſe, which is not more
full of danger then of glory, in which we will be all equal
ſharers, and if you ſtand firm to me, both vanquiſh the one,
and triumph with the other.</p>
               <p>Remember only that when I lead you on, I commit my
honour into your hands: therefore whoſoever is not a friend
to <hi>Demetrius</hi> honour, let him with leave depart; and to thoſe
who undertake the protection of that, <hi>Demetrius</hi> here in the
preſence of the Gods dedicates both his life and fortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61061:28"/>
There was none ſo meanly ſpirited as to relinquiſh his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in a perſonal occaſion; but all cried out with one voice,
<hi>Demetrius honour is his Souldiers glory.</hi> Wherefore having
thanked them for their forwardneſs, he preſently divided them
into two bodies, and giving the conduct of the one to <hi>Emilius,</hi>
led the other himſelf, commanding me, as I always did, to
accompany him.</p>
               <p>The night being very dark, was exceeding favorable to our
deſign; for by the help thereof, marching with a wonderful
ſilence, we paſſed quite beyond the City till we came under
the Palace-wals without being diſcovered by any of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels,
and lay cloſe there for almoſt the ſpace of an hour under
the covert of a thick Wood; but the time being come that the
aſſault was to be given, by reaſon of the ſilence of the night,
we plainly heard the beating of the drums, accompanied with
a great ſhout, by which we knew our men were engaged, who
on both ſides made a furious onſet; and though <hi>Telamon's</hi>
after a fierce conteſtation were at length repulſed, <hi>Hydaſpes</hi>
ſhewed ſuch an example of courage to his men, with a pike in
his hand, himſelf firſt mounting upon the ladders, that being
ſeconded by <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Druſilius,</hi> two eminent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
they forced the Enemy with great ſlaughter to retire,
and poſſeſſed themſelves of one of the Towers; which being
ſecured, they advanced, notwithſtanding all reſiſtance, to the
gate, and having killed moſt of the guards, letting fall the
bridge, made an eaſie entrance for <hi>Telamon</hi> with all his
Forces.</p>
               <p>This gave ſo hot an allarum, a general cry runing through
the City, that all was loſt; that the Cavaliers who were in
the Palace thinking all ſecure on that ſide, leaving none there
but the guards, haſted to the place from whence the chief al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum
came, and ſo encouraged the Souldiers, that they ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
their forces, and began to make a ſtrong reſiſtance; but
by reaſon of the darkneſs not diſtinguiſhing enemies from
friends, miſerably ſlew and oppreſſed one another: And there
was now ſuch a confuſed cry in the City, that <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61061:29"/>
thought the time no longer to be delayed; but having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his men to put their ſhirts above their arms, himſelf
and the Officers wearing white ſcarfs, they began to faſten the
ladders in ſeveral places, which could not be ſo done, but the
Sentinels took an allarum; nevertheleſs <hi>Demetrius</hi> covering
himſelf with his ſhield, went on firſt himſelf to the aſſault, and
was followed with ſuch an unanimous conſent of the ſouldiers,
that we were upon the wals almoſt as ſoon as the enemy; yet
there we encountred ſo ſtrong an oppoſition, that our men
began to fall back: whereupon the Prince crying out to them,
Will you thus betray the honour committed to your truſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
remembring their promiſe, they were animated with ſuch a
courage, that they not only poſſeſſed themſelves of the walls,
but forced the Imperialiſts to retreat, yet in ſo good order, that
if <hi>Demetrius</hi> had not performed actions above the ſtrength of
man, we had all certainly periſhed; but he made ſuch way
with his ſword, killing all about him which made any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that we advanced into a large open place, where our men
had room to exerciſe their valour, which was ſo well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that divers caſting down their weapons cryed out for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the reſt paid the forfeiture of their obſtinacie with their
lives; inſomuch that having ſeiſed upon the gates, eſpecially
thoſe towards the Sea, and placed ſtrong guards about them,
we became abſolute maſters of the Palace.</p>
               <p>This attempt was ſo unexpected, and the execution ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that the Empreſs, by the information that was given her
on all ſides, finding into what a ſtraight ſhe was reduced, and
to eſcape impoſſible, ſhe took a reſolution ſuitable to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſo great a Princeſs; every thing, as we heard ſince by
certain priſoners, being ordered by her directions: For not to
ſhew any apprehenſion of danger, having commanded all the
gates and doors that led to her appartement, to be ſet wide
open, ſhe prepared to entertain her ſufferings, or if the worſt
ſhould happen, even death it ſelf, with as much majeſty and
glory, as if ſhe had been to receive the Emperor returning tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
with all the ſpoils of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61061:29"/>
On the other ſide <hi>Demetrius,</hi> having ſecured the Ports,
though he intended no violence, meant to ſhew himſelf as a
Conqueror: Therefore giving a ſtrict command that none
upon pain of death ſhould follow him ſave <hi>Emilius</hi> and my
ſelf, with two Gentlemen more, he went preſently towards the
Empreſs quarter, whither he was directed by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of lights that appeared both before the gate, and in the
windows of the Palace, and approaching neerer we found a
guard of Halbardiers, every one with a great white Torch
lighted in his hand, who at firſt we expected would have
made ſome reſiſtance, but they were ſo far from offering any
violence, that neither uſing motion nor ſpeech, they ſtood
orderly in two ranks from the entry of the gate, through a
great hall, and ſo up the ſtairs into another room, as if they
had been liveleſs Statues.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs ſeeing ſo many armed men, and yet ſuch an
open paſſage, the Prince made a little ſtop, as thinking ſome
treachery might be intended: But then ſuppoſing they durſt
not attempt any ſuch thing, or elſe having a courage above
all fear, he paſſed through them into the hall, which was a
ſpacious arched room, ſupported with two rows of pillars of
white marble, with the walls and pavement of the ſame; then
aſcending a large ſtair, which was likewiſe of white marble,
with a rail and balluſter of Porphyrie, adorned at the bottom
with two Lyons, and on the top with two figures repreſenting
Juſtice and Fortitude, we entred into another great Hall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Statues round about it in niches, the reſt embelliſh'd
with marbles of ſeveral colours curiouſly carved with a large
border of Frutage, and the Roof richly gilt and emboſſed.
Then having the Guards ſtill on each hand of us to the next
room, for they reached no further, we paſſed through another
paved with Moſaique work, and adorned with the pictures of
all the Grecian Emperors, drawn by the moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of their ſeveral times, in which were divers Pages and
Attendants, who ſeeming to take no notice of us, we went on
into another room that was hanged with Tapeſtry, beſides
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61061:30"/>
the rarity of the workmanſhip richly ſet off with gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which by the reflection of the lights appeared in great
abundance. At the upper end, under a State of wonderful rich
Embroidery, ſtood a Chair upon an aſcent covered with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
Carpets; and upon ſeats that were placed round about
the wals, ſate divers perſons of ſeveral ages, by ther habits and
preſence appearing to be the moſt eminent Councellors or
Officers of the Empire; and thoſe which ſate uppermoſt,
being very aged, with long beards as white as ſnow, bore
ſuch a reverend aſpect, that if their ſad dejected countenances
had not ſhewed them ſubject to humane paſſions, they would
have appeared more then mortal. Yet ſeeing them remain
without motion, not ſo much as caſting an eye upon us, in ſo
profound a ſilence, I could not, for my part, but call to mind
the ſtrange ſtories of enchanted Caſtles which we read of in
Romances.</p>
               <p>But as we advanced further, our wonder ſtill encreaſed;
for the next Room that lay open before us, was ſo richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
that it ſeemed the wealth of a whole Nation amaſſed
together in that place; and the company was ſuitable to the
richneſs of the furniture; An aſſembly of Ladies of ſuch rare
beauty, and withall ſo gloriouſly apparelled and adorned with
jewels, that the whole world could not afford the like ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
though the riches and ſtate of that Court made it uſual
there. And this diſorder happening before they were retired
to their reſt, they were not deveſted of thoſe ornaments.
Nevertheleſs there was ſuch a ſilent ſadneſs amongſt them,
as at once repreſented to our conſiderations, in the pride of
thoſe luxuries, the glory of all earthly happineſs, and the
uncertain content thoſe glories afford our minds.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the Prince ſeiſed with a kind of admiration,
turning the point of his ſword to the ground, made a little
ſtand, looking about to whom he ſhould addreſs himſelf;
but perceiving that none of them would vouchſafe ſo much as
the leaſt regard, ſeeing yet another door open, he boldly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tept in.</p>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61061:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But if before he were ſeiſed with admiration, he was now
in an inſtant ſtruck with an aſtoniſhment: If before he ſaw
none but dejected countenances that ſeemed to ſubmit to him
as a Conqueror, he now beheld ſuch tranſcendent beauties,
armed with ſo magnanimous a fortitude, that himſelf was
ready to fall proſtrate at their feet, to crave the pardon of his
bold intruſion: For at the upper end of the room, from the
ceeling whereof hung about forty Branches of Chryſtal with
white Tap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, upon an aſcent of ſome half a dozen ſteps ſate
the Empreſs alone under a State, with an Imperial Crown
placed by her upon a Cuſhion of Crimſon-velvet; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe Diamonds in a kind of Coronet upon her head,
having ſo many Jewels beſides of an ineſtimable value about
her, that with the reflexion of the lights her leaſt motion
ſeemed to dart forth flames of fire.</p>
               <p>At a little diſtance on her right hand but a ſtep lower, ſate
the young Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi> eldeſt daughter to King <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
who you know upon the peace made between the two crowns,
being ſent a child into <hi>Greece,</hi> became the contracted wife of
<hi>Leonides,</hi> the Emperors only ſon, though before the marriage
was conſummate he dyed ſudenly of an Apoplexie, and at that
time ſhe was not returned back agen into <hi>Sicily;</hi> but, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her widowhood ſhe was then cloathed in a long gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of black after the Grecian faſhion, with wide ſleeves that
touched the ground, her neck bare, and on her head a light
Vail that ſhadowed a little her face, but hid no part of it, and
without any other ornaments beſides, ſave only thoſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with which ſhe was ſo plentifully ſtored, that her beauty
was the admiration of the whole Empire.</p>
               <p>On the other hand but a ſtep lower then that, and at a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſate the Emperors two daughters <hi>Doriclea</hi> and
<hi>Clarinda</hi> magnificently habited according to their birth, not
being inferior to one another in perfections, and ſurpaſſing
all others except only the incomparable <hi>Mariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Empreſs in her countenance expreſſed a majeſtick gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
accompanied with an undaunted mind; <hi>Mariana</hi> a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61061:31"/>
ſweetneſs, as ſecured by her own beauty againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of fortune; and the two Princeſſes a noble diſdain of
their preſent condition; but <hi>Doriclea</hi> a ſeverity enclined to
revenge; <hi>Clarinda</hi> a mildneſs apt to pardon her enemies; and
all in beholding <hi>Demetrius,</hi> began to be ſo far from apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tyrannie of a cruel enemy, that they rather believed
ſome divine aſſiſtance was ſent them by the Gods.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Demetrius</hi> viewing their ſeveral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
eſpecially thoſe of the accompliſhed <hi>Mariana,</hi> began to
feel that courage which had never failed him in ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
amidſt a multitude of enemies, to yield at the very
firſt ſummons of two fair Eyes: yet remembring where he
was, and how little time, perhaps, he had to ſpare, with great
ſubmiſſion approaching to the degrees; kiſſed the hem of the
Empreſs garment, and caſting ſuch glances upon <hi>Mariana,</hi>
that ſhe might eaſily imagine his ſpeech was directed chiefly
to her, ſaid,</p>
               <p>Madam, I find the raſhneſs of my youth hath precipitated
me into an action of ſo much violence, that my guilt is little
leſs then theirs, who impiouſly aſſaulted the ſacred manſions
of the Gods; and if armed with their anger, you pronounce
againſt me the heavy ſentence of your juſt diſpleaſure, there
will need no mountains, my own afflictions will be enough to
overwhelm and preſs me down even to the very center of the
earth.</p>
               <p>Therefore conſider, moſt excellent Princeſs, looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
upon <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> that He who ſtands here a ſupplicant
is <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Polidor</hi> a profeſſed enemy, who very
well knows, that if he ſhould lay deſolate this noble City, and
bury in its own ruines the remembrance of this Imperial palace,
the laws of arms and of nations would not only juſtifie the act,
but render him a noble fame to poſterity that was the author
of ſo great an exploict.</p>
               <p>Then caſting his eyes agen upon <hi>Mariana;</hi> Yet I confeſs
there is a divinity about your perſon which is above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
laws; and my valour, ſince it hath offended you, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61061:31"/>
a crime, in expiation whereof I offer my life a ſacrifice,
if that may ſatisfie for ſo great an offence. Here is my ſword,
laying it at her feet, the inſtrument of my tranſgreſſion, with
which if you pleaſe you may exerciſe upon this breaſt that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
which you expected from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mariana</hi> either perceiving the conqueſt her beauty had
made, or moved through her natural mildneſs, caſt a ſmiling
look upon the Prince: But <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> to whom his ſpeech
ſeemed only addreſſed, riſing from her ſeat, with a wonderful
gravity replied,</p>
               <p>Noble <hi>Demetrius,</hi> To conquer is the effect of a daring cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
common to beaſts, and men of a ſavage nature; but ſuch
a generoſity of mind, is a particular endowment of the Gods:
Againſt the one I was armed with a reſolution above the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of fortune; but to the other I ſubmit a willing Captive,
and here deliver up my ſelf, and theſe Princeſſes the daughters
of the invincible <hi>Andronicus</hi> into your power.</p>
               <p>I need not exhort you to make a noble uſe of your victory,
but let not your ſucceſs make you too ſecure: Our honours
are now in your protection; and be not leſs active in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them, then you were by enthralling our perſons to
advance your own fame.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers and Inhabitants, though ſurpriſed with the
terror of a nightly aſſault, may yet again, as day appears,
make head againſt your Forces, and in that confuſion both
expoſe this City to the hazard of periſhing in its own flames,
and us all to the violences of an incenſed enemy: Or if by the
chance of war, or their multitudes they ſhould prevail, be
aſſured, they who have ſo baſely defended their own and their
Countries ſafety, will exerciſe a barbarous tyrannie over thoſe
they reduce into their power; for Cowards have naturally
cruel inclinations, and it would grieve me more to ſee ſo much
vertue ſuffer, then to ſee a whole nation of ſuch puſillanimous
people led into perpetual ſlavery.</p>
               <p>Therefore reaſſume your ſword, and conſider that <hi>Demetrius</hi>
though environed with a victorious Army, is leſs ſafe in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61061:32"/>
then <hi>Theodoſia</hi> and theſe Princeſſes in the ſole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the generous <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Empreſs was thus ſpeaking, ſome of the Souldiers,
notwithſtanding the command to the contrary, knowing
how much both their own ſafety and the Princes honour was
concerned, came runing into the room, giving an allarum that
the enemy attempted the recovery of the Palace, and came on
ſo furiouſly, that the men wanting his preſence, began to be
diſheartened, and were no longer able to withſtand the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the aſſault.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Prince taking his ſword in his hand, ſaid,
I muſt go, Madam, whither the conſervation, as you confeſs,
of your own honour cals me, and armed with your authority
ſhall ſoon appeaſe this fury of my enemies. But as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, the Empreſs taking a Diamond of an unſeen bigneſs
and luſtre from her finger, ſaid, You might if you pleaſed
ſeiſe upon that, pointing at the Crown, as the price of your
valour, or carry us after you in chains as witneſſes of your
conqueſt; but ſince you refuſe ſuch trophies, and are pleaſed
that I ſhall ſtill retain my dignity, being ſtill an Empreſs,
I will enjoin you to wear this as a teſtimony of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>Which having accepted with great reverence, turning about
he caſt a languiſhing regard upon the Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi> and
immediately haſted to encourage his men in this unexpected
aſſault; leaving behind him no leſs an admiration both of
his beauty, youth and perſon, then of his unparallell'd genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to the wife and children of his greateſt, and ſo powerful
an enemy.</p>
               <p>But his return to his Souldiers was ſo ſeaſonable, that at
the ſame time they were ready to give way to the aſſailants,
but reanimated with his preſence, on the contrary forced them
to retire: Wherefore intending a fair compoſition, and an
honorable retreat, he ſounded a Parley, and went himſelf to
the battlements to declare his intentions were not to uſe any
farther violence, but without any the leaſt damage to quit the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61061:32"/>
City. When day beginning to appear, though ſo as things
were ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable, he perceived by the Enſigns that
he was attacqued by <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> forces: wherefore he only
cryed out to them, Tell Prince <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> who hath gallantly
forced his way thus far, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> is advanced hither to
meet him, and will immediately ſet open the gates to receive
ſo noble a friend.</p>
               <p>Whereupon his voice being known by ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers, there was an unſpeakable joy amongſt them all,
which when they met was expreſſed by a general ſhout and
acclamations on either ſide; and the Princes having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> though his heart returned into the Palace,
thinking it neceſſary for the preſervation of the Army to unite
his forces, marched towards the chief Market place, which
<hi>Hydaſpes</hi> told him <hi>Telamon</hi> had poſſeſſed, and that thereupon
he was advanced with three thouſand men to attempt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
which they conceived had ſtill held out.</p>
               <p>But as he was marching away, turning about to behold
thoſe walls that encloſed his incomparable <hi>Mariana,</hi> a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of a moſt exquiſite beauty, having a ſmall Casket under
her arm, in the habit of a ſlave, came running towards him,
and almoſt breathleſs, with her cheeks bathed in tears, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
herſelf at his feet, beſought him by the love he bore to
vertue, by the reverence he ought the Gods, and as he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
by their protection to obtain a noble fame, to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on the ſufferings of a diſtreſſed Captive, who amongſt
many other grievous calamities was at length reduced to an
ignominious ſlavery, and had no hope of freedom, but by the
generoſity of ſo noble a Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not a little ſurpriſed at ſo wonderful an
object; for ſuch a dazeling beauty appeared through that
cloud of ſorrow, that he thought he never beheld any thing
more excellent, but his moſt excellent <hi>Mariana.</hi> Wherefore
raiſing her gently from the ground, he aſſured her if the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his deareſt blood could contribute any thing to her
repoſe, ſhe might give an intermiſſion to her griefs; for when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61061:33"/>
he once underſtood what way he might afford her relief, he
ſhould not think any enterpriſe impoſſible in the aſſiſtance of
ſo rare a creature; and that in the mean while ſhe might reſt
ſecure upon his word, that he would ſooner tranſgreſs the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
ordinances of the divine powers, then ſuffer any violence
to approach her perſon.</p>
               <p>Wherewith ſeeming a little comforted, ſhe ſaid, Upon that
noble pawn I deliver my ſelf and honour into your protection;
and that preſerved, diſpoſe of this miſerable life as you
pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Then immediately calling me to him, Here <hi>Lyſander,</hi> ſaid
he, I dare truſt to thee my own life, and in that confidence
commit to thy care, till theſe diſorders are a little over, the
ſafeguard of this excellent Maid, whoſe preſervation I charge
thee to be as tender of, as thou wouldſt be of mine or thine
own honour.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I was not a little pleaſed with ſo worthy a charge:
Therefore with great ſubmiſſion approaching to her, ſhe reſted
her hand upon my arm, and we continued our march towards
that quarter where <hi>Telamon</hi> lay with the reſt of the army. But
when we came to the market place, we found him engaged in
a hot conflict with the enemy, who when the day approached
rallied their forces, and made a gallant attempt to recover
their loſt city, and indeed had forced <hi>Telamon</hi> to give ground;
but when they ſaw a freſh ſupply come to him, their hearts
abſolutely failed them, and caſting away their weapons, they
yielded at diſcretion to our mercy.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Demetrius</hi> inſtantly commanding all actions
of hoſtility to ceaſe, called for the Governor, who being
brought into his preſence, he ſpake to him in this manner.</p>
               <p>I believe no neglect of yours hath cauſed the ſurpriſal of
this noble City; you appear a perſon worthy ſo great a truſt
as the command of that place which is the reſidence of the
Empreſs <hi>Theodoſia</hi> and thoſe excellent Princeſſes her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
therefore into your hands I deliver it agen; there ſhall
no violence be offered to the inhabitants, nor to any thing that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61061:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
belongs to them: And all that I require of you is, That you tell
<hi>Andronicus</hi> the Emperor, from <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Polidor</hi> his
mortal enemy, that he could as eaſily and with more juſtice
have laid deſolate this metropolitan City, than he deteins the
Country and patrimonial inheritance of Prince <hi>Philocles:</hi>
but if he continue his oppreſſion, that we now know the way
to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in his own Palace ſhall force him to a
due ſurrender, or bury him in the ruines of it.</p>
               <p>Then, not ſuffering any reply, looking back once more
upon the Palace, and ſighing to himſelf the name of <hi>Mariana,</hi>
he immediately gave the word to march; and having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a chariot for the ſtranger Captive, commanding her to be
attended with all manner of obſervance, in a ſhort time we
arrived at <hi>Sparta</hi> the capital City of the United Provinces,
where <hi>Demetrius</hi> was recived with a general applauſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
both by the States and common people, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by <hi>Polidor,</hi> who gloried more in this one exploict of his
ſon, then in all the actions of his own life. Inſomuch that if
being deprived of the preſence of the incomparable <hi>Mariana,</hi>
he had been capable of any content, he might have enjoyed
a perfect felicity; but he was ſo far from eſteeming his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
happy, that he believed himſelf the moſt miſerable man
living.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs his afflictions made him not forget his reſpects
to the ſtranger Virgin; but having, according to her deſire,
placed her in a private condition with the Queen of <hi>Macedon</hi>
mother to <hi>Philocles,</hi> who being driven out of her own country
lived there retired, ſhe received from her, being a Lady of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
goodneſs and humanity towards ſtrangers, ſuch
extraordinary demonſtrations of kindneſs, that though her
griefs were ſo preſſing, that they were not to be forgotten,
nevertheleſs ſhe found ſome relaxation for them at the preſent;
yet <hi>Demetrius</hi> could find no intermiſſion of his own, but on
the contrary by unexpected accidents was ſo traverſed in the
deſigns of his new affection, that he grew almoſt deſperate of
any future happineſs.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Lyſander</hi> had continued his diſcourſe, but that a ſervant
came in haſte to give notice that the Prince being awake
called for him, and would not be ſatisfied but with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
Wherefore <hi>Alexandro</hi> giving him many thanks for
what he had already related, and expreſſing an impatience to
hear the reſt, they all returned together into the houſe, and
would have viſited <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but that the Phyſitian entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, though he were ſtrangely amended, to forbear till
the next day; and only <hi>Lyſander,</hi> being alwayes about him,
was permitted to enter into the chamber. So that <hi>Alexandro</hi>
paſſing the reſt of the evening alone with <hi>Syneſius,</hi> he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with ſuch excellent diſcourſe, that he was wonderfully
ſatisfied with his company; and at length, though it grew

When he was alone, they came preſſing upon

a new companion, the noble ſenſe of <hi>Demetrius</hi>
ſufferings in the languiſhments of an uncertain
affection: but then reflecting upon the gallantry of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the aſſured acquiſition of ſo generous a friendſhip afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome little refreſhment to his ſorrows.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Demetrius,</hi> though he found a perfect

            </p>
            <p>Inſomuch that when day was come, having called to him

Whereupon, as he was continuing, one knocking ſoftly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
his ſpeech, and <hi>Lyſander</hi> having opened the dore,
he was not at all diſpleaſed to be ſo interrupted when he ſaw
<hi>Alexandro</hi> enter, who through an impatient deſire to eſtabliſh
their new commenced friendſhip, having only caſt a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown
about him, came to his chamber, and without any
ceremony approaching to the bed-ſide, having embraced him,
ſaid, Moſt generous Prince! my inclinations to confirm an
everlaſting league of amity between us can no longer comply
with theſe ceremonious delays of <hi>Caſsianus:</hi> If you are ſtill

would have us think, I come to aſſiſt you with my ſervice;
or if you find an amendment in your ſelf, to enjoy your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
for to a ſick man there is no ſuch comfortable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial,

            <p>Welcome, replied the Prince, As glorious victory to a

the divine <hi>Mariana</hi> would be to the languiſhing <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report of your valour bred in me an impatient deſire
to ſee you: Seeing you, that valour was ſo communicative,
that at the very firſt view it infuſed into me a vigor to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the terrible aſſaults of death; and now by the confirmation
of your friendſhip I am reſtored to ſuch a degree of ſtrength,
that it aſſures me the victory over that cruel enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexandro</hi> was about to anſwer in terms anſwerable to
theſe high Encomiums: but <hi>Syneſius</hi> and <hi>Caſsianus</hi> at the
ſame time coming into the room, he had only time to ſay,
I am glad to be thus happily prevented in a reply that would
come as far ſhort of the zealous intentions of my heart, as my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61061:35"/>
now limited power is of the vaſt deſires I have to ſerve you;
but let Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> reſt aſſured, he hath beſides his owh
vertues ſuch powerful advocates with the Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi>
that he cannot be more conſtant to his friend, then the Gods
have ordained him to be ſucceſsful in his love. Then kiſſing
him on the cheek, and with a ſtrait embrace teſtifying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of kindneſs then was yet expreſſed, he roſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the company, leaving <hi>Demetrius</hi> in a ſtrange perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity
to comprehend the meaning of his ambiguous ſpeeches,
for he could not imagine who ſhould be that happy mediator
of his love to his adored Princeſs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs at that time he had not leiſure to let his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
work; for <hi>Syneſius</hi> came to congratulate his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
amendment, and <hi>Caſsianus</hi> to perſwade him, if it were
poſſible, not to ſtir that day out of his bed; but all he could
obtain, though aſſiſted by the company, was, that he would
not go out of his chamber, which <hi>Alexandro</hi> preſſed the more
earneſtly, that he might have the better opportunity to hear
the reſt of <hi>Lyſanders</hi> relation: wherefore deſiring him and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius</hi>
to meet him preſently in the garden, he returned with
<hi>Caſsianus</hi> to his own appartement, that his wound being dreſt
he might prepare himſelf for that entertainment; and <hi>Syneſius</hi>
ſtaying behind, not thinking it fit any longer to conceal the
accident befallen to <hi>Philocles,</hi> acquainted the Prince with
every particular that had happened, at which he expreſſed a
wonderful diſcontent; yet being ſomething appeaſed by <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius</hi>
with the hopes that they ſhould ſuddenly have certain
news of him, it was agreed amongſt them that no mention
thereof ſhould be made to the Stranger. And <hi>Lyſander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by this time cloathed himſelf, with <hi>Demetrius</hi> leave
they went immediately according to their appointment into
the garden, where they were no ſooner entred into a ſhady
walk, but in an Arbor cloſe by a pleaſant Fountain they found
<hi>Alexandro,</hi> which being a convenient place, without going
any farther they took their ſeats, and <hi>Lyſander</hi> proceeded in
his diſcourſe.</p>

               <head>Continuation of the Story of Prince
DEMETRIUS.</head>
               <p>I Have already ſhewed the glorious entrance of <hi>Demetrius</hi>
upon this Theatre of the world; but the Scene is already
changed, and as you beheld him at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
amongſt his enemies, you muſt now look upon him as a
ſubmiſs Captive paying myriads of tributary ſighs and
tears to an emperious Beauty; by his patient ſufferance, and
conſtant perſeverance, by his many reſolute undertakings and
an undaunted reſiſtance to all oppoſitions, giving unpatterned
teſtimonies of an incomparable Lover.</p>
               <p>After he had received the ſeveral congratulations of his
friends, and taken order to diſpoſe his Souldiers into quarters,
the viſits of ceremony being paſt, his firſt care was, having
commanded me only to wait upon him, to give one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to the ſtranger-Virgin; and entring one morning into
her chamber, he found her ſitting by a table, whereon ſtood
a ſmall Casket open full of Jewels of an infinite price: but
ſhe was ſo far from taking delight in ſuch a treaſure, that on
the contrary beholding it, her eyes overflowed with teares,
which trickling apace down her cheeks ſeemed to outvie in
value thoſe oriental pearls and ſparkling diamonds that lay
before her, and every ſucceeding tear to contend for bigneſs
and luſtre with the former.</p>
               <p>Never was ſuch a ſpectacle of ſorrow, nor ever ſorrow
which ſhewed ſo lovely as in the manſion of that heavenly
face, her griefs ſeeming rather a divine compaſſion of humane
ſufferings, then the cruel oppreſſors of an afflicted mind ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to mortal paſſions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being ſeiſed with an awful reverence, he began
to retire; but ſhe having ſpied him, cryed out, Oh generous
Prince, ſhe not from the miſerableſt creature living; my
griefs are not infectious; on the contrary when you know the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61061:36"/>
cauſe of them for the preſent, armed with a noble anger, you
will take a juſt revenge upon her who hath ſullied the luſtre
of all your glories.</p>
               <p>You undertook my defence, being a deſolate ſtranger; by
your charity I enjoy the protection of this vertuous Queen;
and which is above all, you have preſerved my honor invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
In recompence whereof I have ſtained your noble fame,
made you appear a violator of your word, and your whole
Army a rude multitude not ſubject to warlike diſcipline For
though through an heroick generoſity you not only reſtored
the Empreſs, and the Princeſſes her daughters to their liberty,
but at the ſame time made them a preſent of their City, with
an entire reſtitution of the wealth thereof; and though your
orders were ſo punctually obſerved by the ſouldiers, that not
any of the inhabitants could complain of the leaſt loſs, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
miſerable I, who ought to have obeyed you more then
all the reſt, by a fatal miſpriſion, contrary to your expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
committed a violence in that place which you eſteemed
moſt ſacred, even in the Palace it ſelf, from whence I brought
that maſs of wealth which you ſee there before you, belonging
as I ſuppoſe formerly to young <hi>Leonides</hi> the Emperors only
ſon, but by his death in the poſſeſſion of the moſt excellent
Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi> amongſt which there is a Tablet enchaſed
with the Characters of her name, that bears the value of a
Princes ranſom, but contains within a far greater treaſure, her
own picture drawn by that famous Limner <hi>Pecorus,</hi> who hath
ſo happily encountred every feature and lineament of her face,
that beholding it, I think ſhe herſelf is preſent, reproaching
the monſtrouſneſs of my crime, which hath given occaſion of
ſo vile a ſcandal, that either <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not careful of his
word, or elſe his Souldiers through a baſe avarice ſlighting
their Generals command, ſought rather a priſe of wealth then
fame: For none will ſuppoſe me guilty of ſuch an act, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a part of the prey; and though you perhaps may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
ſo mean a ſatisfaction as this unworthy life, yet when
the Souldiers ſhall know how much I have injured your vertue
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61061:37"/>
and their own, their juſt rage can never be appeaſed but by
my blood, which I ſhall willingly offer in expiation of my
offence.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs I will not be ſo treacherous to my own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
as to acknowledg a wilful guilt: This is but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
infinite other misfortunes, to which my whole life
hath been expoſed; yet a greater malice of fortune then any
of the reſt, that not content to have brought me into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
rank of ſlaves, ſhe would likewiſe make me ſeem to
participate of their nature, who becauſe they are forced to
ſerve, ſeldom prove faithful.</p>
               <p>But the Grecian Admiral who firſt made me a priſoner was
more favorable; for he, I muſt ever confeſs, uſed me nobly,
and took nothing from me but my liberty; which he would
in ſome meaſure ſeem to reſtore, when at his arrival in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
he beſtowed me upon the Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi> with
whom I remained, till you by a gallant attempt became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of that City: And though I cannot but extol the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
uſage I received from the Princeſs, yet the natural
deſire of liberty, and to return into my own country, made
me flie to you for refuge, who by ſuch an unpatterned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
generoſity had ſo lately enfranchiſed even the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
herſelf with all the Royal family, and the Princeſs to
whom I was a ſervant.</p>
               <p>Wherefore taking the opportunity of the confuſion that was
then in the Palace, haſting to my Miſtreſs Cabinet, where
none having ſuch free acceſs as my ſelf, I had hid a ſmall
Casket which contained all my poor treaſure, through haſte,
being in the dark, and both of them of the ſame ſize and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
I brought away this inſtead of my own, which at
firſt, without conſidering it at all, I delivered to <hi>Lyſanders</hi> care;
at the ſame time you were pleaſed to commit to him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the protection of my perſon, and he by reaſon of his many
imployments having reſtored it to me agen but the laſt night,
I did not till then know the error of my miſtake, by which I
have robbed the Princeſs of all her chiefeſt jewels; and though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61061:37"/>
I have left ſome behind in my own Casket of value conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
enough, yet ſhe will be no more ſatisfied with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
then I am with my ſelf for having committed ſo great
a folly, by which I have not only offended ſo gracious a
Princeſs, and left in their place things that I valued far above
my own life, but which more afflicts me, treſpaſſed againſt
the honour of that perſon to whom I owe the preſervation of
my own; and I am ſo miſerable, that it is not in my power
in the leaſt degree to repair the injury, much leſs to make a
due ſatisfaction on either ſide: Therefore laying my life at
your feet, I deſire you will be pleaſed to take theſe into your
diſpoſal, for of right they belong to you; and it is in your
power, by reſtoring them to the Princeſs, both to vindicate
your Army from a ſoul aſperſion, and me from the blame
of a premeditated malice.</p>
               <p>The Prince was exceeding attentive to this diſcourſe;
but at the mention of <hi>Marianas</hi> Picture, ſo tranſported at once
both with a ſudden joy, and a paſſionate deſire to be poſſeſſed
of that dear jewel of his life, that he could ſcarcely forbear
to diſcover the inward inclinations of his heart; yet contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf as much as was poſſible within the bounds of a
moderate temper, replied,</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent Virgin, though both your name and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
lie concealed under your misfortunes, yet your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſo eminent, that they abundantly teſtifie the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of the perſon to whom they belong: And I am ſo far
from ſuppoſing you have in the leaſt degree injured me, or my
ſouldiers, that on the contrary I believe they owe their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to your cauſe, ſome ſupreme power having directed me
to lead them on to that enterpriſe only for your deliverance:
Neither do I imagine any wrong done to the Princeſs <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana;</hi>
for thus to reſtore thoſe trifles, is far more juſtice, then
not to have brought them away.</p>
               <p>Therefore I may preſume to ſay, your griefs are unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
unleſs as our great <hi>Heros</hi> wept when there were no more
worlds to conquer, you likewiſe lament becauſe it is not in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61061:38"/>
your power to exerciſe a greater vertue. But remember, his
inſatiable deſire of honour was imputed to him as an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too great for any mortal creature: And either you muſt
confeſs your ſelf what indeed you reſemble, a Divinity, or elſe
remaining unſatisfied with the admirable effects your vertues
have already produced, be content to ſubmit to the ſame cenſure.</p>
               <p>However, ſince the deteining of thoſe things ſeems ſuch a
burden to your mind, if you pleaſe to truſt me with them, I
ſhall not only take care to ſend them back, but that your own
may be reſtored to you agen: For though I believe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Mariana</hi> infinitely regret your loſs, yet I cannot imagine,
though it were in her power, that ſhe would refuſe to enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe
that perſon, of whom the Gods ſeem to have no leſs a
care then of herſelf; much leſs keep from you thoſe Jewels,
which a conquering Enemy thought a ſacriledge to make his
priſe.</p>
               <p>Whereupon immediately delivering the Casket, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
him by many conjurations to obtain a pardon of the
Princeſs for her fugitive ſlave <hi>Irene:</hi> And until ſhe could find
a fit opportunity to return into her own Country, that ſhe
might ſtill remain in the ſame condition; aſſuring him, that
though for many reaſons ſhe deſired not to be farther known,
yet neither her birth was ſo mean, nor her alliance ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
that either he needed to ſhame at, or repent thoſe
charitable offices, which through a generous compaſſion he
uſed to an afflicted ſtranger, by deſtinie caſt into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>No, I can no more, ſaid the Prince, repent thoſe poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
I am able to render you, then yourſelf can conceal thoſe
excellencies, which require a ſtrict obedience to all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
But the ſame power you have over others, exerciſe,
in ſome degree, upon your ſelf, and ſuffer not ſorrow to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
over that beauty which hath ſo abſolute a dominion over
all the world beſides. I would not ſay I leave you to your
griefs, but in a diſpoſition to vanquiſh them; at leaſt permit
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61061:38"/>
me to hope, that when I have the honour to ſee you next, I
may congratulate with you for that happy victory.</p>
               <p>Whereupon taking his leave, he immediately returned to
the Court to his own appartement; and being retired alone
into his Cabinet, you may eaſily imagine with what an exceſs
of joy he beheld the Idea of that face which was already ſo
engraven in his heart, that it was not capable of any other
content. But then conſidering how he was engaged by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to part with a Jewel ſo precious to him, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt the ſevere laws of Honour, as injurious to thoſe
of Love: yet not willing to tranſgreſs either, his fancie wrought
upon a thouſand ſeveral inventions how to ſatisfie both; but
finding no better expedient, at length after ſome few days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
he reſolved, though then unknown to me, to keep the
Picture as in a complement, for he durſt not preſume to avow
his love, and to ſend the reſt back by <hi>Mercurio</hi> a Sicilian gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of an approved fidelity, who being of a Nation in league
with the Empire, eſpecially as employed to the Princeſs <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
might without difficulty paſs through the Enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Wherefore having given him ſufficient inſtructions, he
ſecretly diſpatched him away with a Letter, which I have ſeen
ſince, and was as I remember to this effect.</p>

open a way to the farther declaration of his love. But whilſt
he pleaſed himſelf with theſe thoughts, there were counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
a working, which turned his hopes even into deſpair;
and though he found difficulties enough before, interpoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſibilities to encounter. For <hi>Polidor,</hi> when he ſaw
he had a ſon worthy to ſucceed him in his honours, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a ſmall Principality, his patrimonial inheritance, nor
with the great power he enjoyed in the new Commonwealth
of the Revolted Provinces, as Generaliſſimo, and chief in all
their Councels; but believing what he had gained with his
own ſword, by the ſame right, of due belonged not to any
other, had long entertained a ſecret deſign to bring them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
into his ſubjection, and either by a popular carriage to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61061:39"/>
induce them to a voluntary reſignation of their liberty, or
elſe by a foreign alliance to awe them with his power.</p>
               <p>Neither wanted he abettors, even amongſt the <hi>States</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who either through a grateful conſideration of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or elſe for their own intereſts, ſought to advance his. But
above all, the Princeſs <hi>Salmona</hi> his wife, a Lady of an aſpiring
mind, yet no leſs prudent in all her actions, and exceedingly
wiſe in the management of great affairs, let paſs no occaſion
or opportunity to encourage him in the attempt; and beſides
by her compliance, and private converſation with perſons of
all degrees, gained no inconſiderable party of adherents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe of moſt eminent authority.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that being now prepared for the yoke, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
by a general accord to contrive the means with moſt eaſe
to bring themſelves into it.</p>
               <p>Some would have it propoſed to the people in their ſeveral
Provinces; Others, that by degrees the power ſhould be let
fall into his hands as it were through a remiſneſs of the <hi>States;</hi>
Others, that he ſhould make uſe of the credit he had with the
Army, and having ſeiſed upon all the ſtrong places, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to declare himſelf: But the wiſer ſort propoſed an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
firſt with ſome powerful neighbouring Prince, and then
whatſoever ſhould be attempted afterwards none would dare
to reſiſt; but the people, though the name of Liberty were
precious amongſt them, yet being much leſs eſteemed then
the dear fruition of their wealth, would rather ſubmit to an
eaſie government, then expoſe all to the hazard of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
war. Wherefore the reſult of their debates was, that the
<hi>States</hi> in gratitude to <hi>Polidor</hi> ſhould offer to treat in their own
names with the Nobility of <hi>Armenia</hi> to beſtow their young
Queen <hi>Diophanta</hi> in marriage upon Prince <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and to
ſecond it with ſuch advantagious conditions to that Crown,
that they ſhould not be eaſily rejected.</p>
               <p>What was thus concluded in their ſeveral private Cabals,
in a ſhort time became the publike act of a general Aſſembly;
and <hi>Polidor</hi> finding himſelf entreated to accept what with ſuch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61061:40"/>
induſtry he had laboured to procure, began to think of nothing
leſs then a Crown, or at leaſt the eſtabliſhment of it in his ſon.
But <hi>Solmona</hi> imagined herſelf already poſſeſſed of it; and
though ſhe were endued with a ſingular wiſdom, yet to ſhew
ſhe was a woman, and ſubject to the paſſions of that ſex, ſhe
began to ſtand upon punctilio's and terms of competition
with the Queen of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whoſe greatneſs of birth, and
experience in the changes of the world, made her nevertheleſs
contemn, or at leaſt not take notice of thoſe little frailties in a
perſon whoſe vertues ſhe had ever loved.</p>
               <p>But in the mean while <hi>Demetrius</hi> was altogether ignorant
of theſe great contrivances; what intrigues, plottings and
ſtratagems were uſed to make him a King, who eſteemed it
a far greater honor to be a ſlave, and would not have changed
his fetters for the Empire of the whole world, much leſs for
ſo inconſiderable a portion of it as the Armenian Crown.
But when by the publike act he perceived how far they had
proceeded to his ruine, he armed himſelf with a reſolution an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to ſo great an oppoſition; and it was not long before
he was put to the trial of his force: For within a few dayes
after <hi>Polidor</hi> coming early one morning to his chamber, after
the attendants were diſmiſſed, he began to entertain him with
this unwelcom diſcourſe. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> how dear thou art to
me I cannot better expreſs, then by letting thee know the
care I have ever had of thy advancement.</p>
               <p>Theſe people who thou ſeeſt thus forward to treat a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
for thee with the Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> will be as ready when
occaſion ſhall ſerve to offer thee the ſoveraignty of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
but it will be neceſſary in the firſt place to ſtrengthen
our ſelves with this alliance; therefore prepare thy ſelf to be
a Lover, that thou mayſt be a King, and having the poſſeſſion
of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rown, ſoon become maſter of another.</p>
               <p>Yet you muſt conſider, that though I have with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
by degrees aſcended to theſe hopes, there lies now a
neceſſity upon us to go on vigorouſly in the proſecution of
his enterpriſe: For our intents are perceived, if not known,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61061:40"/>
by many who at the preſent only comply becauſe either they
think it moſt ſecure for themſelves, or elſe know not how to
avoid it without the hazard of greater inconveniences both
to the private and publike: But if they find any remiſneſs in
our proceedings, or that we fail never ſo little of thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
upon which we have laid the foundation of our riſe, they
will quickly take the advantage of our defects; and having
once inſinuated into the vulgar how neer they are to the loſs
of their liberty, eaſily prevent the like danger for the future,
by removing not only all poſſibilities of making a ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
but thoſe perſons from amongſt them, whoſe greatneſs
they have ſuch cauſe to apprehend: For the Emperor being
weary of the war, and attacqued on all ſides by other enemies,
they may, having once raiſed theſe jealouſies, when they pleaſe
make a peace with him upon any terms; and the peace once
confirmed, under fair pretences, at once disband the Army,
and deprive us of our power.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt now either advance forward, or elſe be
ſure to retire with diſgrace; and that theſe very people whoſe
fathers <hi>Polidor</hi> with his ſword redeemed from ſlavery, will
trample upon his ſon <hi>Demetrius</hi> as their vaſſal.</p>
               <p>But by this Match you may eſtabliſh your power above the
reach of their malice, and bring the whole Nation into an
abſolute obedience; which otherwiſe, when I am dead, will
neither want arts nor pretences to contrive your ruine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no ſecurity in the benefits they have received from me,
for they will as eaſily forget them, as they did their allegiance
to their own natural Prince.</p>
               <p>Commonwealths reverence their Benefactors when they
are marble, gracing their ſepulchers and ſtatues with glorious
inſcriptions to point others the way to the ſame honours, but
ſeldom ſuffer the power to remain long in any one family
that is great, either in birth, or merit; for though they love
and cheriſh valour and courage, and undertaking ſpirits, when
they are in diſtreſs, and have need of ſuch vertues, yet in times
of proſperity and peace they become their greateſt terror.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61061:41"/>
If <hi>Demetrius</hi> were leſs worthy, this State perhaps in gratitude
would be content to let him enjoy the title, which when he
was a child, in a complement, as a thing yet remote, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon him; but having already ſeen how much he dares,
they will not dare to truſt him with ſo great a power, unleſs
their fears make them not dare to deprive him of it.</p>
               <p>Since then we are not ſafe, nor the honor of our family ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
whilſt theſe Peaſants who deſpiſe all Nobility, and love
nothing but wealth, enjoy their liberty, to reduce them agen
to the obedience of a Crown, cannot be called ambition, or
if it be, having ſo juſt a motive, it is an ambition without a
crime, and <hi>Diaphanta</hi> cannot but embrace the love of that
Prince who hath ſo noble an ambition to preſerve his own
honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> being prepared for ſuch an encounter with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
ſerious countenance, preſently replied; Sir, I am
not ignorant, that as I received my life from you, I was not
only born your Subject, but likewiſe bred a Souldier under
your command, and by thoſe relations am obliged by a triple
duty to render an humble, willing, and ſtrict obedience to all
your commands. Nevertheleſs having ever ſhewed your ſelf
both a ſingular juſt Prince, as well as an admired wiſe General,
and a no leſs indulgent Father, I conceive you will permit me
the liberty, before I yield an abſolute concurrence, to alleadge
ſome objections, which perhaps will not be inconſiderable,
againſt the many ſuppoſed advantages of this pretended
alliance.</p>
               <p>It is chieſty propoſed as the only means to cumulate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
upon our family, and as a ſtrong Rampier, not only to
defend it againſt the malitious aſſaults of an inſolent ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
people, but from thence to batter and deſtroy that liberty
which otherwiſe would perhaps in time ſeek the ruine of its
Protectors.</p>
               <p>But alas, what honor can it be to the ſon of the renowned
<hi>Polidor</hi> to borrow the ſhadow of a Kingly dignity from a
woman, that is herſelf a meer titulary Queen? For do not the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61061:41"/>
Nobility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and chief Officers of the Crown, to whoſe care ſhe
was left during her minority, though ſhe be now of age to
aſſume the government, ſtill as Guardians uſurp the Regal
authority; which cannot be without an aim either to confirm
it for ever in themſelves, or elſe by a marriage to eſtabliſh it in
ſome of their own families.</p>
               <p>Therefore to what intent, unleſs to procure a diſgraceful
repulſe, ſhould I direct my addreſſes to ſuch a Queen, who is
ſo miſerably oppreſſed, that ſhe hath the leaſt voice of all in
the diſpoſal of her own affections? Or ſuppoſe you ſhould by
a formal Embaſſie gain the conſent of the Nobility, which is
very unlikely, can it be thought probable, that they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all right detein the power from the lawful Inheritrix,
will by the mediation of a foreign Allie reſign both that and
themſelves into the hands of a ſtranger? So <hi>Demetrius</hi> who
was born to be a Soveraign in his own Country, muſt ſue,
and entreat, and perhaps with much difficulty obtain the
honor to be admitted a Subject to the Subjects of another
Nation.</p>
               <p>Where are then thoſe ſpecious advantages of aids, and
ſtrength, not only to ſupport the preſent dignity of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but to make an aſſured paſſage to the dominion of the
United Provinces? Are they not ſtill in the diſpoſal of the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Nobility? And it is not likely till they have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to deveſt themſelves of that authority, that they will arm
their new made Pupil with a force to make a conqueſt of the
<hi>Peloponeſians,</hi> that he may the eaſilier when he pleaſe reduce
them to an abſolute obedience.</p>
               <p>Therefore if my vote, as I am a party of no ſmall intereſt,
might intervene in the deciſion of this great affair, I ſhould
wholly reject the propoſition as grounded upon falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and as abſolutely contrary to the noble deſigns of ſo
worthy a Father, as it is prejudicial both to his own and his
Sons honor.</p>
               <p>Then falling at his feet, and embracing his knees, beſought
him by the tender affections of a father, either to leave him to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61061:42"/>
his own inclinations, or elſe at leaſt to reſpite his definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
till he had taken time to conſider of his reaſons, which
if they proved not of validity to alter him from his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he would by ſubmitting to his will, in teſtimony of a
perfect obedience, deliver up again into his hands that life
which he had received from him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Polidor</hi> was ſo far from being moved by his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that on the contrary relying upon the experienced wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his age, either through diſdain that ſo young a man,
and his ſon, ſhould undertake to diſpute what he upon mature
deliberation had reſolved on, or elſe contrary to his nature, by
the perſwaſions of the Princeſs <hi>Solmona</hi> rendred inexorable,
in a paſſionate rage he turned away from him, and going out
of the room, with a look that expreſſed his diſpleaſure, made
only this ſhort reply: Either reſolve inſtantly to proſecute
the love of <hi>Diophanta,</hi> and be a King, or remain for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the name of Son.</p>
               <p>So heavy a decree, with ſuch ſeverity pronounced, ſtruck
ſuch a ſudden damp upon his ſpirits, that he continued a while
in a manner ſenſleſs like a ſtatue fixed to the earth: But then
recollecting himſelf, riſing from the ground, cryed out; No
<hi>Demetrius</hi> will never ſhew himſelf unworthy of his birth;
He will either be a King, or periſh in the attempt; and that
title which he diſdains to hold from a woman, by the vertue
of his ſword make the purchaſe of his own valour.</p>
               <p>But oh <hi>Polidor!</hi> from whence proceeds it that of an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
father thou art ſo ſoon become a tyrannical oppreſſor of
thy ſons affections? Thou wouldſt have me love, and my
ſoul is already ſo wholly poſſeſſed with that divine paſſion,
that the Goddeſs of Love herſelf ſitting enthroned in my heart,
I cannot be ſubject to any other laws; and I love a Princeſs,
beſides her natural endowments, both in birth and dignity ſo
far above a petty titulary Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that if I thought
not my ſelf aſſured of a Crown, I ſhould not preſume to ſay
I loved her: And thy ſelf, if thou kneweſt the ſlight my fancie
hath taken, would ſay, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> thy thoughts ſoar too high.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61061:42"/>
If then I love with ſuch an ardent flame; if I am in my
imagination already a King; and if my ambition be much
greater then thy ſelf didſt ordain; in what do I contradict
thy will? Is it an infringement of thy commands, to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
thy deſires? Or am I leſs a Lover, or leſs ambitious,
becauſe my Love hath raiſed my Ambition to a heigth ſo far
above thy pretences? Is it againſt the laws of piety to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by that ſupreme law of laws, that ought to be the
guide of all our actions, Reaſon? which aſſures me, that in
complying with thy deſires I ſubmit my ſelf to a perpetual
ſlavery; but in the fruition of <hi>Mariana's</hi> love ſhall at the
ſame inſtant become poſſeſſed of a vaſt Empire.</p>
               <p>A filial duty is leſs obliging then a divine decree: The
Gods have ordained me to love the incomparable <hi>Mariana;</hi>
and either I muſt enjoy her love, or elſe the family of <hi>Polidor,</hi>
which to eſtabliſh he vainly conteſts with heaven, remain for
ever extinct in the miſerable death of the unfortunate <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon throwing himſelf upon his bed, ſuch a tempeſt
was raiſed within his breaſt, that if his paſſion had not burſt
out in tears to allay the violence thereof, his ſoul undoubtedly
had been oppreſſed and overwhelmed with the weight thereof.
But at the ſame inſtant I entring caſually into the chamber,
having overheard theſe laſt words which proceeded from him
with an unuſual vehemence, and beſides ſeeing him in ſo ſad
a condition, I could not forbear to ſay,</p>
               <p>What can make the happy <hi>Demetrius</hi> call himſelf unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and thus talk of miſery and death, and the extinction of
his family, and a conteſtation with heaven as if he were a
perſon wholly abandoned to deſpair? What hath diſſolved
that manly courage into theſe womaniſh teares and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints?
Can any thing but a general ruine produce ſo great
an alteration? Sure ſome ſtrange unheard of grief hath taken
poſſeſſion of that noble ſoul, and expelled thence the uſe of
reaſon, or elſe he could not thus yield to paſſion, and lie as it
were ſenſleſs of any thing but ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61061:43"/>
If it be ſo, and your griefs are too violent, as it appears,
for any one man to encounter, communicate them to me
that I may bear a part in your ſufferings; for I have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
my life to your ſervice, and either now employ it to
eaſe you, if it be poſſible, of theſe afflictions, or elſe having
entertained a diffidence of my fidelity, adde to your miſeries
by embruing your hands in that blood, which ſhed in
your cauſe would prove fatal to the oppreſſors of your
felicity.</p>
               <p>Whereupon turning towards me, after a great groan, he
replied, Oh <hi>Lyſander!</hi> I am ſo far from the leaſt miſtruſt of
thy faith, that if I were not aſſured of thy friendſhip, and that
I might with confidence diſcharge my ſoul into thy boſom,
my heart is ſo overcharged with unſpeakable griefs, that it
would force a paſſage through this tormented breaſt.</p>
               <p>I can no longer conceal from thee the only ſecret of my
life; let this, ſhewing me the Tablet, repreſent to thee the
true object of my happineſs, and conſider in <hi>Polidor</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
of an indulgent father: <hi>Mariana's</hi> beauty is the ſtar
by which I direct my courſe, and his cruelty the ſtorm that
threatens a miſerable ſhipwrack to all my fortunes.</p>
               <p>Then relating to me the beginning of his love, how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
the Picture, when he ſent the Casket back by <hi>Mercurio,</hi>
and all the particulars that had newly paſſed between him and
the old Prince, he continued: Now canſt thou wonder that
this conſtancie is ſhaken that lies expoſed to ſuch furious bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries?
Rather admire that the whole fabrick is not ſunk into
the earth, which hath been ſo cunningly undermined by the
councels and policies of an erronious affection.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mariana</hi> makes good the place, and will for ever keep
poſſeſſion, not by ſecret plots and ſtratagems, but by an open
defiance againſt the aſſaults of the whole world.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it is a miſerable condition, to maintain a war,
though in a juſt cauſe, againſt a Father; and in a Subject a
crime ſo capital, as cannot be expiated by the life of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
but the whole race muſt be involved in the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61061:43"/>
Yet it is as impoſſible to diſunite me from my
Love, as to be ſeparated from thoſe relations.</p>
               <p>A fathers ſeverity may be turned into mildneſs, and a
Prince at his pleaſure may alter his laws; nay, the vaſt frame
of the world may be ſhaken, and the univerſality of nature
ſuffer a change; but a perfect Lover can neither turn, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor change; for Love is the chiefeſt attribute of the Gods;
and he that participates ſo much of their divine nature, muſt
like themſelves ſtill remain the ſame.</p>
               <p>That power therefore which hath laid a neceſſity upon me
to continue conſtant in my love, will either inſpire me by a
juſt means to overcome theſe difficulties, or elſe infuſe ſuch a
gentleneſs into <hi>Polidor,</hi> that he will at length comply with my
deſires.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I expect from thee an aſſiſtance to my
reſolutions; which, to avoid the anger of an incenſed father,
and to daſh at firſt all hopes of proceeding farther in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
ſo fatal to my happineſs, are immediately to retire into
the ſhelter of ſome other Country, till the violence of the
ſtorm be over.</p>
               <p>Prepare therefore habits with all things neceſſary for our
eſcape, and after to morrow, about midnight, meet me in the
wood, on the farther ſide of the Park, without the City, from
whence, before any notice can be taken of our departure, we
may eaſily get out of the States territories: And whereſoever
I am, freed from theſe incumbrances, and <hi>Lyſander</hi> in my
company, I cannot want ſomthing of content, which in this
place is wholly denied by the cruel adverſaries both of my
life and liberty.</p>
               <p>I perceived that the apprehenſion of being croſſed in his
deſigns, had ſo firmly ſetled him in this reſolution, that it
was impoſſible by any arguments to diſſwade him from it:
Wherfore only deſiring he would duly conſider the condition
of his affairs, without farther circumſtance, I promiſed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to obey his commands; yet that it would be neceſſary
however to recollect his ſpirits, and not by a dejectedneſs to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61061:44"/>
expreſs his diſcontents, but by appearing in the Court with
his uſual alacrity, if occaſion of diſcourſe were offered by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidor,</hi>
to ſhew a flexibility to his deſires, and that it was rather
a youthful ardor, or love of liberty, then any averſneſs, that
had moved him at firſt to diſreliſh his propoſition, which a
little time, with better conſideration, might bring to an effect
agreeable to his wiſh.</p>
               <p>Whereupon having with many kind embraces teſtified a
great ſatisfaction in my ready compliance, and aſſured me
punctually to follow my advice; he prepared himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his ordinary viſits, and I retired the private way out of
his chamber; but upon the ſtairs unexpectedly met <hi>Mercurio,</hi>
who was newly returned; yet knowing he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
any thing of his buſineſs to me, paſſed by him only
with a ſalute; and though I thought his coming might cauſe
ſome retardment of our intended departure, yet not to give
any ſuſpition of a neglect, as Lovers are ſubject to all kind
of jealouſies, I went immediately to put things in order ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my directions.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, after ſome great perſons were diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who attended to preſent their cuſtomary reſpects, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curio</hi>
gave a ſhort account of his voyage: That the Princeſs
<hi>Mariana</hi> at his arrival ſhewed him ſo little countenance, that
at the firſt he doubted whether he ſhould ſee her any more;
nevertheleſs after two days attendance, one of her Ladies
having ſent for him, delivered him a Casket, and afterwards
with her own hands ſhe gave him a Letter, which having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
he told him that the Emperor being advertiſed of the
ſurpriſal of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> marched that way with his Army,
but afterwards underſtanding he had agen left it, came only
himſelf with his ordinary train, to ſee how matters ſtood,
and by the relation made to him by <hi>Theodoſia</hi> of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſo admired his valour, and was ſo enamoured of his
generoſity, that it was commonly diſcourſed he had an intent
to offer him his younger daughter <hi>Clarinda</hi> in marriage, and
upon ratification of the match both to relinquiſh his right to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61061:44"/>
the united Provinces, and to acknowledge them a free State;
it being ſaid there was already one nominated to be ſent to
propoſe a Treaty, and an indifferent place for Commiſſioners
of both ſides to meet, becauſe the Emperor for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his honour to the world, ſtood only upon this pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio,
That at the ſame time he offered his daughter, the
States ſhould likewiſe ſend an honorable Embaſſie to demand
a Peace. Which news was ſo diſpleaſing to the Prince, that
he could ſcarce forbear to break out into complaints againſt
the hardneſs of his deſtinie, which raiſed ſo many oppoſitions
to his happineſs: But having received the Letter, his joyes
and fears were infinite, till he had peruſed the contents: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Mercurio</hi> being diſmiſſed, firſt he conſidered the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
then kiſſed it a thouſand times; but going to open the
ſeal, he made a pauſe, as loth to offer violence to an impreſſion
made by thoſe fair hands; and when pale and trembling, he
began to tear the paper, a meſſenger from the Princeſs <hi>Solmona</hi>
came to give him notice that ſhe deſired inſtantly to ſpeak
with him.</p>
               <p>When remembring my advertiſements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how neceſſary it was by a preſent cheerfulneſs in ſome
meaſure to aſſwage <hi>Polidors</hi> anger, and apprehending the
Letter might move ſuch an alteration in him as would render
his compliance impoſſible, having agen kiſſed it with great
reverence, he put it next his heart, and went directly to the
Princeſs appartement, who beginning to enter into a diſcourſe
concerning <hi>Diophanta,</hi> he ſo behaved himſelf, that ſhe received
an unexpected ſatisfaction, beyond her hopes; and the old
Prince likewiſe coming in, he found his humour ſo changed,
that he believed the greateſt difficulty already paſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a ſeeming content on all ſides, they paſſed a great
part of the day together: but the houres were tedious to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
untill he had diſengaged himſelf, for it was towards
evening before he could find an opportunity to retire; at
which time I being then in the Ante-chamber, he made me a
ſign to follow him; and being come together into his private
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61061:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cabinet, he drew the Letter out of his boſom, and with
a trembling hand breaking the Seal, read theſe following
lines.</p>

               <p>That this cauſed a ſtrange emotion, you may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
but it is impoſſible to conceive the effects it wrought
in him; for he was ſcarce come to the end, before his life
ſeemed to be at the laſt period. But that word <hi>Contempt</hi>
pierced him ſo to the heart, that the Paper falling immediately
out of his hand, he ſunk down upon the Couch like a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
carkaſs, continuing ſo a long time without any the leaſt
ſhew of motion, and by all appearances paſt the help of any
external remedies; for he was already pale, and cold, in his
face and hands: but unbracing him, about his heart where
the Tablet lay, remained ſuch a burning heat, as if his ſoul
by <hi>Mariana's</hi> cruelty expelled that noble manſion, had in a
juſt revenge kindled a fire there to conſume the Idol it had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61061:45"/>
ſo much adored; yet withall ſuch a violent beating, as if
Love and Anger armed with all their power contending for
the victory, and having made that the ſeat of their war, ſought
in the ſame ſlames to conſume each other.</p>
               <p>But Love, the more powerful paſſion, at length prevailing,
ſhe by her gentleneſs extinguiſhed that fire; and his vital heat
at her command diſſipating it ſelf agen through all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
he began by degrees to return to his former colour:
When lifting up his eyes, as if two flood-gates had been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there iſſued forth a torrent of tears, which making way
for his ſpeech, with a ſaint voice he uttered only theſe few
words.</p>
               <p>He that can ſerve any other beauty, is indeed unworthy of
<hi>Mariana's</hi> favours; but he that can harbor a thought of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in diſparagement of ſo divine an excellence, ought to
ſuffer, as I do now, torments worſe then the pangs of
death.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I anſwered, He that did not contemn <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anas</hi>
love, or at leaſt were not ignorant in the arts of Lovers,
could not ſo miſerably afflict himſelf, having ſuch fair aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of her affection.</p>
               <p>What in modeſty could ſhe have ſaid more? Or in regard
of her honour leſs, then that the jealouſie you ſerved ſome other
Beauty, ſuggeſted to her thoughts you contemned hers, and
bred an apprehenſion you did not ſet ſo great a value upon
her favors as ſhe deſired.</p>
               <p>It is evident ſhe labours with theſe doubts, no leſs then
<hi>Demetrius</hi> with the fears of her diſpleaſure; and uſed this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to procure her ſatisfaction, whilſt he loſeth all his, and even
his life with vain imaginations.</p>
               <p>Women are not leſs enclined to love then men, but far
more ſubtle to conceal their flames; yet her regards did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
teſtifie, when you gave the other Princeſs, their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that her heart ſtill remained the priſe of your conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Oh my dear <hi>Lyſander,</hi> he replied, how ſevere thou art to
thy friend, and how charitable to the chiefeſt enemy of his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61061:46"/>
life! Had the Princeſs ſuch skill as thou ſuppoſeſt in the arts
of Love, ſhe would have been more merciful then by ſo cruel
a cenſure to deprive him of all hopes, whom ſhe thought
worthy in the leaſt degree of her affection.</p>
               <p>But for thy ſake I will for a while flatter my ſelf with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

               <p>How this came to <hi>Polidors</hi> hands, or of what happened
afterwards, I can give no perfect account more then by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
report, that his departure as ſoon as known was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lamented; but before any notice could be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we were advanced beyond the States dominions to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa</hi>
a Town upon the borders of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and from thence
making a great circuit, to avoid all poſſibilities of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
after two moneths travel we came to the famous
City of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> where we had firſt news that Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
were arrived from <hi>Sicily</hi> at the Port to conduct the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Mariana</hi> into her own Country; and that the Emperor
with his whole Court intending to bring her as far as <hi>Traja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolis,</hi>
meant there to conſign her, with a full reſtitution of
her Dowry into their hands.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Prince remaining conſtant to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
we continued our journey to <hi>Amphipolis</hi> a great City
built upon a Lake ſome four leagues over, and about forty
from <hi>Trajanopolis:</hi> when being certainly informed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
was already upon the way, and that after a weeks repoſe
at <hi>Trajanopolis</hi> the Princeſs would in a ſhort time be in that
City, where <hi>Artabaces</hi> the Soveraign Prince thereof, but a
Feudotary of the Empire, made exceeding preparations for
her reception; he reſolved there to expect the happineſs he ſo
much deſired, once more to behold thoſe fair eyes, whoſe
firſt glances had gained ſuch a ſoveraign dominion over his
heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61061:47"/>
Wherefore for privacie ſeeking a lodging in a remote part
of the City, we happened upon a houſe joining to the Lake,
that belonged to an aged man of a very reverend aſpect,
called <hi>Dribleon,</hi> who was a great Naturaliſt, and his humour,
though a little extravagant, ſo divertiſing, that the Prince
took great delight in his company.</p>
               <p>He was the author of many rare inventions, and amongſt
the reſt had framed a motion of water, that indeed was moſt
admirable to conſider; and finding we were not only exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
delighted with it, but applauded his induſtry, he the
more freely communicated to us his other ſecrets; and the

he had working in his head, with an aſſurance of large rewards,
obtained a promiſe of his aſſiſtance; and thereupon having

he had undertaken.</p>
               <p>In the mean while there happned nothing worthy menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
On the contrary the time began to ſeem tedious, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

were to accompany her to <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> and <hi>Xenobarbus</hi> Prince
of <hi>Thrace,</hi> with <hi>Simonida</hi> his Princeſs, and a numerous train
of great Lords and Ladies, being appointed by the Emperor
to conduct her to <hi>Epidaurus</hi> where ſhe was to embark, they

where the entertainment was ſo noble, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it ſo extraordinary, that I cannot forbear to make a
brief relation of the particulars.</p>
               <p>It was on purpoſe ordered that ſhe ſhould make her entry
upon the water; and being arrived at the Lake, ſhe was there
received by <hi>Artabaces,</hi> who (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the magnificence of his State.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61061:47"/>
He came with a Fleet of a hundred Gallies all compleatly
rigged and manned, as if appointed for ſome preſent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but ſo gloriouſly gilt, and adorned with Enſigns and
Streamers, as if he would at once diſplay both the riches and
power of his Principality.</p>
               <p>They lay all ranged along upon the ſhore, and from the
Admiral was caſt forth a ſpacious bridge, at the foot whereof
<hi>Artabaces</hi> with a great number of Gentlemen, the chief No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his Country, ſumptuouſly clad, though like Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
attended her coming; and as the Princeſſes deſcended
from their Chariot, with great reverence approaching towards
them, having kiſſed the skirt of their garments, conducted
them, with the Ambaſſadors and the chiefeſt perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
aboard his own Gally, the reſt of the Train being at the
ſame time by the ſeveral Commanders diſpoſed in the others
appointed for them, which were all ſplendidly furniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the occaſion, but the equipage of the Admiral ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
the whole Fleet beſides.</p>
               <p>There was no part of her that appeared, not ſo much as
the Oars and Maſts, but were richly carved and guilt; The
Sails, being faſtened to the Yards, were of white Taffata, and
all the Shrouds and Tacklings of ropes of gold; The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orm
which conſiſted of twenty Banks, and twenty Slaves on
a Bank, were cloathed in Caſſocks of Cloth of gold, with
their Chains of maſſie ſilver; And on the Poop was raiſed a
Pavillion of Tiſſue embroidered with the Imperial Arms,
ſupported by pillars of Goldſmiths work; under which upon
a little Aſcent covered with Perſian carpets of ſilk and gold,
were placed Chairs for the Princeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for <hi>Artabaces</hi> and the reſt; Forty Pages, all of a ſtature and
age, being cloathed alike with Gaberdines of Tiſſue, and ſhort
paned Hoſe richly embroidered, attending upon the Deck to
ſerve upon any occaſion.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken their ſeats, the Admiral moved firſt,
and the whole Fleet dividing it ſelf into three Squadrons,
two came on each ſide at a diſtance, and the other in the

In this poſture they began to advance towards an Iſland,
which was made in the middle of the Lake upon great Boats,
containing a thouſand paces in compaſs; on the one ſide
whereof upon a Rock, artificially raiſed to an extraordinary
heigth, ſtood a Caſtle of a ſeeming impregnable ſtrength,
with divers armed men appearing upon the battlements as in
a poſture of defence: But coming before the Harbor, which
lay in the form of a Half-moon, with two Forts upon each
point as to guard the entrance thereof, there iſſued from thence
another Fleet of Gallies with all warlik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the two flanking Squadrons (for the Train were in the

Sea fight, which ſeemed ſo much in earneſt, that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
two Gallies of the adverſe party were ſunk, and a great
number of the men ſeen ſwiming as it were for their lives.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Artabaces</hi> Gallies at length prevailing, the others fled;
and the Caſtle and Forts at the ſame time, as in token of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
taking in their Flags, planted other Enſigns in their
rooms, with the Imperial and Sicilian Arms joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Then the Admiral with the Squadron in the Rear entring
the Harbor, as it were to ſeiſe upon the place, as the Princeſſes
landed, there was a young woman of an exquiſite beauty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<hi>Venus,</hi> attended by divers <hi>Cupids,</hi> and two hundred
Virgins, who upon her knees delivered up the keyes of the
Caſtle, with the poſſeſſion of the whole Iſland, and the Palace,
which was a piece of excellent Architecture raiſed upon pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
ſome twenty paces from the water-ſide, and in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece
of the Porch, in great characters of gold, was written,
<hi>THE PALACE OF LOVE;</hi> Through which was
ſeen a ſpacious Garden, adorned with many artificial Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and Walks of Trees, bearing all manner of ripe fruits;
which being taken up by the roots, and ſet in ranks, made it
appear a place by long induſtry brought to an admirable
perfection.</p>
               <p>Here was prepared for them a ſumptuous Banquet, during
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61061:48"/>
the time whereof the Nymphs made ſuch a raviſhing Conſort
of muſick and voices, that it appeared indeed the heavenly
Palace of the divine Godeſs of Love: And the Collation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, the Tables on a ſudden vaniſhing out of ſight, the
Princeſſes remained ſeated upon a kind of Throne, which,
part of the Iſland at the ſame time falling away, remained even
with the water: When immediately out of the hollow of the
Rock whereon the Caſtle ſtood, appeared two Sea-monſters,
which drew after them a Chariot framed like a great ſhell, in
which ſate <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Thetis</hi> by themſelves, being followed
by divers other Chariots, drawn likewiſe by ſeveral Fiſhes
with little Boyes upon their backs blowing trumpets of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels;
in which were an infinite number of Sea-Gods and
Nymphs, who with voices and inſtruments made a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
harmony; and paſſing by the Princeſſes, <hi>Neptune</hi> as
in ſign of homage laid his Trident at their feet.</p>
               <p>Then entred into the haven a ſmall Gally with twenty oars,
at the head whereof ſtood <hi>Clitiphon</hi> brother to <hi>Artabaces,</hi> in
compleat armor richly gilt, repreſenting <hi>Mars,</hi> with all manner
of warlike inſtruments at his feet; and coming up to the throne,
preſented his Sword and Shield, in which was engraven this
Motto in Greek, <hi>Vanquiſhed by Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after entred two other Gallies, in the former
whereof was the young Prince <hi>Euripedon,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces,</hi>
clad like <hi>Paris,</hi> with a golden ball in his hand; and in
the other the three Goddeſſes, who eagerly purſued him for
that prize of beauty: But paſſing by the Princeſſes, he caſt
the ball amongſt them; whereupon the other Gally with the
Goddeſſes immediately making a ſtand, they celebrated the

                  </gap> appeared a Gally rowed by twelve Negro's clothed

in cloth of ſilver, the Stern guided by an old man repreſenting
<hi>Time,</hi> and upon a Shield of ſilver ſate <hi>Cupid</hi> triumphing with
a ſhaft in his hand, pierced through a heart; at whoſe feet lay
a Knight in plain ſilver-arms ſuitable to the ſhield, his helmet
by him, and his ſword and lance, broken into divers pieces.
But when the Gally came before the Princeſſes, and <hi>Cupid</hi>
delivered the Shaft to <hi>Mariana,</hi> ſhe was ſurpriſed with ſuch
a wonder, that her colour and countenance changing on a
ſudden, ſhe neither believed what ſhe ſaw to be real, nor had
the power to behold what ſhe imagined only an apparition:
Neither were the two Princeſſes leſs amazed at ſo unexpected
an object; <hi>Doriclea</hi> remembred perfectly the lineaments of
<hi>Demetrius</hi> face, and <hi>Clarinda</hi> by her bluſhes ſhewed ſhe had
never forgotten that perſon, whoſe vertues ſhe eſteemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable.</p>
               <p>But before they had recollected themſelves, whilſt they
remained gazing one upon another, the Gally being advanced
agen into the midſt of the harbor, with artificial fire-works
that were placed about it, ſeemed all in a bright flame, and as
it were by degrees conſuming, the Decks on a ſudden cloſing
agen, in an inſtant it ſunk under the water, leaving all the
company in an aſtoniſhment what art could produce ſo rare a
ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artabaces</hi> himſelf beheld it as miraculous, and approaching
to the Princeſſes, ſaid; Some Deity that inhabits this Lake,
in deriſion of our endeavours, hath now at length ſhewed it
ſelf to congratulate your preſence; for otherwiſe I confeſs my
ſelf as ignorant from whence it ſhould proceed, as unable to
comprehend the ſecret of ſo ſtrange a myſterie.</p>
               <p>But the Princeſſes who knew the vertue and power of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
made another conjecture, yet not ſeeming to take
farther notice of it for the preſent, they agen embarked, and
in the ſame manner they came to the Iſland, ſave only the
Sea-Chariots with their Muoick kept about the Admiral-Gally,
they went on to the City; where they received an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
ſuitable to the entry, but I know nothing more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61061:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the particulars: For the Prince being returned with <hi>Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleon</hi>
the Conductor, and inventor of the inviſible Gally, to
his houſe, having nobly rewarded his ingenuity, leſt enquiry
ſhould be made after him, immediately left the City; and but
once more had the happineſs to ſee the Princeſs in her paſſage,
which was at <hi>Stobi.</hi> Wherefore finding it was impoſſible,
whilſt ſhe was thus in continual motion, to effect his deſires
or approach her preſence, he retired to <hi>Salona</hi> a Port-town in
<hi>Albania,</hi> with a reſolution to hire a ſhip there, and with the firſt
occaſion to follow her into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come thither, we lay a while privately, till news came
that the Sicilian Fleet with the Princeſs was departed from
<hi>Epidaurus:</hi> And in the mean time having found a Captain of
a Veſſel, who for a good reward was willing to undertake the
voyage, we prepared our ſelves for our departure; when being
ready to embark, a ſtranger who likewiſe waited for a paſſage,
deſiring to be admitted into our company, the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
he was a perſon worthy reſpect, willingly condeſcended
thereunto; and the wind being fair, we preſently ſet ſail with
aſſured hopes of a ſuccesful voyage.</p>
               <p>Thus favored with a freſh gale, we advanced into the Main:
but towards the evening the wind ſo abated, that we ſcarcely
made any way at all, and ſix days and nights ſucceſſively after
were in a manner becalmed: Nevertheleſs at the end of the
ſeventh, we hoped with the next riſing Sun to diſcover the
Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

having from the main-top deſcried land, at the news
thereof aſcending upon the Deck, whilſt we ſtood with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
beholding the long wiſhed for ſhore afar off, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Gally with mighty force making towards us; which
when ſhe approached neerer, the Captain by her Colours
knowing to be a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> wiſhed us to prepare to fight, for it
was impoſſible, we having ſo little advantage of the wind, but
by the help of her oars ſhe would overtake our Veſſel, and if
ſhe were of the adverſe party to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> undoubtedly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61061:50"/>
Whereupon the Decks being cleered of incumbrances,
every one betook himſelf to ſuch weapons as were next at
hand; except only a young man about nineteen years of age,
in the habit of a Mariner, but whoſe extraordinary mein could
not be concealed under that baſe covering; who with his arms
folded upon his breaſt, his legs a-croſs, and a ſad countenance,
leaning againſt the Main-maſt, ſtood in that dejected poſture
as unconcerned in all our motions, or any thing elſe, but his
own ſorrowful thoughts. Which <hi>Demetrius</hi> firſt obſerving,
wondring at ſuch an indifferencie in a time that threatned ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of danger, and in a perſon whoſe goodly compoſition
promiſed a manly performance, ſtepping to him, ſaid, If thou
art what thy habit ſpeaks thee, why art thou ſo neglectful of
thy Captains command, or ſo careleſs of thy own ſafety, when
every man expects the encounter of an enemy, to remain thus
regardleſs of both? But either not hearing, or not minding
his words, he only looked up a little, and pulling his cap more
over his eyes, fixed himſelf agen in the ſame diſconſolate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and before the Prince could queſtion him farther, the
Gally having hailed our Veſſel, commanded the Captain to
ſtrike his Topſail, which he refuſing unleſs required in the
name of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> they preſently attacqued us, and being
grapled together, the <hi>Sicilians</hi> came on ſo vigorouſly, that in
an inſtant they leapt upon our decks; yet by the valour of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the Stranger that came with us, many of them
by the loſs of their lives found the error of their boldneſs, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
with diſmembred bodies, lay gored in their own blood,
bewailing their too much forwardneſs; and the reſt being
driven to deſpair, to avoid the fury of the Conquerors, were
ready to expoſe themſelves to the mercy of the waves.</p>
               <p>When the Captain of the Gally perceiving ſuch a ſlaughter
amongſt his men, and that they were not only like to loſe the
poſſeſſion of the Ship, which he eſteemed ſo eaſie a purchaſe,
that he had not vouchſafed his own preſence in the fight, but
his Gally likewiſe, if his men were ſo repulſed, to run the hazard
of being taken; incenſed with the diſgrace, with his ſword in

his hand, he flew like lightening into our ſhip, and his motions
were no leſs terrible to our almoſt wearied men: So that eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making a way through them, the Stranger, who had given
exemplary teſtimonies of a noble courage, was forced to a
little retreat, and even <hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf to retire two or three
ſteps backwards; but reaſſuring his footing, he advanced
upon him agen with a double force, and a terrible combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
between them two.</p>

the Captain of the Gally, like a Lyon rouſed from his ſleep, he
ſtept as enraged to the next man he encountred, and having
wreſted his ſword out of his hand, with a voice that threatned
deſtruction, he cryed out, To me, thou rebellious inhumane
monſter! for to me alone belongs the chaſtiſement of thy
horrible treaſons; and whoſoever ſeeks to ſhare with me in the
glory of my revenge, I defie him as an enemy.</p>
               <p>At which ſummons, the Captain, as receiving new vigor,
forſaking <hi>Demetrius,</hi> turned to the Mariner, whoſe prodigious
ſtrength was no leſs an admiration, then the occaſion of his
ſudden fury; for with the weight of his blows he compelled
his daring adverſary to retire, and having driven him to the
ſide of the ſhip, on a ſudden cloſing with him, thought as we
conjectured to have thrown him headlong into the Sea; but
ſtrugling ſo for maſtery, being faſt entwined in one anothers
arms, they fell both together overboard with a confuſed ſhout
and cry, both of our own and the adverſe party.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Neptune,</hi> who by the terrible claſhing of their
ſwords, as if ſummoned by <hi>Joves</hi> thunder, had been raiſed
from his profound manſions, to behold the iſſue of this furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conflict, aſtoniſhed with the prodigie of ſo much courage
in humane breaſts, and affrighted with their fall, leſt if they
periſhed in the Main, their ghoſts ſhould invade the peace of
his dominions, by the power of his Divinity conveyed them
ſafe into the Gally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where having looſened their hold, they
ſoon recovered their feet, and as ſoon, with the ſame eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61061:51"/>
as before, renewed the combat. But the Captain, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in the greateſt extremities he had a preſent judgment,
as ſoon as he perceived he was in his own Veſſel, content with
that prize which he then thought ſure his own, leſt we ſhould
follow after them, cryed out to his men preſently to unfaſten
the grapling irons; who were ſo ſpeedy and reſolute in the
execution of his command, that before we could force a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
they got free of our ſhip, and with main force made for
the ſhore; whilſt with afflicted minds that we were not able
to afford him any aſſiſtance, we beheld the Mariner alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
himſelf againſt the whole force of the Gally, and we
loſt the ſight both of him and it, before we perceived he was
vanquiſhed; for when we could no longer diſtinguiſh the
men, by the brandiſhing of their weapons in the air we knew
the fight was not yet ended. Which more then humane
proweſs ſeemed to veriſie thoſe antient fables of the Gods,
who upon ſeveral occaſions are feigned to have aſſumed the
ſhapes of inferior mortals.</p>
               <p>Nothing ever before cauſed greater admiration in <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
then this unexpected accident; nor ever any mans actions,
except only Prince <hi>Alexandro's,</hi> could make ſo great impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of an Heroick vertue. But when we had recompoſed our
ſelves and whilſt the ſhip was cleanſed, the hurt men provided
for, and the dead heaved over-board, we ſate in the Cabin
deſcanting thereon: As if the Gods had been offended that
we ſhould ſo partially attribute ſo much of miracle to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſame compoſition with our ſelves; To ſhew there
was ſomething above us both of greater power and terror, on
a ſudden covered the heavens with a mid-night darkneſs, and
at the ſame time looſening the winds from their obſcure dens,
which with hideous roaring invaded the boſom of the Ocean,
we had no other light, but what with horrible thunder break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the clouds, ſeeming to inflame the whole horizon,
menaced us with a fearful deſtruction; and the Sea, as if our
boaſting had been the cauſe of its diſturbance, with mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
waves threatned to overwhelm our frail Bark, which with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61061:51"/>
their impetuous beatings againſt her ſides, having at length
opened a plank, the Mariners forſaking their labour, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both themſelves and us to be devoured by that mercileſs
element.</p>
               <p>When the courage of the Stranger was in this remarkable,
that with threats of death overcoming their fears, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
them agen to work, ſome at the pump, and others to
endeavour the ſtopping of the leak; whilſt <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as once
the Trojan Heros in the like extremity, though not ſeiſed
with the like cold fear, ſtretching forth his hands to heaven,
implored the aſſiſtance of the divine powers, who pleaſed with
that humiliation, commanded the winds back agen to their
dark priſons, and unvailing the heavens, diſcovered certain
ſtars, which comforted us with the hopes of an enſuing day,
and with the day once more to enjoy the glorious light of
the Sun.</p>
               <p>Such was the efficacie of a pious devotion, that our wiſhes
were fully accompliſhed; but when day appeared, we found
the violence of the tempeſt had driven us many leagues from
the coaſts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and in a now ſtill calm, not left us without
almoſt as certain apprehenſions of danger: For, our Veſſel
had ſprung many leaks, and having no wind to drive us to
any Port, our only truſt was in the ſtrength of our arms, by
continual pumping to endeavor our preſervation; and though
death was now as neer as in the ſtorm, yet the terrors not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo great, our men having leſs apprehenſion thereof, with
wonderful alacrity continued their labour.</p>
               <p>In this manner we remained ten days floting upon the ſea,
without any certain hopes of ſuccor; and though we hoiſed
all our ſail, could ſcarcely perceive we made any way. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
at length we deſcried land, and by degrees, contrary to
all expectation, arrived in this road, within two leagues of the
ſhore; where our men, with much watching and extreme la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
of which though every one of us, and even the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
bore a ſhare, not able longer to continue, unleſs Boats came
to fetch us off, we were ſure before the next morning to periſh,</p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61061:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wherefore, notwithſtanding all the ſigns we had made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
no aid coming to us from the land, <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the
ſtranger, confident in their ſwiming, with a generous reſolution
expoſed themſelves to the ſea; with an aſſurance that if they
ſcaped themſelves, as in ſuch a calm they doubted not of their
ſtrength, they would ſend us a timely relief; which both they
and we, turning to <hi>Syneſius,</hi> have received by your noble care:
And now you know the perſon you have ſo highly obliged,
I hope you will not retract any of your favors, but for his ſake
pardon the many errors I have committed in my tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
eſpecially for deteining you ſo long at this time.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Alexandro</hi> infinitely delighted with this ſtory,
with many thanks kindly embraced <hi>Lyſander;</hi> and both he
and <hi>Syneſius</hi> having expreſſed a great ſatisfaction in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſo gallant a Prince, by a mutual conſent they returned
all agen to his appartement.</p>

Iuſt Gods! You have at length forced me to acknowledg
your power; I now ſee the vanity of my ambition, the malice
of my revenge, and the little confidence that is to be repoſed
in Armies; for I that ſo lately commanded multitudes which
threatned deſtruction to <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his poſterity, am now
left thus deſolate, forſaken of my friends, and unpittied by
my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But why do you not purſue your vengeance? Will you
ſuffer him ſtill to live, who hath been ſo vile a Traitor both to
his King and Country; and not only ſacrilegiouſly profaned
your Temples, violated the holy P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ieſthood, and deſpiſed
your Laws, but as in contempt of your divinity pulled down
your Altars, and thrown your ſacred Images on the earth?
Can you forbear to dart thunder againſt that breaſt which
hath harboured ſuch impieties? I have by degrees proceeded
to the heigth of all miſchiefs, and it is not now in my power
to provoke you farther: Therefore no longer delay your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>But death is too mild a chaſtiſement for offences of ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
a nature: The World, which I have abuſed, muſt be
a witneſs of my miſeries; <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whom I have injured,
receive a ſatisfaction in my ſufferings; and <hi>Eudoxia</hi> his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Queen, whoſe chaſtity I have defamed, triumph in my
overthrow.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Love,</hi> thou gentle Deity, to thee I appeal for mercy;
Thou kindleſt thoſe flames which ſought to conſume all that
oppoſed them. Had I not by thy command loved <hi>Artemia,</hi>
and ſhe by violence been taken from me, my other injuries
perhaps had been forgotten, and I had not thus been at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
both with Gods and men.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince thou haſt in ſome meaſure been the author
of my crimes, in compaſſion afford relief to my torments;
and if thy own darts have not the power to kill, borrow one
of death, and with a favorable wound pierce this heart, which
by thy inſtigation hath nouriſhed ſuch preſumptuous thoughts
not only againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> but even againſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61061:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heaven it ſelf. Whereupon <hi>Alexandro</hi> being no longer able to
contain his paſſion, riſing from his place, and drawing his
ſword, cryed out,</p>
            <p>Wicked <hi>Cenodoxius!</hi> for by thy crimes I know thy name;
dareſt thou think of death, and ſtill thus add to thy guilt?
Wilt thou make innocent <hi>Love,</hi> which never inſpired other
then noble thoughts, conſcious of thy bloody deſigns? Thou
haſt enough derided the divine myſteries of the Gods, and
vilifying their authority, rebelled againſt <hi>Antiochus:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Alexandro,</hi> the ſon of that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whoſe birth, if it had
been poſſible, would have been ſtained with thy baſe ſcandals
of <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> ſtands here armed with their power, as the miniſter
of their juſtice, to ſend thy ſoul to thoſe torments, if there be
any ſo horrid, that thy ills deſerve.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſword depends thy fate, which thou canſt not
poſſibly avoid: yet in thy defence ſhew thy ſelf worthy of
my revenge, that I may not repent thou hadſt the honour to
fall by theſe hands; which, if thou haſt not a courage, great
as thy miſchiefs, to encounter me, I ſhall wiſh had been the
act of an infamous executioner. To which <hi>Cenodoxius,</hi> who
when he firſt ſaw him approach in ſuch a poſture, ſtarted up
and ſtood upon guard, preſently replied,</p>
            <p>The world hath received ſuch teſtimonies of my valour,
that Prince <hi>Alexandro</hi> cannot be ignorant I dread not death,
much leſs any mortal encounter; and only chance hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to him that inward ſenſe of my proceedings, which his
ſword aſſiſted with the force of all his allies, nor the united
ſtrength of the whole Nation, nor the cruelty of tortures,
could ever have extorted from me.</p>
            <p>Yet know I repent not my own intentions, but lament in
my fall the riſe I have given to others to put in execution
their dangerous deſigns.</p>
            <p>What I have done was in a noble ſenſe of my ſufferings,
which were ſo injurious, that I believed the Gods would never
have forſaken ſo juſt a cauſe; and I will avow I was ambitious
to have had it in my power to revenge them, but was ever as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61061:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
far from intending any violence to the ſacred perſon of your
Royal Father, as I am now from lifting my arm againſt his
lawful Succeſſor, which ſhall never be, though provoked in the
juſt defence both of my life and honour; for I acknowledge
there belong to him as well a preſent reſpect, as a future obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Therefore if it were poſſible, I would flie this encounter:
But leſt he ſhould be apt to impute that to a degenerate cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe,
which proceeds only from a reverence to his birth, I
will remain here under the ſhelter of my ſword and ſhield; as
juſt men when <hi>Jove</hi> darts lightening upon the earth, retire
into their houſe, not that they fear the thunder, but becauſe
they will not defie his power: And thus guarded, my life is
ſecure as in an impregnable Fort, which apprehending neither
batteries nor aſſaults, ſends forth no forces, nor makes any
ſallies to repulſe the enemy.</p>
            <p>Yet if you will vouchſafe a parley, I ſhall upon eaſie terms
ſurrender up the place into your hands. I only deſire a patient
hearing of my wrongs, the redreſs I will leave to your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclinations: But if upon the recital of my ſtory you judge
me, though not blameleſs, unworthy of your compaſſion, and
ſtill deſpiſe that life, which perhaps will appear the only means
left for your preſervation, I ſhall patiently ſubmit to my own
misfortunes; but you will never be able to divert that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of confuſion, which, in <hi>Coraſtus</hi> new acquired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
threatens the total ſubverſion of this flouriſhing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
            <p>Whereupon making a ſtop; Thou do'ſt ſo gallantly, ſaid
the Prince, beg for thy life, that I almoſt begin to wiſh thou
wert leſs faulty, or that thou hadſt not ſpoke ſo well.</p>
            <p>Such an undauntedneſs of ſpirit in a lawful enemy, would
make me ambitious to embrace his friendſhip; but in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it is an inſolence ſo inſupportable, and the permiſſion of it
ſo deſtructive to the dignity of Princes, that hadſt thou no
other crime, I might in a juſt indignation, to ſuppreſs thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,
ſacrifice thy blood to my anger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61061:54"/>
Yet I ſo much love the reſemblance of vertue, for I cannot
deny the bravery of thy reſolution appears no leſs, that I am
content for a while to reſpite thy fate; and not to ſatisfie thy
deſire, but the world in the candor of my actions, will lend an
impartial ear to the relation of thy ſtory; of which already I
know ſo much, that though thy courage were equal to thy
boaſting, and thy ſecurity, under the defence of thy arms,
much more then thy vanity doth ſuppoſe, yet I could not
doubt with far leſs difficulty to force a paſſage through them
to thy diſloyal heart, then I have obtained this victory over
my ſelf, to delay the execution of my juſt revenge.</p>
            <p>However I give thee my word for thy ſecurity, till thy
diſcourſe be ended; but upon this aſſurance, for I ſuppoſe a
reconcilement impoſſible, that thou ſhalt afterwards prepare
in equal combat to receive the chaſtiſement due to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits;
though I confeſs I feel a ſtrange inclination within
my ſelf, to deſire that thou mightſt appear, after a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
worthy of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and my pardon.</p>
            <p>If I do not, replied <hi>Cenodoxius,</hi> I am content to accept of
your conditions; but I am as confident to be received into
your favor, as I am aſſured you are a Prince of a generous
magnanimous ſpirit, and being born to be a King, have ſuch
a publick ſoul, that for the general good you will forget all
perſonal injuries, or particular intereſts.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I deliver my ſelf into your hands; and
in teſtimony I deſire not henceforth to employ my ſword but
in your ſervice, thus proſtrate upon my knees, I lay it at
your feet.</p>
            <p>This was a ſtrange unexpected ſight to <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who when
he heard <hi>Alexandro</hi> was gone abroad, fearing ſome ill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
with <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in his company, went to ſeek him;
and imagining it moſt likely he was walked into the wood,
knowing the paſſages thereof, happened preſently upon the
place where he and <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> were together, at the very
ſame inſtant that in ſuch a ſubmiſſive poſture he delivered up
his ſword. Which cauſed in him no little wonder; for though
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61061:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he were ignorant who <hi>Alexandro</hi> was, he very well knew <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodoxius,</hi>
and that ſuch humiliations were very contrary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his cuſtom or humor. But he was ſurpriſed beyond all
imagination, when <hi>Alexandro</hi> putting forth his hand to raiſe
him up, ſaid, I receive this thy ſubmiſſion not as ſatisfactory,
but as the duty of a Subject: yet laying aſide my birth, and
the name of <hi>Alexandro,</hi> though I will not ſay I ſhould be glad
to find a cauſe to entertain thee as a friend into my boſom, I
cannot deny but I wiſh thy actions had not rendred thee ſo
odious.</p>
            <p>By which time having ſpied <hi>Syneſius,</hi> No more they had
not, he replied, if the prudent advice of this my noble Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
could have prevailed, who wiſely judging of the event,
diſſwaded me from the undertaking; and though I inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
rejected his counſel, I muſt, with pardon, crave leave
to embrace his perſon.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſtepping back, told him, he could not permit
his embraces, whoſe actions had rendred him odious to Prince
<hi>Alexandro;</hi> and though the neerneſs of his alliance had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been chiefly the cauſe of his diſgrace with the King, yet
he would now give that teſtimony of his loyalty, as not to
own a relation to his enemy.</p>
            <p>Then with one knee touching the ground, and kiſſing the
Princes hand, humbly beſought him to pardon thoſe errors he
had through ignorance committed: For though, as he had
often expreſſed, his genius ever aſſured him he was a perſon to
whom he ought to pay more then an ordinary duty, and that
there was ſomething in his countenance which he believed he
had formerly known; yet not having had the honour to ſee
him ſince he was a child, and not forgetting how unhappy he
was in the diſpleaſure of his Royal maſter, he was as far from
ſuppoſing him to be the Prince, as from the imagination that
he would be pleaſed to grace that Subjects roof with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
whoſe fidelity, through the malicious ſuggeſtions of
his adverſaries, was, though wrongfully, ſo much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61061:55"/>
When the Prince interrupting him, replied, I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
that the impreſſions I formerly received, if I had known
you ſooner, might perhaps have made me more ſcrupulous in
accepting the offer of your houſe: But beſides the obligation
at our firſt encounter, I have ſince obſerved ſuch a diſcerning
judgment in your diſcourſes, and ſo right a ſenſe of honor in
all your proceedings, that I believed it impoſſible you could
any way favour, or be engaged in ſo unworthy and unjuſt a
cauſe as the preſent war; and this accident hath but by a few
hours prevented the diſcovery I meant to make to you of the
perſon whoſe life you did preſerve, which I am reſolved ſo to
imploy in the vindication of your honor from thoſe ſcandalous
aſperſions of diſloyaltie, that the King finding his error, ſhall
at length in juſtice be forced to declare, that they who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly
in ſuch difficult times deprived him of ſo worthy a
Councellor, were no leſs his, then your enemies.</p>
            <p>But for the preſent let me prevail with you to give a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertainment to <hi>Cenodoxius;</hi> for in your preſence I will
hear the relation of his ſtory, and in the mean while engage
my promiſe, That though I cannot eaſily forget the injuries
paſt, I will neither look upon him as an enemy, nor yet by any
outward reſentment teſtifie that I believe him to be the author
of them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon not admitting any farther diſcourſe of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
he deſired <hi>Syneſius</hi> to be their guide to conduct them out
of the Wood; and going directly to his houſe, whilſt <hi>Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxius</hi>
diſarmed himſelf, went to viſit Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and
entring into the chamber, heard him, as he lay upon his bed,
utter theſe complaints.</p>
            <p>Oh Love! why art thou ſo cruel a tyrant to require ſuch a
ſtrict obſervance of thy laws, and wilt not afford thy vaſſals
the reward of their obedience? Which though I have ſerved
thee with ſo pure a devotion, I dare not preſume to hope, much
leſs to aſpire to the fruition of thoſe incomparable joyes, which
thou haſt ordained to be the only object of my felicity. Where
then ſhall I vent my moans, or of whom ſeek redreſs to my
ſufferings?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61061:56"/>
Of whom, replied Prince <hi>Alexandro,</hi> but of thy friend?
Who being a witneſs of thy conſtant love, will be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to procure thy ſatisfaction; and either <hi>Mariana</hi> muſt
gratefully acknowledg her happineſs in the acquiſition of ſo
noble a Lover, or elſe diſclaim the intereſt which <hi>Alexandro,</hi>
as a Brother, may juſtly pretend to in her affection.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Demetrius</hi> caſting himſelf at his feet, and embracing
his knees, I cannot, ſaid he, more reverence the perſon of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandro,</hi>
knowing him the heir of a mighty Monarch, then I
did before in his reſemblance of the divine <hi>Mariana:</hi> But that
from ſuch a heigth he can deſcend ſo low as to compaſſionate
my miſeries, ſtrikes me with no leſs admiration of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
then the conſciouſneſs of my own demerits makes me
apprehenſive of her cruelty.</p>
            <p>She muſt be cruel to herſelf, replied the Prince, and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Alexandro,</hi> if with the ſame tenderneſs of affection as he
doth now, ſhe receive not his friend <hi>Demetrius</hi> into her boſom.</p>
            <p>Then caſting his arms about his neck, they remained both
a while mute; till <hi>Alexandro</hi> firſt breaking ſilence, ſaid,
With what an exceſs of joy could I thus for ever embrace my
friend, if like him I might at length hope to ſee the period of
my ſufferings?</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Lyſander</hi> entring into the room, interrupted
their farther Careſſes; and underſtanding who <hi>Alexandro</hi> was,
kneeling down to kiſs his hand, beſought him to pardon the
over-great liberty he had preſumed to uſe in his preſence:
which though it had been a known fault, would have been

               <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> having by <hi>Syneſius</hi> deſired to be admitted to his

               <p>THe juſteſt actions are are not always followed with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
not the moſt wicked deſigns ever reproachful

cenſured, or eſteemed according to the ſucceſs: But it
is the conſtant fate of great undertakers, that if they fail in their
attempts, they not only loſe their fortunes, but withall the
reputation either of conduct or valour. Therefore I will not
ſeek by arguments to maintain a cauſe, which is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
becauſe it hath miſcarried; though I may truly boaſt,
not through either of thoſe defects: Neither was I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to my ſelf of thoſe ignoble principles deſtructive to

that in conſidering the vaſt ruines of my party, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61061:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will without farther circumſtance enter into the narration of
my ſtory; by which you will perceive, that though in the
late defeat of my forces the ſuperſtructure were demoliſhed,
a foundation ſtill remains whereupon Prince <hi>Alexandro</hi> may
build to himſelf a more abſolute Empire, then any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
ſince with victorious arms they firſt gained the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of this Nation, durſt ever aſpire unto.</p>
               <p>This preamble, to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who were
ſtrangers, and unacquainted with inſolence in Subjects, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very unſuitable to the condition of a vanquiſhed Rebel
in the preſence of his natural Prince, which by their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
they ſeemed to expreſs: But <hi>Alexandro,</hi> who very
well knew the vain-glory of the perſon, and being beſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to hear with patience what he would ſay, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt diſtaſte, deſired him to proceed: And the reſt
thereupon ſetling themſelves in a poſture of attention, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in this manner.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the original of my diſgraces, and of the troubles
in which this Nation is now involved, I muſt look back ſome
few years to the reign of <hi>Theodora,</hi> who though by a doubtful
claim ſhe got poſſeſſion of the Crown, through a ſeeming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity
brought the people into a ſlaviſh obedience: And not
only the Natives, but foreign Princes, and even a Queen as
abſolute in dominion as her ſelf, who if not before her in right,
the acknowledged heir of this Kingdom, by whoſe title the
King your father now ſits upon the throne, felt the bloody
effects of her tyrannie.</p>
               <p>But however the legality of her ſucceſſion were queſtionable,
having once aſſumed the government, ſhe entertained thoſe
Maxims which moſt conduced to the eſtabliſhment of her
power.</p>
               <p>Wherefore knowing that a Prince who will be abſolute,
muſt either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61061:57"/>
of the people; and being in her nature cruel and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
ſhe thought ſeverity the moſt certain means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
her deſigns: Nevertheleſs ſurpaſſing even all her ſexe in
the art of diſſembling, ſhe ſo vailed it over with a mask of
affability, that though ſhe were reſolved to make her will a
law, yet ſhe appeared to the vulgar the moſt ſubmiſs of women,
and was believed to have neither affections nor deſires, but
what tended only to the common good: Inſomuch that her
moſt violent proceedings were thought forced by a publike
neceſſity; her unjuſt wars abroad in foſtering rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſubjects of neighbouring Princes, pious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
for the relief of the diſtreſſed; her frequent oppreſſions
at home, ſtudied policies for the preſervation of her Countries
liberty; her violation of the laws, a watchful providence for
the protection of juſtice; and which was moſt admirable, her
profound diſſimulations real vertues, and an innate tenderneſs
of affection to the people; by which ſhe ſo won their hearts,
who judge only by outward appearances, that the great ones,
who chiefly groaned under her tyrannie, though they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her artifices, durſt not ſeek to undeceive them; but whilſt
ſhe lived, they reverenced her as their common mother and
Protectrix, after her death deified her, and have ever ſince
offered annual ſacrifices to her memory.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>btleties by which ſhe deluded the world,
it was her chiefeſt glory to maintain the name and reputation
of the <hi>Virgin-Queen,</hi> pretending that having wedded the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Intereſts, ſhe could not confine her love to any particular
object: But indeed neither her pride would ſuffer her to admit
a Companion in the Empire, nor her variable deſires to be
confined to the chaſte embraces of the nuptial bed.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding being often preſſed and ſupplicated by
her dear Children, for ſo fawningly ſhe called the people, by
the choice of a Royal husband, to permit them at leaſt to hope
continuation of their preſent happineſs to their poſterity, which
they could no way expect but by the eſtabliſhment of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in the iſſue of ſo gracious a Princeſs; though ſhe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61061:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meant nothing leſs, yet upon occaſions to ſerve her own ends,
which without regard of the future, were only to maintain a
vaſt uncontrolled power in herſelf during her own life, ſhe
many times ſeemed to comply with their deſires, and by this
bait appeaſed the fury of divers neighbouring Princes, who
whilſt ſhe entertained them with the hopes of joyning this
Kingdom to their own by an alliance, neither aſſiſted one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
againſt the invaſion of her Armies, nor ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the injuries received in their own perſons.</p>
               <p>To omit divers others, A great example of the advantages
ſhe gained by this cuning practice, was that notable overthrow
given to the Imperial Navy: For having by her allurements
brought <hi>Hipolito</hi> Prince of <hi>Iſtria</hi> into a belief that ſhe meant
to marry him, the hopes of a Crown, though otherwiſe his
vertue was the glory and emulation of that age, made him ſo
far forgetful of his vertue, that upon ſeveral pretences and
punctilio's of command, retarding thoſe ſuccors which from
the Iſlands that were under his government ſhould have join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he gave the Queen leiſure to raiſe a
mighty force both by ſea and land; and whilſt the Emperors
Fleet hovered about theſe coaſts in expectation of his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
it was by a terrible ſtorm for the moſt part ſo broken
and ſhattered, that <hi>Marcellus</hi> our Admiral obtained an eaſie
victory over the remainder of that invincible Armado.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theodora</hi> being once paſt her fears, <hi>Hipolito</hi> ſoon found
how he had been deluded by the vain hopes of an imaginary
greatneſs; and by that wonderful ſucceſs being now freed
from all apprehenſions of a foreign enemy, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perſeverance would in the end produce nothing but a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

treaties, and at length wholly deſiſted from their addreſſes.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Queen ſeeming ſtill deſirous to ſatisfie her
people; and having by her inſtruments inſtilled into them as
it was eaſie for her to work them any way, that a ſtrange alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61061:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would be prejudicial to their liberties, ſhe began to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
to the world, that ſhe intended to provide them a Father
indeed, by making a worthy choice amongſt the Nobles and
Princes of her own Nation. Under which pretence admiting
divers Favorites to a more then ordinary familiarity, as often
as her fancie pleaſed, diſgraced ſome, and advanced others to
the ſame hopes: But amongſt all thoſe who were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as capable of ſo great an honor as the fruition of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
incomparable Queen, none was more worthy, though
none had ſo ſad an experience of her pride and inconſtancie, as
the noble <hi>Heraclius</hi> my unfortunate father.</p>
               <p>He was by a long continued deſcent of famous anceſtors,
though born a Subject, a fit pretender to a Crown; By his
glorious atchievements both at home and abroad, though
young in years, grown old in the eſteem and admiration of
the people; And as if the Gods by the excellence of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
had intended to raiſe him to a fortune equal to his
merits, the beauty of his perſon, his meine, and deportment
conſidered together, had ſuch a powerful influence, that even
the chaſteſt Virgins, to maintain their vertue, contended for
his love; but all their hopes and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſtations ended, when
they perceived that thoſe perfections were now become the
ſo e object of the ungrateful <hi>Theodora's</hi> affection.</p>
               <p>At firſt by eminent employments ſhe drew him to a neerneſs
about her perſon, which he ſo diſcharged both to his own and
her honour, that the favors ſhe caſt upon him ſeemed but the
juſt rewards of his ſervice: Then at times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etting fall ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
ſpeeches, ſhe emboldened him to pretenſions of a higher
nature, which though either through modeſty, or prudence,
knowing the fickleneſs of womens paſſions, be ſeemed not to
underſtand, yet he wanted neither a noble ambition to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
nor a genereſity of courage to ſtruggle with thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
which either through envy, or competitors were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in his way to the throne of Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>But whilſt things hung thus in ſuſpence, an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſeemed to remove all obſtacles on every ſide, which to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61061:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the world might both juſtifie <hi>Thedora's</hi> love, and entitle <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi>
to a more then common intereſt in her affection.</p>
               <p>Though the Queen were now in the heigth of all her glory,
victorious over her enemies, and generally beloved by her own
people, yet there wanted not thoſe both at home and abroad,
who maligning her proſperity, when they ſaw open force could
not prevail, ſought by ſecret machinations to deprive her both
of life and Empire; amongſt which, her greateſt, and then
moſt powerful adverſary, was <hi>Valentinianus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who, beſides the affronts and indignities he received from her,
had ever favored the title of <hi>Aurelia</hi> Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who
being her Competitor for the Crown, ſhe then deteined in a
miſerable impriſonment, and afterwards, when there was no
oppoſition to awe her tyrannie, under a formal ſhew of Juſtice
moſt barbarouſly murthered: Which the Emperor either
foreſeeing, or at leaſt endeavouring to prevent, had long ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
her deliverance; but finding no ſubmiſſions or entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
could procure her liberty, had ſet on and aſsiſted the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
to invade this Kingdom; but when that deſign failed,
lamenting the misfortunes of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and his own want of
power in not being able at that time to afford her relief, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storax</hi>
a valiant Commander amongſt the Romans, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no authoriſed by the Emperor was never certainly
known, undertook by a deſperate courſe at once both to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Maſters revenge, and to free the diſtreſſed Queen from
the oppreſsions of her uſurping adverſary.</p>
               <p>Wherefore aſſuming the habit of a Merchant, he ſoon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and having ſome time frequented the Court,
under pretence of ſeveral Negotiations, as was very well
known to thoſe by whom he made his addreſſes: One day
as the Queen was walking in a garden, attended by <hi>Heraclius</hi>
with divers other Lords and Ladies, taking that advantage to
put his enterpriſe in execution, he preſented her with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
which whilſt ſhe was peruſing, he ſecretly drew from
under his mantle a ſhort dagger; but as he lift up his hand to
give the fatal blow, <hi>Heraclius</hi> perceiving his treacherie, at
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61061:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſame inſtant ſteping between, received a terrible wound
under his right pap; yet nothing daunted either with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or the ſuddenneſs of the accident, the poignard remaining
behind, he pulled it immediately out of his own boſom,
and ſtuck it in the Aſſaſins heart.</p>
               <p>Then turning about to <hi>Theodora,</hi> The Gods, ſaid he, have
this day ſhewed their juſtice in your protection. But as he was
about to continue his ſpeech, through the abundance of blood
that iſſued from his wounds, his ſpirits begining to fail, he fell
proſtrate at her feet, and with a faint voice uttered only theſe
words; Madam, I die, but die contented, ſince I have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
my life for your preſervation.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Queen, who knew not any cauſe ſhe had to
fear, till at the ſame time ſhe ſaw both the Traitor weltring in
his blood upon the ground, and the dear preſerver of her life
ready to expire his lateſt breath, ſhe could no longer ſuppreſs
that paſſion, which till then ſhe had ſo artificially concealed;
but breaking out into a deſperate rage, ran furiouſly to the
dead body of <hi>Castorax,</hi> and ſetting her foot upon his throat,
drew the poignard out of his ſide, which aiming at her own
breaſt, ſhe perceived certain characters engraven upon the
blade thereof, and pauſing a little to peruſe them, read this
inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Caſtorax</hi> a true born Roman</l>
                     <l>To <hi>Theodora</hi> the Barbarian.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In conſidering whereof, having ſomething recollected her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Are theſe, ſaid ſhe, the Regalio's, thoſe boaſters of their
own vertue prepare for Princes? Barbarous <hi>Theodora</hi> indeed,
if thou ſhouldſt thus abandon thy life, which now more then
ever thou art bound to cheriſh, that thy juſt vengeance may
become the terror of theſe blood-thirſty Romans.</p>
               <p>Then falling upon <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and as ſhe embraced him put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one hand under his head, and the other upon his wound,
with a pale trembling countenance, the Index both of ſorrow
and wrath, burſt out into theſe expreſſions:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61061:60"/>
I will, if it be poſſible, ſtop this paſſage through which thy
ſoul ſlies ſo ſwift away towards the Elyſianſhades, as eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the love of a Queen too mean a reward for the merit of
ſuch an heroick action.</p>
               <p>But why wert thou ſo generous, to raiſe that hidden fire in
my boſom to ſuch a mighty flame, if thou wilt now leave me
to be conſumed by it?</p>
               <p>The Gods have allotted me too ſad a fate, if I could not
live but by thy death, and yet have ordained my life to be
inſeparable from thine.</p>
               <p>When ſighs interrupting her ſpeech, ſhe laid her mouth ſo
cloſe to his, that ſhe ſeemed to breathe into him her own ſoul;
for holding her hand ſtill upon his wound, which ſtopped the
blood, he liſt up his eyes a little, and looked her in the face,
but immediately cloſed them agen. Whereupon ſhe cryed
our,</p>
               <p>Ah do not ſo unkindly leave me! Live, my <hi>Heraclius,</hi> live
to add the glory of thy revenge to that of thy ſuffering: She
intreats thee to live, for whoſe ſake thou wert ſo willing to die;
Or if thy eyes are now ſhut for ever, let thy ſpirit hover a
while about this place, to hear the vows, which in ſtead of
tears, that would aſſwage, if not extinguiſh the heat of a noble
paſſion, I here offer to appeaſe thy offended ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Be witneſs, O you Gods! I henceforth declare a profeſſed

or if amongſt the Gods any can be ſo unjuſt to protect ſuch

love their Queen, and reverence her authority, more then
they fear his thunder; and in contempt of his power I will
ſet up Onions, or Cats, or what my own fancie ſhall beſt like
to be adored in his chiefeſt Temples.</p>
               <p>As ſhe uttered theſe horrible blaſphemies againſt the divine
Powers, which were enough to fright even the dead out of
their graves, <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſtirred a little and fetched a great
groan; inſomuch that the Phyſitians, who were inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called, being come upon the place, and perceiving motion
in him, gave ſome hopes that his condition was not altogether
deſperate; and deſiring the Queen to commit him to their
care, which by the perſwaſions of the Lords that were about
her ſhe willingly granted, they conveyed him to his lodging,
and having ſearched his wound, aſſured her the danger was
not great, unleſs the abundance of blood which he loſt had too
much weakned him: But when they had applied their remedies,
and given him ſome Cordials, the ſigns of his amendment were
more apparent; for in a ſhort time he recovered his ſpeech,
and not long after took a little reſt, to which <hi>Theodora</hi> with
infinite joy for the preſent left him.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs her deſire of revenge was nothing abated, but
immediately aſſembling her Councel, after unheard of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties

were preſently condemned to dye by moſt cruel tortures;
nor therewith ſatisfied, the enacted a law, that thoſe who were
found for the future ſhould be procceded againſt with the like

               <p>No Province, City, Town or Village, but was filled with
blood and ſlaughters: For by reaſon of the ſtrict league that

the Kings of this Iſland, the Romans lived promiſcuouſly
amongſt the Sicilians, as if they had been one people: but
now ſuch was the zeal they bore to their Queen, that when
they heard of the attempt made by one of that Nation againſt
her life, they ran headlong in multitudes to deſtroy them;
Children delivered their parents, parents their children, and
wives their husbands into the hands of their perſecutors;
Infants were torn from their Mothers breaſts, and even Prieſts

and no leſs revengeful in his reſolutions then <hi>Theodora,</hi>
yet proceeding with more moderation, ſent Ambaſſadors to
diſavow the fact of <hi>Castorax,</hi> and withal to deſire a ceſſation
from the ſlaughter of his innocent ſubjects. Which was only
to mitigate the Queens rage, if it were poſſible, until ſuch time
that he had prepared an Army for their defence, and her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement</p>
               <p>But theſe modeſt ſollicitations on the one ſide rendred her
more inſolent; and <hi>Valentinianus</hi> on the other loſt no time in
compleating his Army, which was already encreaſed to a
formidable number; ſo that the Ambaſſadors, who were
ſcornfully treated, had no ſooner ſet ſail for <hi>Italy,</hi> but they
were ready, if not prevented, to arrive upon our coaſts; and
the report of their force ſtruck ſuch a terror into <hi>Theodora,</hi> that
her thoughts were for the preſent diverted from the ſoft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61061:61"/>
of a Lovers embraces. The only care now was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the fury of this terrible ſtorm; the Ports are ſecured, the
Nobles conſulted, and the people by invective declarations
againſt the Romans animated to their juſt defence. But the
reſult of all lay in her own boſom, which at that time was open
only to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> whom ſhe appointed Generaliſſimo of all
her forces both by ſea and land; and when all things were in
a readineſs for this great expedition, retiring one day into her
Cabinet, ſhe ſpake to him in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heraclius,</hi> how high thou art in my eſteem, thy own merits
may aſſure thee; for I have never been ungrateful for the leaſt
benefit received from any the meaneſt of my ſubjects, but to
thee I owe the preſervation of my life with the apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of thy own; which being an obligation of the higheſt
nature, thou mayſt juſtly expect from me whatſoever is in me
to give: Wherefore I have already inveſted thee with the
power, and when thou returneſt victorious, as it were a ſin
to doubt of thy ſucceſs, I may without exceptions of the moſt
envious, beſtow upon thee with my ſelf, the title and dignity
of a King.</p>
               <p>Remember then, it is not ſame alone for which thou art
now to fight, nor the ſpoil of the enemy, nor thy Princes
honor, nor the publick good, thoſe ordinary incitements that
draw all generous ſpirits into action, but for thy own proper
intereſt, and the eſtabliſhment of the Crown upon thy ſelf and
thy poſterity: which can never be, unleſs together with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Romans power, we raiſe an irreconcileable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
between the two Nations, who otherwiſe, having lived
hapyily ſo many ages in a firm league of amity, will perhaps
when they feel the inconveniences of a war, deſire to unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and our ſubjects, to purchaſe their own peace with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
relinquiſh that cauſe, which now through a blind zeal
of affection they are ſo forward to maintain.</p>
               <p>For thou art not ignorant through what difficulties I have
paſſed to the Crown, nor with what a conſtancie the Emperor
<hi>Valentinianus</hi> hath adhered to <hi>Aurelia's</hi> party, under a falſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61061:62"/>
ſuppoſition, not only that my birth was illegitimate, but that
<hi>Dyoniſius</hi> my father did at his death by a ſolemn teſtament
deprive me of the ſucceſſion; which though maliciouſly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
are pretences that ſtrongly oppugne the conſervation
both of my life and honor: For as well the laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as likewiſe the ſtrict dictates of the Gods, do under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
penalties forbid that the ſcepter of this Iſland ſhould be
polluted by the hand of a ſpurious iſſue. And though by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
and diſſimulations, to ſpeak truly, unworthy the dignity
of a Queen, I have ſo gained the hearts of the people, that
hitherto for the moſt part they have given but little credit to
thoſe ſcandalous aſperſions; yet being in their nature ſickle
and unconſtant, we ſhall be too much wanting to our ſelves, if
we neglect any means wahtſoever to prevent the danger of a
future alteration.</p>
               <p>I will no longer therefore conceal from thee thoſe ſecret
coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>els which have ſo long labored in my boſom for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery:
And be not ſtartled at my reſolutions; for though at
the firſt view they may ſeem to carry a face of horror, yet
once brought to maturity, they will appear the beautiful iſſue
of Piety and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Know then that the chief tye between the people of this
Country and the Romans, is the unanimous conſent of both
Nations in matters of Religion; which knot nothing can
diſſolve, but by diſcovering to the world the luxury, pride,
and avarice of the Prieſts and Flamens, and by that means to
work them to a deteſtation of the Roman Gods, the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
various adoration whereof are indeed either the vain
Chimera's of ſuperſtitious brains, or elſe the ſubtile inventions
of wicked Polititians, introduced only by a ſpecious ſhew of
devotion to tyranniſe over mens conſciences, and by bringing
them into an awful reverence of their divine power, to ſerve as
bottomleſs gulfs to devour the vaſt treaſure of whole families
provinces and kingdoms.</p>
               <p>For what elſe are the ſeveral names given to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but
ſo many effects of his power; and all the other rabble of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61061:62"/>
Gods, but the ſundry attributes or influences of his divinity?
Yet thoſe divers names are honored with ſeveral Temples, and
different ceremonies; and the heavenly vertues or divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
which flow from him only, are reverenced as ſo
many diſtinct Deities with peculiar rites and ſacrifices. Yet
not content with thoſe deluſions, but to accommodate their
Religion to all ſorts of inclinations, the drunken feaſts of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> the immodeſt Lupercals, and even the beaſtly God
<hi>Priapus</hi> himſelf are held in no leſs veneration then the Goddeſs
of Temperance, <hi>Minerva,</hi> or the moſt chaſte <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not then evident that this multiplicity of Godheads is
only to increaſe a blind zeal amongſt the vulgar, and by the
infinite number of ſacrifices and oblations to enrich and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
the ſlothful luxury of their attendants? into whoſe ſtore
all kind of humors empty their ſuperfluities, and even the moſt
neceſſitous increaſe their own wants to add to their abundance;
inſomuch that the Prieſts doe in every Province enjoy the
goodlieſt poſſeſſions; and they who ought to be examples of
humility, are grown ſo inſolent with their wealth, that they
dare conteſt with the chief Nobles and Princes of the land;
nay, their pride is ſo exorbitant, that they have often ſtrugled
for power with our Predeceſſors, and do to this day exempt
themſelves from the juriſdiction and authority of our
lawes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, not to hold thee longer in ſuſpence, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to launce theſe peſtilent tumors; which otherwiſe will
ulcerate the whole body of the State; beſides, it were a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
folly to permit thoſe to have the directions of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
conſciences, who tacitly diſavow our right of ſucceſſion,
and at the ſame time to engage them againſt an enemy whoſe
principles are the ſame, and their quarrel grounded on no other
pretence.</p>
               <p>No, my <hi>Heraclius,</hi> ſince we cannot by any other mean
procure our own ſafety, we muſt no longer ſuffer theſe idle
ſuperſtitions to reign amongſt us. Yet that both Nobility
and people may be the rather induced to like the change;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61061:63"/>
and not imagine it proceeds from any intereſt of our own,
they muſt be enriched with the ſpoils of theſe domineering
Flamens and their adherents; but eſpecially the Souldiers,
who being ever leaſt ſcrupulous in matters of Religion, will,
when they ſee it ſo much concerns their own profit, need no
provocation to haſten their ruine, and ever after with a more
ſtedfaſt reſolution maintain the juſtice of our cauſe.</p>
               <p>If therefore thou concurreſt with me in opinion, we will
immediately put this deſign in execution, and henceforth no
God ſhall be acknowledged in <hi>Sicily</hi> but the omnipotent <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
whoſe Images we will adore by the name of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian
Jupiter,</hi> yet with a limited devotion, and ſuch rites as
may beſt ſuit with the politick maxims of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and as for the reſt, their Prieſts and ſuperſtitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aboliſhed, they ſhall be expoſed to the rapine of thoſe who
are moſt forward to ſeiſe upon the prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heraclius</hi> with no little aſtoniſhment, but with exceeding
attention obſerved the iſſue of this diſcourſe; and whether
convinced with her reaſons, or knowing it in vain to oppoſe
her will, and that not to comply was inſtead of advancement
to procure his own ruine, finding ſhe expected an anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any deliberation, made this reply.</p>
               <p>Moſt illuſtrious Princeſs, I can neither ſufficiently admire
your wiſdom, nor give a due commendation of the ſtudious
care you have ever ſhewn for the welfare of your people;
but that you ſhould make one ſo unworthy as my ſelf the
object of your favor, is a goodneſs ſo far beyond all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
as the poor inconſiderable ſervices of your Vaſſal
<hi>Heraclius</hi> are from the ambition of aſpiring to ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as the affection of the moſt excellent <hi>Theodora;</hi> yet to

I am in that no more deficient then the moſt potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of the earth; for though they may lay Crowns and
Scepters, and the Trophies of conquered Nations at your

feet, yet they cannot be ſo vain to boaſt an offering that may
deſerve the love of ſo incomparable a Queen: It is your cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
alone can create ſuch a world of merit; which if
you lay upon theſe ſhoulders, ſhall be as ſtrongly ſupported
as <hi>Atlas</hi> doth the immenſe fabrick of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot promiſe more, nor will I perform leſs; and to
teſtifie I am as ready to comply with your deſires, as free
from the ſervile flattery of ignoble ſpirits, your pleaſure once
declared, the inſulting Flamens ſhall ſoon feel the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to their demerits: Yet conſider, I beſeech you, the
dangerous conſequence of ſuch violent alterations; and if
whilſt you thus endeavor to ſecure your ſelf, you open not a
way to the extirpation of your poſterity; for it is only the
fear of the Gods, and of infringing their laws, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
amongſt the people the Prerogatives of Princes, as
deputed to them for the adminiſtration of their divine juſtice;
nor is it improbable, that to add a greater reverence to their
perſons, they have by degrees ſuffered the increaſe of theſe
ſuperſtitions, as pious frauds, both to preſerve the dignity of
their office, and a civil union amongſt men; therefore in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing
them you may perhaps deſtroy the tenure of your
own power: however it is apparent, when you embolden the
vulgar with prophane hands to violate thoſe things which in
all ages have been reputed ſacred, at the ſame time you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them to vilifie and deſpiſe the authority of Kings;
for if they once perceive the holy myſteries of the Gods
have not been exempt from error, upon the leaſt ſuggeſtion
of turbulent diſcontented ſpirits, they will eaſily believe
that Princes their Vicegerents have through ambition uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a tyrannical juriſdiction, and then the Sacred Unction
cannot protect them from the rage of popular innovation;
but the multitude contemning all humane dictates, the Regal
Ornaments will become the deriſion, and the Flowers of the
Crown the Trophies of their fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61061:64"/>
Beſides, it is not unworthy our moſt ſerious thoughts, that
as Religion is the chief obligation which preſerves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of particular people amongſt themſelves, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Nations one with another, ſo it is the faireſt pretence for
factious Contrivers to ſtir up domeſtick Rebellions, or for
foreign Princes, being ambitious of Empire, to invade the
Territories of their neighbors. And though amongſt your
ſubjects, ſome will undoubtedly without difficulty approve
of the change, others for their profit comply, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part perhaps through fear ſubmit to the preſent exigence;
yet education hath ſo powerful an influence upon the mindes
of men, that they who have been bred in them, will never be
drawn to forſake their errors, but be ready to embrace any
occaſion whatſoever to embroil the State, through hopes
that in a general confuſion an opportunity may occur to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
agen their antient ſuperſtitions: And ſtranger Princes,
under a pretended deteſtation of our new received opinions,
though indeed to make a miſerable prey of this ſo diſtracted
Kingdom, will not only renounce their former leagues,
but be ſtill ready to foment the fire that ſhall ſet all in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion.</p>
               <p>And though our habitation be indeed ſtrongly fenced in
with the Sea, and ſeparated from all the reſt of the world,
yet we are ſo ſmall a parcel of it, that we cannot poſſibly
think long to ſubſiſt, if we live at defiance with the whole race
of mankind: which, if we ſet up a new Religion, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heard of, or received in any other Clime or Region, muſt
inevitably follow; for our old Allies will forſake us, and if
we ſeek for new, the moſt barbarous Nations will refuſe
us for their friends, who have been ſo unconſtant to our
Gods.</p>
               <p>When therefore our Iſland, as the beſt policed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
are ſubject to mutability, ſhall either be infeſted
with civil diſſentions, or elſe lie open to the oppreſſions of
ſome formidable Invader, having neither charity amongſt
our ſelves one to another, nor the compaſſion of friends from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61061:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abroad, being deſtitute of help, and utterly deprived of all
external ſupport, it will appear like a poor ſmall weather-beaten
Bark floting in the midſt of the Ocean, and miſerably
toſſed with ſtorms and tempeſts; whilſt the deſpairing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
beholding her ſails torn with the wind, her tackling
fail, her maſts ſhivered, her anchors loſt, the rudder broken,
and their whole Veſſel full of leaks, terrified with the horror
of their preſent danger, both loſe the uſe of reaſon to aſſiſt
themſelves, and in vain implore the aſſiſtance of the heavens,
having neither Compaſs, nor Mariner, nor Pilot, nor ſo much
as the glimmering light of any favorable ſtar to conduct them
ſafe to a ſecure harbor.</p>
               <p>I may therefore under favor ſuppoſe, that though what
you have deſigned is moſt congruent to the preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your affairs, yet perchance the moſt certain means to
eſtabliſh your Empire for the future, will be to let things reſt
as they are, and to conclude a happy peace with the Emperor
<hi>Valentinianus,</hi> though purchaſed at any rate, ſo he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
<hi>Aurelia's,</hi> and acknowledge your, Title: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
I am ready to execute your juſt commands; and this
arm, ſupported with your power, ſhall either depopulate the
vaſteſt Regions of the habitable world, or ſecure you from
the apprehenſion of your Enemies.</p>
               <p>Oh my better Genius! replied the Queen; it is no marvel
thou haſt ſuch an attractive power over my affections,
ſince both our ſouls ſeem inſpired with the ſame thoughts,
and governed by the ſame principles. Theſe reaſons thou
haſt now put into the ballance, have long ſtrugled with my
reſolutions; and if either by Treaties, or the mediation of
Allies, or by incredible ſubmiſſions, or any other means
whatſoever I could have contracted a peace with <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
I ſhould never have proceeded to ſuch extremities;
and you may eaſily believe it is not choice, but neceſſity, that
at length forces me to it: For during the reign of <hi>Euphemia</hi>
my elder ſiſter, when I was cruelly perſecuted by the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mens,
as ſuſpected to have an averſion to their Gods, did I not by

oaths and proteſtations, and a ſtrict obſervance of all the uſual
rites and ceremonies, aſſure my ſiſter of my conſtancie in that
belief wherein I had been bred? And if you will imagine me
ſo wicked to have diſſembled then for my own ſecurity, why,
ſince the power hath been in my ſelf, have I not freely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my opinions? You ſee I have not yet ſince my coming
to the Throne, either in my own private practice, or in the
publick ſolemnities altered any thing of the antient forms;
but to ſhew my zeal to that profeſſion, received my Crown,
and the holy Unction from the Roman Flamens, aud have
hitherto maintained Ambaſſadors at <hi>Rome,</hi> by declaring my
ſincere intentions to continue ſtill the ſame league and union
with the Emperor, to obtain his approbation of my Title:
But ſince he is ſo obſtinate not to depart from <hi>Aurelia's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and nothing can induce him to hearken to any terms of
reconciliation, We muſt, if it be poſsible, by rooting out his
faction, diſenable him to offend us.</p>
               <p>This is the moſt viſible remedy for the preſent evil; and
future ages, as we do now, muſt ſuit their councels according
to the different revolutions of their affairs.</p>
               <p>Purſue therefore, with an undaunted courage, in my ſafety,
thy own greatneſs: But let us no longer loſe time in diſcourſing
of what ought already to be put in execution. And thereupon
taking a Ring from her finger, ſhe brake it aſunder, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the one half thereof to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> I conjure thee, ſaid
ſhe, to preſerve this, as I will do the other part, in teſtimony
of my promiſe that thou ſhalt hereafter enjoy with me an

our mutual fidelity: And if in thy abſence during this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

fate be plunged in any exigence of misfortune ſend me that
as in remembrance of the vow I here make in the preſence of

employ all the power of our dominions, and even my own life
to redeem thee from thy adverſity.</p>

Whereupon kneeling down, he kiſſed her hand with ſuch
a zeal as expreſſed the gratitude of his heart; and after reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
proteſtations of an inſeparable amity, and a conſtant
perſeverance in the proſecution of their deſigns, they parted
for that time, <hi>Theodora</hi> to communicate her intentions to the
Nobles, and <hi>Heraclius</hi> with the promiſes of infinite booty
to prepare the Souldiers to withſtand any oppoſition that
might happen.</p>
               <p>The ſouldiers with little difficulty embraced the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
but the Princes and Nobility, or the greateſt part of
them, as much as they durſt, ſought to diſſwade her from
ſuch an attempt, as they conceived no leſs perillous then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious:
But knowing the obſtinacie of her diſpoſition, and
that beſides the fond affection of the people, the Army was
diſpoſed to be at her devotion, they were forced to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or at leaſt to ſuffer what was not in their power to
remedy.</p>
               <p>So that things being thus ordered, and <hi>Theodora</hi> having
in a general aſſembly of the States made a ſpecious declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the abuſes and ſuperſtitions introduced by the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,

and to cover her malice with a greater ſhew of piety, leſt
through corruption the ſame errors ſhould agen creep in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, ſhe aſſumed to herſelf and to her ſucceſſors
the ſacred office of the High-Prieſthood, vainly ſuppoſing
that all the inferior orders depending wholly upon the Prince,
He might the eaſilier, upon any occaſion, impoſe upon mens

the ſupporting of an unlimited Prerogative. Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the right of divine authority being denied them, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
have ever ſince been contemned; and then their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
compliance with the Crown, only to maintain the ſhadow

to ruine both themſelves and it; whoſe ſufferings it will be

ſucceeded ſo according to her deſire, that it is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
with what a precipitate rage the multitude ran in
throngs to demoliſh thoſe antient Reliques of Antiquity with
which their Anceſtors had adorned the Shrines and Altars of
the Gods.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts were expelled the Temples; the Veſtal fire
was extinguiſhed; and the ſacred Virgins wiſhing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred

the crime, were polluted with unchaſte embraces.</p>
               <p>In fine, all was expoſed either to maſſacre or rapine; and
the Queen being now abſolute Miſtreſs of her deſires, ſhe
ſeemed to defie the force not only of <hi>Valentinianus,</hi> but even
of the whole world.</p>
               <p>Yet to carry all with a ſhew of ſanctity, in the firſt place ſhe
took care to eſtabliſh her new Model of Religion; and having

Temple; Herſelf attired in the holy veſtments, with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Oak upon her head, riding in a Chariot drawn by four
white Bulls covered with trappings of gold, with a hundred
Virgins cloathed in white, perfuming the air with incenſe,
being attended by <hi>Heraclius</hi> and divers of the Nobility, who
durſt not ſeem to diſlike of her proceedings, beſides an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of the common people, the Beaſts deſtined for
the offering being led before, went in ſolemn Proceſſion
through the City, every ſtreet where they paſſed being

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61061:66"/>
to the new erected Altar, herſelf pulling ſome of
the hair from between the Beaſts horns, which ſhe caſt into

the inferior Prieſts ſlew the Sacrificee, the Ceremonies
whereof being ended, with a general applauſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

he relyed upon for aſſiſtance was totally ſuppreſſed, and
the reſt generally united with the Queen, knowing his own
ſtrength was not ſufficient to make an invaſion, rather then
to hazard a diſgraceful repulſe he reſolved to return back
agen to <hi>Rome</hi> without attempting any thing, and though
now more irritated then ever, to delay his intended revenge
till ſome ſitter opportunity.</p>
               <p>Thus thoſe enterpriſes however difficult, that are reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
undertaken, and vigorouſly purſued, are for the moſt
part proſperous in the event, the ſucceſs making them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
both juſt to the world, and honorable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers:
And ſo at this time it happened to <hi>Theodora,</hi> for
having luckily effected her deſigns, and <hi>Valentinianus</hi> at the
report thereof having withdrawn his Army, never any
action was eſteemd more glorious, nor ever Prince ſo
applauded with the general acclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>But this ſurfet of happineſs made her nauſeate all other
pleaſures; the thoughts of Love were deſpiſed, her
Vowes to Heaven forgotten, and <hi>Heraclius</hi> who had
placed her on the Throne of Fortune, becauſe the
onely inſtrument of her Felicity, the chief object of
her hatred.</p>

Nevertheleſs ſhe knew ſo well how to diſſemble, for that
was her chief maſter-piece, that at firſt, being of a frank
generous nature, he perceived it not: And the <hi>Sardinians,</hi> a
people acknowledging <hi>Theodora</hi> for their Soveraign, having
at the ſame time tumultuouſly taken arms in ſeveral Provinces
for the protection of their antient Gods, and at laſt united all
their force under the command of <hi>Conar,</hi> who was deſcended
of the true race of their native Kings; <hi>Heraclius,</hi> under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to add to his glory, was with the Army under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſent upon that enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>But he no ſooner arrived at <hi>Oriſtagnum,</hi> the Metropolis of
that Kingdom, but his friends at home advertiſed him, that
the Queen began already to caſt her eye upon new Favorites,
and that it was apparent a little abſence would wholly alienate
him from her affection, if not prove fatal both to his life and
honour.</p>
               <p>Whereupon tranſported with a rage, he furiouſly aſſaulted
the Army of the Rebels; and having driven them into their
holds, began with a recollected ſeriouſneſs to conſider of the
condition of his affairs.</p>
               <p>When being daily ſtimulated with freſh advices of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie
of that ungrateful woman, he privately aſſembled
ſome few of his chiefeſt Confidents, to whom having laid open
his ſecret griefs, after various debates they all concluded,</p>
               <p>That ſince the Queen, according to the common maxim
of tyrannical Princes, no longer regarded any Subject, then
either whilſt his ſervice was apparently neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of her greatneſs, or his power a terror to the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her will, no means ought to be omitted which might
conduce to thoſe ends of which herſelf had been the principal
author: Neither could he now with ſecurity retire agen to a
private condition; for a popular great man, though he walk
in never ſo direct a path, very hardly avoids at ſome time or
other to ſtumble upon a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>affold; and the very well knew the
people ſo applauded her choice, that finding themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
of their expectation, they might be apt upon the leaſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61061:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſummons to take arms, in his ſufferings to revenge their own
injury: Nor was it to be doubted, that incited by thoſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
ſhe would endeavour, either by force or ſtratagem, to
procure his ruine; which if not ſuddenly prevented, would be
no leſs certain, than reproachful, That he who for <hi>Theodora's</hi>
ſake, to eſtabliſh her upon the throne, durſt by aboliſhing their
rites, provoke the anger of the immortal Gods; to maintain
juſtice, and for his own ſecurity, had not the courage to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the petulant humors of a ſickle ungrateful woman.</p>
               <p>Therefore to avoid both the danger and the ſcandal, he
ſhould immediately whilſt the memory of his late victory
rendred him terrible to the <hi>Sardinians,</hi> by offering a grateful
advantagious peace, oblige them to his party; and to engage
them more firmly, having taken hoſtages of <hi>Conar</hi> for their
fidelity, to put Sicilian garriſons into ſome of their chief
Towns; yet that his Army might not be diminiſhed, and to
expreſs a greater confidence of the Sardinians, to receive a
competent number of them under his pay, who through an
innate diſdain of their long ſlavery, would willingly follow
his Enſigns: By which means he ſhould not only wonderfully
encreaſe his ſtrength, but by their invading of <hi>Sicily,</hi> putting
them paſt all hopes of a reconciliation with the Queen, make
them more faithful to his deſigns: And though he might be
confident his own ſouldiers would ever remain firm to him,
yet ſuch aſſociates who fought for the vindication of their
Gods, and their Countries liberty, would queſtionleſs by
their example render them more reſolute in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings:
And if he attained to his ends, the reſtoring of their
antient priviledges would be a welcom reward of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
or if by the chance of war he were overcome, he had
a whole Kingdom at his devotion for a ſecure retreat.</p>
               <p>But ſucceſs was as certain as the attempt; for having a
Fleet ready in the harbor, he might tranſport his whole Army,
before there could be any advertiſement of the deſign. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the Queen as yet ſecure in her proſperity, prepared
any force to oppoſe his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61061:68"/>
Nothing ought therefore to retard ſo juſt and neceſſary an
enterpriſe; but inſtantly concluding a Treaty, with as much
expedition as might be to prepare for his departure, and with
his ſword in his hand, either to force <hi>Theodora</hi> to ratifie her
former vows, or elſe by the puniſhment of her infidelity to
waſh away the ſtain of his own diſhonor.</p>
               <p>This was the united advice of all his friends, but moſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
preſſed by <hi>Ergastrix</hi> his own Secretary, who though
ever faithful to his maſter, in his heart deteſting the violation
offered to the Gods by <hi>Theodora,</hi> hoped thus by her fall, in
reſtoring <hi>Aurelia</hi> to her right, to introduce again thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
cuſtoms; not without ſome aſſurance, that being free in
her choice, ſhe would in gratitude of ſo great a benefit, make
the author thereof the companion of her happineſs.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who never raſhly concluded any thing, having
with a profound judgment hearkened to their debates, when
<hi>Ergaſtrix</hi> had ended his ſpeech, remained a while ſilent, but
preſently recollecting himſelf ſaid,</p>
               <p>Moſt faithful friends, By the councel you have given me,
I perceive how ſenſible you are of my injuries, and doubt not
but you will be as forward to aſſiſt me in all dangers, as you
have been free in your advice to prevent them: But before I
can return a determinate anſwer, you muſt give me ſome ſmall

while with my honor.</p>
               <p>Whereupon immediately leaving the room, they retired
ſeverally; his friends to expect, and he into his private Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to form a reſolution.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> fetched a deep ſigh, and making a
little pauſe, ſaid; Some accidents about that time intervened,
which though they are material to the continuation of this
ſtory, yet becauſe they more particularly concern <hi>Heraclius,</hi>
than point at that end to which this diſcourſe is chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and having already perhaps in your opinions, though
I ſhall aptly enough apply all in the concluſion, related many
things impertinent to the preſent purpoſe, not to delay your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61061:68"/>
expectation any longer, I will haſten to thoſe occurrences,
which having reference only to the publick, will ſeem moſt
worthy of your attention.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Alexandro</hi> at that ſudden ſtop obſerving an alteration
in his countenance, was curious to know what might be the
cauſe thereof; beſides having never before heard thoſe affairs
diſcourſed of in that manner, though he thought he had too
boldly trenched upon the honor of <hi>Theodora,</hi> and the juſtice
of her proceedings, yet deſiring rather to know the truth from
an enemy, then relying upon things, becauſe none durſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them, received as truths, to found his actions upon
falſe principles, was not only exceeding attentive to what he
had ſaid, but ſeeming very much pacified towards him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
he would not omit any particular either of <hi>Heraclius</hi> or
his own fortune: For though at firſt he had only promiſed to
hearken with patience to his diſcourſe, he confeſſed he was
now ſomthing pleaſed with the novelty thereof; therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
him what perſons ſoever he were to mention, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
were the ſubject of his enſuing narration, that he ſhould
uſe the ſame freedom which he had done hitherto. And this
he ſpake with ſo much mildneſs, that <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to conceive he had vanquiſhed the fury of his diſdain:
Wherefore abſolutely to gain him, in a more ſubmiſſive
manner he proceeded in his diſcourſe.</p>

to my ſpeech, in which otherwiſe, through

            <p>No ſooner had <hi>Heraclius</hi> retired to his Cabinet, which for
the greater privacy, was in one of the higheſt Towers of the
Caſtle, which had a fair proſpect upon a large Plain that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

it ſelf many Leagues upon the Sea-ſide, but opening
one of the Caſements he addreſſed his prayers to heaven to
direct him in his reſolutions; when ſuddenly his meditations
were interrupted with an unuſual ſpectacle, which at a remote
diſtance preſented it ſelf to his view in the adjacent Plain.</p>
            <p>He immagined he ſaw a great white cloud advance leaſurely
forward upon the earth, and as it moved aſcending into the air,
ſeemed to be inſenſibly diſſipated by the brightneſs of the Sun,
which by reaſon of a clear ſerene skie, cauſed in him no little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
but approaching within diſtance to be diſcerned, his
wonder was not at all abated, when he perceived a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Matrons and Virgins, cloathed all in white, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
ſome bearing white Tapers in their hands, and others
with Cenſors caſting Incenſe into the air.</p>
            <p>Whereupon immediately deſcending, he called his chiefeſt

fear of ſome intended ſtratagem by the enemy, himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

Proceſſion was almoſt ready to encounter them, when it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

               </gap> Leader of this reverend Band, was a modeſt elderly
Matron clothed in a looſe garment of courſe Canvas, with a vail
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61061:70"/>
upon her head of the ſame; ſhe was bare-footed, and carried

having painted on it in lively colours, a Peacock with his
train ſpread, being the bird of <hi>Juno,</hi> the Goddeſs whom that
people ſuperſtitiouſly adore as their Protectrix, After whom
followed in pairs a hundred and fifty women more, about the
ſame age, and in the ſame habit, their eyes devoutly fixed on
the earth, each one bearing in her hand a burning Taper; and after
them a very aged Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on ſupported by two others, herſelf in the
ſame kind of habit, but flowing more looſly, and ſome other
little diſtinctions, which ſhewed her to be the Superior, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs
of that ſociety.</p>
            <p>The next was a woman of middle years, who bore likewiſe
in her hand a Banner, wherein was repreſented <hi>Juno</hi> ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a cloud, and divers people of all conditions praying to her;
ſhe was followed by two hundred more in the ſame manner,
carrying lighted Tapers, and bare footed, but their habit diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from the former, for their under-garment, the border
whereof only appeared, was black over which they wore a
white veſt or fine linnen girt cloſe to them with a ſilken cord,
and their Matron had on her head a larger vail then the reſt,
training upon the ground, with a long ſilver ſtaff in her hand,
on the top whereof was an Imperial Crown.</p>
            <p>The third Banner was richly embroidered with the figures of
<hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> ſitting together in their Majeſtie, and the
troop that followed were young women, none above thirty,
their heads adorned with curious Coronets made of Peacocks
feathers; their under garments were of Purple, their upper
veſts of pure Lawn pleated, and fringed with ſilver, being girt
to them with a ſilver girdle, over which they wore mantles of
cloth of ſilver training upon the ground; their Matron bore in
her right hand a maſs of gold ſet with precious ſtones, on the
top whereof was a ſmall figure of <hi>Juno</hi> cut out of one entire
Emerald; ſhe had divers attendants about her, and her mantle
was born up by one of the ſame order; but herſelf as well as
her company, had ſandals upon their feet of Crimſon Velvet,
with laces of ſilver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:61061:71"/>
After them marched another banner, which by reaſon of the
greatneſs, was born up by twelve young maids, in which <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſate enthroned with his threefold Scepter, <hi>Juno</hi> kneeling on
a cloud before him, and on the earth a King in his Royal Robes
offering up his Crown, with divers people behind him in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
poſture, who by the interceſſion of that great Queen of
heaven, ſeemed to be recommended to the protection of the
Thunderer.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that followed were maids of admirable beauty, their
hair hanging looſe, and on their heads Chaplets of flowres;
their under garment was of crimſon, ſhort before, but very
long behind, covered with another of lawne girt cloſe to
them, with wide ſleeves hanging to their feet, and over that a
kind of jacket of ſilver net cloſe to their bodies, and ſtreight
ſhort ſleeves as far as the elbow, but a looſe skirt cut in panes
like ſcallops, which reached to their knees.</p>
            <p>Theſe as the others bore tapers in their hands, but ſung in
a moſt mournfull tune, yet with a harmony that ſeemed ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial.</p>
            <p>Then followed two hundred maids more, four in a rank, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
differing in habit from the others, with ſilver Cenſors,
which ſmoaking with rich perfumes, they toſſed in the air as
they marched.</p>
            <p>The next in order were fifty young women playing upon
Ivory Harps, with ſtrings of ſilver wier, being clad in a cloſe
garment of black, over which they wore a ſhort veſt of lawn
curiouſly wrought about the skirts, and in every ſeam with
needle work, which reached only to their knees; after whom
followed fifty more in the ſame habit, that played upon ſeveral
other Inſtruments, all together making a moſt excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,

the ſoul into a divine contemplation; yet in contemplating
the celeſtial quires, no humane fancy could frame a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
image of them then what was there repreſented to the
fight.</p>
            <p>Then came a hundred yong Virgins, none above twelve yeers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61061:71"/>
of age, in long garments of cloth of ſilver, with wide ſleeves,
bearing in their hands Olive branches, who likewiſe in ſad notes
ſang the praiſes of their Goddes; after whom came a Damſel
cloathed in black, on her head a battered Coronet, and in her
right hand a broken Scepter.</p>
            <p>Then followed a Lady of a Majeſtical preſence, her hair ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon her ſhoulders, on her head a Garland of Olive mixed
with Roſes; her Garment which was cloſe to her body with
wide ſleeves, and a long train; was made of little plates of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
artificially joyned together like the ſmall ſcales of fiſh, over
which ſhe wore a Mantle embroidered with pearl, in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticque
faſhion faſtened on one ſhoulder with a large Diamond
of great value: Her train was born up by ſix Virgins of the
moſt eminent quality, beſides divers others which attended her;
but her ſelf with her eys, and hands held up to Heaven, ſeemed
unmindful of all earthly glory.</p>
            <p>Immediately after, under a Canopy embroidered with a Sun,
whoſe gliſtering rays caſt a glorious light, ſupported with twelve
ſtaves of Gold, which were born up by twelve Virgins richly
habted, followed the Image of <hi>Juno</hi> all of maſſie Gold, with a
Crown upon her head, enchaſſed with Precious-Stones of an
ineſtimable value, in her right hand a Scepter, in the other a
heart of one entire Rubie hanging at a ſmall chain of Gold, and
about her neck, wriſts, and waſte, great ropes of Oriental Pearl,
beſides divers other Ornaments, as Tablets of Diamonds, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs,
and Emeralds, which altogether made a vaſt treaſure, and
teſtifyed with the greatneſs, and liberality, the devotion of the
doners; but becauſe of the ſadneſs of the occaſion, all this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was ſhaded over with a vail of thin black Tiffany, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her from the head to the feet.</p>
            <p>Twenty Virgins carryed the Goddeſs upon their ſhoulders,
fifty more carryed great white Tapors lighted, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
with golden Cenſors raiſed a cloud of perfume that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
her: after which followed promiſcuouſly a great

            <p>But perhaps I recount theſe ſupernatural effects to perſons

is ſo obvious to every ſenſe, as cannot but gain a credit in
the relation, and may beget a compaſſion in the moſt barbarous
enemy, much more in the generous breaſt of ſo noble a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer.</p>
            <p>For it ſo happened immediately after the late encounter,
wherein the chiefeſt of our youth ſignalized the nobleneſs of
their courage with their blood, that our troops diſheartned
with their fall, being at length forced to a ſhamefull flight, the
runaways to palliat the ignominy of their cowardiſe, made ſuch
a terrible relation of the invincible valour of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> to
the reſt of the Army, that of twenty thouſand men, who lay
encamped without the City, in leſs then an hours ſpace, being
overcome by their own fears, not any remained for the defence

to bring them back again to the defence of their Country, this
ſad diſaſter was ſo quickly bruited among the inhabitants, that
perceiving the ſoldiers precipitate flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beleiving their
Prince had likewiſe forſaken them, being ſtruck with a pannick
feare, all the men, both old and young, that were able ſo to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themſelvs, and even the Preiſts, who by hollowed vows,
are obliged to attend at the Altars, ran headlong out of the gates,
to lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Mothers tears, the VVifes embraces, the lamentable
cryes of tender infants, nor the reverence due to the ſupreme
Powers, could not fortifie them with a reſolution, rather to dye
manfully in the diſcharge of thoſe natural, pious Obligations,
then moſt unnaturally, and impiouſly, in ſeeking refuge amongſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61061:73"/>
beaſts to relinquiſh the protection of the Gods.</p>
            <p>In this confuſion, ignorant of what had paſſed, I returned
from the Temple, accompanyed onely with a ſmall traine of
Ladies, when I found the ſtreets filled with multitudes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
running diſtractedly up and down; ſome weeping over
their children, ſome tearing their hair, and wringing
their hands, and others though more patient in their
griefs, ready to expire with the anguiſh thereof, but all
irreſolute, whether they ſhould by laying violent hands upon
themſelves, and their Infants, put a period to their miſeries, or
elſe by following their fugitive friends, periſh with them by a
languiſhing death.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt ſome exclaimed againſt the unkindneſs of their
deareſt Allies, others reproached the vild timerouſneſs of the
Prince and Souldiers, and all in general bewailed the cruelty of
their own deſtiny, at length underſtanding perfectly the cauſe of
their lamentations, being inſpired by the Goddeſs, I aſcended a
high Tribunal in the chief place where on certain days the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
gives publike audience to the people, whether they al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
flockt about me, and having with much difficulty obtained
hearing, after ſome few arguments to excuſe my fathers ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
leaving the City, having aſſured them if they would follow

their ſufferings, or elſe to reſtore them to their former happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with theſe promiſes, together with the reſpect and affection
that they bore to me as their natural Princeſs, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to return quietly to their houſes, and with patience three
days onely to expect the return of our Prince, our kinſmen and
Allies; which being expired, and having not heard the leaſt
news what is become of them, now truly diſdaining either the

The holy reſidences of theſe Votaries remain protected
from the rapine of your ſouldiers; and the ſacred Temple of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61061:74"/>
our Goddeſs not be prophaned, or polluted by the irreligious
contemners of her Deity: Otherwiſe rather then to ſuffer our

violence which may be offered to that Heavenly Image,
in contempt of your power we come thus prepared both
to prevent your tyranny, and by a voluntary Martyrdom to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the anger of the incenſed Gods.</p>
            <p>When on a ſuddain, and at the ſame inſtant both her ſelf, and
all the reſt drawing out of their ſleeves ſhort poignards, the
points whereof they directed againſt their own breaſts, pawſing a
little, in that fatal poſture, they expected the anſwer of <hi>Heraclins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he without any demur falling preſently on his knees, and
laying one hand on <hi>Agneſias</hi> poignard, beſought her, that if from
him ſhe apprehended any violation of her honor, that ſhe would
rather by his death ſecure her fears, then through a diffidence of
the Conqueſt her Vertue had made leave his memory infamous
to poſterity.</p>
            <p>When raiſing himſelf up, and having a while conſidered
ſuch a multitude of Beauties, and in <hi>Agneſias</hi> perſon
the amaſſed perfections of the whole multitude; You have
conquered, ſaid he, moſt excellent Lady; The Invaders of your
Country, will henceforth become the Champions of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and either <hi>Theodora</hi> ſhall by remitting the puniſhment of
this late revolt confirm to your Nation their ancient priviledges,
or I will my ſelf armed in your defence undertake the protection
of your cauſe.</p>
            <p>Return therefore triumphant to the City with your holy
Band, and recall thither your Prince, your Husbands, and your
friends, and deſpiſe not their ſociety, who by the chance of warr
being ſubdued, and through a fear in ſuch occurrences incident
to humane nature flying the ſuppoſed fury of a Conqueror, have
loſt nothing of their own honor, and given ſuch a glorious occaſion
to the whole world to celebrate the fame of your Heroick
vertues; which will ſpread ſo far, that as the Amazonian Queen
to raiſe an iſſue worthy of her ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61061:74"/>
of the renowned <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo the remoteſt Monarchs of the
earth, hearing the relation of this noble enterpriſe, will conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſubmit their Crowns to theſe Virgins, that the glory of
them may be preſerved in their poſterity: But to your ſelf the
great example of ſo magnanimous an action, none muſt dare to
aſpire, but he who by an invincible vertue ſhall acquire the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>I know not by what tradition you have received the ſtory of
your miraculous Image, but Nature hath in your ſelf formed ſo
excellent a ſhape, a beauty ſo tranſcendent, and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
adorned with ſuch heavenly endowments, as if at the
ſame time, in villification of the ſupreme powers, ſhe meant to
enſnare men in Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But ſince you ſo ſuperſtitiouſly reverence the ſhadow of a
Deity, I may certainly with leſs offence adore a mortal deifyed
with ſuch real perfections.</p>
            <p>Therefore you may henceforth remain as ſecure from any
attempt by us againſt your divine perſon, your Patriots, or thoſe
things which you eſteem ſacred, as the Temples, and Altars of
your Gods are from being prophaned, or deſtroyed by their
own Prieſts.</p>
            <p>This more then expected Grace, abundantly ſatisfyed <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia,</hi>
as concerning the ſucceſs of her deſigne: But ſhe who
preferring her Countries honor above her life, came fortifyed
with a reſolution to defye the ſtrength of a whole army, now
inſpired with gentler thoughts, neither mindful of Country,
nor friends, nor the terror of thoſe dangers ſo lately paſſed,
through a compaſſion of her ſelf deſired to live, yet not to
live unleſs pittyed by that enemy, whoſe power ſhe had before
deſpiſed: And though <hi>Heraclius</hi> had ſufficiently diſcovered the
paſſions of his mind, yet innocent love ignorant how to extract
any aſſured hopes out of artificial expreſſions, though ſhe
thought he had given her attributes far exceding her merit, yet
imputing all to Courtſhip, ſhe could hardly believe he was an
affectionate lover, and when through a ſelf kindnes ſhe would
have interpreted his words in favour of her deſires, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61061:75"/>
of <hi>Theodoras</hi> greatnes, and the fame of their contracted
vowes, ſo confounded thoſe imaginations, that rage, diſpair, and
emulation with an united ſtrength combating the ſole ſupport of
a vertuous minde, if Honor and Chaſtity had not repelled the
fierceneſs of their invaſion, would perhaps have forced a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thoſe violent tranſportations.</p>
            <p>But Reaſon being now agen placed in its proper ſphere, with a
heart full of generous thoughts, and the beams darted from her
eys, diſſipating all cloudes of diſcontent, like a triumphing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
to ſecure a ſubmiſſive enemy from his fears, ſhe firſt
threw away her mortal weapon, and then thus replyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodora</hi>'s inſatiate ambition of rule will be ſoon ſatisfied
through your generoſity, for to be thus vanquiſhed, all Nations
will eſteem as a certain foundation of their liberty, unleſs
through the fond opinion of a ſervile loyalty, by ſuffering your
vertue to be made the inſtrument of her tyrannical oppreſſion,
you ſtain the glory of your Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>However if you ſo diſpoſe of us, we muſt now to her render
a paſſive obedience, but I believe the Immortal <hi>Juno,</hi> who in
compaſſion of our long ſufferings inſpired you with ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
clemency, hath likewiſe choſen you to be the Author,
and preſerver of our future felicity, and remember that <hi>Agneſia</hi>
though a feeble Virgin, deſerted by her father and his people,
armed with a reſolution to deſpiſe the power of <hi>Theodora</hi> though
ſupported by the proweſs of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> yielded not her ſelf, as
her ſlave, but the ſole prize of his incomparable Vertue.</p>
            <p>When bluſhing that ſhe had ſaid ſo much, yet continuing her
ſpeech, on a ſuddain upon the ſide of a hill deſcending into the
plain, their appeared advancing towards them a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for <hi>Conar</hi> having collected together his ſcattered Troops,
and being beſides animated with a freſh ſupply of his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
returned to the City but finding it deſolate, and
ſuppoſing the <hi>Sicilians</hi> by the advantage of his abſence had led
his daughter; and the inhabitants into captivity, inraged with the
diſgrace, he reſolved either to free them agen, or elſe to periſh in
the enterpriſe; and their march being likewiſe perceived by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61061:75"/>
the Sentinels from the Caſtle of <hi>Oriſtagnuns,</hi> the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not attending any order, fearing a ſurpriſal, iſſued out with
a conſiderable force, to the defence of their General, which
moving a jealouſie on either ſide of ſome intended ſtratagem,
yet each party apprehending even more then death it ſelf, to be
thought guilty of ſo vile a treachery, they awhile gazed upon
each other without uttering a word, but <hi>Heraclius</hi> fearing his
men would advance too far, leſt in an ignorant zeal, violence
might be offered to the Ladies, without any reply, haſted to
withſtand their attempt, yet if need were to defend himſelf
from the attempt of the enemy.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Agneſia</hi> by his abrupt departure, judging her ſelf already
condemned as a Traitor, with a perplexed mind remained
doubtfull, whether to juſtifie her innocence ſhe ſhould follow
<hi>Heraclius,</hi> or elſe to prevent the miſchief of a fatal encounter,
carry the joyfull tidings to her friends, who ſhe ſaw were come
to her reſcue, of the happily contracted Peace.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, Love, not yet grown an abſolute Tyrant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
a conſideration of the event, though it were an anguiſh
to her ſoul to remain ſo long ſuſpected as the Agent of a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
treachery, yet reflecting on the dangerous ruine both of
her life and honour, through an unhappy miſpriſion on either
ſide, ſhe with all the Virgins, chaunting the praiſes of their
<hi>Goddeſs,</hi> as the author of this ſucceſs, but ignorant what ſacrifices
they ought to have offer'd to the God of Love, in the ſame ſolemn
manner of proceſſion, returned towards the Princes hoſt, who
being fully informed of all that had paſſed, no leſs admiring his
ſiſters matchleſs reſolution, then the tranſcendent humanity of
<hi>Heraclius;</hi> preſently commanding his Army to face about,
with general acclamations of joy, they returned to the quiet
poſſeſſion of their City; and <hi>Heraclius</hi> when he perceived they
were marched away, diſmiſſing likewiſe his Souldiers to their
ſeveral ſtations, retired to commune with his own
thoughts.</p>
            <p>On the one ſide they repreſented to him <hi>Agneſias</hi> youthfull
beauty, accompanied with ſuch an undaunted courage, yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61061:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the mildneſs of a modeſt chaſtity; on the other the
mature graces of <hi>Theodora,</hi> with an equal greatneſs of mind,
but ſubject to all the paſſions of an unbridled appetite; the one
innocent of what ſhe deſierd, the other ſo full of thoſe deſires
that were deſtructive to innocence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one tyed to him by the
band of a holy vow; himſelf united to the other by the ſacred
power of Love, and both, though through a different influence,
threatning the period of his fate, he propoſed to himſelf all the
waies immaginable how to evade thoſe difficulties into which his
croſs fortune had plunged him, and at length with the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his honour to compaſs his deſires.</p>
            <p>In which perplexity he remained altogether irreſolute, till
the next day <hi>Conar</hi> accompanied only with half a dozen of his
chief Nobility ariving unexpectedly about a furlong from <hi>Orr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnum,</hi>
without any ceremony or ſafe conduct, deſired admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to a parley: whereupon <hi>Heraclius</hi> advertiſed of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with the like number went to meet him, and after the firſt
ſalutations were paſt, retiring a good diſtance from their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
they entred into privat conference; the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was never known to any; only it was obſerved that they
parted with great demonſtrations of kindneſs on either ſide, and
<hi>Heraclius</hi> aſſumed a more contented countenance then uſually
he had ſhewn in many daies before; which <hi>Ergaſtrix</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
preſſed him to reſolve his friends concerning their late
conſultation, and omitting no occaſion to incenſe him againſt
<hi>Theodora,</hi> produced freſh Letters of the immoderate favours
ſhe beſtowed upon her new minion <hi>Arſidas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the peruſal whereof, with a diſdainfull ſmile, he replyed,
The reſolution is already taken; I will not by invading my
Country, blemiſh the renown of my Anceſtors with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of diſloyalty, but by maintaining my faith, puniſh the
infidelity of this perfidious Queen.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, I am determined privatly to imbarque for <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and let none examin the drift of my intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that my
abſence may not be known in the Army, give it out that I am
detained in my bed by an acceſs of feaver: In the mean while
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61061:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>Calliſthenes, Clytas</hi> and <hi>Lyſias,</hi> with this caution, that by no
means they offend the <hi>Sardinians,</hi> I commit the government
of all affairs; to you the care preſently to provide a Veſſel, and
my ſelf will ſo manage the reſt, that at my return, which if I
proſper in my deſignes, ſhall be no leſs ſudden then my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
thoſe friends who have been faithfull to me, ſhall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the glory; but if I miſcarry, be no way involved in my
diſgraces.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſpoſed of all things in order to his intentions,
within a few daies after in the habit of a Souldier, attended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by two truſty ſervants, he ſet ſail, and guided by a favourable
wind, in a ſhort time arrived in the road of <hi>Palermo,</hi> upon the
Weſtern coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where <hi>Theodora</hi> being then in her

to enjoy the coolneſs of the evening.</p>
            <p>When ſuppoſing by her equipage it could be none but the
Queen, preſently deſcending into a ſmall skiff, he intended to
go on land, yet as he paſſed, if it were poſſible, to take a view of

            <p>Whereupon he haſted to their relief, but <hi>Arſidas</hi> unskilfull

               </gap>,
being as yet preſerved, cryed out for aſſiſtance, caſting away
his garments he plunged himſelf into the main, and with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the skiff; but when the manner of this accident was related, all
grew into a horrible confuſion, with terrible threats and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations

            <p>Nevertheleſs the Court being again appeaſed, and the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

intelligence of all that paſſed, had not malitiouſly ſuggeſted that
his exceſſive greatneſs began to grow dangerous to the State,

to remain in his Government of <hi>Sardinia</hi> till it had pleaſed
her Majeſtie to recall him home to greater honours; or if his
deſignes were not pernicious, why in ſuch a manner did he come

was the aſſuming to himſelf ſuch a ſoveraign power, as of his own
head to grant a peace to Rebels, and without the privity of the
Councel, to entertain a Conference with a publique Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Which Objections were ſo aggravated with politick recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that inſtead of a reception anſwerable to the merit of
ſo notorious a ſervice, one morning as he entered into the Palace
he was by a ſuddain ſurpriſal diſarmed, and by the guards convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a ſtrict priſon, where notwithſtanding the earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61061:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſhe had cancelled the Bond of all former Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the remembrance of <hi>Agneſia</hi>'s beauty wholly poſſeſſing
his affections, and the known malice of his enemies, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him his preſent danger, He began for her ſake more ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to think of his own preſervation, and by promiſe of large
rewards, ſo entirely gained <hi>Cardonius,</hi> Captain of the priſon,
that the ſecond night after he made an eſcape, and though with
ſome difficulty in a ſhort time after returned undiſcovered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Sardinia,</hi> hoping by the fidelity of his friends, there to
arrive in a ſecure port, from whence he might upon a gentle
ſtream ſail to the embraces of <hi>Agneſia,</hi> whoſe hereditary right
would poſſeſs him of a Kingdom, and her fathers forces united
with his own, inveſt him with a power to oppoſe the Tyranny
of <hi>Theodora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe inſtruments who with ſuch dexterity wrought his
diſgrace, being no leſs diligent at the ſame time to ſecure the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of that Army; had inſtantly diſpatched <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> of
their Partizans, with a large Commiſſion from the Queen, to
aſſume the charge thereof; who at his firſt arrival at <hi>Oriſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
preſently ſecured the perſons of <hi>Caliſthenes, Clytus,</hi> and
<hi>Lyſias,</hi> with all others who were thought favourers of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and then in a long ſtudyed Oration laid ſuch horrible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to his charge, that the ſouldiery remained for the moſt part
ſatisfyed with thoſe tranſactions; and thoſe whoſe affections,
nor Faith, would not admit of any alteration, <hi>Heraclius</hi> being
abſent, and his chief friends under reſtraint, being deſtitute of
Councel, fearing to act againſt their own intereſt, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another, ſubmitted to the preſent change.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Ergaſtrix</hi> as he was more vigilant then the reſt,
and his power to hurt not ſo much regarded, eſcaping the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> eaſily procured a barque to tranſport him
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and having advanced ſome few Leagues from the
ſhoar, happily encountred his Maſters, who being deſirous to
learn the news of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> boarded his veſſel, and was not a
little aſtoniſhed to meet ſo accidentally his faithful ſervant, but
underſtanding by him the ſtate of his affairs, and how his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61061:78"/>
were traverſed by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> without any long deliberation
altering his courſe, he ſteered directly for <hi>Sardinia;</hi> where being
received with exceeding honor by <hi>Conar, Agneſias</hi> gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
added hopes ſo correſpondent to his deſires, that he
believed he might without offence diſcover the ardency of his
affection; which was ſo acceptable on the other ſide, that the
nuptials were forthwith celebrated with all the pomp due to
the birth of ſo great a Princeſs, and the mannagement of the
war, being then reſolved on as neceſſary, was wholly committed
to his direction.</p>
            <p>This news flew quickly to <hi>Oriſtagnum,</hi> which cauſed a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
diſorder in <hi>Cleomenes</hi> Army, for a conſiderable party that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
watched an opportunity to expreſs their zeal to their former
General, ſeparating themſelves from the reſt, forced their way
through the Guards, to the Tower, where <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> with his
other adherents were impriſoned, and having ſet them at liberty,
marched triumphantly with Colours diſplayed to <hi>Heraclius</hi>
Camp, offering with their lives to ſecure him from the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his enemies, and he with this ſuddain addition of force
was ſo elevated, that he now eſteemed himſelf beyond the
reach, or malice, of fortune.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Cleomenes</hi> giving advertizement of this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
defection into <hi>Sicily,</hi> was preſently ſupplyed with freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
wherupon knowing his greatneſs was inconſiſtent with his
enemies, he took the field, with a reſolution to give him battail,
which was joyfully accepted by <hi>Heraclius,</hi> but in the encounter,
the circumſtances whereof would be tedious to relate, the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
on <hi>Heracluis</hi> party fighting gallantly, being all ſlain, the
<hi>Sardinians</hi> were ſoon totally routed, by which defeat their
Country remained afterwards annexed to the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Crown,
and their Prince, and people the ſlaves of the Conquerors.
But my unfortunate Father ſeeking a noble death amongſt his
enemies, performed actions, which though I ſpare to mention,
ſucceeding ages will admire, yet being overpreſſed with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
he vvas at length taken Priſoner, and as a ſure token of an
entire victory, ſent vvith a ſtrong guard into <hi>Sicily,</hi> vvhere <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61061:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> fearing time might mitigate the Queens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
cauſed his Proceſs to be preſently diſpatched, and
the Judges being all of the ſame Cabal, vvithout conſideration
of his many glorious atchievements, they condemned him to an
ignominious death, vvhich being the ſentence of a partial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the relenting people, with a general murmur, voted the
Authors thereof the greater malefactors.</p>
            <p>But they, vvho about the ſame time, had barbarouſly embrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their hands in the ſacred blood of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> vvhich vvas a
horrid example for future ages to violate the dignitie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
having brought <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſo neer the Scaffold, thought all
delays dangerous until they had delivered him into the hands of
the Executioner.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> vvho though ſhe diſſembled her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
vvas of a haughty, inſolent ſpirit, and no leſs unconſtant
then cruel in her reſolutions, through a diſdain as ſome ſuppoſed,
that the perſon vvhom ſhe had once deſtined to her bed, ſhould
by an infamous fall, be laid in an obſcure Grave, for the preſent
ſuſpended the Execution, which made others conceive, that
hovvever, by the perſvvaſion of his adverſaries, vvho pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſafety, ſhe had ſuffered them to proceed to this tryal, and
condemnation, yet ſhe did it only to ſubmit him to her povver,
and that ſome ſparks of her former love ſtill remaining, began
to kindle a nevv flame, vvhich if he vvould have abſolutely
humbled himſelf, and acknovvledging his fault, have repudiated
<hi>Agneſia,</hi> might have lighted the Torches to his ſecond Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neals.</p>
            <p>But thoſe vvho beſt knevv the Nature of her diſpoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſhe did indeed deſire his ſubmiſſion, but with an intent
only to inſult over his misfortunes, or if ſhe ſuffered him to live,
to let him knovv he lived only by her Grace, and that ſhe vvas
abundantly acquit of all paſt Obligations, in ſhevving ſo unuſual
a clemency, to ſo great an offender; vvhereas the beſt of his
ſervices could pretend to no other eſteem then as the duties of a
ſubject ſo highly obliged by his Prince, nor to no farther revvard
then the acknovvledgemen of his loyalty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61061:79"/>
This was the conceit of the beſt judgements, and <hi>Heraclius</hi>
himſelf concurred in the ſame opinion, wherefore beſides his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
affection to <hi>Agneſia,</hi> rather then to ſubmit, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to entertain death, without any ſhew of a ſervile fear, and
though ſome perſwaded him to implore the mercy of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and intimations were given him even from the Queen her
ſelf, that if he would conform to the compliance of a ſubmiſſive
ſubject, he might expect the mercy of a gracious Princeſs, yet
he would never condeſcend to owe his life to that perſon, who
had ſo manifeſtly outraged his honor.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the pitteous lamentations of <hi>Agneſia,</hi> who
was then young with child of me, and who, if he died, vowed
her own deſtruction, ſo ſhaked his reſolutions, that the evening
before he ſuffered, he ſent privatly for <hi>Deſpina</hi> one of the Ladies
of the bed-chamber, who being highly regarded by the Queen,
was acquainted with many paſſages of their former love.</p>
            <p>To her therefore with many conjurations of ſecrecy, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that pledge of a perpetual Union, the divided Ring, which
in his greateſt perils <hi>Theodora</hi> had obliged him to ſend h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, with
a ſolemn proteſtation, that ſhe would interpoſe the whole power
of her Kingdom, and even her own life between him and danger;
beſeeching her if ſhe tendered his life, with all the ſpeed that was
poſſible to convey it to her, and his once moſt gracious Miſtreſs,
not doubting it might produce effects ſuitable to her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſpina</hi> ſeemed very joyfull of this occaſion to ſerve him,
but like a true Courtier following the vogue of the times, when
<hi>Heraclius</hi> began to decline, ſhe had received the addreſses of
<hi>Glaucus,</hi> who being one of <hi>Arſidas</hi> familiars, and of the then
prevalent faction, he ſo far ingratiated himſelf into her favour,
that to comply with him, having ſtained the honour of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
bed, ſhe thought it no crime to betray to him the ſecrets
of a deſpicable friend.</p>
            <p>So that inſtead of delivering the half Ring to <hi>Theodora,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him the more to her, ſhe carried it immediately to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Glaucus,</hi> with a full relation of all other paſſages, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61061:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her infinite thanks for ſo great a diſcovery, charmed her by
all the endeerments of their ſecret love to an everlaſting ſilence,
and early the next morning, with <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> poſting to the
Queen, preſſed her with divers arguments to ſecure her ſelf
from many eminent dangers, and her faithful Councellors from
their perpetual fears, by delivering at length the publique ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into the hands of Juſtice, who had not only lived a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of her Authority, but being legally convicted of moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
Treaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had neither acknowledged his guilt, nor once
vouchſafed to ſue to her for mercy; but on the contrary, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own innocence, vauntingly affirmed, even to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of her Majeſties honour, that though he knew a certain
means to ſecure his life, yet he would rather ſuffer a thouſand
deaths, then not leave a teſtimony to the world, that he deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both her favour aud her power.</p>
            <p>This allegation had ſo ſtrong an influence upon the woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
humour of <hi>Theodora,</hi> who more then any thing, reſented a
contempt, that to puniſh his arrogance, as ſhe termed it, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſended
to their deſires, whereupon not expecting any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commiſſion, or Warrant for their proceedings, they haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the priſon, and to prevent a ſecond reluctance, cauſed
him inhumanly to be dragged out of his bed to the common
place of execution, where being ſpectators of his fall, they
did not more glory in their cruelty, then he by a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the world, triumphing over their malice, and even
death it ſelf, with a chearful alacrity expoſed his neck to that
fatal ſtroak, which though at once it deprived him of life, and
ſeparated him from his dear <hi>Agneſia,</hi> yet could not be ſaid to
ſhed his bloud, ſince it ſo firmly cemented the affections of the
people, both to her and his poſterity, that though deprived of
her Country, ſhe was ever after honoured by them as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and her ſon ſince with the Title of their General.</p>
            <p>But though I paſs over the griefs of <hi>Agneſia</hi> as altogether
unſpeakable, it were too great an omiſſion, and even a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
againſt the providence of the ſupream Juſtice, to ſeem
forgetful of the laſt Scene of this woful Tragedy.</p>

revealed her Treachery, and immediately thereupon delivered
up the ghoſt, not without many bitter curſes and exclamations

ſo far a comfort in her afflictions, that the iſſue of <hi>Heraclius,</hi>

my childhood, with this ſad ſtory of our misfortunes, which
then made ſnch an impreſſion, that though being over-worn with
ſorrow, ſhe ended this life before I had attained to the thirteenth
year of my age, yet I ſtill retain ſo perfectly in memory every
particular paſſage thereof: Beſides, after her death, the care of
my youth being committed to the tuition of <hi>Veveus,</hi> an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend to my deceaſed father, who ſharing in his diſgraces,
lead a retired life in the Country, he in that ſollitude punctually
related to me thoſe ſecret tranſactions between <hi>Heraclius</hi> and
the Queen, with the inveterate hatred of his malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not to incite me to a revenge, but on the contrary, by
ſo great an example, to arm me againſt the various uncertain
changes of the world and foreſeeing I ſhould not be favoured
at the Court, inſtructed me with principles of Philoſophy, to
ſuit my mind to the preſent condition of my fortunes, which I
eaſily comprehending, applyed my ſelf wholly to martial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,

racing, which ſo unbend the mind from any great thoughts,
that the lovers of them, for the moſt part, become incapable of

            <p>But neither that retirement, his excellent precepts, nor theſe

For <hi>Lyſimacus,</hi> a perſon highly eſteemed by the King, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Governor of our Province, the Inhabitants of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi>
the capital City prepared to entertain him with that honour
which was due to the dignity of his place, and one in ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
favour with his Prince. Wherefore being advertiſed of the
time of his arrival, and that he brought with him, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an illuſtrious train, his Lady, and two daughters of a
renowned beauty, being ſwayed by a croſs fate, I was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with a deſire to be a ſpectator of thoſe triumphs, that
communicating my deſign to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> one of my moſt familiar
companions, and finding him poſſeſſed with the ſame inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we went privatly together to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> where the firſt
night of our coming, at a publique ball, though unknown, we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61061:81"/>
had a full ſurvey of all the choice beauties in the Country; but
the two ſiſters, <hi>Belinda</hi> and <hi>Artemia</hi> were adorned with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
graces, that the whole aſſembly receiving luſtre from
their motions, all the delights ordained for mankind, ſeemed
to move in that circle as in their proper ſphear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Belinda</hi> the elder though not more mature in perfections,
was by the Kings mediation already eſpouſed to an ancient
Lord, who by his meritorious ſervices deſerved no leſs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
but ſo unequal to her in years, that it was not probable
ſhe could entertain his embraces with that content which was
neceſſary in the conjunction, to ſatisfie his hopes, in raiſing an
heir to his Family; and indeed, though ſhe had complyed with
the commands of authority, it appeared too evidently, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
her ſelf to the Courtſhip of others, that ſhe had not
pleaſed her own fancy in the choice of a husband: But <hi>Artemia</hi>
was ſo tender a Virgin, that though ſhe were deſired of all, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
being thought incapable of the impreſſions, ſhe was
not yet acquainted with the aſſaults of love.</p>
            <p>The contemplation of this Saint-like innocence ſo diverted
my thoughts from all other objects, that I obſerved not with
what delight <hi>Parmenio's</hi> eyes followed the motion of <hi>Belindas,</hi>
but perceiving her ſo open to all addreſſes, he fancied ſuch a
ſucceſs to his new deſires, that he had leaſure enough to mark
with what a greedy appetite I ſucked in that poyſon, the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof hath ſince ſpread with ſuch a rancorous aſperſion
upon my honour.</p>
            <p>But alas! how can man avoid the perverſneſs of the fates,
ſince from his birth he is ordained to purſue thoſe means which
ſubmit him to their decrees?</p>
            <p>I ſaw <hi>Artemia,</hi> I admired her beauty, her innocent behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
even raviſhed my thoughts with the contemplation of her
growing vertues, and by envying their happineſs who had the
honour to approach her perſon, though ignorant of ſuch paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I knew I loved her, and loving her, with a reſtleſs anxiety
of mind employed all the arts a Lover could invent to betray
my ſelf to my own ruine, in which I was ſo ſucceſsful, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61061:82"/>
found the means to diſcover the fervency of my paſſion,
I met with ſuch a reciprocal concurrence of affection, that in
ſhort, for I will not detain you with a narration of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
I approached in my conceit to the fruition of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happineſs; for the example of her ſiſters diſproportioned
match, which I failed not to enforce, rendring her more plyant
to my deſires, we were ſolemnly contracted in the preſence of
<hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Hortenſia</hi> her confident attendant, who were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to all our proceedings.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs becauſe <hi>Lyſimacus</hi> fortunes depended wholly
upon the Court, doubting, leſt he might ſeem to favour his
cauſe, he would not eaſily conſent to beſtow his daughter upon
the ſon of him that had ſuffered as a Traitor; that no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might traverſe our joyes, we reſolved, having performed the
rites, ſecretly to conſummate the marriage: And things were
at length brought to ſuch a point, that nothing wanted to the
accompliſhment of our wiſhes, but the period of all wiſhes, an
oportunity to perfect our felicity, in the mutual bliſſes of the
ſacred nuptial bed.</p>
            <p>In this difficulty <hi>Hortenſia</hi> her confident nurſe uſed ſuch dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
that ſoon after, having one night concealed my ſelf in
the Governors Palace, the Court being all at reſt, I was ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveyed into <hi>Artemias</hi> Chamber, where meeting no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
but a yielding Virgins modeſty, I ſoon entred, like a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Conqueror into the Fort of Love; but had ſcarce ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
poſſeſſion of that ineſtimable treaſure, which all the graces,
her faithfull attendants, had then been fourteen years amaſſing
together, when ſuddenly the whole Palace being filled with a
confuſed noiſe; <hi>Hortenſia</hi> as one amazed came running into the
chamber, and trembling, told us, that her old Lady <hi>Caliſta,</hi>
with <hi>Belinda</hi> and their maids, by what accident raiſed out of
their beds, ſhe knew not, were coming towards the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>You may eaſily imagin ſuch an unexpected alarm ſtruck ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

ſunk down upon her pillow in a ſwound; at which ſight, though
reſolved to juſtifie the action, yet moved with a tenderneſs of

eaſily underſtood I believed her treachery to be the cauſe of that
miſchief, whereat either offended, or thinking it neceſſary to
ſhew her innocence, having recollected her ſelf, and being aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her womans wit, ever excellent in ſuch occurrences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſhew of perplexity, it is now no time, ſaid ſhe, to talk,
or by frivolous proteſtations to ſeek to remove your ſuſpition;
if you can ſhift for your ſelf, leave to me the care of my Miſtreſs
honor, and of my own juſtification.</p>
            <p>Whereupon with a great lighted Taper that ſhe had in her
hand, in an inſtant ſhe put fire to the curtains, and to the other
combuſtible things either about the bed or the Chamber, and
taking the half dead <hi>Artemia</hi> in her arms, ran haſtily with her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the dore meeting <hi>Caliſta,</hi> without any ſtay, thruſting by her,

to ſome more open place, for what with the ſmoak and the
flames, that I know not by what miſchance have ſeiſed upon

late I had not the ſooner perceived it, ſhe had undoubtedly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in the fire. Which by what they had ſeen, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
affrighted, bore ſuch an appearance of truth, that none ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the deceit, they haſted again to <hi>Belindas</hi> appartment,
where by their diligence <hi>Artemia</hi> ſoon recovered her ſenſe, and
was preſently ſo carefully inſtructed by <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> that not any
of them imagined the true cauſe of her diſtemper.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, when I perceived the Nurſes ſubtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and withall heard what he had ſaid to the Ladies, I
was ſo altered in my opinion both of her fidelity and addreſs,
that I was in no further pain for <hi>Artemia,</hi> but conveying my
ſelf our of her Lodging, under the ſame diſguiſe that I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
the diſtraction was ſo great, that I eaſily mingled amongſt
the croud without any danger of ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61061:83"/>
The occaſion of this uproar was a tumult amongſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people, who having a little before had a new Tax laid upon
them, though in it ſelf very eaſie, yet being unaccuſtomed to
ſuch impoſitions, thinking the preſſure thereof inſupportable,
they ran in multitudes to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> hoping either through entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or fear to force <hi>Lyſimacus,</hi> being ſcarce in poſſeſſion of his
Government, to diſcharge them of that burden, and the better
to effect their deſires, knowing the advenues of the City, at a certain place where the Wall was decayed, entered at that dead
time of the night, without being perceived either by the Watch,
which in a time of peace was but ſlight, or any of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who ſlept ſecurely under the protection of their careleſs
guards, untill having poſſeſſed themſelves of the Magazine, the
Souldiers that eſcaped their fury gave the alarm, which being
unexpected, was ſo much the more terrible, and the Peaſans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this time Maſters of all the Ports, none durſt ſtir to make
any reſiſtance; but the Citizens running diſtractedly to the
Palace, had raiſed the Governor, who by their confuſed relation,
not underſtanding rightly the cauſe of their fears, nor perceiving
any thing as yet but clamor and diſorder, aſſembling his guards,
ſtood only in a poſture of defence, in expectation of the day,
whilſt <hi>Caliſta</hi> more apprehenſive of danger, having raiſed her
daughters, intended to retire with them to ſome place in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
that might beſt ſecure them from the outrage of any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
attempt.</p>
            <p>But the flames by this time burſting out from <hi>Artemias</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cauſed a ſecond confuſion, at the ſight thereof a general
cry running amongſt them, that they were miſerably betrayed
to an inevitable deſtruction, and they were ſo poſſeſſed with the
horror of their preſent danger, that death was the leaſt of their
apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Lyſimacus,</hi> whoſe courage had advanced him
to eminent honours, being accuſtomed to perils, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered
temper, endeavoured to allay the tumult, and having
by his example animated them to a better aſſurance, firſt gave
order to quench the fire, and then ſent a party of his moſt reſolute
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61061:83"/>
men, amongſt whom I intruded my ſelf, towards the chief
Market-place, where finding none to encounter them, they
made a ſtand in expectation of a further order.</p>
            <p>This pauſe gave me time to retire to my Lodging, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſently armed, and well mounted, I returned again to the
Governor with the offer of my ſervice in this unexpected occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which he accepting with his uſual civility, and day by this
time appearing, I marched out of the Palace to diſcover the cauſe
of this ſudden uproar: But before I had paſſed through one
ſtreet, the party which was firſt ſent out, being beaten from
their Poſt by the Rebels, fled in ſuch haſte and diſorder, that if
I had not happily withſtood them in their carreer, <hi>Lyſimacus</hi>
having ſo ſmall a force, muſt of neceſſity have ſubmitted to the
licentious will of an incenſed rabble; but having encouraged
them to a ſecond attaque, the purſuers began quickly to retire;
in which action, though my ſervice might perhaps merit from
the King, it was from none but <hi>Artemia</hi> that I expected the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
whoſe beauty only was of that power to animate me to
ſuch a performance.</p>
            <p>O that ſhe, whoſe outward graces had then ſo ſtrong an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to repel the rage of a lawleſs multitude, had not afterward ſo
much vertue within her ſelf, to give the Law to the unruly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of one ſingle man, or rather of an impuiſſant effeminate
Courtier.</p>
            <p>But ſhe being yet guiltleſs, her Champion fighting under the
protection of her innocence, ſoon gave thoſe Traitors the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
due to their delinquency, and afterwards though they
compaſſed not their ends, they obtained what they leſs expected,
not only a free pardon of their offence, but a promiſe that their
complaints ſhould be favourably recommended to the King:
with which they were ſo well ſatisfied, that returning again to
their ſeveral Villages, they infinitly extolled the juſtice and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of their Governor.</p>
            <p>This tumult thus appeaſed, <hi>Lyſimacus</hi> ſpent ſome daies in
rectifying the diſorders of the Province, that the Government
being well ſettled, he might return again to <hi>Palermo,</hi> in which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61061:84"/>
interim though I had frequent acceſs to <hi>Artemia,</hi> yet ſince
the late accident, being lodged in <hi>Belindas</hi> appartment, it was
impoſſible to enjoy that privacy of converſation which the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
hearts of the chaſteſt lovers are priviledged to deſire.</p>
            <p>Wherefore knowing her departure would be ſudden, and
that the air of the Court was not my proper element, rather
then to be ſeparated from my happineſs; or by appearing at
<hi>Palermo,</hi> to revive the remembrance of my fathers diſgraces, I
reſolved publickly to avow our marriage; yet doubting <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
who had ever been bred up in an awfull obedience to her
parents, being young and timerous, would through fear of their
diſpleaſure, oppoſe my proceedings, without acquainting her
with my intentions, I went directly to <hi>Lyſimacus,</hi> whoſe many
obliging civilities ſince the ſuppreſſion of the Rebels, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to reveal my ſecret firſt to him.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution entring into his Chamber, I found him,
having newly received a Packet from the Court, giving order
for his removal the next day; and before I could find an opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to utter my mind, taking me by the hand he retired into
his Cabinet, and after many endearing profeſſions of kindneſs,
ſaid,</p>
            <p>If you have been rightly informed of my actions, you have
no reaſon to eſteem me an enemy of your Family; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as I lamented your fathers fall, ſo I ſhould rejoyce to ſee
you advanced to ſuch a height, that you may be above the reach
of his perſecuters; wherefore ſince your own vertue hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you a way to thoſe honors which belong to your birth, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
not the means, by purſuing of glory, to eſtabliſh your ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that you may perceive I intend more then a ſuperficial
complement, peruſe this letter, and according to the contents,
judge how forward I ſhall be, by advancing your hopes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
you in a belief of the ſincerity of my intentions.</p>

               </gap>and, he immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to the company, leaving me full of amazed
thoughts, to what end this diſcourſe ſhould tend; but having
unfolded it, I perceived it was a Letter from the King, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
whereof were to this effect.</p>

            <p>I muſt confeſs I was not a little pleaſed with this real effect of
<hi>Lyſimacus</hi> friendſhip, for I ſuppoſed he would not be averſe to
receive that perſon into his alliance, whom he had ſo generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged, and with that aſſurance, knowing I muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
accompany him, I quitted my reſolution of declaring our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
till ſome fitter oportunity; yet as if by a ſecret inſtinct
foreſeeing my future miſeries, I could not without ſome relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance
caſt my thoughts upon the diſpleaſing encounters, I might
meet withall at Court.</p>
            <p>I knew many of my fathers enemies remained ſtill in great
places of Authority; I knew likewiſe that divers of his friends
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61061:85"/>
being of no leſs eminence either in birth or power, that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
eſpecially if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing looked upon me with an eye of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
might perhaps revive thoſe factions which had formerly
been between them; and I was not ignorant that their claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
might render me odious to that Prince whoſe only end
was peace, and his chiefeſt policies to ſuppreſs the diſſentions
amongſt his Nobles.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs on the other ſide I conſidered that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of a Soveraign were equivalent to Laws, that to make
excuſes would be held a crime equal to diſobedience, and that
only to avoid ſuppoſed inconveniences, I might both neglect
my fortunes, and incur the cenſure of ingratitude: But that
which removed all ſcruples, was the remembrance, that though
thoſe factions ſhould through my occaſion break out into new
animoſities, <hi>Seleucus</hi> himſelf would be a party engaged in the
ſame intereſts, for thoſe very perſons who to ſatisfie their vain
ambition, brought my father to an ignominious death, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with <hi>Theodoras,</hi> had embrewed their hands in his own
mothers blood, with a double ſcandal both to his linage and
dignity.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I thus ruminated upon my own imaginations, <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
returning again into the Cabinet, with all the ſubmiſſions
due to a father, I acknowled the benefit I was like to receive by
his favour, and his expreſſions on the other ſide were ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that invited by deluſive hopes, with exceeding alacrity I
prepared for my journey, and the third day after we arrived with
the Ladies, in very good equipage at <hi>Palermo,</hi> where I met
ſuch civilities in the Court, and received ſuch extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
from <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that as I could not hear the praiſes he gave
me without bluſhing, ſo I cannot repeat them without an oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of too much vanity: Let it ſuffice I found ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſatisfaction, that all things ſeemed to ſort with my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and I now rather expected addreſſes from <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi>
then to meet with any oppoſition to my juſt demands.</p>
            <p>But theſe mountains of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by my own vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
raiſed to ſuch a heighth, were but as heaps of ſand, eaſily
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61061:85"/>
levelled with the leaſt guſt of adverſe fortune: and the firſt
clouds that darkened this ſun-ſhine of my glory, appeared in
<hi>Artemias</hi> countenance for intending to make her participant of
my joys, entring one morning into her Chamber, I found her
ſitting in her chair with her hair looſe, her head ſupported by her
hand, a ſmall Table that had been placed before her, thrown
down, her Jewels and other ornaments ſcattered upon the floor,
her cheeks blubbered with tears, her ſwoln heart ready to burſt
with ſighs, and in ſhort all the marks of an extreme grief, encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
even to diſpair.</p>
            <p>What an afflicting object this was to a perfect Lover, your
ſelves if you have ever felt the effects of that noble paſſion, may
eaſily judge. The accurate ſenſe of ſorrow had ſo bereft me of
all ſenſe, that as if thunder ſtruck, I fell proſtrate at her feet,
not able to utter one ſyllable; which ſhe perceiving, taking me
by the hand, and gently preſſing it, ſaid: Ah <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enodoxius!</hi> what
a world of enemies oppoſe themſelves to our happineſs? Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
kindred, friends, allies, and even the King himſelf, who
ought to be the protector of innocence, hath determined our
ruine.</p>
            <p>Whereupon a great number of Guards ruſhing in upon us,
ſhe gave a great ſhrike, and before I could turn my ſelf about,
we were both ſeiſed upon, and without being ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
a word, conveyed ſeverally away, under a moſt ſevere
reſtraint.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to relate how ſtrangely I was ſurprized with
this barbarous proceeding, and I will not offend your ears with
the ſpeeches or complaints which I uttered in my paſſion; but
in the ſolitude of my impriſonment, which I may truly ſo term,
for during the ſpace of three months, in which time my enemies
were perfecting their miſchief, none were ſuffered to come at
me except only two ſervants, who remained under the ſame cloſe
confinement, with the help of thoſe Precepts that I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from my faithful inſtructer <hi>Veveus,</hi> though ignorant of my
offence, I ſo compoſed my thoughts, that I reſolved with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to expect the event, and at length things being brought
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61061:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to that maturity which the contrivers thereof themſelves deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
my friends were again permitted to viſit me, yet my affairs
went ſo ill that none were very forward to perform that office,
only <hi>Parmenio,</hi> whoſe friendſhip made him a partner in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces,
would not ſuffer me to remain ignorant of what ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned my honor.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he ſo prepared me to endure the changes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and withal caſt out ſuch ambiguous ſpeeches concerning
my Love, that imagining any thing more poſſible then that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temia</hi>
could be falſe, I expected nothing leſs then the certain
news of her death.</p>
            <p>When at laſt fixing his eyes upon me, and fetching a great
ſigh; upon what terms, ſaid he, would you be content to quit
your intereſt in <hi>Artemia?</hi> Whereupon my blood riſing into my
face, Thy demand, I replyed, is injurious to our friendſhip, yet
upon the firſt offence not to cancel that band, remain ſatisfyed
with this anſwer, That not all the poſſeſſions of the world, the
hidden Treaſures of the Sea, what the fruitful earth may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
or the benignity of the Heavens can promiſe, is able to
purchaſe from me that ineſtimable Jewel.</p>
            <p>My demand indeed he continued, might give juſt occaſion of
offence, if ſhe had valued you at ſo high a rate; but if ſhe have
already changed you for another, and voluntarily delivered up
that Treaſure into the poſſeſſion of a Rival, upon which you ſet
ſuch an infinite eſteem, I ſuppoſe you will be content to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
upon eaſier conditions, and not be ſuch a ſlave to your
affections as by continuing your Love, to abandon your Honor.</p>
            <p>To which as in a fury I preſently returned, If <hi>Parmenio</hi> had
ſenſe of honor, he could not thus vildly blemiſh the vertue of
<hi>Artemia:</hi> Thou haſt conſpired with my enemies to betray me
to ſome action of infamy, and under the pretence of friendſhip,
ſeekeſt to undermine my Love, but thy blood ſhall pay the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
of thy baſe ſcandal, that in thy heart I may read the ſtory of
thy treachery.</p>
            <p>Whereupon with a ſad countenance, and tears in his eys, he
replyed, Theſe tranſportations are the generous effects of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61061:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but I hope the laſt effects of a dying paſſion. I came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for ſuch reproaches, and value not your threats. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
though my life were as mnch in your power as you pretend,
yet I am not to be frighted out of my fidelity, but when your
rage is ſatisfyed with my blood, in that heart which you believe
ſo trecherous, you ſhall finde the impreſſions of your own ſad
ſtory, all but this laſt part of it, which a heart ſo loyal as mine is
not capable of receiving, That <hi>Cenodoxins</hi> in defending the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of women, hath in his madneſs ſhed the innocent blood of
the faithfulleſt of friends.</p>
            <p>The faithfulleſt of friends! ſaid I to my ſelf, is a title much
more precious then that of the beſt of women: whereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
my thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and almoſt beginning to ſuſpect, what
under that name he had ſeemed to affirm, as one prepared to hear
the ſentence of death, I began to hearken to his diſcourſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with the moſt comfortable terms he could poſſibly invent,
he told me:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Eumenes</hi> the Kings only minion, though he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
ſo much, having ſtrong inclinations to <hi>Artemia,</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of my actions, and perhaps upon ſome information of my
particular addreſſes, grew into ſuch a jealouſie of being ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his pretences, that at his ſollicitation <hi>Scl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ucus,</hi> who in his
exceſſive indulgence to his favourites was only defective, had
in ſuch haſt recalled <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> from his Government. That
the match being propoſed, was joyfully accepted both by him
and his Allies. That thereupon <hi>Caliſta</hi> was employed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
her daughter to receive this new ſuiter, which ſhe at firſt
coldly refuſed, but being more earneſtly preſſed, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed;
not ſticking to avow that ſhe was already engaged in her
affections, and in ſhort, that ſhe was Contracted to me, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the rigor of her Parents, or perhaps her own diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
had concealed the conſummation of our marriage. That
nevertheleſs <hi>Eumenes</hi> perſiſting in his reſolution, ſince he could
not prevail by intreaties, to ſhew the power of a favourite, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by force to compaſs his deſires. That <hi>Caliſta</hi> was by
the King himſelf commanded to tell her daughter, that it was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61061:87"/>
his pleaſure, ſhe ſhould marry <hi>Eumenes,</hi> who ſo abuſed the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
he had with his Maſter, not being able indeed to deny him
any thing, that in caſe of refuſal Guards were appointed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her perſon, and at the ſame time to convey me to priſon, as
having tranſgreſſed an antiquated Law againſt ſecret Contracts
without the conſent of friends. That it happened immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after <hi>Caliſta</hi> had declared the Kings reſolute command to her
daughter, and was gone, I entring thereupon into the chamber,
found her having newly received this cruel Arreſt, in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate
poſture, and ſo as I have already told you, we were
both ſeiſed upon together. That to hinder all correſpondence
between us, it was held fit I ſhould be kept cloſe priſoner, and in
the mean while the kindred, and friends, to be employed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
her from her reſolutions, but that ſhe remaining yet firm,
<hi>Hortenſia</hi> who only knew our ſecret, and till then as ſuſpected
of partiality, had been kept from her, being gained with large
promiſes of rewards, had ſo wrought upon the weakneſs of her
young novice, by the charmes and allurements of a Princely
greatneſs in becoming the wife of the ſole favorite, that ſhe was
at length abſolutely overcome, and being now agen at liberty,
did openly avow her love to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and that though it were
already determined to nullifie the former marriage, yet to make
ſome ſhew of a legal proceeding, the chief Flamens were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
as Delegates to examine the juſtice of my cauſe. And
indeed to confirm the truth of <hi>Eumenes</hi> relation, before he had
quite finiſhed his diſcourſe, or I could make any Reply, I was
ſummoned to appear in the Court, and by my Guards conveyed
to the preſence of thoſe temporiſing Judges.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to recount the various agitations of my diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
mind in this unexpected occaſion: But oh the Heavens!
when I beheld <hi>Artemia</hi> ſupported by <hi>Eumenes,</hi> with an unuſual
confidence, before a publique Aſſembly, ſtand ready to confront
me, the billows of a tempeſtuous ſea are not more raging then
at that time were my diſtracted thoughts, and with the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
if I had been at liberty, I ſhould have broken out to
my revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61061:87"/>
But then calling to mind the innocent delights of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
converſation, a tender remorſe of love ſo calmed thoſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
paſſions, that being asked what were my pretences of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in that Lady, believing her innocence was betrayed, and
though forced to a complyance, that ſhe was not fallen from her
Vertue; inſtead of reproaching her Levity, magnifying her
perfections, I related at large the birth, growth, and maturation
of our Love, our mutual Vows, our private Contracts, our formal
marriage, and at laſt the fruition of thoſe joys, which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
eſteeming me worthy to poſſeſs, I could not now be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of, but by a too manifeſt, and impious violation of their
divine Ordinances.</p>
            <p>This laſt aſſeveration was a circumſtance unexpected by the
Judges, and I obſerved raiſed bluſhes in <hi>Artemia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> cheeks, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prepared with an anſwer, laying aſide all modeſty ſhe boldly
replyed:</p>
            <p>It is indeed true, that overcome with <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> flatteries,
not weighing the greatneſs of the ſin, I tranſgreſſed the rules of
piety in conſenting to an unlawful Contract, but conſidering my
unexperienced yeers, I hope my crime is not ſo great, that for
my puniſhment I ſhall be condemned to remain his wife, who
hath here, in the face of the world, laid ſo foul an aſperſion upon
my Honor.</p>
            <p>Till now, I muſt confeſs, I retained inclinations, ſo far as it
was lawful, to love that vild man, but ſince not ſatisfied to have
betrayed my youth to ſuch an unnatural contempt of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
he hath here ſo unworthily defamed my Chaſtity, there
is nothing I more truely hate, nor nothing more warrantable,
then to uſe all means poſſible to free my ſelf from his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Wherefore though <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s teſtimony with my own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
might be ſufficient to vindicate my fame, and to leave
me free to a more worthy choice, yet becauſe the ſcandal hath
been publick, to ſatisfie the whole world hovv much my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
hath been traduced, ſince our Lavvs permit not the tryals
of Chaſtity practiced among other Nations, by vvalking with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61061:88"/>
bare feet through fire, or over the ſharp edges of burning plough-ſhares,
I am content, though either of thoſe would be far more
gratefull, to expoſe my body to the near ſurvey of ſuch skilfull
perſons, who being competent witneſſes of my virginity, and
by a ſacred Oath obliged to the truth, may give teſtimony there
of to this Aſſembly. Yet conſidering the repugnancy of a
maiden-modeſty, to ſuch an immodeſt ſcrutiny, let me obtain
this favour, that to cover my ſhame, my face may be vailed
from the view of thoſe who are to be the witneſſes of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</p>
            <p>Was there ever ſuch an unheard of impudence? or ever ſuch
a ſubtile invention to work a ſiniſter end? which was ſo much
the more admirable, becauſe ſhe could hardly yet be called wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>I cannot but bluſh at the recital of ſuch immodeſties, and
muſt make a digreſſion to crave your pardon before I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
farther in my diſcourſe, which not to offend your chaſte
ears, I ſhall paſs over in as few words as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The Delegats commending her willing ſubmiſſion to ſuch a

               </gap> ſentence from
thoſe, as ſhe called them, ſacred Judges.</p>
            <p>Sacred indeed in their profeſſion and inſtitution, but by their
practice and precepts, the corrupters and ſycophants of
Princes.</p>
            <p>The Kings favorite is enamoured of a beauty already poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by another; he by his wicked Agents works her to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
divorce, and they to pleaſe the times, by a corrupt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
become the vile inſtruments to accompliſh his unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires:
For notwithſtanding the truth of my allegations, <hi>Artemia</hi>
gained her proceſs, and not long after with all the pomp of the
Court, was by the King himſelf given to <hi>Eumenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A gift I muſt confeſs worthy of a King, if overcome with
vanity, and the ſubtile allurements of a wicked confident, her
fame, before ſhe knew the eſteem of vertue, had not been ſo
miſerably betrayed to an eternal obloquie.</p>
            <p>But whilſt ſhe gloried in her inconſtancy, and <hi>Eumenes</hi> boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the purchaſe of ſo rich a prize, the ſenſe of this deep diſgrace
raiſed ſuch furies in my breaſt, that whilſt I meditated a revenge
anſwerable to the indignity I had received, the torments of my
own mind were greater then any I could invent to inflict upon
my enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eumenes</hi> death alone I thought too mean a ſatisfaction for ſo
monſtruous an injury, unleſs the falſe <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> the perjured
<hi>Artemia,</hi> the corrupt <hi>Flamens,</hi> and even the King himſelf, as
guilty of too much partiality, being complices in the offence,
participated likewiſe of the puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Artemia</hi> and <hi>Hortenſia</hi> not long after being found culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a greater crime, which is ſo publick a ſtory, that none are
ignorant thereof, and <hi>Eumenes</hi> as a confederate, from that
height of favour falling into the hands of Juſtice, my anger for
the preſent was in ſome meaſure appeaſed: In ſo much that
knowing the peacefull humor of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
pollicies he prevented all occaſions that might diſturb
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61061:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the calm of his Government, during the reſt of his Reigne I
lived quietly, if not contented in my former retirement.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Seleucus</hi> being dead, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſeated in the
Throne, though <hi>Clearchus</hi> for a time through an exceſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
enjoyed little leſs then a partnerſhip in the Empire, and
the Prince and Nobility, though they could not deny his merit,
maligned his greatneſs; yet he being by the butcherly hand of
an impious aſſaſſin, as you all know, in the midſt of the Camp
Royal, moſt barbarouſly murthered, the beams of favour were
ſo equally diſperſed, that through their benigne influence, every
one believing the way was now cleared to thoſe honours and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which belonged either to their birth or vertue, ſought to
ingroſs that authority to themſelves, which with ſo much mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
they repined at in another. And in this general mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of affairs, aſpiring with the higheſt, the renowned Juſtice and
generoſity of the King, made me hope, if not the chief place,
at leaſt a change in my condition.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having in a manner buried the remembrance of
my former diſgrace, in the graves of my perſecutors, I reſolved
once more to become a Courtier? O reſolution ſo deſtructive
to my repoſe! O ambition ſo fatal to my honour! But had I
only ſerved my ambition, and not again rendred my ſelf a ſlave
to love, Fortune who contemns that petty Deity, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have been more propitious to my deſigns.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Artemias</hi> perfections I might have conſidered the hidden
rancor of thoſe charming poyſons; in her ſudden change the
flexibility of womens minds, and in her unpatterned levity, the
frailty of the whole ſex.</p>
            <p>I was not yet ſo neglected by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> nor ſo diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> as well the Queen of his heart, as his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
in Soveraignty, but that in the purſuance of their favour,
I might have expected a more glorious ſucceſs, then in the vain
conteſtations of love, though <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf had been propoſed
the price of my Conqueſt: Nevertheleſs yielding to the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
of thoſe impotent delights, I began inſenſibly to burn in
a ſecond flame, which hath been the deſtruction both of my ſelf
and Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61061:89"/>
The Court was enriched with many excellent beauties, but
none in my opinion to be compared to the incomparable <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
whoſe fortunes not equalling her birth, ſhe eaſily condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſo advantagious a party. But the ſtory of her infidelity is
ſo well known to all the world, and ſo freſh in every mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that I need not be the relater of my own infamy; though
I cannot but exclaim againſt the folly of mankind, with ſuch a
general conſent to allow the lubricity of women, to become the
ſtaine of their husbands honor.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient the adultres was detected, and though I were
not my ſelf preſent, by divers of my neereſt freinds, ſurprized in
the luſtfull embraces of her amorous paramour.</p>
            <p>Wherefore her ſhame being ſo publick, and her minion <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellio,</hi>
though in the rank of Gentlemen, of too mean a quality,
and the offence too great, to admit the diſpute of an honourable
encounter, inſtead of revenge, ſeeking for Juſtice, I required
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the puniſhment due to their crime.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Vitellio</hi> being favoured by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> in lieu of redreſs, I
was forced upon our ſeparation, not alone to endow <hi>Paulina</hi>
with a large revenue, but to receive her baſtard-iſſue as the
lawful inheritor of all my fortunes, and only <hi>Vitellio</hi> to avoid the
fury of my indignation, was for the preſent, not baniſhed, but
as a darling of the Court, with many rich preſents, ſent to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
himſelf in foreign parts, in ſo much that I became the ſcorn
and deriſion, not only of <hi>Palermo,</hi> but even of the whole
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This laſt wound ſtuck ſo deep, and made ſo large an orrifice,
that all the furies of hel entring at once into my boſom, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
my paſt diſgraces in ſuch hideous forms tyranizing over
my honour, that the thoughts of revenge depriving me of
all repoſe, rage and diſpaire became at length the greater
tyrants.</p>
            <p>My Fathers blood, <hi>Agneſias</hi> languiſhing griefs, my violate
marriage, and this late contempt, raiſed ſeveral paſſions, which
like ſo many torrents, overthrew all obſtacles that withſtood
the rapacity of their courſe, where they met the greateſt checks,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61061:90"/>
raging with the greateſt impetuoſity, and though the ſacred
perſon of the King, with the holy Office of the Prieſthood,
ſeemed ſecure Ramparts againſt any violence, they ſwelled to
ſuch a prodigious height, that at laſt they overflowed them,
and have now cauſed a vaſt ſea of confuſion, in which my ſelf
have firſt ſuffered a miſerable ſhipwrack.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs thoſe two conſiderations of piety and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
had perhaps ſuppreſſed ſuch unruly thoughts, if the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of the times perceiving my diſtemper, had not taken
that oportunity to engage me in their own deſignes; but that
which chiefly forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed me in thoſe reſolutions, was the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Alucinus</hi> whoſe councels I had ever eſteemed as Oracles;
for coming one day into my Cabinet, where overwhelmed with
griefs, I ſate ruminating upon my own misfortunes, after ſome
gentle reprehenſions, he began to entertain me with a diſcourſe
much to this effect.</p>
            <p>If I were ignorant of your ſufferings, I ſhould wonder to ſee
ſo great a courage ſo overcome by ſorrow; and if your injuries
were not ſo publick to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould adviſe you with a
manly fortitude rather to reſiſt thoſe motions, which I doubt
not prompt you to a revenge, then by the purſuance thereof to
publiſh your own ſhame.</p>
            <p>But who is there, though then unborn, that is unacquainted
with the ſtory of <hi>Heraclius</hi> misfortunes? Is not the miſerable
ſlavery of the <hi>Sard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nians</hi> a ſad teſtimony of <hi>Agneſia's</hi> calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Who knows not with what injuſtice you were deprived
of <hi>Artemia?</hi> And the contempt caſt upon you in the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of thoſe baſe adulterers, is it not the common diſcourſe of
every mans mirth? even children point at you as you paſs the
ſtreets, and Mechanicks in every corner ſing the vile paſquils
publiſhed in your diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding you will perchance object, and that may be
the chief cauſe of your perplexity, That <hi>Theodora's</hi> monſtrous
ingratitude to <hi>Heraclius</hi> and her tyrannical oppreſſion of <hi>Agne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
though they were acts of extream cruelty, yet ſhe being
dead, you can now retain only the reſentment of them, That
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61061:90"/>
               <hi>Seleucus</hi> who ſupported the inſolency of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> is by the
ſame fate exempt from the juſtice of your revenge, That the holy
function of the Flamens, cannot without ſacrileidge ſuffer a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in their perſons; and though <hi>Antiochus,</hi> through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations
of the Queen, hath by an injury of the higheſt nature,
without regarding the dignity of your birth, expoſed your life
to a perpetual infamy, yet being by the ſupreme powers ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a King, though he abuſe his Authority, the puniſhment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
only to themſelves, and to attempt ought either againſt
his perſon, or his power, were an impious violation of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>It is true, though three Kings ſucceſſively have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
perſecuters of your Family, yet if their malice had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no farther, theſe reaſons might prevail with you, for a
privat cauſe, not to diſturb the publick peace.</p>
            <p>But the whole Nation groans under the power of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
who not content with an unlimited power in himſelf, which he
wholly ſubmits to the unbridled will of <hi>Eudoxia;</hi> but ſeeking
to introduce again the ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
make us ſlaves to the inſulting pride of his ambitious Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,
which by the memorable prudence and piety of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
though in other things extravagant enough, being reduced
to a ſmall number, and a power depending only on the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
begin now to be more aſpiring then ever.</p>
            <p>I will not inſiſt upon the ſufferings of the Commons, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what falſe pretences they are burthened with intollerable
Taxes: It will be enough by repreſenting the corruptneſs of
the Fountain, to give you a view of the impurity that flows in
all the ſtreams</p>
            <p>Doth not the Queen with ſuch an abſolute dominion ſway
the affections of the King, that none dare pretend to advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but by her mediation? And by her ill placed favours is
not the Court, the proper ſphear of Princes, become a harbor
only for diſſolute youth? or at the beſt ſuch as they call wits?
who becauſe they can hold up a chat, contrive the intriques of
a Comedy, and in their ſmooth Rimes flatter the Ladies,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61061:91"/>
are thought the fitteſt Miniſters to govern a State.</p>
            <p>How often whilſt the Buffon <hi>Crotus;</hi> the chief Poet, and the
chiefeſt of Poltrons <hi>Valerius,</hi> the ſtrong gameing wit <hi>Andemus,</hi>
the play-wright <hi>Dante,</hi> the Railleur <hi>Arterius;</hi> the intriguer
<hi>Grollio,</hi> with the reſt of that Cabal, and their chief Patron, the
luxurious <hi>Vitellio,</hi> have been admitted to the privacy of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors;
have the chiefeſt of the Nobility, upon urgent affairs,
like ſo many Lacquays, attended in the Ante-Chamber for an
Audience? And no ſooner diſmiſſed, but every one of you
paſſed under the cenſure of thoſe flattering Criticques? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſlus</hi>
in his old faſhioned habit ſmells too rank of Antiquity,
<hi>Percianus</hi> is reaſonably well dreſſed, but holding his noſe in the
Aire, walks as if he were broached upon a ſtake, <hi>Giraldo</hi> beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with too much Learning, <hi>Archelaus</hi> an honeſt fool, and
your ſelf of ſo tame a diſpoſition, that no Lady would deſire a
more patient husband.</p>
            <p>Can men of ſuch noble deſcent ſuffer ſuch vild affronts? Or
becauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> hath deveſted himſelf of his power, are you
obliged to loſe the remembrance of what you are? Were not
Kings choſen for the publick good, and when by their ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they in a manner make a war againſt their people, doth it
not tend to the diſſolution of their power? And if they obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
perſiſt, are not the Subjects freed from the bond of their
Alleagiance? To which they are no longer obliged, then whilſt
they receive Protection from their Prince.</p>
            <p>Conſider the general ruine that is threatned to the whole
Kingdom, in the ſubverſion of our fundamental Laws, and
though the reſt are poſſeſſed with a Lethargick ſtupidity, be
you awake to the crying complaints of your Country.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath laid ſo many afflictions upon you,
not as puniſhments, but by inciting a juſt indignation againſt the
ſubverter of our native rights, to manifeſt to the whole world
[the incomparable vertue of your mind.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſince by theſe diſgraces; you are as it were point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out to the people, to be the Champion of their Liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
not to undertake the protection of ſo juſt a cauſe. Or if
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61061:91"/>
you can forget your unſpeakable injuries, and unconcernedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the miſeries of the Commonwealth, at leaſt ſuffer not your
ſelf to be thus trampled on by every upſtart Polititian.</p>
            <p>Though you have neither a heart of revenge, nor a ſenſe of
juſtice, I am ſure you cannot be without an ambition to enjoy
thoſe honors that belong to your birth: and the path to the
higheſt dignities is now ſo beaten, that every State-Novice hath
found the way to compaſs his own deſires.</p>
            <p>If you once ſhew your ſelf an enemy to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> you
may be ſure he will ſeek your friendſhip: both <hi>Seleucus</hi> and
himſelf have been ſo beſotted with the love of Peace, and ſo
unskilled in the art of governing, that whoſoever have oppoſed
their proceedings, or by any means ſought to embroil them in
troubles, inſtead of puniſhment have been rewarded with Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the greateſt truſt.</p>
            <p>Who more fierce to defend the Peoples Rights, then that
Gyant of the Law <hi>Severus,</hi> till for the title of Advocate-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
he ſold his honeſty? <hi>Appius</hi> upon the ſame ſcore was made
high Chancellor, <hi>Gallus</hi> Treaſurer, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> chief Juſtician,
and to conclude, what greater enemie of the kingly Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
then the now only <hi>Atlas</hi> of the preſent Tyranny <hi>Affrodar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?</hi>
Therefore the more you decline from that which you call
duty, the greater value you ſet upon your ſelf: and if you paſs
ſo far as once to appear in Arms, doubt not but <hi>Antiochus</hi> to
purchaſe his peace will part with a great ſhare of his power,
which you may afterwards employ as you pleaſe, either for your
own intereſt, or which is moſt worthy ſo generous a ſpirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
your Country from a certain ſlavery.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs being willing to be deceived I was eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by theſe deluſive Arguments, and though moved by a
private hate, framing ſuch plauſible pretences for the common
welfare, as were generally approved, I gained ſuch a conſiderable
number of adherents, even amongſt the moſt moderate men,
who wiſhed only a reformation of certain diſorders which were
prejudicial both to the King, and people, that I doubted not of
a ſucceſs in the enterpriſe: which not to diſſemble my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61061:92"/>
being ſo highly provoked by them, was abſolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the power and Office of the Flamens, and to let <hi>Antiochus</hi>
ſee that perſon he had ſo much contemned, was conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to pull the Crown from his head, but having ſhewn what
I was able to do, to do no more then was the duty of a ſubject,
or at the moſt but to limit that Arbitrary power, which had
been the deſtruction of mine own Honor, and was indeed the
general grievance of the people.</p>
            <p>Wherefore knowing how He was, notwithſtanding, as yet,
in a manner adored by the ſubjects, and the name of King even
reverenced amongſt them, I began firſt to caſt an aſperſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the preſent Government inſinuating by ſubtile Agents, that
they were unjuſtly burdened with heavy Taxes, that the publick
Revenues were laviſhly expended, that the pride of the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
was inſupportable, the Queens power intolerable, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of <hi>Affrodartus</hi> pernicious, and the proceedings of the
King terribly threatning a general ſubverſion both of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Religion. The Alliance contracted with the Roman
Emperor, by the match between your ſelf and the Princeſs
<hi>Theophania,</hi> though you were then both infants, giving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
aſſurances of the one, and the undertaking, contrary to
his inclinations, a war againſt the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> promiſing nothing
leſs of the other. For it could not be doubted when <hi>Affrodar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
engaged him in that enterpriſe, it was with a deſign, if he
proved ſuccesful, to conclude his Conqueſts with the abſolute
ſlavery of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſuggeſtions taking that effect as was deſired, having
gained the to ſtand as newters, all other neighbouring
Princes being imbroiled with wars at home, the people of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi>
leagued with us, the <hi>Cyprians</hi> our faithful friends already
in Arms; the <hi>Sardinians</hi> through jealouſie I had cauſed to be
ſowed amongſt them, of a total extirpation of their Nation,
revolted; and <hi>Antiochus</hi> through want of mony, the ſinews of
a war, but ill aſſured of thoſe forces he had raiſed under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Affrodartus</hi> for the <hi>Cyprian</hi> expedition, I began more
openly to declare my ſelf, and being accompanyed by <hi>Adraſtus,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61061:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Giraldo,</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> with divers more of the ſame confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
confidently preſenting our ſelves before his Majeſtie:
I boldly told him, that his own miſ-government was the cauſe
of theſe diſorders, and if he did not apply a preſent remedy,
himſelf with his poſterity would be involved in the general ruin.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch, that perceiving his deſigns to fail, his perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with ſo many dangers, and without doubt relying
upon the integrity of our intentions, returning agen to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
deſires of Peace, he ſeemed ready to comply with us in
whatſoever we would propoſe.</p>
            <p>Whereupon in the firſt place, we obliged him, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
their priviledges, to deſiſt from his enterpriſe againſt the
<hi>Cyprians,</hi> and disbanding his Army, to repair to his chief City,
there to conſult with us, for the future ſettlement of his affairs,
with faithful proteſtations, that a laſting peace being eſtabliſhed
in the Kingdome, we would imploy all our endeavours to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him the moſt glorious of Princes: which either through a
belief of our promiſes, or with the hopes of a perfect ſettlement
was ſo eaſily granted, that being now in <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſecured by the
affections of the Citizens we became more arrogant in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
requiring, before we would enter into any debate, that
<hi>Affrodartus,</hi> whoſe deſtruction was neceſſary for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our deſigns, for having counſelled the war againſt the
<hi>Cyprians;</hi> and <hi>Evaldus,</hi> the Arch-Flamen, as the chief contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the Roman alliance, ſhould be both delivered into the
hands of juſtice; That the marriage being not yet conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
the Princeſs <hi>Theophania</hi> ſhould be immediately ſent back
to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Contract pronounced void, and open war declared
againſt the Emperor. That all Taxes ſhould be aboliſhed, the
Flamens abſolutely deprived of their Authority, the Receivers
of the publick Revenue called to a ſtrict account, and the
ſtrength of the kingdom entruſted with ſuch perſons, as our
ſelves ſhould nominate; but above all, as obliged in commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſufferings, though indeed to have an Army yet on
foot for ſecurity, That the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> till they were reimburſed
their charges, ſhould not be bound to diſmiſs their Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:61061:93"/>
It would be infinitely tedious to relate the ſeveral diſputes,
and conteſtations on either ſide before <hi>Antiochus</hi> would yield to
theſe Propoſitions, but we perſiſted ſo reſolutely in them, and
were ſo cordially abetted by the Citizens, that at length, finding
it vain to reſiſt, he condeſcended to all our deſires, and to ſhew
the confidence he repoſed in us, puting himſelf wholly into our
hands, conſtituted me Lievtenant General of all the forces in
his Dominions, with ſo abſolute an Authority that I was no
longer a ſubject, but more then a Colleague in the Empire, and
himſelf enjoyed onely the Title of a King.</p>
            <p>Having thus attained to that heigth which was beyond the
aym of my Ambition, preſently ſeiſing upon all the ſtrong
holds and Forts of the Kingdom, but eſpecially the Magazines
and Navy; to be yet more abſolute, all thoughts of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being now laid aſide, I raiſed an Army, under pretence, that
the King, repenting his confidence in us, upon whom he ought
chiefly to relye, ſought to introduce a foreign Enemy for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment
of his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Nor ye content having thus deveſted him of his Power, to
render him as well contemptible, as odious, I declared him,
through natural defects incapable to govern, and to compleat my
revenge, through the occaſion of <hi>Vitellios</hi> favor, ſpared not to
caſt ſome aſperſions upon <hi>Eudoxias</hi> honor.</p>
            <p>At this diſcourſe the Prince could not ſo govern his paſſions,
but the blood riſing into his face, ſeemed ready to flye forth at
every part, to vindicate it ſelf from ſo foul a ſcandal; which <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodoxius</hi>
perceiving, with a ſubmiſſive countenance caſting his
eys upon the earth, and with a profound ſigh that teſtified the
ſorrow of his heart. The remembrance, ſaid he, of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
is no leſs grievous to my ſelf, then they are offenſive
to you, and have been injurious to my Soveraigns Honor; but
I have been thus punctual in my confeſſion, that I might leave
nothing to be objected againſt me; and my paſt crimes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greater then my preſent griefs, I ſtill hope in the concluſion
to reconcile my ſelf agen to your favour</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:61061:93"/>
He, reply'd the Prince, that is conſcious of ſo much guilt, and
can hope for a reconciliation, adds to his other faults a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unpardonable. But proceed without reply, for I will be
as juſt in my cenſure, as ſevere in the proſecution of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>Whereupon reaſſuming his diſcourſe, the King, ſaid he, at
laſt perceiving, and too late repenting the error he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in conferring ſo unlimited a power upon a ſubject, began
ſeriouſly to reflect upon his condition, which by his too much
facility he believed was almoſt become deſperate.</p>
            <p>His chief Councellors, <hi>Affrodartus,</hi> and <hi>Evaldus,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made a ſacrifice to the publick hate, the authority of the
Flamens, <hi>Theodora</hi> having taught us that it was not devine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcruple abſolutely abolliſhed, his friends as ſuſpected, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or apprehending their own danger, fled from him; all the
ſtrength and Treaſure of the Kingdom in my hands, and nothing
wanted to the conſummation of his ruine, but by ſending back
the Princeſs <hi>Theophania,</hi> and declaring war againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
to deprive himſelf even of all hopes of ſupport.</p>
            <p>Reduced to ſuch extremity, to prevent ſo fatal a miſchief,
with a reſolution deſperate as fortunes, but with a courage great
as his birth, he reſolved, if he muſt periſh, to periſh like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
To ſecure his Crown, and his Countreys peace, he was
content to be unkinged, and he would now be a King again,
though to the uttermoſt hazard of both.</p>
            <p>Wherefore departing from <hi>Parlermo</hi> with a numerous Court,
under pretence, according to the agreementr, of conducting
the Princeſs <hi>Theophania</hi> to the ſea-ſide, being a daies journey
from the City, with a ſmall train he took the rout of
where being arrived with the Queen and Princeſs in ſafety, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
proclaimed me and my adherents Traitors, he began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to levy Forces for his own and their defence.</p>
            <p>This was the period of all my wiſhes, and I now applauded
the influence of my ſtars, that I ſhould at length come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
worthy of my ſelf, for to ſpeak truly, though I were
content to make uſe of them, thoſe diſſimulations and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61061:94"/>
with which I had proceeded hitherto, were arts, that in
my nature I utterly abhorred: But to come to the deciſion of a
pitched battail, though the hazard were more, the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
was more honourable, and in conquering a King, and then
to lay the Conqueſt at his feet, the glory would be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
            <p>Wherefore flattering my ſelf with theſe Chimerical ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
having put the Army in a readineſs, which conſiſted
of fifty thouſand foot, and ten thouſand horſe, I began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards <hi>Cornavij;</hi> yet being within two daies march of
the Kings quarters, and underſtanding by my Scouts, that he
had not above ten thouſand men together, ſeeking only for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
I diſdained ſuch an advantage, which, if I had harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame thoughts as moſt of my adherents, I might then
have purſued to his final deſtruction; whereas on the contrary,
knowing his weakneſs, whilſt he marched away with that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number, under feigned pretences, I drew farther off,
giving him all the oportunity himſelf could deſire to aſſemble
his friends, who perceiving my ſlackneſs, and ſeeing him go on
with ſo undaunted a courage, flocked to him in his retreat from
all the Provinces of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The firſt Rendezvouz was at <hi>Mottingham,</hi> where <hi>Philocles</hi>
Prince of <hi>Theſſalie</hi> met him, though without any aid ſaving his
own valour; but at the ſame time <hi>Selindus,</hi> a Prince of long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wars, came in with eight thouſand foot and
two thouſand horſe, ſo that advancing to <hi>Vriconvi,</hi> the Gates were
immediately opened to him, &amp; the Citizens having at their own
charge raiſed ſix thouſand men, gave beſides ſuch ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of their fidelity, that conſidering the commodity of the
Haven, and if any accident ſhould happen, that it lay open to
the ſea, having appointed <hi>Iſmenus,</hi> a Souldier of approved truſt,
to be their Governor, and <hi>Vitellio</hi> with five hundred choice
horſe to be a guard for the Queen, he left her and the
Princeſs <hi>Theophania</hi> there, as in a place of undoubted
ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Then having conſtituted <hi>Selindus</hi> his Lieutenant General,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61061:94"/>
and <hi>Philocles</hi> General of the horſe, himſelf with all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he could make, marched towards where <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi>
a Prince of the blood-Royal, received him with five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
foot well armed, and four thouſand Lances; <hi>Fulvio</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
brought ſix hundred barded horſe, <hi>Petruchio</hi> eight hundred
Croſſ-bows, <hi>Cardenius</hi> a thouſand horſe lightly armed, <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a thouſand expert ſlingers, beſides two thouſand more arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with ſhort Swords and Targets of beaſts skins, and
<hi>Protomanthius</hi> Prince of <hi>Bernicia</hi> two thouſand Archers, and
eight thouſand reſolute horſe commanded by himſelf, and his
four ſons, the eldeſt whereof was not above nineteen years of
age, yet I muſt confeſs, both for their vertue and courage, the
admiration of Armies.</p>
            <p>Beſides the forces of theſe generous Princes, there were
three thouſand Gentlemen, the chief flowre of the Nobility,
who chuſing <hi>Albinius, Julianus</hi> and <hi>Bernardo,</hi> three Noble
youths, the brothers of <hi>Maxentius</hi> for their Captains, ſerved
as a peculiar guard for the Kings own perſon.</p>
            <p>Having thus aſſembled a conſiderable power, confident in
his own ſtrength, without regarding my motions, he marched
into the Province of <hi>Coritani,</hi> and as he advanced, daily encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in numbers. But though I had all this while remained in a
manner quiet, yet I was very carefull to obſerve his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and being particularly advertiſed by my ſpies of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
knowing the advantage was not great on either ſide,
having received a freſh ſupply of ten thouſand men from <hi>Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
I advanced upon the ſame rout he had taken, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolute for the encounter, ſtaying for me, encamped with
his whole Army in a large Campagne at the foot of <hi>Trapanio,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Mountain for ſhelter on one ſide, and a ſmall River for
defence on the other.</p>
            <p>The Armies being now in ſight of each other, ſeeing the
advantagious Poſt of the enemy, I thought it impoſſible to
attain them without too evident a hazard, and therefore rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Batalies, ſtood as in a poſture of defiance, ready to fight;
which <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceiving, either impatient of delays, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61061:95"/>
to be ſo braved by a Subject, paſſed the River, and
<hi>Selindus,</hi> like an expert General in the ordering of his men,
ſhewed himſelf worthy of that Authority.</p>
            <p>The King had the advantage of horſe both for number and
courage, being for the moſt part compoſed of Gentlemen of
the chiefeſt quality in the Kingdom; but my Infantry were
both better diſciplined and more reſolute for the combat.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, both ſides ſhewed ſuch an ardor to meet, that
they prevented the directions of their Officers, and the charge
was ſo furious, that they ran together pel mel without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Commanders, and even the King himſelf fighting in
the melle as a common Soldier; ſo that though before the Armies
joyned I had given a ſtrict command not to endanger, but if it
were poſſible, to ſeize upon his perſon; yet in ſo general a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion,
he ought his preſervation only to his own valour, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch an invincible ſtrength in his arm, that the brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Sword was no leſs terrible, then if <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf
to ſupport the glory of a triple royalty, had armed him with his
threefold Dart, to the amazement and confuſion of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> likewiſe by his ſurpaſſing courage ſhewed
himſelf animated with the blood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and after a brave
conteſt, at length totally routed the whole body of our Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but tranſported with a youthfull ardor, was ſo eager in the
purſuit, and afterwards his men, believing they were abſolute
victors, ſo abandoned themſelves to the plunder of our baggage,
that in the mean while my reſcue commanded by <hi>Pratinus,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them afreſh, made a horrible ſlaughter amongſt the foot,
which would rather have appeared a maſſacre, if the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a vigilant eye in every place, with the three thouſand horſe
of his guard, and a thouſand more under the conduct of <hi>Pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomanthius,</hi>
had not come oportunely to their reſcue.</p>
            <p>But upon his appearance, the ſouldiers who before having
ſeen the fall of <hi>Selindus,</hi> were ready to ſhrink, renewing their
vigor, the fight began to be bloudy, and the victory wavering,
ſometimes enclined to the one ſide, and ſometimes to the other;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61061:95"/>
When <hi>Corinnus</hi> a daring Souldier, making his way with his
ſword through the thickeſt of the Enemy, having killed <hi>Enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi>
the Bearer, ſeized upon the royal Standart, which being
thrown down had undoubtedly put an end to the diſpute; if
<hi>Iurius</hi> as bold in his attempt, had not by the death of <hi>Corinnus</hi>
recovered that loſt Enſigne, with which he again raiſed the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of his party.</p>
            <p>But once more Fortune ſeemed inclinable to favour ours,
when the King ſpyed me ſingle, in a ſudden rage ſpurring on his
horſe, ſo far engaged himſelf, that he was preſently inveſted
round, with a yet entire Troop that came to my ſuccour, who
notwithſtanding my order, to ſecure themſelves from the fury
of his blowes, to endeavor the preſervation of their own; for
death attended upon his ſtroakes, and the fire darting from his
eyes, was no leſs killing then his ſword.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he muſt at length have been oppreſſed with
multitudes; if the three gallant brothers <hi>Albinius, Iulianus, and
Bernardo,</hi> with the reſolute <hi>Prontomanthius,</hi> perceiving the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their Prince had not like lightning flown to his
aid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinius</hi> firſt making his way over heaps of dead bodies joyned
with the King at the ſame inſtant that his horſe was killed under
him, who preſently mounting him agen on his own, fought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on foot, till with his death he gave the laſt teſtimony of his
loyalty. But <hi>Iulianus, Bernardo,</hi> and <hi>Prontomanthius</hi> having
deſpight of all oppoſition by this time forced their way through
our Troops, environing their Soveraign, gave ſome reſpite to his
almoſt wearyed force, yet it was my chance with the force of a
batle-axe to throw the young <hi>Bernardo</hi> on the earth, and I was
now engaged with <hi>Iulianus</hi> who fought gallantly to revenge
his brothers death, when the Kings guards of Cavaliers coming
furiouſly on to their ſuccour, ended this cruel conflict by force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to retire.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs though they ſecured the perſon of the King,
and carryed off <hi>Iulianus,</hi> and <hi>Prontomanthius,</hi> yet both thoſe
latter dyed ſhortly after of their wounds; and the night now
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61061:96"/>
coming upon us, both ſides were rather tyred, then either of
them victorious.</p>
            <p>Wherefore by a mutual conſent ſounding a retreat, we both
drew off, uncertain which ſide had gained the advantage, onely
this I muſt confeſs, that what the Enemy onely doubted, we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
believed, and therefore the King retyring to the other
ſide of the river kept the Feild, and in the darkneſs of the night,
I having rallyed my Troops the beſt that I could, withdrew to
<hi>Cornavii</hi> a ſtrong Town, ſome three hours march from the place
of battaile, leaving it as yet diſputed who bore away the honor
of the day, which for my part I will not take upon me to decide,
your ſelves weighing the circumſtances will be the moſt compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
judges.</p>
            <p>On our ſide the horſe were abſolutely defeated, the baggage
taken, and many of our choice Commanders, beſides common
Souldiers ſlain; On the other, the number of their dead was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, the foot almoſt either all killed or routed, and beſides
<hi>Selindus</hi> who commanded in chief under the King, and thoſe
already named, a great number of the Nobility likewiſe loſt their
lives.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is true, beſides the honour of the remaining laſt in
the feild, the King the next day, ſeeing no Enemy appeared,
marched directly towards <hi>Palermo</hi> the chief fortreſs of our
ſtrength, though being within four leagues of the City, the
principal Burgers, who were faithful to my deſignes ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the people with the bloody cruelty of the Royaliſts, that to
prevent his neerer approach they iſſued out in multitudes againſt
him; Inſomuch that <hi>Antiochus</hi> apprehending I might likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
upon him in the rear, having paſſed only ſome light skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
with thoſe ſwarmes of Citizens, he retreated in very good
order to <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> which being in the heart of the Kingdome, and
the Province abounding with all manner of proviſions was
thought the fitteſt place to make his chiefe reſidence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
applying himſelf to the care of rendering that City defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the winter growing on, for the preſent, deſiſted from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enterpriſe; &amp; his Majeſty thus eſtabliſhing himſelf, I having
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61061:96"/>
not a power to impeach his deſigne, with the reſidue of my
broken Army, retired for ſhelter, and to recover new force, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Palermo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the event of the firſt battaile in this bloody war,
which I have related thus punctually; becauſe your Highneſs
being then too young to uſe the exerciſe of arms, hath not
perhaps been fully informed of ſome paſſages that I have now
noted unto you: but in the enſuing treaties of peace, and all
actions that have occurred ſince, having been your ſelf either
preſent, or a principal actor, I ſhall paſs them over with ſilence,
and come now to that laſt point, which hath been to me ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous,
and is of greateſt conſequence to your ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Armies therefore being withdrawn into their winter
quarters, the King, to ingratiate himſelf with the people, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a general pardon, propoſed certain Articles of agreement;
but ſome of my party having farther deſignes, hindered the effect
thereof, perſwading me that though they intended nothing more
then the preſervation of the royal dignity in a well grounded
peace; yet no peace could be ſecure till the proſperity of our
affairs made us able to preſcribe the conditions, inſomuch that
by degrees ingaging my ſelf, I was inſenſibly ſo far ingulfed in
a diſturbed ſea, that it was indeed impoſſible to return agen to
the harbour.</p>
            <p>Wherefore after the various ſucceſſes of ſeven years war,
growing at length ſenſible of thoſe miſeries in which through
ambition, I had involved my native Country, I reſolved at laſt
in the hazard of one battel, both to put a period to my owne
hopes, and to the lamentable diſtractions of the whole
Iſland.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe raiſing a mighty power, and through an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of his conduct and courage, having conſtituted <hi>Coraſtus</hi>
my Lieutenant General, who having cunningly inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into all my Councels, though I were not ignorant his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
ſquared not altogether with mine, yet being acquainted
with the ſecret of my intentions, he ſo well diſſembled the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
of his heart, that I conceived not the leaſt ſuſpition of his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61061:97"/>
treacherous machinations; and therefore underſtanding that
the King returning victorious from the ſiege of <hi>Dobuni,</hi> at once
to put a foil upon his conqueſts, and likewiſe to intercept his
paſſage, the whole Army not being yet ready to move, I left
<hi>Coraſtus</hi> to haſten their diſpatch, and my ſelf onely with twelve
thouſand foot and ſix thouſand horſe, advanced to the borders of
<hi>Coves,</hi> where his Majeſty then lay to refreſh his Army, with
an intent as ſoon as the reſt of my forces came up to give him
battel, and in the mean while to hinder thoſe ſupplies that might
come to him from <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> or the other Garriſons remaining in
his obedience.</p>
            <p>But whilſt ſecure in the fidelity of <hi>Coraſtus,</hi> and boaſting the
hoped for ſucceſs of this laſt enterprize, I contrived the way
how to manage the conqueſt to my greateſt glory, he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully,
not onely retarded the advance of thoſe ſupplyes;
but having infuſed into the Souldiers his owne Principals, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
them perfidiouſly to my deſtruction: For publiſhing to
the world, I aſpired onely by ſubduing <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to ſet the
Crown upon my owne head, and to continue, if not increaſe the
ſlavery of the people; having expelled thoſe of my party, he
rendred himſelf maſter of <hi>Palermo,</hi> and by the advertiſements
of my friends, I knew it was in vain either to expect aid from a
new enemy, or to attempt any thing againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who
having likewiſe intelligence of this rupture amongſt our ſelves,
though I offerred upon conditions to ſubmit, and to joyne with
him againſt the common Enemy; yet the propoſitions which
ſeemed neceſſary to me for my ſecurity, appearing to him inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and unreaſonable, he reſolved to give us battel; and I
through the exigence of my affaires ſought not to avoid the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
the iſſue whereof hung ſome time in ſuſpence, and the
victory without flattery, ought wholly to be attributed to your
owne valour, for when you charged our horſe, they retired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the foot, put all into ſuch a confuſion, that never was a more
abſolute defeat, nor ever any General from ſo much greatneſs
reduced to a more miſerable condition.</p>
            <p>Wherefore being diſtitute of all hopes to reſtore my fortunes,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61061:97"/>
or by death to finiſh my diſgraces, I abandoned the feild, and
have ever ſince wandered vp and down, as much as was poſſible
avoiding the ſociety of men, thinking my ſelf only happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no witneſſes of my ſhame.</p>
            <p>But in this ſollitary perigrination often reflecting upon thoſe
diſcourſes with which <hi>Coraſtus</hi> frequently entertained me in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat,
though I thought them then rather matters of argument,
then ſetled maxims by which he would govern his actions, yet
by what he hath now done, the perniciouſneſs of his deſignes is
too manifeſt, and by his betraying of me, and the ſuppreſſion of
my party, he only endeavours to make his way more eaſie to
the ruine, not only of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but by cutting off the Royal
line of the Regal Authority.</p>
            <p>This is no aſperſion of malice that in revenge I ſeek to lay
upon my adverſary, in diſcovering to you his tranſactions and
proceedings, I ſhall manifeſt the true drift of his deſignes, and
free my ſelf from that ſuſpition, wherefore having now ended
the ſtory of my misfortunes, which I hope hath in ſome ſort
mittigated the height of your indignation, though I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then what you may collect from the circumſtances
thereof, to alleadg in my excuſe, yet when I have repreſented
to you the condition of your affairs, which through a partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Councels, perhaps you do not rightly underſtand, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the intereſts of the Crown, I doubt not but you will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pardon my tranſgreſſions, though never ſo great, then by
nouriſhing a vindicatiue humor, abandon your own cauſe.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Alexandro</hi> caſting his eye upon <hi>Ervillius,</hi> ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a little, but perceiving by an alteration in his countenance,
that with ſo long ſitting up he began to be weary, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſhew of mildneſs he deſired <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> to reſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of his diſcourſe till ſome other oportunity.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Nicander</hi> entring into the room, preſented a

taking <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> with him, retired to his own appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

that his ſwoln breaſt was ready to break with
anguiſh:wherefore deſcending into the Garden,
invited by the murmuring of the fountains that ſeemed to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize

a ſeat at the entrance of a grot, with his head, though his back
were towards it, leaning upon a Marble Pillar that ſupported the
Arch which lead into that pleaſant ſolitude; and then caſting

of <hi>Theophania,</hi> he began with ſighs and tears to give a vent to
his paſſions.</p>
            <p>When as ecchoing his groans, from the inmoſt part of the

perceived to proceed from the ſad accents of two womens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

made ſuch a hollow noiſe, that he could ſcarcely diſtinguiſh the

of his ſteps, treading by chance upon a looſe quarrie in the
pavement, artificially placed ſo on purpoſe, at the preſſing
thereof a great ſtream of water hit him with ſuch a force juſt in
the face and eyes, that whilſt he dryed himſelf with his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,
the Ladies, who were not willing to be ſeen, pulling
down their vails, had an oportunity without being deſcerned, to
ſtep by him, and through a doore that entred into the Park,
which in their paſſage they made faſt, conveyed themſelues out
of his ſight, though not ſo nimbly but that turning about, he
diſcovered in them both ſuch a perfect ſhape and proportion, as
drew after them his admiration: The one attired in great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

                  <p>I Need not tell you that <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> incited by a
natural vanity, and the diſgraces caſt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Family, under pretence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good, together with his revenge, ſought the
advancement of his own greatneſs: And that
though many of us perceiving the drift of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
nevertheleſs favoured his proceedings, it
was ſtill with a hope by thoſe means to recover
that dignity, of which, Kings fearing our power,
have by degrees, and to their own ruine, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
deprived us.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt by force and policy we thus ſtrove
to ſatisfie our ambition, in contending for more
then we had, we ſhall probably looſe that little
which remained. For <hi>Corastus</hi> conſidering with

to the Crown, and being a diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
of the diſſimulations, arts and ſtratagems,
by which we ſought to compaſs our ends, inſpired
with more generous thoughts, he thought it a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which perhaps <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> cals treachery, to
ſeparate himſelf from ſuch partial Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Without fraud or deceit he declares his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <hi>Alexandro</hi> having read the Letter, I ſee, ſaid he, the heavens
are juſt in making our enemies the active inſtruments to deſtroy
each other; and though <hi>Coraſtus</hi> at length ſupplant me in my
right, I ſhall not loſe my revenge.</p>
            <p>The heavens, replyed <hi>Syneſius,</hi> afford you other comforts,
then to make your greateſt and moſt dangerous enemies, the
Umpires of your Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The greateſt perhaps, ſaid the Prince, but not the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
A plain thruſt, though directed by a ſtronger arm, is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61061:100"/>
eaſilyer avoided then a cunning feignt, which offering at the
foot, is aimed at the heart.</p>
            <p>Force may repel force, but diſſimulations, plots, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures,
noble ſpirits know not how to encounter, becauſe
they are not exerciſed in the management of ſuch arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coraſtus</hi> cannot be truely ſaid to rebel againſt the King, but
rather to have ſuppreſſed a rebellious Uſurper, and by what I
underſtand, the frankneſs of his proceedings is ſo generous, that
whatſoever are his pretences, if it were poſſible to come to an
agreement, I had rather to enjoy a devided Empire with him,
then be fully reſtored by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Cenodoxius;</hi> for his
proceedings under ſpecious pretences of reformation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
proteſtations to advance the intereſts of the Crown
have been ſo injurious both to King and people, that by his
wicked practices they are now almoſt irreconcileably engaged in
one anothers ruine: Yet I muſt confeſs if he had avowed his
cauſe, I ſhould not have been ſo much offended with his actions,
nor altogether ſo averſe from a reconciliation: For great men
that are ſenſible of their owne diſhonour, are the fitteſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
for Princes, and being cheriſhed the chief ſupports of the
Crown.</p>
            <p>Your wiſdome replyed <hi>Syneſius,</hi> ſo far exceeds your graces,
that if your conduct be equal, though you ſhould be overcome,
whilſt you maintaine ſuch gallant principles, your fall will be
more glorious then others conqueſts; and even your enemies
in the height of their proſperity will lament the misfortune of
their victories, that in the juſt purſuance, as they call it, of their
liberties, they were forced to be ſo unſeaſonably ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p>I wiſh, ſaid <hi>Alexandro,</hi> I may deſerve your praiſes, for I
had rather have my memory preſerved with the attribute of
good, then fortunate: But fortune is commonly an attendant
of prudence, and wiſe Councels will add rigor to my armes,
therefore ſince your advice may be far more beneficial to my
affaires, then your commendations, though I accept the one as
an effect of your civility, I ſhall hearken to the other as to an
Oracle.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Syneſius</hi> glad of the occaſion preſently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They preſume with too much vanity upon their owne ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
that intrude themſelves into the Councels of Princes,
but to every one, when commanded to deliver his opinion, it is
an obligation of duty; yet I ſhould now be ſparing of mine,
becauſe I perceive your judgement is already byaſs'd another
way, and <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> having deſired me, as a mediator, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
what he hath more to ſay, I may perhaps incur the cenſure
of partiality.</p>
            <p>However ſince in obeying your commands, I cannot but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his requeſt, I ſhall the more boldly hazard my ſelf, with
a hope to content both; and craving pardon for my preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
deſire the liberty to utter my thoughts freely, as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the more remote originals, as the preſent remedies,
which if prudentially applyed, may appeaſe the raging of theſe
our horrible diſtractions. Whereupon the Prince having aſſured
him that he expected not leſs, nor deſired nothing more, with
a compoſed gravity, he entred into this enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> in his ſtory hath pointed out divers things, which
like ſtill gliding ſtreames ſearching the defects, have in ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time undermined the banks that preſerved our peace from
all perils of inundation.</p>
            <p>The popularity of <hi>Theodora;</hi> the contempt of all things
ſacred; The too peaceful inclinations of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> The unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
power of favourites, the unſeaſonable mildneſs of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
pardon me if I mention it, his too great indulgence to <hi>Eudoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a;</hi>
Her ſlighting of the Nobility, and through a fond averſion
to war a general neglect of our ſecurity: But in theſe latter times
nothing hath been more prejudicial to the Kingly dignity, then
by ſeeking with rewards to appeaſe the turbulencie of factious
diſcontented ſpirits: For every weak capacity perceiving that
was the way to advancement, ſtudying nothing more then to
ſhock the royal authority, eaſily arived at thoſe honours that
were above their deſerts, and ſo diſencouraged the loyal endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of thoſe, who truly reverencing their Soveraign as they
ought, would not by meriting his hate, aſſure themſelves of his
avour.</p>

Beſides the examples already produced, look into your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            </p>
            <p>The old <hi>Gibideus</hi> now a great Councellour, through hate
to <hi>Clearchus</hi> laid the ſlander of a horrible paraſide upon his
Maſter; <hi>Ergogius</hi> his Son, the now onely confident of the

            <p>Theſe, with many more, who not being ſo eminent, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely

believe it was ſo ſtrongly cemented together, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure
ſo firme, and ſolid, that to all humane apprehenſion it

which they conceive good conduct, with the help of the ſword,

            <p>But this is an errour too manifeſt to every common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

            <p>All other Nations in the world, when they firſt eſtabliſhed

            <p>By theſe Maximes ſtill tending to the ſame end, that State
which had no other Original, then a ſmall company of fugitives

and never receding from her firſt Principles, never ſuffering
any change either in her cuſtomes or government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> by a renowned conſtancy, and preſervation in

yet once elected, imbracing reſolutely thoſe of the

in thoſe luxuries of which they are ſo frequently accuſed, yet
their affaires, continuing in the ſame ſetled courſe, would ſtill
proſper with the ſame ſucceſs, and their greatneſs be the envy

And the frequent bloody ſtrifes between our Kings and the
Nobility, with thoſe more laſting and more devouring between
the two pretending families to the Crown, were but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

though worthy of all his greatneſs, too much byaſſed by his own

            <p>
               <hi>Eurideus</hi> ſucceeding in the Miniſtry, proceeded by other

others, not conſidering whether the ground were good, raiſed a
glorious ſtructure of imaginarie greatneſs upon a devouring
quickſand, ſo that any the leaſt mark remaines of that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
which was beheld with ſuch general admiration by the
whole world.</p>
            <p>Thus, what one built, another preſently deſtroyed, and thoſe
active ſpirits, who ſought to prefer themſelves, neglecting the
intereſts of their Country, applyed themſelves onely to thoſe
ſtudies that might render them moſt gratefull to the preſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
who being moſt powerful, were moſt likely to advance

chief work maſters ſo often failing, and every new one ſerving
himſelf with new inſtruments, and new materials, the old ones
were either altogether uſeleſs, or through diſeſteam, or want
of complyance, not regarded.</p>
            <p>That Country which is ſo unhappy to be governed by ſuch
depraved Councels, muſt of neceſſity be a nurſery of factions,
and diſcontents, which through thoſe errors, and defects ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
amongſt us, that it was impoſſible they ſhould be long
contained within the bounds of duty: And <hi>Cenodoxius</hi> moved
by the ſenſe of his diſgraces, finding the humors of men ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent
to his deſigns, through Vanity and Revenge, engaged us
all in a miſerable war, of which as he was himſelf the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
ſo himſelf hath firſt felt the cruel effects thereof.</p>
            <p>He hath freely confeſſed the fault, and you acknowledge his
provocations have been great, wherefore if ſatisfyed with the
puniſhment he hath already ſuffered, and what he alleadgeth as
an excuſe, can move your judgement to a mitigation of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
I fear the Arguments are pregnant enough to perſwade
you for the future to embrace his Amity.</p>
            <p>If it were poſſible, as you ſeem to intimate ſuch a deſire, to
come to an agreement with <hi>Coraſtus,</hi> I ſhould acquieſs in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
for he indeed ſo openly diſcovers his intentions, and thoſe
who adhere to his party, are a people of ſo much greater inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
then either the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> or thoſe of our own Nation,
which favor <hi>Cenodoxius,</hi> that probably the Peace might be laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though obtained upon hard conditions.</p>
            <p>But the freedom of his declaration, manifeſts the firmneſs
of his reſolution; neither is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he,
who hath undertaken ſo great an enterpriſe, and, without doubt
ſatisfyed in the juſtneſs of his proceedings, having ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to effect it, the chief ſtrength of the kingdom in his
hands, a mighty formidable Army, and in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo,</hi>
an inexhauſtible treaſure, will eaſily abandon ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
when the ſucceſs promiſeth ſo great a reward.</p>

<hi>Cenodoxius,</hi> yet we know from whence that proceeds, and his
own force is ſo inconſiderable, and ſo deſtitute of ſupplies to
maintain the courage of the ſouldiers, that <hi>Coraſtus</hi> already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

            <p>Wherefore your own ſtrength not being ſufficient to ſhelter
you from ſo great a ſtorm, you muſt by a timely aſſiſtance ſeek
to prevent the ſo much threatned danger.</p>
            <p>From whence then ſhall we expect theſe ſuccors? If you
depend upon ſupplies from abroad, you already know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
the fruitleſneſs of thoſe expectations, but that you may
no longer be deluded with ſuch vain hopes, conſider with how
little reaſon they have been hitherto entertained.</p>
            <p>The Grecian Emperors have received ſo many horrible great
affronts, and indignities from the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Crown, that <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
who now ſways that Scepter, cannot but with pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the oppreſſion of the royal Family. For though <hi>Theodora</hi>
during the reign of her ſiſter, ought the preſervation of her life
to the ſon of that famous Emperor, who deveſting himſelf of his
royalty, added immortality to his glory; yet being ſeated in the
Throne, ſhe not onely refuſed his alliance, (which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in it ſelf juſt, was a large teſtimony of his affection) but in
a time of Peace, not any occaſion being given, with fire and
ſword invaded his Dominions: And afterwards, contrary to all
Laws of Equity when the <hi>Peloponeſians</hi> revolted, with mighty
ſupplies both of men and treaſure, maintained them in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>Neither hath the King your father given leſs occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
where with ſcorn rejecting the ſiſter of this preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
he immediately contracted an alliance with his greateſt
enemy.</p>
            <p>Nor content with that affront when one of his chiefeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
ſhaking off the Imperial yoak ſet up an uſurping King
of their own, he without difficulty receiving the Ambaſſadors
of that new created Soveraign, both juſtifyed his actions, and
allowed a power of election in the people.</p>

Wherefore the match with the Princeſs <hi>Mariana,</hi> by the
death of young <hi>Leonides,</hi> taking no greater an effect, it cannot
be expected now he apprehends not your power, that he will
commiſerate your ſufferings.</p>
            <p>However though help fail on that ſide, you may imagine the
brother of <hi>Eudoxia</hi> will never ſuffer a King, ſo neer an allye, in
a caſe of ſuch exigence to remain deſtitute of ayd.</p>
            <p>Alas! He, and his great Miniſter, that ſtrong ſupport of his
maſters glory, <hi>Armandus,</hi> haue not contributed a little to
theſe our diſorders, though I muſt confeſs, not without mighty
provocations; for beſides that never any rebellions, as they have
been very frequent, were ever ſtirred up by any of the great
Princes in that kingdom, but either they were fomented or ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
abetted by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in their greateſt extremities,
when oppreſſed by a foraign enemy, we have likewiſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the alliance, and moſt unexpected propoſitions that
have been made to our advantage, refuſed them our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Armandus</hi> whoſe pollicies had a general influence,
ſince we would not accept of his offers, to ſhew his friendſhip
was not to be deſpiſed, and to let us know, our peace proceeded
not from our own prudent conduct, but from the diſtractions
of others; in that height of our felicity, when ſurfeited with
happineſs, we were grown inſolent, as with an unconcerned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
to behold the ſword, and deſtruction ravageing the
dominions of our neighbours, yet neither through generoſity,

And though by this time, perhaps, ſatisfyed with their revenge,
they would prevent our final ruine, they are now ſo aſſaulted on

            <p>The <hi>Peloponeſians</hi> likewiſe forgetting they owe their liberty
to our predeceſſors, moved with ſome ſlight injuries, and loving
your enemies mony better then your cauſe, are corrupted to be

Other Princes are ſo remote that they are unconcerned
in our differences. And to conclude having in our proſperity
ſeparated our intereſts from all the world, and never had a feeling
of others, we ought not to expect that any ſhould have a ſenſe
of our miſeries.</p>
            <p>Since then in this neceſſity of friends, there is no variety of

            <p>But though all neighbouring Princes were ready to afford you
their beſt aſſiſtance, foreign forces are ſo odious to your own

            <p>Beſides you need not doubt of the fidelity, and real engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Divinity, that though the people only through fear of
puniſhment are obedient to his Laws, yet whilſt they perform
their duty, he refuſeth them not his protection.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Prince perceiving he made a ſtop; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

poſſible, though not the affection you bear to <hi>Alexandro</hi> yet the

this retirement? Though you have made no mention of them,
I am not ignorant of your ſufferings, and the Heavens be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable

them.</p>
            <p>Sir, replyed <hi>Syneſius,</hi> this retirement is an effect of my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

They had entred farther into this obliging diſcourſe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
with a ſudden noiſe, they went both to ſee what ſhould
be the occaſion thereof; when paſſing through the great Hall,
towards the Gate, they were encountred by a multitude of
country people, all armed with ruſtick weapons, and ſome bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſeveral parts of their bodies, the freſh bleeding marks of a
terrible ſcuffle; but as a token of their victory, they lead pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
amongſt them nine or ten men, who by their appearance
ſeemed to be ſouldiers, and by their ſad dejected countenances,
ſenſible of their diſgrace.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with <hi>Lyſander</hi> and the reſt, were run
to the bruit, and the Peaſants as ſoon as they ſaw their Lord,
making a ſtand, without any confuſion, which commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
ſuch aſſemblies, gave way to a young man, a rich
Farmers ſon of the Village, that bore a great ſway amongſt
them, who ſtepping forward, whilſt the reſt were ſilent, with a
very good grace, and in terms better then his habit promiſed,
ſaid,</p>
            <p>Having ſome days together repaired to the adjacent woods in
ſearch of cattle that were ſtraied, theſe two laſt, I obſerved divers
ſoldiers likewiſe frequented the ſame whom I met ſomtimes two,
ſomtimes three, and once diſcovered twelve together refreſhing
themſelves by a ſpring, whether unleſs by ſome extraordinary
chance, not any man ever reſorteth. Wherefore ſeeing them
lie ſo concealed, I ſuppoſed they were either the conſorts of thoſe
that had cauſed the late diſorder, or elſe were appointed for
ſome more miſchievous intentions: ſo that poſſeſſed with this
apprehenſion, having advertiſed my neighbours thereof, we
ſurpriſed them this day again in the ſame thicket feeding upon
ſuch proviſion as they carried about them, and though unarmed,
every man laying hold of his Sword, they made ſo ſtout a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
that many of my companions bear, as you ſee, the marks
of their valor. But at length being hedged in on every ſide,
and three of their aſſociates already ſlain; the reſt throwing
down their weapons, yielded themſelves all, ſaving that (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to one who held by half a dozen, was ſtronglyer fettered
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61061:106"/>
then all the reſt) I know not whether to call him, more, or leſs
then man; for though in his defence he ſhewed a courage more
then humane, yet ſo obſtinately to reſiſt ſuch a multitude, was
rather the teſtimony of a ſavage fierceneſs, then of a courage
guided by reaſon. His looks threatned to devour, and when
moved by compaſſion to ſee ſo much valour ſo deſperately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
intreating him to yield, we offered him his life, diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our courteſies, as aſſured of the prey, he ran more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſty
upon his aſſailants.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he was at the length overthrown by his own
ſtrength, for with a prodigious force directing a blow at my ſelf,
miſſing his aim, and following his ſtroke, his feet failing, he fell
to the ground; whereupon half a dozen of our moſt reſolute
men at the ſame inſtant falling upon him, he was rather catched
as in a toil, then taken.</p>
            <p>What himſelf and his fellows did intend, we know not, nor
were we ſo over curious to ſeek to force that from them which
they ſeemed ſo reſolute to conceal; but by preventing of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in bringing them thus captived into your preſence, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
we have performed our duty.</p>
            <p>The Princes exceedingly attentive to this relation, with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
eyes obſerved the comely perſonage of the valiant priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who all this while never lift his eyes from the earth, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked by <hi>Syneſius,</hi> with ſuch civility as might oblige him to
a reply, what he was? With a ſtern regard he boldly anſwered,
A Souldier.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe no leſs, ſaid he, But how came you hither? when
with a diſdainfull ſmile, he replyed, Hath not this gallant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
who with his quaint Rhetorick cals valour brutality, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you? By the vile cowardiſe of my companions, who
baſely yielding themſelves, betrayed me into the hands of this
rabble.</p>
            <p>It is not my intent, continued <hi>Syneſius,</hi> to irritate you with
unſeaſonable or impertinent demands, I mean, what deſignes
brought you into theſe Quarters? My revenge, replyed the
Souldier, which ſince I have failed of accompliſhing upon my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61061:106"/>
if I did not ſtill retain hopes to ſatisfie, I would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
execute upon my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Alexandro</hi> ſteping forward, ſaid, ſo great a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
ought not to be vanquiſhed by deſpair; if your quarrel be
juſt, you ſhall not want the liberty in a noble way to proſecute
your revenge, nor yet friends that will readily embrace your
cauſe: But before we proceed any farther, tell me freely whoſe
Souldier you are?</p>
            <p>When the Priſoner looking ſtedfaſtly upon him, with a more
ſubmiſs, but with a countenance expreſſing ſomething of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
anſwered, Should any here but your ſelf, by asking that
queſtion, have dared ſo much as in thought, to doubt of my
loyalty, my hands in deſpight of theſe fetters, without other
reply, ſhould ſoon have forced him to learn that truth, which
by a natural ſympathy with my heart, is ſo plainly charactered
in my face.</p>
            <p>This anſwer diſcovering to <hi>Syneſius</hi> that the Priſoner knew
<hi>Alexandro,</hi> preſently cauſing him and his companions to be
looſened, with great commendations, and many thanks, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the young Farmer, he diſmiſſed the Countrey people;
and the Prince with his company retiring into another room,
whether the Souldier was commanded to follow, after they
were ſeated, he told him, I perceive you know me ſo well,
that you cannot but know the reſpect you are obliged to bear
me, yet I will not now uſe my power, but with entreaties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you to lay aſide your fierceneſs, and in complyance with
my curioſity, to acquaint us both what you are, and with the
cauſe of your diſcontent.</p>
            <p>I dare not, ſaid the Souldier, diſobey ſo great an authority,
though to any elſe I might juſtly excuſe my ſelf, in the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the remembrance of my griefs, not to add to my torments;
But ſince ſo ſad a Story cannot but make impreſſions in a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

been honoured with ſo noble a compaſſion. When breathing

more worthy of my eſteem: So that the ardor of our loves,
was the cement of our friendſhip, and by cheriſhing that Noble
flame, as our deſires encreaſed, we grew more enamoured of
each others vertue.</p>
               <p>This was the original of that fatal love, which beginning in
the ſad obſequies of a dead Father, had likewiſe a moſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
concluſion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs at the preſent we flattered our ſelves with the
hopes of a farr better ſucceſs, when the ceremonies being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Monelia</hi> ſupported by two of her neareſt allies, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out of the Temple, and ſtopt by the croud of people,
made a ſtand juſt at the Pillar, which during the ſolemnity, had
been our ſtation, and offering her the convenience of that place
to repoſe her ſelf from the preſs, with a gracious bending of her
body ſhe accepted of our civilitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61061:108"/>
There at a nearer diſtance, but through a ſcarf of thin black
Tiffany, we ſurveyed thoſe perfections, which believing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
we were ready to adore, till perceiving our boldneſs,
ſhe pulled down her great vail; and when with one offended
look, ſhe might as eaſily have ſtruck us both dead, was pleaſed
only with that gentle cruelty to check our preſumption.</p>
               <p>But the throng once paſſed, being retired to her Palace, ſhe
was ſo ſtrict an obſerver of the rules of mourning, that many
weeks after not ſtirring abroad, nor admitting any viſits but the
condoleances of her kindred, we could not poſſibly arive at that
felicity, to be bleſſed with the ſight of her fair eyes, much leſs
by any aſſay of our fortunes, to begin the progreſs to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>We daily viſited thoſe Walls which encloſed the habitation of
our Deity, whether multitudes of ſouls continually flocked to
offer up their devotions; We went frequently to the Temple
to reverence thoſe ſtones which ſhe had hallowed with her tears;
we preſumed to poſſeſs that ſeat, which was the throne wherein
with ſuch mildneſs ſhe reproved our audacity, and at length one
day as we ſate thereon, diſcovering of that paſſage, we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
walking by us, attended only by two maids, the Saint that
we adored.</p>
               <p>It was the firſt time after her retirement, that ſhe appeared
again to the world, and therefore as others out of cuſtom, ſhe
through a devout zeal made her motions to the Altar; at the
ſteps whereof whilſt in an humble poſture ſhe implored the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the God, <hi>Perrotus,</hi> tranſported with I know not
what rapſodie, not ſaying any thing to me, went directly to the
degrees, and kneeling cloſe by her, with his eyes fixed upon
the holy Image, but with his heart directed to <hi>Monelia,</hi> in a
low tone, yet ſo that ſhe might eaſily hear him, formed his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons
after this manner.</p>
               <p>Hail bleſſed Deity! Thou celeſtial purity, the Soveraign of
my heart, the period of my deſires, the ſoul of my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, my
only good! Though I dare not preſume to exalt my eyes to
the Majeſty of ſuch a heavenly beauty, vouchſafe to turn thy
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61061:109"/>
favourable regards upon the wretched captive <hi>Perrotus,</hi> either
eaſe him of his torments, or in compaſſion end them with his
life.</p>
               <p>This ſhort ſupplication was uttered with ſuch fervency, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
expreſſed the zeal of the ſupplicant; but the boldneſs
of the attempt ſo ſurpriſed <hi>Monelia,</hi> who very well perceived
to whom it was addreſſed, that remaining a while immoveable,
ſhe appeared as one through exceſs of order in her devotions
raviſhed into an extaſie, wholly alienated from her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs recovering her ſelf, ſhe preſently riſe, and glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a look on him, which he could not interpret other then a
meſſenger of her diſpleaſure, beckning her Maids, who waited
at a diſtance, haſted out of the Temple, but through diſorder,
and confuſion, leaving a ſcarfe upon the Pavement, which he
inſtantly with a trembling hand took up, that favour of hazard,
made him give it a contrary conſtruction.</p>
               <p>Wherefore with infinite content, but with a pale diſcompoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
countenance returning agen to the place, where with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I beheld the extravagance of his proceeding, he recounted
to me the particulars, and ſucceſs of his audacity.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, though I conceived his indiſcretion unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
yet not to caſt him into diſpaire, I diſſembled my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which at length I found was indeed erroneous. For fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
all publick aſſemblies, that we might have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to meet <hi>Monelia,</hi> and to inſinuate our ſelves into her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
ſhe caſt ſuch favourable regards upon my friend, that
I, who obſerved all her geſtures, perceived ſhe was not diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his obſervances.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding fearing her bluſhes would betray more then
her modeſty was willing to diſcover, ſhe avoided as much as was
poſſible, all opportunities of diſcourſe; which ſhe not onely
graciouſly afforded me, but would oftentimes her ſelf miniſter
the occaſion, and one night at a Ball, being ſeated juſt behind
her, whilſt <hi>Perrotus</hi> danced with a young Lady, her moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
confident, turning about to me; I wonder, ſaid ſhe, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61061:109"/>
ſo hardy a Cavalier as <hi>Perrotus</hi> hath not yet by his addreſſes
ſhewed a particular inclination to ſome choice beauty; Or doth
he diſplay that black enſigne, meaning the ſcarfe, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continually
wore about his arm, to ſhew that his heart is dead to
love?</p>
               <p>Rather, replyed I, the fair one that beſtowed it upon him,
meant it as an emblem of her cruelty, as willing to afford him
no other favour but the livery of diſpaire, for aſpiring to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſo far above his merit; and in acknowledging his crime, to
mourn for his preſumption, in having dared to boldly to declare
his paſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, perceiving to what they tended, made her
whole face appear a garden of full blown Roſes, wherefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
to be too far engaged upon that ſubject, converting
her bluſhes into a ſmile, ſhe asked me if being perhaps more
diſcreet, I were not more fortunate in my love?</p>
               <p>To which I preſently returned anſwer; If never to have
preſumed to ſay I love, be free from offence; Or if to enjoy all
that ever I may pretend, be a happineſs, I may juſtly vaunt my
ſelf both diſcreet and fortunate.</p>
               <p>However though I dare not by an unworthy mention, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
her name, who vouchſafes to afford me ſuch comfort, I
I may without endangering her deſpleaſure tell you, that I have
a competitor in my love, yet, which perchance you will think a
miracle, his rivality, though I were aſſured he would arive at
his deſires, can no way traverſe my pretences.</p>
               <p>But to ſolve this Enigma, a ſecret inſtinct of nature works
ſuch a Sympathy between <hi>Perrotus</hi> and me, that one divine
beauty is the center of both our ambitions, her whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
I admire, The object of my delight is the ſoul of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and the Sun that yeilds him light, by the ſame vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
me with life. Onely in this we differ, that his deſires,
with a noble ardor, aim at a chaſte fruition, but my flame is ſo
pure and ſublime, that it hath purged the droſs of all low ſenſual
appetites; And whilſt he with uncertain hopes purſues the
dictates of that generous paſſion, I, approaching her perſon,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61061:110"/>
and admitted to a familiarity of converſation in contemplating
her better part, her ſoul, enjoy a happineſs which it is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſhould ſuffer any diminution, as it is that ſhe ſhould decline
from her vertue.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though the influence of our ſtars, in ſubmiting
us both to the ſame fate, threatned the diſſolution of a loyal
friendſhip, the ſupream powers, protector of ſuch holy leagues,
have, by regulating our affections, more firmly united our hearts
and the Goddeſs to whom we direct our addreſſeſs, when ſhe
frowns upon the one, torments the other, and if ſhe would be
ſo gracious, in ſatisfying both, can offend neither. But whilſt
they contendingly ſubmit to each others merit, may by the
beams of her favour communicate to the one all earthly
joyes, to the other more ſublimed pleaſures, till their ſouls Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
in thoſe amorous delights, aſcend to a perfect fruition
of her celeſtial perfections.</p>
               <p>So whilſt the glorious light of the world, into the diſplayed
boſome of the amorous <hi>Heliotropian,</hi> darts his directeſts beams,
his cheriſhing warmth affords likewiſe beauty, and ſweetneſs
to the neighbouring roſe, yet both growing on to perfection,
flouriſh without emulation, till the ſame power which gave them
being, greedy of their precious odors, with ardent Careſſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
their vital moiſture, they expire, a ſacrifice of perfume
to the adored author both of their life and death.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Mone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ia</hi> in declining the diſcourſe of <hi>Perrotus</hi> temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
found her ſelf more embraſed with this ſubmiſs declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of my no leſs temeratious, though more refined paſſion.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the aſſembly then breaking up reſpited the
doom I expected from ſo rigorous a Judge, and in the mean
while, what I had ſaid, made ſuch happy impreſſions, that conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her thoughts, and finding her charity could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to her honour, through a generous compaſſion ſhe
afforded relief to our ſufferings, ſo that at length <hi>Perrotus</hi> became
poſſeſſor of that rich mine of treaſure, which yeilded me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of wealth, yet diminiſhed nothing of his owne ſtore.</p>
               <p>A Diamond abates nothing of his hardneſs, receives no ſtain,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61061:110"/>
nor is of leſs worth the owner in being conſidered by a skilful
Lapidary, who underſtanding the true value thereof, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
contemplates its oriental luſtre. No more did <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
perfections receive any change or blemiſh, nor were leſs
eſteemed by her dear <hi>Perrotus,</hi> becauſe I paid them that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which was due to their incomparable worth, but he in the
poſſeſſion, and I in the contemplations of her divine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
enjoyed ſuch an abſolute content that it wanted nothing of
perfect but immortality, till the ſupream powers to ſhew a
great example to the world, that there is no true felicity, but in
their celeſtial manſions, from that height of happineſs ſuffered
us to be precipitated into a bottomleſs ſea of miſery, which the
two peerleſs lovers have already dyed with their blood, and
wherein I yet ſtruggle for life, onely through a deſire, if the
heavens will ſo permit, by a dire revenge to appeaſe their incenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ghoſts.</p>
               <p>But whilſt we lived favoured by fortune, though <hi>Perrotus</hi>
was indulgent to his love, he was not neglected of his honour,
nor was I ſo raviſhed with the contemplation of vertue that I
wholly neglected the practical part thereof:</p>
               <p>Being by profeſſion Souldiers, we are obliged in the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of war to purſue glory, of which we were the more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
that we might in ſome degree correſpond with the merits
of <hi>Monelia,</hi> and by our powers gain lawrels not to crown our
own browes, but to plant her an ever flouriſhing garden of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though whilſt we were Probationers in that noble
ſcience, we ever fought under the ſame Enſignes, yet grown
more mature in practice, being honoured with ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
we were many times ſeparated as the ſervice of our Prince
required; and whilſt I was employed in this laſt expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Cenodoxius, Honorius</hi> being avertiſed that the two ſons
of the Lord <hi>Syneſius, Philemon</hi> and <hi>Gernolanus,</hi> two perſons of
ſuch excellent judgement, and conduct, that being fallen from
their firſt Principles, they were no leſs eſteemed by <hi>Coraſtus,</hi>
then dangerous enemies to the King, either to raiſe new forces,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61061:111"/>
or for ſome other pernicious deſign, under pretence of a viſit
to their father, received harbor in this Palace, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of ſuch conſequence, and of a known courage, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotus,</hi>
with vvhat Troops he ſhould think neceſſary for the
enterpriſe, was appointed either by force or ſurpriſal to bring
them priſoners to</p>
               <p>Which charge he willingly undertook becauſe he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Country, and being to enter into the enemies
quarters, having beſides an intention if the firſt deſign ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or not, to make ſome other attempt, he marched out two
thouſand ſtrong, the groſs whereof he left in a valley ſome two
leagues from hence, whilſt with one choice Troop he advanced
to a Wood at the entry of the Park, where commanding them
to lie concealed under the covert thereof, having choſen out
three ſmall parties of his moſt experienced men, he ſent two
of them under the command of <hi>Diphilus</hi> and <hi>Erato,</hi> two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
of a tryed courage, by ſeveral ways through the Parke,
and himſelf with the third went a little compaſs about, through
the Wood, where we encountred that rabble of Peaſants,
with a purpoſe that none might eſcape, to ſurround the houſe,
and ſo without farther violence, unleſs they met reſiſtance, to
require the two brothers to be delivered into their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erato</hi> taking the lower way in a ſolitary remote walk, met
two Gentlemen, one whereof by the deſcription had been made
to him he conceived was <hi>Philemon,</hi> who being unarmed without
any difficulty ſuffered himſelf to be taken, and <hi>Erato</hi> ſending
him guarded to the Wood, went with this good news to ſeek
<hi>Diphilus,</hi> whom he found engaged, cloſe by a Grot, upon the
Mount with one of an invincible courage, who by the like
miſtake he believed to be <hi>Gernolanus,</hi> but with the loſs of
both his hands, the death of <hi>Erato,</hi> and two or three
more of his companions paid the forfeiture of that errour,
wherefore not able longer to withſtand ſo great a force, his
ſouldiers fled with him towards the Wood, whether being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
purſued by the Conqueror, ſurrounded by the Troop that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61061:111"/>
lay there in ambuſh, he was forced to yield; when ſuppoſing
themſelves poſſeſſed of the prey that they hunted after, they
preſently marched away to their main body, where by ſome of
the principal Officers, the two priſoners were ſoon known to be
Prince <hi>Philocles</hi> and his ſervant <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> who notwithſtanding
the miſchief he had done them, was received with great ſhouts
and acclamations of joy, neither was <hi>Philocles</hi> diſpleaſed though
he very much regretted the misfortune of <hi>Diphilus</hi> and <hi>Erato,</hi>
to find himſelf ſecure amongſt the Kings friends.</p>
               <p>But this mutual rejoycing was turned into a general conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when the remainder of <hi>Perrotus</hi> party flying from the
fury of the two enraged brothers, whom it was his chance to
encounter in the adjacent Wood, related the miſerable fall of
their valiant Captain, the only mirror for Lovers, the envy of
husbands, the ſoul of all Society, and a miracle of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Whereupon ſighs ſtopping the current of his ſpeech, the
Princes and <hi>Syneſius</hi> looking ſadly and with aſtoniſhment one
upon another, they all knew by the circumſtances, that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
had been a principal actor in this Tragedy, yet remaining ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
Oh mighty <hi>Jupiter,</hi> continued he, doeſt thou now rather
ſeek the attribute of powerful, then equitable, by ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means, (for it was not their courage alone could protect
them from the juſtice of his ſword,) to ſupport Traytors and
Rebels againſt an unequalled example of Obedience, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty!
Where ſhall Vertue, and Truth ſeek for refuge, if thou
ſuffereſt them thus in their followers, to be proſecuted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored?
for in depriving us of <hi>Perrotus,</hi> thou haſt deprived
us of all that in man could be called excellent.</p>
               <p>But not to give farther vent to my griefs, the mournful
nevvs of his death being by his dejected Troops carryed to
<hi>Palermo,</hi> he vvas bevvailed as a publick loſs: but ariving at
the ears of his ſo dearly cheriſhed ſpouſe, though ſhe appeared
a little ſurpriſed therevvith as firſt, contrary to all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe vvas ſo far from abandoning her ſelf to ſorrovv,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61061:112"/>
that ſhe ſcarce expreſſed ſo much grief as was decent; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
calling for <hi>Lucius,</hi> one of <hi>Perrotus</hi> his ſervants, who
had been preſent in the action, as if unconcerned, or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her loſs, made him relate every particular paſſage of that
fatal encounter, and as though ſhe doubted they had not been
ſufficient, curiouſly informed her ſelf how many wounds he
had received, in what part of his body, which was the moſt
deadly, and whether <hi>Philemon,</hi> or <hi>Gernolanus</hi> had given that
mortal ſtroak.</p>
               <p>When having ſatisfied her as far as he was able, and to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himſelf, ſhewed her the yet freſh bleeding teſtimonies of his
fidelity; ſhe with a kind of ſmile, telling him they were but
ſcratches, which would ſerve him to boaſt of as marks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
amongſt his companions, diſmiſſed him her preſence;
and I the ſame day returning from the Army, not knowing any
thing of this diſaſter, but haſting to embrace my friend without
ſtopping, rid directly to his Palace, and diſmounting at the gate,
encountered that faithful ſervant, with tears flowing in his eyes,
his countenance pale, and his limbs trembling, deſcending
from his Ladies Chamber: At which gaſtly ſight, preſaging
the worſt, I began not to be a little perplexed, but was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confounded, when at once telling me of his Maſters death,
and his Ladies indifferency, crying out he had lived too long,
to be the witneſs of ſuch a monſtrous ingratitude, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of grief, and want of ſpirits, which had iſſued out with
his blood, embracing my knees, he fell immediately dead at
my feet.</p>
               <p>Good heavens! how at this mutation of fortune, rage, grief,
and pitty, at once ſtrugling together in my boſom, deſtroyed
each other, yet neither obtained the victory! In beholding
that ſad ſpectacle of a loyal ſervants fidelity, I was all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
then reflecting on the bloudy ſlaughter of my friend, I
thought I ſaw his gaping wounds crying out to me for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which at the inſtant inflamed me with an unquenchable
fury; but then conſidering, that by a prodigious change, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi>
was now no more the ſame, but the ſepulchre of her
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61061:112"/>
own vertue, ſenſeleſs of pitty, and regardleſs of revenge
through extremity of anguiſh, I was ready to ſacrifice my own,
life in expiation of her inconſtancy, to the grieved ghoſt of
her noble husband; yet aiming a poignard at my heart, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paſſions were ſo ſtrong, that they withheld my arm, and
I remained the prey, of their cruel conteſtation.</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Lucius</hi> avouched it with his death, and had not
his death been a teſtimony of his truth, I could not poſſibly
have credited ſuch an unnatural failing; Nevertheleſs having
ſomething recollected my ſelf, I reſolved once more to ſee
her, and to perſwade her, though ſhe had loſt her vertue,
not to bring an infamy upon the whole ſex, by a too open
manifeſtation of her frailty.</p>
               <p>Wherefore uſing my former liberty, without a guide, I
aſcended the degrees, and paſſing through the outward room,
approaching ſoftly to the chamber dore, which being open,
in putting by the Tapiſtrie, I perceived her ſitting at a Table,
with her back towards me, as in a poſture of writing.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, finding ſhe neither ſaw, nor heard me,
I could not but make a little ſtand, to obſerve with what an
undiſturbed tranquility of minde, ſhe buſied her ſelf in ſuch
unſeaſonable employments: But I was aſtoniſhed, when
on a ſuddain ſhe cryed out, I come <hi>Perrotus;</hi> and at the ſame
inſtant that ſhe ſpake thoſe words, riſing from her ſeat, and
aided with a more then maſculine courage, ſhe plunged a
Dagger into her boſome, found an eaſie paſſage to her
heart.</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! how my blood chilled when I beheld her
fall? At the noiſe whereof a maide that waited in another
roome, came running, though in vain, to her aſſiſtance,
whilſt I through amazement, knew not whether to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Lucius</hi> death a dreame, or this Tragicall Sceane a
viſion.</p>
               <p>But approaching nearer, I found it was indeed the very
ſame, Conſtant, Chaſte, <hi>Monelia,</hi> in this laſt act of her life,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61061:113"/>
diſplaying the crimſon Enſignes of a Triumphant Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay which was greater at the preſent, my joy, to be
ſo undeceived, or my grief to ſee the world bereaved of ſo
glorious an ornament.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I bathed her wound with my tears, through which
her precious life expired, I kiſſed that heroick hand, which
ſtill graſped the reeking inſtrument, that had freed me from my
fears.</p>
               <p>But in applauding her reſolution, and in bewailing her cruel
fate, ſhe became ſenſible of my expreſſions, for opening her
fair eyes, with a ſmiling countenance ſhe embraced me, and
pointing to the Table, without ſaying a word, and without
either pang or groan, but ſtill and quiet, as the gentle calm of a
ſweet ſpring-tide-evening, that fair Sun ſet in the vermilion
cloud.</p>
               <p>Thus deprived of my light I was ſeized with a kind of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and my feeble limbs being ſcarcely able to ſupport the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or my greifs, leaning againſt the table, I perceiued lying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a paper directed to my ſelf, written with carracters of blood
which I ſtil preſerve about me as the warrant I have to live til her
commands be fulfilled. Wherupon drawing it forth of his boſom,
he delivered it to Prince <hi>Alexandro</hi> who whilſt he disburdened

               <p>Having finiſhed the reading hereof, now, ſaid <hi>Clorimanthes,</hi>
judge of the equity of my cauſe, and I doubt not but you will
give me leave to proſecute my revenge, which, though in the
preſence of <hi>Syneſius,</hi> I dare avow, can never be ſatisfied, but
with the blood of his own ſons.</p>
               <p>This ſad tragedie moved a wonderfull compaſſion in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and exceedingly augmented the griefs of <hi>Alexandro,</hi> who
perceiving <hi>Syneſius</hi> expected he ſhould ſay ſomething to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the cauſeleſs hate of <hi>Clorimanthes,</hi> taking him by the
hand, and embracing him, The heavens, ſaid he, <hi>Clorimanthes,</hi>
are witneſs, with what a true ſenſe of ſorrow, I have heard the
woful ſtory of your unfortunate friends: I confeſs as well to
ſatisfie your own honor, as the commands of <hi>Monelia,</hi> you are
obliged to ſeek revenge upon the authors of their death, and
I confirm my promiſe to aid you in the purſuit thereof; but
you muſt firſt find out who they were that have offended, and
againſt whom you are ſo juſtly incenſed, for I can aſſure you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the word of a Prince, that neither <hi>Philemon,</hi> nor <hi>Gernolanus,</hi>
are the perſons at whom you ought to direct your fury.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you eſteem your honour, or deſire a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61061:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſt ſatisfied with this truth, till I preſent your enemies
before you, which though perhaps you may think ſtrange, if
you obſerve my commands, and reſpect the Lord <hi>Syneſius</hi> as
one highly in my eſteem, I will not fail in a ſhort time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Clorimanthes,</hi> who durſt do any thing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
his Prince, having promiſed an entire ſubmiſſion to his will;
<hi>Alexandro</hi> went preſently to acquaint <hi>Ervillius</hi> with the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their late encounter, who being then accompanied by <hi>Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxius,</hi>
he ſhewed him ſuch civilities, as aſſured him that <hi>Syneſins</hi>
had dealt effectually in his affairs, who when the others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
being deſired to ſtay, gave the Prince a full account of
that paſſage concerning <hi>Philocles,</hi> which <hi>Clorimanthes</hi> had
touched on in his diſcourſe, and then, it being already far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the night, left him to his privacy.</p>
