            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Country Common BREWERS Humbly Offered to the Conſideration of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Acts of Parliament touching the Duty of Exciſe, Order that every Common Brewer, for every Barrel of Ale or Beer by him Brewed, whether Strong or Small, that is above 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Barrel ſhall pay to the King the Duty of 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Barrel, and for every Barrel of Ale or Beer of 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Barrel, or under, ſhall pay the Duty of 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Barrel; and by the ſame Acts every Barrel of Beer is appointed and allowed to contain 36 Gallons to the Barrel, and every Barrel of Ale to contain and be allowed 32 Gallons to the Barrel, each Gallon to contain 4 Quarts of the Ale-quart Standard of the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>And for the Brewers Encouragement, and towards their Loſs happening by Filling and Leakage, the ſaid Acts do allow and appoint that they ſhall have allowed them out of every 23 Barrels of Beer, they ſhall ſo Brew 3 Barrels, and out of every 22 Barrels of Ale 2 Barrels.</p>
            <p>That theſe Brewers ever ſince, and before the making the ſaid Acts of Parliament always Brewed Beer, and not Ale, neither do they pretend to Brew Ale, they being really and properly Beer Brewers, and ever accounted ſuch, and their Drink always taken to be and returned as Beer, and not as Ale, until about 4 years laſt paſt, when, by the Advice of Intereſted Perſons, Beer was to be deemed and returned Ale, and 36 Gallons thereby reduc'd to 32 Gallons; and in truth ſuch has been the practice ever ſince, and continues to this day.</p>
            <p>That the Gagers have alſo ſince that time further impoſed upon the Brewers, by Gaging and Returning their Worts hot from the Copper in the Backs and Coolers, whereas the practice was always quite otherways, and as is conceived by Law, the Gagers Return ought to be from the Tun, and no Returns to be made but from thence.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of which unwarrantable Gaging of hot Worts, and the Returning Beer to be Ale, the Brewers loſe an Eighth part of what they Brew, the Steem and Sediment being as well Gaged and Returned as the Worts, and the Allowance given the Brewers by the Acts alſo wholly taken away in ſuch falſe Returns.</p>
            <p>Great Differences have often aroſe between Brewer and Gager, and Applications made by the Brewer to Perſons Authorized by Law to determine ſuch Differences, who have often Adjudged on behalf of the Brewer, as is ready to be proved, yet all but fruitleſs and in vain; the Gager ſtill perſiſting in their irregular Returns, and the Brewers expoſed to the Mercy of a Gager's ſingle Oath, to Make and Return their Drink of what quality, and by what name they pleaſe, although they little or never were acquainted with the Brewing Trade, to the great Oppreſſion and diſcouragement of the Brewers in their ſeveral Occupations, and the diſabling them in their ready compliance of payment to their Majeſties of their Juſt Duty Aſſeſſed by Law, (which they always were, and ſtill are willing to do,) unleſs ſpeedily reliev'd and helpt by the Authority of this Honourable Houſe, which they humbly Offer to their Grave Conſideration for Relief therein.</p>
