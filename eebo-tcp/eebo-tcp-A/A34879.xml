            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>READER,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nature of man is prone to be inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after newes, especially in these unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, distracted times amongst us, it is a great part of the imploiment of people and takes up much of their time, as if</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>were</hi> Athens, <hi>and the people thereof</hi> Athenians, (who spent their time in nothing else: <note place="margin">Act. 17. 21.</note> but either to tell, or to heare some newes.) <hi>And yet the news wee beare is sometimes</hi> bad, <hi>sometimes</hi> uncertain, <hi>and many times</hi> false. <hi>Divert thy thoughts awhile from earthly things, and in this ensuing Treatise thou shalt heare, what newes from heaven in the Gospel. The Law indeed brings us tidings: but it is like the message of</hi> Ehud, <hi>to</hi> Eglon, <hi>it brings a dagger with it that stabs mortally: but the tidings of the Gospel is like that message</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>of the</hi> young Prophet <hi>to</hi> Jehu, <hi>to make him a King.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is nothing truly terrible, but the Gospel brings tidings of our freedome from it, (if we be believers) nor nothing truly amiable, but it tells us of our interest in it. How welcome to a poore captive is newes of deliverance from slaverie? The Gospel brings us tidings of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from</hi> sin, Satan, death, hell, <hi>from</hi> wrath, <hi>and</hi> damnation, <hi>it tells us of</hi> riches, <hi>and</hi> glory, <hi>and</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, <hi>and</hi> Crownes, <hi>and what soever may satisfie the capacious soule of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath appointed different conditions for men, and Angels, the Angels that stood they are so confirmed that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66290:3"/>
they cannot fall; the Angels that fell they are determined under eternail wrath that they cannot rise, but God from everlasting in his love, and mercy had appointed that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man should have a way of recovery, as a board after ship wracke, whereby he might come safe to the shore. And God in time was pleased to come out of his hidden eternity, and to discover this love of his to the world, and hath sent his Son to puhchase it, and his Spirit to apply it, and his servants to tell (not this, or that perticuler man) but <hi>all Nations,</hi> that <hi>whosoever believeth in Jesus Christ</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat 28. 19 Luk. 2. 10 Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>shall have everlasting life:</hi> this blessed tidings is brought by the Gospel.</p>
            <p>And let none say this newes is to good to be true, for God who is truth it selfe (as it were on purpose) to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the infidelity of man, hath <hi>said</hi> it, and <hi>sworne</hi> it, and <hi>sealed</hi> it with the blood of his deare Son, <hi>that we might have strong consolation;</hi> and hath made this fabrick <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> of the world to be as a stage to act the redemption of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on, which being finished, it shall be no more.</p>
            <p>It should stir us up to love, and blesse the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, and the holy Spirit; and to imbrace the Messengers that bring those glad tidings, to account their very <hi>feet beautifull,</hi> the meanest part of the body, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moutaines, the barren places of the earth. And I <note place="margin">Isa. 52. 7.</note> doubt not but many poore soules can from experience blesse God for the worthy Authour in those barren mountaines, where he converseth, and else where, and say of him as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> of <hi>Ahimaaz, he is a good man, and bringeth good tidings.</hi> Though others being hardened spit at such lights, <note place="margin">2 Sam 18. 27.</note> and labour to extinguish who God in just judgment will cause to stumble, and fall, and lie downe in eternall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But I shall detaine thee no longer from the the work; but commend it and thee to Gods blessing, and rest.</p>

            <head>GOOD NEWES To the Worst of SINNERS.</head>
            <p>MARKE 16. 15. <hi>And hee said unto them, goe yee into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may easily understand who spake these words, and to whom they were spoken. In these words, our Lord Jesus Christ after his resurrection, when he had all power in Heaven, and Earth given to him, he sends forth his Apostles to Preach, and he bids them <hi>Goe into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi> This was their Commission they were to have now, to go preach the Gospel; Indeed they had a Commission before, but it was only to the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and it was a little, but by spirts: but now Christ was risen from the dead, and had received all power in Heaven and Earth, he sends them for good and all (as it were) he gives them a full and compleate Commission, <hi>Goe yee into all the world,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66290:4"/>
               <hi>and preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the Lesson that I mean to insist <note place="margin">The words opened.</note> upon, there are two things here in the words that must be opened, that you may see the foundation, or ground of this Lesson; And that is,</p>
            <p>First, what is meant by <hi>Gospel? Goe, and preach the Gospel.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gospel what meant by it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then, what is meant by creature? <hi>Goe preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, what is meant by Gospel? I will not stand upon the severall acceptations of it, onely you may understand that both in the Scripture language, and also among the Heathen, <hi>Gospel</hi> hath been taken for <hi>Glad tidings, good newes</hi> in generall; any <hi>Good newes,</hi> or <hi>Glad tidings</hi> have been called <hi>Gospel;</hi> So the <hi>Greek</hi> word signifies, so some conceive the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Godspel,</hi> being old <hi>English,</hi> signifies <hi>Gospel,</hi> that is, <hi>good speech,</hi> good <hi>newes,</hi> good <hi>hearing,</hi> good <hi>tidings:</hi> but in a peculiar sense in Scripture it is taken for that <hi>Good tidings</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> by Jesus Christ. And so in this sense we read of it in the old Testament, and in the new. In the old Testament, you shall read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. that our Fathers they had the <hi>Gospel</hi> as well as we: but (Beloved) you are to take notice, that though our Fathers had the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that is, the glad tidings of life and salvation by Jesus Christ, from <hi>Adam,</hi> from the beginning of the world, yet they had it but dimly, and darkly; and they had it mixed with a great deale of <hi>Law,</hi> a great deale of bad tidings (as I may speak) they had a little <hi>good</hi> newes with a great deale of <hi>bad.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> had a little good tidings <hi>The seed of the woman shall bruise the Servents head;</hi> and there was bad tidings also, there was the curse upon the Serpent, and upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66290:4"/>
the woman, &amp; the man; the woman should bring forth in paine, the man must eat his bread in the sweat of his browes; And so in all the old Testament, there was a little <hi>Gospel</hi> in the Prophecies, and <hi>Gospel</hi> in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and <hi>Gospel</hi> in the visions, but abundance of <hi>law</hi> mingled with this <hi>Gospel;</hi> the one spake <hi>sad tidings,</hi> as well as the other did <hi>good;</hi> for you know the Law spake <hi>curses</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> to those that in every point did not observe it: But in the new Testament, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, when he went up to Heaven, we read that there was perfect <hi>Gospel,</hi> or only <hi>good</hi> newes, and <hi>glad</hi> tidings, for the <hi>bad</hi> newes was now all gone. And so it is to be understood here, <hi>Goe preach the Gospel.</hi> As if he should say, I doe not (my disciples) bid you goe and give them now <hi>good</hi> newes, and then <hi>bad,</hi> to give them a <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and a <hi>line</hi> of <hi>Gospel:</hi> but goe preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, that is, meerly, purely <hi>Gospel;</hi> for now Christ is risen from the dead, and now the Gospel in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and simplicity is erected, <hi>Goe preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[To every creature]</hi> What should be the meaning of <note place="margin">Creature what meant by it</note> that? We know that in the Scripture language, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> most usually signifies not men but <hi>beasts,</hi> &amp; things <hi>without life,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. you have it twice, or thrice <hi>The creature groaneth;</hi> the beasts, and the woods, and every thing that God hath made, as being a name somewhat too low for men in the ordinary Scripture expression. Yet so as it comprehends men: for men also are sometimes called <hi>creatures.</hi> Now, what should the meaning of this be, that now the Gospel being to be purely, and fully, and compleatly set up, whether the Lord Jesus would have them preach, and make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66290:5"/>
known glad tidings to <hi>all creatures,</hi> that is, that even the bruit <hi>beasts,</hi> and these creatures without <hi>life,</hi> that they should have glad tidings, and good newes from the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. I will not averr that it is so, that that is the meaning of it: but surely (beloved) there is <hi>no</hi> creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but hath a great deale of <hi>glad tidings,</hi> and <hi>good newes</hi> from the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ: for we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that the <hi>creature groanes,</hi> and the <hi>creature exspects deliverance,</hi> and redemption. All these creatures by sinne are brought into slavery, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they shall partake of the <hi>libertie of the Sonnes of God:</hi> there is a redemption for them out of slavery, as well as for men by the redemption of the Lord Jesus Christ: But what that shall be, or in what sort I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine. Now whether you will understand it so, that our Lord Christ meant not men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only, but that by <hi>creature,</hi> the poore <hi>creatures</hi> that are <hi>without life,</hi> and <hi>bruit beasts,</hi> and all might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the precious worth of this Gospel.</p>
            <p>Or take it more restrained as generally the godly <note place="margin">Gentiles called creatures.</note> doe, that by creature here is meant the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for they knew that they were to preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which they also did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the resurrection: but now saith Christ, <hi>Goe preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi> That is, now I will have no distinction of persons, I doe not now say, <hi>take heed of the way of the Samaritans:</hi> but goe which way you will, goe to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to <hi>Sinners,</hi> to any men, or women that you can call <hi>creatures, Scithians, Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, bond or free,</hi> goe and preach the Gospel to them, bring them glad tidings, and newes, that Iesus Christ hath brought <hi>life,</hi> &amp; <hi>grace,</hi> &amp; <hi>salvation</hi> freely for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66290:5"/>
That this is the meaning, compare it with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Goe therefore, teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> Here it is, goe preach to <hi>every creature,</hi> there it is goe teach <hi>all nations,</hi> I will have no partition, or distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them saith Christ. I gave you leave, and often bid you teach the <hi>Jewes</hi> before: but now goe teach the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for the world was then divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those two parts, <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> goe teach the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> goe teach every creature.</p>
            <p>But some may say; Why doth not our Lord then <note place="margin">Quest.</note> say, goe teach the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jew?</hi> Why doth he call them <hi>creatures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, it is not an ordinary expression to call <note place="margin">Answ.</note> men creatures in the Scripture: But the reason (as I <note place="margin">Gentiles the worst of sinners.</note> conceive) is this, because the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were great sinners and the greatest of sinners. And that you shall see clearly in divers places, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where Christ forbids us to take care for tomorrow, <hi>what we shall eat, and what we shall drink;</hi> why? for (saith he) <hi>after these things the Gentiles seek;</hi> that is, the worst of sinners, and we must not be like them. So in <hi>Ephs.</hi> 4. the Apostl would not have them <hi>darkned in their understandings, and walk as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mindes.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. It is an ordinary expression in Scripture, where great sinners are spoken of, either they are called <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or else compared to <hi>Gentiles, Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Are wee not Jews, and not sinners of the Gentiles?</hi> that is, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were the greatest sinners that were; now they being the greatest sinners, the Lord calls them creatures, and not men: because it is an ordinary expression in Scripture to call <hi>wicked</hi> people <hi>beasts</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>men, Isaiah</hi> 11. they are called <hi>Beares,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66290:6"/>
               <hi>VVolves,</hi> and <hi>Tigers,</hi> and <hi>Foxes,</hi> and <hi>Doggs,</hi> and <hi>Bulls, &amp;c.</hi> So in <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>You that were not a people</hi> saith Peter, <hi>hath God made his people.</hi> They were not a people; God will not ordinarily vouchsafe wicked men and women the name of people: but they <hi>were not a people.</hi> What were they then? They were <hi>Dogs</hi> for <hi>filth inesse, Foxes</hi> for <hi>cunning, Tigers</hi> for <hi>cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Beares,</hi> and such kind of creatures. Therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> were called the people of the Lord, not onely to distinguish them from others: but they were called the people of God, as we see in <hi>Exodus,</hi> it was a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be accounted a <hi>people</hi> first, and then the <hi>people of the Lord.</hi> Therefore the Lord Jesus because hee would not have his Disciples make any exception, hee calls them creatures; as if he should say my Disciples, though they be so sinful that according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scripture language you cannot call them <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> or <hi>people,</hi> yet they are <hi>creatures,</hi> and <hi>goe preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> go to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sinners in the world, whom I will not vonchsafe to call a people, yet they are creatures, goe preach the Gospel to them. So that now I am come to the lesson which we are to observe, and that is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Ministerie of the Gospel</hi> (especially after the resurrection of Jesus Christ) <hi>Containes nothing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good newes to the worst of sinners.</note> 
               <hi>but glad tidings, and good newes even to the worst of sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Creatures that were so bad that they could not be called men and women, yet saith Christ, goe preach the <hi>Gospel, pure Gospel, gladtidings</hi> to them. I say the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel if it be rightly dispensed doth not containe a tittle in it but perfect good newes, and glad tidings to the heart of the worst of sinners. For this is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66290:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the proper difference between the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The Law speaks good newes but only to the <hi>righteous,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Difference between the Law and the Gospel</note> 
               <hi>if thou doe well thou shalt be rewarded;</hi> if thou <hi>fulfill the Law</hi> thou shalt have <hi>life;</hi> the Law speakes well to a man <hi>quatinus</hi> as a <hi>righteous</hi> man: but the Gospel quite contrary, the proper object of all the good that the Gospel brings, it is to a man <hi>quatinus</hi> as a sinner, not as a <hi>regenerate</hi> man, and a <hi>righteous</hi> man, and a <hi>humble</hi> man, but as a <hi>sinner.</hi> And here is the excellency of the Gospel, the more sinfull any man is, the more <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> this Gospel is to him, the <hi>more sin abounds, grace abounds much more;</hi> therefore you shall read <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. they that had the benefit of the Gospel they are called <hi>ungodly, he that justifieth the ungodly.</hi> They are called <hi>aliens Ephes.</hi> 2. they are called <hi>strangers</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> and men <hi>without strength, Rom.</hi> 5. they are called the <hi>chiefe of sinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. So to enemies, aliens, strangers, lost people, unrighteous, ungodly, and the like; the Gospel brings perfect good newes, and glad tidings of life, and grace, and salvation by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Now this in some measure you know, but this that I tell you I feare you doe not know, that the Ministery of the Gospel it is only good newes, there is not one word of bad newes, not one line, not one sillable, or <note place="margin">Nothing but good newes now in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</note> tittle, but only glad tidings, sweet, and good newes to the heart of the worst of sinners. Therefore to shew you this truth a little more fully; Before our Lord Christ went to Heaven there was some Gospel, but there was much Law; and as our Lord Christ was a Minister of the Gospel, so he was of the <hi>circumcision,</hi> as the Apostle calls him, I mean before his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet it is said in <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. <hi>he took the booke of</hi> Isaiah
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66290:7"/>
(and some think this was the first Sermon that ever he made) and he read this place and opened it to the people. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because hee hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poore; he hath sent me to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, to recover sight to the blinde, to set at liberty them that are bruised; to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Beloved, there is nothing in all this but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good newes, glad tidings; as that the <hi>poore</hi> should have salvation by Christ, that the <hi>broken hearted</hi> should be <hi>healed,</hi> that the <hi>Captives</hi> should be <hi>delivered,</hi> that the <hi>blinde</hi> should <hi>receive their sight,</hi> and that them that are <hi>bruised</hi> should be <hi>set at liberty,</hi> and them that are <hi>slaves</hi> should have the <hi>yeare of Jubilee,</hi> the <hi>acceptable yeare of the Lord;</hi> there is not a tittle in all this but only good newes, and glad tidings.</p>
            <p>Take another place, and that is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. there <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 18. 19. &amp;c. opened.</note> you shall have the difference between the <hi>old Testament</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> or between the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> (if I may so speak) the Law; that is, the administration of the Gospel in the time of the Law, where there was a <hi>little good newes,</hi> but mingled with a <hi>world</hi> of <hi>bad,</hi> and terrible newes. <hi>Yee are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and darknesse, and tempest, and the sound of a Trumpet, and the voyce of words, which they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more. For they could not endure that which was commanded: And if so much as a beast touch the mountaine it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart.</hi> Here is nothing but what is <hi>terrible,</hi> and <hi>sad</hi> newes: as a mountaine that was so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible that it might not be touched; when God did give his Law upon mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66290:7"/>
that mountaine all burning with fire; If we see a house burning with fire it is terrible: but to see a <hi>mountaine</hi> all over burning with fire, and with blacknesse, and darknesse, and tempest too! A fire though it be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible yet there is somewhat comfortable, because there is light: but that fire was full of blackness and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and darknesse is a sad thing. And there was <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,</hi> and <hi>lightning,</hi> and <hi>thunder,</hi> and a <hi>voyce of words,</hi> a voyce of terrible words, that bid them doe such and such things that they had no power to doe, and yet they must doe them, or be damned. It was terrible, in so much that <hi>Moses</hi> himself, that used to <hi>see God, face to face,</hi> said, <hi>I quake exceedingly:</hi> and if a beast touch the hill he must be stoned to death, or thrust through with a dart. Here was nothing but terrible objects in the administration of the <hi>old</hi> Testament, in the giving of the Law upon mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> But come to the new Testament, of the Gospel as it is set up since Christ went to the holy of holies, after his resurrection. <hi>You are come now to mount Sion,</hi> and that was a pleasant place, if you take it according to the letter it was the pleasantest place about <hi>Jerusalem. And you are come to the City of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem.</hi> And, what a beautifull thing that is, you may read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. and 21. a City with 12 gates, and every gate a whole pearle. <hi>And to innumerable companies of Angels.</hi> Whether that be meant, that now, in the times of the Gospel, God sends out <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>minister</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> more <hi>frequently,</hi> or <hi>diligently</hi> than formerly; or as most men understand it, <hi>Ye are now come to a myrd of Angels,</hi> or to an innumerable company of Angels, that is, ye are come to an estate by Christ in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, wherein you are at least equall with Angels. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66290:8"/>
you are come to the <hi>generall assembly, and Church of the first borne;</hi> as if he should say, you are come to a Church where all are <hi>Patriarches,</hi> for the <hi>Patriarches</hi> were the first borne heretofore; <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and they were honourable men. Every Saint in the time of the Gospel is in as <hi>honourable,</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> a condition as any <hi>Patriarch;</hi> you are not come to a Church of <hi>ordinary</hi> Saints, but to the Church of the <hi>first borne, whose names are written in heaven.</hi> And <hi>you are come to the judge of all.</hi> You will say that is a terrible thing; No, it is a blessed thing to see God in the light of the Gospel to be a judge: Therefore in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. and divers other places, he comforts the Saints in their persecutions, and sufferings with this, that God will come to judgement, God is the Judge of all, it is a comfortable thing. And then you are come to the <hi>spirits of just men made perfect,</hi> to such an assembly of Saints, and Church of the first borne where the spirits of men are made perfect, that is beyond my expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conception; there is a perfection of the Saints in their <hi>love,</hi> and in their <hi>graces</hi> incomparably to that it was before. <hi>And yee are come to Jesus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling;</hi> You are come to such an estate, and to such a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where Christ is the <hi>Intercessor,</hi> and his <hi>blood speaks</hi> not as the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> it doth not cry for vengance, but alway for <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> from his father to you. You see in the administration of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> there is not <hi>one sillable,</hi> or <hi>tittle,</hi> but what is <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> even to the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>sinners.</hi> And therefore the Spouse in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> speaking of Christ (as I suppose) she commends Jesus Christ from the crowne of the head to the sole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66290:8"/>
of the foot as <hi>all beautifull,</hi> and <hi>amiable,</hi> and then she summes up all, <hi>Thou art all faire my love, there is no spot in thee.</hi> Jesus Christ in the new Testament, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel is <hi>all faire, altogether amiable</hi> even to the worst of sinners, there is <hi>no spot</hi> in him. So you have the Lesson breifly.</p>
            <p>Now that which with the help of God I will further <note place="margin">Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Gospel glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> doe, is to give you a weiw of the summe of the whole Gospel in particular, that so you may look upon every peice of it, and you shall see that there is not a jot from the beginning to the end, but it brings <hi>glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the worst of sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all you may take notice that the Gospel <note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel shewes mans wretched condition</note> doth <hi>hold forth</hi> to sinners their <hi>lost wretched condition</hi> they are in; In the Gospel poore sinners come to learne what a <hi>damnable wretched</hi> condition they are in whereas men <hi>without</hi> it think they are well, they doe no body <hi>hurt,</hi> they <hi>give</hi> to the <hi>poore,</hi> and <hi>lend,</hi> and the like, and yet they are going the <hi>broad way</hi> to destruction. Now we see not only by Scripture but by experience the <hi>Gospel</hi> tells them they are <hi>dead in sin,</hi> that they are <hi>children of wrath,</hi> that they are <hi>under the curse of God</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the broad way to hell.</p>
            <p>But you will say, is that good newes for a man to heare the Preacher say he is in a damned condition, and a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Beloved, it is sweet and good newes; if the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should make thee a <hi>damned</hi> creature, or <hi>dead</hi> in sin it were bad newes: but when the Gospel brings thee a light to see that thou art so, whereas otherwise thou in thy blindnesse wouldest goe downe to hell in it, it is blessed, and good newes; it is better to see it here than for ever in <hi>hell</hi> where there is no remidie. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66290:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is no man, or woman in this place that belongs to God, but they can blesse God, and his Son Jesus Christ that by the Gospel the Lord hath <hi>discovered</hi> to them their <hi>wretched</hi> condition that they were naturally in. That is one thing.</p>
            <p>A second instance is this, that the Gospel holds <note place="margin">2. The wrong wayes and meanes that men use for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> forth to sinners, all the <hi>wrong wayes</hi> that they goe, and all the <hi>wrong meanes</hi> that they use to save their soules; this is by the light of the Gospel. Man naturally is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>dead</hi> in sin, or <hi>asleep;</hi> or if he be a little <hi>awaked,</hi> he takes a thousand wayes to goe to <hi>heaven,</hi> and none of them Gods way, none of them the right way. Every <hi>carnall</hi> man sometime or other, hath some <hi>designe</hi> in his head to save his soule: <hi>one</hi> man thinks to doe it by his <hi>equity,</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> in his dealing, and trading; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his <hi>hospitality,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to the <hi>poore;</hi> another by hearing of <hi>Sermons,</hi> and performing of <hi>duties,</hi> as in the time of Poperie how many yeares did they spend, &amp; spent their strength and time, and their money, and when all came to all, all was lost; all their ways were the wrong way to Heaven. Now, the light of the Gospel discovers all these <hi>false</hi> wayes, and shewes that you will come <hi>short of the glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>salvation</hi> of your soules; and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that <hi>There is no Name under heaven by which you can be saved, but only the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Consider, is not this good newes that God should come first by the Ministery of the Gospel, and shew thee thy <hi>wretched condition;</hi> and then when thou hast spent thy time, and strength in false wayes to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to God, and to <hi>save</hi> thy <hi>soule,</hi> the Gospel comes and discovers all these that thou maiest go seek the true way?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66290:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thridly, the Gospel holds forth to poore sinners <note place="margin">3. It holds forth Gods love to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> that there is a <hi>love,</hi> an <hi>eternall love,</hi> an <hi>infinite love</hi> in Gods breast to poore sinners before ever the world was made. You know in reason a man would think that God should <hi>hate</hi> such a one as I am, God foresaw what a creature I would be when I was borne, and how I have lived; and reason would think that <hi>love</hi> should proceed from something <hi>amiable</hi> in the object that should produce love, some <hi>beautie,</hi> or <hi>bountie,</hi> as wee say: but God sees me to be wicked, and sinfull; and therefore reason would think God must damne me world without end. Now the Gospel comes to such a sinner, and tells him the case is otherwise, it is not so, poore sinfull man or woman, and though God hate sin above all things in heaven, or hell, yet God loved thee knowing what thou wouldest be; God knows the reason of it, we doe not; it is as it is said in <hi>Deutreno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I loved thee, because I loved thee.</hi> God hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, speciall love to thy poore soule, yet hates thy fin; from before the world was made, and the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were brought forth; So God loved the world, that he gave his Son</hi> &amp;c. There was a love in God, out of which he gave his Son Jesus Christ to die for us. This the Gospel, and the Spirit of God init, reveales to the poore soule, that when I was an enemie to God, hee was my friend; when I <hi>hated</hi> him, he <hi>loved</hi> me; nay before I was, God had thoughts of an infinite, eternall love to me</p>
            <p>Then fourthly, the Gospel holds forth to a sinner, <note place="margin">4. Gods love fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> that as God had an infinite love towards him, so it was not a <hi>cold</hi> love that ended in nothing: but out of this love God would send his Son Jesus Christ into the world to save sinners; This is one maine principle of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66290:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Gospel, that the Father out of his love sent his own Son, that was the Image of his person, the Son of his love, and delight into this world, to lay downe his life, and to die for sinners. Were it not for the Ministery of the Gospel we could never know this: how could we know but by the Gospel that the Lord Jesus Christ did come to die to save sinners? <hi>So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that hee that believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, breifly (for I doe but give you a few touches <note place="margin">5. Christ came to work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> of instances.) it holds out to us that as the Father out of his, love sent his Son; so that Jesus Christ actually, and really is come into the world, and took our nature upon him <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> and the infirmities of both, and sanctified our nature that he took, and in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture became our <hi>Surety,</hi> a <hi>Publick</hi> person for us; our Advocate, a second <hi>Adam.</hi> That he was conceived, and born of the Virgen; and that he lived here, and so did the will of God, and fulfilled his Law; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed many yeares among men, and that therein while he did so, he gave us many blessed experiments of his love, and mercy to poore sinners, in healing the sick, in giving sight to the blinde, in raising the dead. And while he conversed among men, he taught, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a great measure the mysteryes of his Fathers counsells to us, that else we could never have known, and gave us a holy patterne, and example of life, in humility, and patience, and delligence, and prayer, and thankfulnesse. All these things are good newes, and glad tidings to poore sinners, every part of them.</p>
            <p>Then the Gospel tells us, that this Lord Jesus Christ
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66290:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after he had walked among men for many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">6. Christ died for us</note> that then as a Publicke person, and second <hi>Adam,</hi> and our Surety, he did lay downe his life, and <hi>die</hi> for our sins.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Where is the good newes from that? Hence it is that poore sinners are reconciled to God, they are made friends with God. Hence it is that poore sinners are redeemed from all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>curse,</hi> and <hi>hell;</hi> all these by the death of the Lord Jesus are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Then the Gospel tells you that Jesus Christ, as hee died for our sins, so <hi>he rose againe for our justification,</hi> he rose againe from the dead the third day, whereby poor sinners are assured that they are justified and freed <note place="margin">7. He roase from death</note> from all their sins, and whereby they shall rise to <hi>grace</hi> here, and their soules and bodies shall rise to glory hereafter with Christ, and whereby they shall rise out of all afflictions also in due time; For the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is the ground of our resurrection out of afflictions in this world; and every tittle of this is glad tidings, and good newes to poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>Then the Gospel tells you that after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he conversed with his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and not with the <note place="margin">8. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with his discipls</note> 
               <hi>world,</hi> and that he met with his <hi>Disciples</hi> from one mountaine to another, from one Towne to another, for a few dayes after, and there he made many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prayers to his Father for them, <hi>and for all that should believe in him;</hi> and there he gave them instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and directions how they should order the Churches of God, and Preach the Gospel to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:66290:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And then you know the Gospel tells us that he went <note place="margin">9. Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heaven.</note> up into <hi>heaven,</hi> and from heaven, as soone as he came there, he sent his holy Spirit to us to unite us to Christ, to be our Intelligencer, to make known the heart of Christ to us, <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi> to comfort us in all distresses, and to make intercession in us till we come to heaven, where he is.</p>
            <p>And the Gospel tells us this good newes that when he went to heaven he made way for poore sinners to <note place="margin">10. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us.</note> come there, and that there he intercedes for us, and there succours us, and pities us when we are in the flesh as he was once.</p>
            <p>Then the Gospel tells us that in due time he will <note place="margin">11. shall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> come againe from heaven as he went, and bring a Crowne with him, and actually subdue all his peoples enemies, and give them the same glory that he hath, and they shall be one with God for ever as he is; he will come and take poore sinners to himselfe, that they shall be <hi>where</hi> he is, and <hi>as</hi> he is, world without end.</p>
            <p>The Gospel tells you moreover that all this love, <note place="margin">12. Gods Covenant.</note> and grace, and mercy, and salvation by Jesus Christ, here, and in Heaven, it is all made sure to us by an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, sure</hi> &amp; <hi>perfect</hi> in every point, as <hi>David</hi> saith. And this <hi>Covenant</hi> is sealed with the blood of the Testator, the Lord Jesus, that it might be sure: and he hath also sent <hi>Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> to make known this Gospel; and he hath given the seale of the Lords Supper, and Baptisme to confirme this Gospel. Put all together, and from the first to the last, you shall not finde in the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> (if it be truely, and soundly opened) any sillable but what is wholesome, and comfortable, and sweet and glad tidings to the worst sinners.</p>

Only, to cleare it more fully to you, there are some objections that you may make: (for Beloved it were a happy thing if we did fully understand this Lesson, and fully believe it) therefore that it may sink into your hearts, I will tell you all that I know can be said against it.</p>
            <p>One objection is, you will say, the Ministery of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</note> Gospel is not so very good, because we poore sinners doe not heare any thing in it for the body; we doe not heare any thing in it of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>wealth;</hi> we see peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as poor after they receive Christ as ever they were, and it may be poorer; and if God did mingle in the Gospel earthly things with heavenly, than it were good newes, worth the hearing.</p>
            <p>Beloved, concerning that I answer but in two words. <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>All the happinesse of this world consists either in <hi>honour,</hi> or <hi>wealth.</hi> As for <hi>honour,</hi> if you believe in God, if you receive Jesus Christ, the Gospel brings you ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that whereas now you are poore people that no body cares for, you shall be <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> as Christ is a <hi>King,</hi> so you shall be <hi>Kings,</hi> and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall be <hi>Queenes.</hi> Nay you shall be <hi>Princes in all Lands.</hi> You know earthly Kings are but Princes in <note place="margin">Psalme 45.</note> their severall Kingdomes, as the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. But the Saints, for <hi>honour</hi> are <hi>Princes in all Lands. They shall binde Kings in Chaines, and Nobles in fetters of Iron; such honour have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal 149.</note> 
               <hi>all his Saints.</hi> You must look on it (beloved with a spirituall eye. And if there be any reallitie in that that they call honour, this is not a notion, but there is more reallitie in <hi>spirituall honour</hi> than in <hi>Carnall.</hi> Take <note place="margin">Spirituall honour reall.</note> carnall men that call you <hi>honourable,</hi> and <hi>worshipfull,</hi> and the like, you know all these are but words, and a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66290:12"/>
puffe of winde, when they are present: but they are <hi>hatefull,</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> one another when they are gone, as the Apostle saith. But if a man receive Christ in the Ministery of the Gospel, there is true <hi>honour;</hi> that is, such a man will be respected in the hearts of others; not only in the <hi>eyes</hi> of God, and godly men, but in the <hi>hearts</hi> of the <hi>wicked:</hi> for in their hearts they will say, such a man is an honourable man, such a woman is an honourable woman, they will not do any thing against their consciences, and disobey Christ, they had rather die. Beloved there is more realitie in this honour; you shall be Princes, and Kings, and Queenes.</p>
            <p>And then you shall have <hi>innumerable companies of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Angels waite on the Saints</note> 
               <hi>Angels,</hi> you shall be in as glorious a condition as they, and somewhat better, you shall have them to waite on you. You consider not this, because you settle not your selves to search spirituall priviledges: you shall have an innumerable company of <hi>Angels</hi> to waite on you; that is better than to be <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Earles,</hi> that have an innumerable company of <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,</hi> and <hi>whoremongers</hi> for their serving men, that it were agreat deale more ease if they could spare them, to be without them: but you shall have a company of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> to waite on you.</p>
            <p>And though the Gospel tell you not of <hi>outward</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Saints right to outward things.</note> 
               <hi>riches,</hi> for Christ himselfe, saith, <hi>The soxes have holes, and the foules of the aire have nests: but the Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his head.</hi> Yet the Gospel tells you that you have so much title to worldly things, that <hi>Godlinesse hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi> And that <hi>God will be a Sun, and a shield to those that feare him,</hi> and <hi>he will withhold from them nothing that is good.</hi> Is not that tidings enough of riches and wealth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66290:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when God will withhold nothing that is good? God will give food, and raiment, they have it by promise; wicked men have it by providence, as the <hi>doggs,</hi> and <hi>fowles,</hi> have it. Therefore, for all that objection this truth runs cleare.</p>
            <p>But secondly, another will say, the Gospel indeed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel brings persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> brings tidings of Christ, and <hi>salvation,</hi> but it brings ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings also of <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>persecutions:</hi> the Gospel saith, <hi>Whosoever will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</hi> And Christ saith, <hi>I come not to bring peace, but a sword; I come to set the father against the sonne, and the son against the father &amp; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against her mother.</hi> And saith the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heart I like not this newes, I love to be at peace with God, and all the world (as their phrase is.)</p>
            <p>Concerning that, though it be true that the <hi>Gospel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. they are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> brings <hi>afflictions,</hi> yet it is true the Gospel tells you that these sufferings of yours. In the first place they are <hi>priviledges,</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> tells you it is a peice of your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to have them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or life, or death. Death,</hi> what is <hi>death?</hi> Afflictions are called <hi>death, In death oft,</hi> that is, <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> they are but little <hi>deathes,</hi> and one great death ends all; the greatest death is a priviledge, your <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>povertie,</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> will be a <hi>priviledge.</hi> How is that? You have it in <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. <hi>They all work for good to them that love God.</hi> For your good here, and your glory hereafter; for saith the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>These light afflictions that are but for a moment, they work for us, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, exceeding weight of glory.</hi> The English word cannot expresse it; compare it with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that wee suffer, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed. The Spirit of glory riseth</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66290:13"/>
               <hi>on you.</hi> The Lord doth you good by it for the present, and it <hi>works</hi> for a <hi>Crowne of glory hereafter;</hi> For this is a true saying, <hi>if we suffer with Christ, we shall reigne with him.</hi> Therefore though the Gospel bring sufferings with it, yet take them as the <hi>Gospel</hi> expresseth them, they are <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>good tidings;</hi> they are priviledges to you, and will turne for your good here, and your glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gospel</hi> moreover tells you for your suller satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <note place="margin">2. They are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> that the Lord will <hi>lay no more upon you than you are able to beare.</hi> And he will be in the <hi>afflection</hi> with you, in the <hi>fire,</hi> and in the <hi>water;</hi> the Lord Jesus will be with you there, and in due time he will make you a way to get out. Beloved, put all together that the Gospel speakes of <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> construe them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; you shall see that there is nothing in all that, but <hi>glad tidings,</hi> and <hi>good newes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I but saith another, the <hi>Gospel,</hi> (if it be <hi>Gospel</hi> that we use to heare from our Ministers) it is not good <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res men to forsake sin.</note> newes, for our Ministers preach against <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Whoremongers;</hi> and when I <hi>sweare</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister saith I shall never goe to <hi>Heaven;</hi> And he saith the <hi>Gospel</hi> will have a man <hi>forsake</hi> his <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> and the like, this is not good newes: it is good newes that God will save me, but it is not good newes that I must <hi>leave</hi> my <hi>sins,</hi> and all my wayes of pleasure that I am in. It is <hi>good newes</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> will have me <hi>saved</hi> but it is not <hi>good newes</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> will have me a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and be <hi>purisied,</hi> and purged from my sins.</p>
            <p>Concerning that, it is very true that though the <hi>Gospel</hi> speak not properly against <hi>drunkards,</hi> and <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and <hi>Swearers;</hi> yet the <hi>Gospel</hi> saith that <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards</hi> must leave their <hi>drunkennesse,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66290:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leave their <hi>swearing;</hi> and the Gospel calls <hi>every</hi> man to <hi>repentance,</hi> from <hi>every</hi> sin, yet not withstanding that it is no bad newes.</p>
            <p>First, take Christs Argument <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Doth thy right eye offend thee? pul it out and cast it from thee; doth thy right</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Leaving of sin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note> 
               <hi>hand offend thee? cut it off, and cast it from thee.</hi> That is as some interpret it, there are some sins that are as <hi>pleasant</hi> as the <hi>right eye,</hi> &amp; as <hi>profitable</hi> as the <hi>right hand,</hi> and thou wer't better to cut them off: why so? <hi>It is better to goe to heaven with one eye, than with two eyes to go to hell;</hi> and <hi>it is better to goe to heaven with one hand, than with two to goe to hell.</hi> Is it not good tidings when a man is taught to make a good bargaine? is't not good tidings when the Gospel tells a man he must throw away his sinnes, and it is better to crosse himself a little in his lusts and goe to heaven, than to goe lusts, and soul, and body, and all to hell? Is it not good newes, when a mans <hi>house</hi> is on fire, if one come and shew him how to save a peice? It is better than to have all burned. Now the <hi>Gospel</hi> teacheth you to leave sin, and it is good newes, Why? I will tel you, because when the Gospel bids thee <hi>leave sin,</hi> it puts in thee a <hi>new nature</hi> that is contrarie to sin to hate it more than <hi>hell,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> himself, and then if God bid thee leave thy <hi>sins,</hi> it is the best newes in the world; as for instance, there <note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to hate sinne.</note> are many men, and weomen I believe here, that if the Lord should say to them, as he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> I will give thee <hi>whatsoever</hi> thou wouldest have in <hi>heaven,</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi> there are some in this place that would say, O Lord I would <hi>leave</hi> my <hi>pride,</hi> I would have a humble <hi>heart,</hi> and a <hi>heart</hi> that should not <hi>love</hi> worldly things, and a <hi>heart</hi> that should not be <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>waspish.</hi> If the Gospel should leave the heart as the Law did, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66290:14"/>
bid you throw away your sinnes, and give no strength to doe it, it were bad newes: but if the <hi>Gospel</hi> give you a <hi>new nature,</hi> to <hi>hate</hi> sin, and when it bids you leave, it gives you power to take it away; it is <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> newes.</p>
            <p>Another objection that others may make is, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth dutie.</note> the <hi>Gospel</hi> brings <hi>tidings,</hi> that when we receive Christ, as wee must <hi>leave sin,</hi> so we must set on the doing of good, I must not be my owne Master, as the Minister saith, one while I must <hi>fast,</hi> and another while I must <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> my <hi>Children,</hi> and my <hi>Familie,</hi> and this is a <hi>hard</hi> task, an endlesse work, I cannot beare it, to <hi>pray</hi> every morning, and evening &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I answer, this is good newes. Why? because in the first place, when the Gospel tells you any such thing <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not on paine of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note> the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth not bid you <hi>doe</hi> them, or else you shall be <hi>damned,</hi> as the <hi>Law</hi> did: but the <hi>Gospel</hi> sairh thus, thou poore <hi>drunkard,</hi> or thou <hi>proud woman,</hi> here is a <hi>gracious</hi> God that hath <hi>loved</hi> thee, and out of love hath sent Jesus Christ to <hi>die</hi> for thee, and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Ministers to make it known to thee: and here is <hi>everlasting redemption,</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> by him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because thou art a <hi>sinner,</hi> there is no other reason in the world; now thou art safe, <hi>free</hi> from <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> feare not that, that is gone, <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>died</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile</hi> thee to God, and Christ hath <hi>loved</hi> thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obey him, if not thou shalt not be <hi>damned,</hi> that is done away alreadie; Indeed the <hi>Law</hi> saith, thou shalt be <hi>damned</hi> for not doing it: but saith Christ, in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> I have <hi>died,</hi> and have <hi>forgiven</hi> thee thy <hi>sins,</hi> and if thou wilt be a <hi>Villane,</hi> &amp; not respect my <hi>Father</hi> that hath <hi>loved</hi> thee, and I that have died for thee, so it is: but if thou wilt obey me, thou shalt be a good childe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66290:14"/>
Thus the <hi>Gospel</hi> speaks; now there is no bad newes, for me to heare of my dutie, to heare that the Lord Jesus, Christ commands me, when I see my <hi>salvation</hi> sure, I worke not for <hi>life,</hi> as those under the <hi>Law,</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>voyce of words,</hi> it bids me doe this, or that, or I shal be <hi>damned;</hi> and if I went a little awrie, I should lose all my labour; no, I see my <hi>salvation</hi> is <hi>safe, hell,</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> are shut out of doores, God is my <hi>Father,</hi> and I am his childe, <hi>I</hi> am in an <hi>everlasting Covenant,</hi> there is nothing in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> shall be able to <hi>separate me from the love of God.</hi> Now <hi>I</hi> am <hi>redeemed from my enemies, and without feare,</hi> as the Scripture saith, why should <hi>I</hi> not serve him, and studie to doe what he commands me?</p>
            <p>Besides, admit the <hi>Gospel</hi> bids thee doe many things, the <hi>Gospel</hi> also gives thee <hi>power</hi> to doe them. It is not a <hi>voice of words</hi> as that on <hi>Mount Siuai, Heb.</hi> 12. that is, <note place="margin">2. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel gives power to do what it requireth.</note> 
               <hi>words,</hi> that had a <hi>voice,</hi> but no <hi>power;</hi> thou shalt doe <hi>this,</hi> and not that, but it gave no <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>the people were not able to heare the word.</hi> for they were bid, not to commit <hi>adultery,</hi> not to <hi>sweare,</hi> not to <hi>steale,</hi> and there was no <hi>strength,</hi> but a <hi>voyce:</hi> But the <hi>voyce</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>power,</hi> it is called <hi>The day of Gods power, the power of God to salvation;</hi> The <hi>Arme</hi> of God, the <hi>strength</hi> of God. Therefore whatsoever the <hi>Gospel</hi> commands, it gives a sweet <hi>power</hi> to the heart to doe the same, and then it is no bad newes. If a man bid me <hi>pay a thousand</hi> pounds for my neighbour, and give me a <hi>thousand</hi> pounds in my hand, it is <hi>easie</hi> to doe it. The <hi>Gospel</hi> bids me <hi>deny</hi> my selfe, and subdue my lusts, if it did give no <hi>power</hi> it were a terrible thing: but if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the <hi>Gospel</hi> carry the Spirit of Christ into the heart and kill <hi>sin,</hi> and make me able to <hi>deny</hi> my selfe, then it is good newes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:66290:15"/>
Besides, the <hi>duties</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> bids me doe, they are <hi>few</hi> for number, and <hi>easie</hi> for nature; and for the <note place="margin">3. Gospel duties few and easie.</note> 
               <hi>end</hi> of them, it is not for <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> that is safe, there is no danger of that; and there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> to them And also there is a <hi>sweetnesse</hi> in <hi>Gospel obedience,</hi> that there is nothing on this side <hi>glory,</hi> so Pleasing to the soule that hath believed, as <hi>obeying</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Ro. 6. <hi>You have your reward in holines.</hi> Godly men say that this is the meaning of it, that <hi>holiness</hi> is a <hi>reward</hi> to it selfe; the doing of good things is a <hi>reward</hi> to it <hi>selfe.</hi> To say nothing of the <hi>reward</hi> hereafter, that there is a <hi>Crowne</hi> of glory, <hi>your labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Againe, it may be, some man will say, the <hi>Gospel</hi> for <note place="margin">

The same word that makes known salvation, the same word <hi>breeds,</hi> and begets <hi>faith</hi> in the heart to receive it. That God that gives his <hi>almes</hi> to us, gives a <hi>purse</hi> to carry it: that God that gives Physick to a poore soule, will give a <hi>hand</hi> to receive it.

But it seemes that there is in the Gospel, or annexed to it a <hi>discipline,</hi> or a <hi>government</hi> whereby wee shall be ruled; thus saith one, thus saith another; and if we receive the Gospel of Christ, we must receive the <hi>Government</hi> of Christ say the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and wee feare that will be no good newes to our poore soules.</p>
            <p>As for that, in few words as I am able, I confesse <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Two wrong go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments since Christ.</note> (Beloved) that in, or with the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ, there is a <hi>Government,</hi> or there is a <hi>discipline,</hi> that may (in a sense) be called an <hi>externall</hi> discipline over the Saints or people of God. And it is true that all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have hetherto been in the world, since our Lord Christ went to heaven, men have called them the <hi>Governments</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and fatherod them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, and the <hi>Gospel:</hi> and truely if they had been so indeed as men pretended, that is, if those kind of <hi>governments</hi> that wee have had, had been part of the Gospel, surely than there had been a great deale of <hi>bad</hi> newes, and <hi>heavie</hi> tidings in the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Jesus Christ. As for instance; There have been but <hi>two</hi> great <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> or disciplines (if I may use that word) in the world since our Lord went to heaven,</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66290:16"/>
The one was <hi>Papacie.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The other <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Wee have been governed either by the <hi>Pope</hi> that <note place="margin">Papacie. Episcopacy.</note> stiled himself, the <hi>Successor</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Romish</hi> Governour, or by <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in latter yeares, in many parts; though <hi>Papistrie</hi> made the greater stirr in the world. Now these two differ in <hi>degrees,</hi> otherwise they are of the same kinde. And if these were the <hi>government</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>discipline</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> we may well say, there hath been <hi>sad tidings,</hi> and <hi>heavie</hi> newes from the <hi>Gospel</hi> for many yeares. Give <note place="margin">Evils in both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</note> me leave to instance in a few substantiall things in these two <hi>Governments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was one thing that was in both these <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> The <hi>Ministers,</hi> (such as they were, by what <note place="margin">1. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their power.</note> titles soever they were stiled; for they had many sorts) they took all the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>governing,</hi> and <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> wholly, and solely into their owne hands; they called themselves the <hi>Church</hi> of God; we must looke to the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to their lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They called themselves the <hi>Clergie,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods inheritance,</hi> as the word in the Originall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. True it is, there is a <hi>power,</hi> a sweet <hi>Gospel power</hi> in the <hi>Ministers,</hi> that is somewhat peculiar from the <hi>people:</hi> But to take all power into their owne hands; and to leave the people, and call them the <hi>laity,</hi> the <hi>drosse,</hi> the <hi>valgar,</hi> to leave them as <hi>vassalls,</hi> and <hi>slaves,</hi> and to call themselves, the <hi>Clergie,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and the like: If this had been Christs discipline, there had been some <hi>hard,</hi> and <hi>heavie tidings</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they <hi>took</hi> this <hi>power</hi> into their hands, so they <hi>used</hi> this <hi>power</hi> as <hi>Lords over Gods inheritance,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66290:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrary to the command of Jesus Christ 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">2. Their Lorldlines in two things.</note> 4. <hi>You shall not Lord it over Gods inheritance.</hi> Now you know they were <hi>Lords,</hi> that will appeare in two things.</p>
            <p>First, they made <hi>Lawes</hi> upon the <hi>consciences</hi> of men, <note place="margin">1. In im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing lawes on mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</note> besides the <hi>Lawes</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> made; you know they had their <hi>Synods,</hi> and their <hi>Convocations,</hi> and their great <hi>Councels,</hi> and the like, and there they would have <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Lawes</hi> every time they met for the <hi>consciences</hi> of poore Saints; This was no good newes.</p>
            <p>And then forcing men to <hi>aver</hi> those <hi>lawes</hi> that <note place="margin">2. In sorc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to obey those lawes.</note> they had made; as they had made a law that people should not goe <hi>out</hi> of their <hi>Parishes;</hi> they must every one heare his <hi>owne</hi> Minister, though it may be he was an <hi>Ignorant, drunken, dumb, prophane wretch,</hi> and if they did not, they were <hi>forced,</hi> and compelled to doe it, Beloved, this was not according to the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Jesus Christ: for if it had, surely it had been no good newes</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the second Government that we have <note place="margin">3. Forcing Ministers &amp; Officers on the people.</note> had hetherto, they <hi>imposed Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> upon the people, the people never had yet liberty under these two <hi>Governments,</hi> to choose men <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods own heart,</hi> that would <hi>feed</hi> them with <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>understanding:</hi> but such as the <hi>Bishops</hi> sent they must receive, whether they were good or bad, they must tako them as they found them; and those usually were either <hi>Ignorant</hi> unlearned meu; or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> unsanctified men, and these were sent by them as Lords, and the people were forced to receive them.</p>
            <p>Then fourthly, in this government, all the power
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66290:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they had (which they took all to themselves) <note place="margin">4. Their power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Saints.</note> they exercised it onely, (almost) against the <hi>Saints</hi> and people of God, either as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> or <hi>Lollards,</hi> or <hi>Heretiques,</hi> or <hi>Puritans,</hi> or the like; either for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that was <hi>good,</hi> or for things that were <hi>trifles,</hi> according to their owne judgment. For doing that which was good, for <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> for <hi>meeting</hi> to teach one another, and to seek the Lord, these were called <hi>Conventicles.</hi> Or for trifles that they in their consciences held <hi>indifferent,</hi> as the wearing of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> and the <hi>Crosse</hi> in baptisme; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves said they were indifferent things, and trifles, and yet men must be silenced, and people <hi>bannished</hi> beyond Sea for these things. This government wee have had, and there was little good newes and glad tidings to the soules of the poore Saints from all this.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they did <hi>restraine</hi> the Spirit of God in the <note place="margin">5. Restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit in preaching, &amp; praying</note> Saints both in <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>praying.</hi> In <hi>preaching,</hi> the Ministers were tied, they must preach <hi>such,</hi> and not <hi>such</hi> things, and they must be in danger to be <hi>fined,</hi> if they did not keep to the <hi>houre.</hi> And for Prayer, when it may be the poore Ministers soule was full of <hi>groanes,</hi> and <hi>sighs,</hi> and he would have rejoyced to have <hi>poured out his soule</hi> to the Lord, he was tied to an old <hi>Service-Booke,</hi> and must read that till he <hi>grieved the Spirit of God,</hi> and dried up his owne spirit as a <hi>chip,</hi> that he could not pray if he would; and he must read it for an houre together, and then it may be come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pulpit: but his spirit was gone.</p>
            <p>Againe, they backed all their lawes with the <hi>secular</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6. Their lawes backed by secular power.</note> 
               <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>punnishments;</hi> they never rested till they had twisted their owne lawes, with the <hi>secular</hi> lawes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66290:18"/>
the <hi>Civill</hi> lawes of the Land. Every law of theirs was steeled, and backed with some <hi>Civill</hi> severe law, to <hi>confiscation</hi> of goods, or <hi>imprisonment,</hi> or such a <hi>fine,</hi> to the <hi>cuting</hi> off of <hi>eares,</hi> the <hi>slitting</hi> of <hi>noses,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>cheekes,</hi> to <hi>banishment,</hi> yea to <hi>death</hi> it selfe; as you know how many precious Saints of God (even by those that pretended the government of Christ, and his discipline) were <hi>burned</hi> in <hi>Smithfeild;</hi> and how many suffered strange <hi>torments,</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> yet their persecutors pretended the <hi>discipline,</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> I give you but a few instances; These were the <hi>governments</hi> we have had hetherto, for thirteen, or fourteen hundred yeares, either from the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>Bishops, Papacie,</hi> or <hi>Episcopacie.</hi> And truly Beloved, there is not a title of <hi>good newes,</hi> or <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the hearts of holy Saints, and tender consciences in all this, as your selves may judge.</p>
            <p>Now what we shall have the Lord knows I know not, but only thus much I say, that what ever it will be, if it be according to these straines that have been heretofore, than I confess there will be a great deale of <hi>heavie tidings,</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> newes, even in the Gospel of Jesus Christ; if men call it Gospel, or any thing belonging to it. For my part, as I am wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what <hi>Government</hi> men will set up and call it Christs, right, or wrong; So I am not ignorant of the feares, and jealousies that are in the hearts of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people of this, and that thing: but be sure, if it be the <hi>government</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>discipline,</hi> there will be nothing but <hi>good newes,</hi> and <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the <hi>honestest</hi> heart, and <hi>tenderest</hi> conscience; and if it be not such a government, it is not of <hi>God;</hi> for I have proved plainly, that there is nothing in the Gospel
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66290:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Jesus Christ, but <hi>good newes,</hi> and <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the <hi>worst</hi> of sinners. But if it be a government that I shall be compelled against <hi>conscience,</hi> and my goods <hi>confiscated</hi> for this, or that trisle, this is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gospel; for there are none of these terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in the Gospel of Christ, it is all sweet.</p>
            <p>I will give you but one instance, and passe it over; <note place="margin">The two worst things in the Gospel good newes.</note> In the <hi>government</hi> of Christ according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>two</hi> worst, and <hi>harshest</hi> things that you shall finde there, you shall see clearely that they are good things, and good newes for a poore Christian to have them set up over his soule.</p>
            <p>As first of all, you know that in the Gospel, the <note place="margin">1. Reproofe</note> 
               <hi>government</hi> or <hi>discipline,</hi> call it which way you will. We finde in some cases that the Lord Jesus, will have us not only <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>exhort,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> one another: but in some cases he will have us <hi>reprove</hi> one another, and have our Ministers <hi>reprove</hi> us also, but in <hi>love,</hi> and <note place="margin">Benefit of Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> 
               <hi>tendernes.</hi> This is one of the harshest things; and this if you look right on it with a <hi>spirituall</hi> eye, truly it is <hi>glad tidings</hi> for a poore Saint, when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himself, by the violence of some <hi>lust;</hi> Then for a sincere hearted Brother, or Sister in the spirit of <hi>meeknes,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>reprove</hi> him, and set his <hi>bones</hi> in joynt. You have some of you found in experience that a <hi>sweet,</hi> and wise reproofe hath been as <hi>pleasing</hi> to you as any <hi>Sermon</hi> of consolation that ever you heard. And therefore you see in Scripture how the Lord sets downe <hi>reproofe,</hi> that you may not be affraid of it <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. he tells you that <hi>reproofe</hi> is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love, <hi>Thou shalt not hatethy brother in thine heart, but rather reprove him.</hi> It is an argument of love. A man that <hi>reproves</hi> another <hi>wisely,</hi> and <hi>meekly</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66290:19"/>
he loves him: for otherwise his poore soule is going in the way towards hell, from God, and fellow ship with God, going on in sin. Now a man that <hi>reproves</hi> him he brings him <hi>backe</hi> againe from <hi>sin,</hi> and that <hi>strangnes</hi> from God that he was in a course to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; therefore I say, there is no such evil in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Scripture saith it is a <hi>precious</hi> thing <hi>Ps.</hi> 141. 5. <hi>David</hi> saith <hi>Let the righteous smite me, and it shall be as balme,</hi> it shall be a kindness; <hi>let him reprove me, and it shall be an excellent oile, it shall not breake my head.</hi> It shall be as excellent <hi>oile,</hi> or <hi>balme</hi> to heale his soule. <hi>Reproofe</hi> is called a <hi>profitable</hi> thing also, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>The Scripture is profitable for instruction, and reproofe,</hi> &amp;c. If reproofe were an evil thing, one could not say that the Scripture were profitable for such an end.</p>
            <p>It is a great <hi>judgment</hi> of God, when God casts a man into such a condition that no body will <hi>reprove</hi> him. It is a thing that I am many times affraid of, truly almost to trembling, least a man should so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himselfe to the Saints, and so estrange himselfe that they will not <hi>reprove</hi> him; O, it is fearefull when a man stands on his owne bottome, and on his owne leggs, that men shall say, there is a Professor, he is so <hi>proud,</hi> and so <hi>foolish</hi> that none will <hi>reprove</hi> him. Saith God to <hi>Ezkiel, Thou shalt not be a reprover to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and in <hi>Hosea</hi> 3. <hi>Let no man strive, or reprove an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> Why so? saith the Lotd in the end of the Chapter, <hi>Let him be as a backsliding beifer, Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> It is a pitifull thing when God shall leave a man as a <hi>heifer,</hi> that is turned into the <hi>meddow</hi> to grasse, <hi>let him alone.</hi> They used to plow
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66290:19"/>
with <hi>heifers</hi> in those dayes as we doe with <hi>horses</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and the horses, and Oxen are called from the <hi>house</hi> to the <hi>Plow,</hi> and are driven and beaten: but when the Oxe is turned to <hi>grasse</hi> to be <hi>fatted, let him alone,</hi> he lies downe, and riseth when he will; so these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were so wicked, that no man should <hi>reprove</hi> his brother, but he should be as a <hi>lambe</hi> in a fat <hi>Pasture.</hi> So that <hi>reproofe,</hi> that is one of the harshest things in the government of Christ in the Gospel, it is a <hi>good,</hi> a <hi>precious,</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> thing. It is a great <hi>judgment</hi> to be without it: therefore though that be used, the doctrine holds true, that there is nothing but good newes, glad tidings in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>There is another thing, that is, <hi>Excommunication,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> 
               <hi>cutting a man off from the people of God,</hi> or <hi>delivering him up to Satan.</hi> A man may say that is a terrible thing; It is terrible as I said before, when there is <hi>secular</hi> punishment with it, <hi>confiscation</hi> of goods, and losse of <hi>estate,</hi> and <hi>freedome:</hi> but according to the Gospel of Christ you shall see, that even the delivering men up to Satan, Christ Jesus intends it in love, for the good, and salvation of their soules; It is <hi>harsh,</hi> but it is <hi>good</hi> newes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. saith the Apostle, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ when yee are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one unto Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus;</hi> speaking of the incestuous person. If men will be so wretched as to sin <hi>grosly,</hi> the Lord Jesus hath ordered that such a man shal be delivered to Satan; for what? that he may be <hi>damned,</hi> and to bring him to hell? No, <hi>for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</hi> And truly Beloved,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66290:20"/>
I have seen, more than one that have <hi>blessed</hi> God for that Ordinance, that have been brought to <hi>humble</hi> their soules, and <hi>sweetly,</hi> and <hi>closely</hi> to walk with God againe, by the blessing of God on that Ordinance. Now I have told you the worst in the Gospel, either <hi>reproofe,</hi> and that but upon <hi>great</hi> occasion; or else <hi>delivering to Satan,</hi> and that must be upon <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> occasion; yet both are <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>profitable,</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> for the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>soule;</hi> Therefore the truth of the Doctrine holds cleare to you, that there is nothing in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> look which way you will, but <hi>good newes,</hi> and <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the worst of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>There is one objection more, and so I proceeed to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> No peace to the wicked;</note> the Uses. Some body may say out of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, There is no peace to the wicked saith my God. Isa.</hi> 57. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 12. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose watters cast out mire, and dirt.</hi> The Prophet seemes to comfort the <hi>godly,</hi> but wicked men have no <hi>peace:</hi> then a man may say; how doth this stand with your Doctrine? you say that the Gospel holds forth <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> and good newes to <hi>wicked</hi> men, even to the <hi>worst</hi> of sinners.</p>
            <p>The are three wayes to answer it, in few words. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> three Wayes. 1. It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law than Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first is, that however <hi>Isaiah</hi> was in a sort an <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Prophet, and spake many things of <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> by way of Prophesie; he saw things for <hi>us,</hi> and not for <hi>himselfe,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> saith; yet these kinde of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more properly <hi>Law,</hi> than <hi>Gospel;</hi> for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine there is no other language in the <hi>Law</hi> but that, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked;</hi> Transgresse once and be damned for ever: but the language of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66290:20"/>
contrary, it comes and gives <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>justifieth the ungodly,</hi> he <hi>preacheth peace to them that are neere, and to them that are affar off;</hi> And who were they? The <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were emphatically sinners: are we not <hi>Jewes</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>and not sinners of the Gentiles?</hi> Therefore this was rather <hi>Law,</hi> than <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> or to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>saith my God.</hi> You may understand it also in this <note place="margin">2. God will not make peace with sin, though hee doth with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> sense, that the Lord will not make any <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>sin,</hi> though he send messages of <hi>peace,</hi> and reconciliation to <hi>sinners;</hi> though God be reconciled to a sinner, hee will never be reconciled to <hi>sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the third, and last, and most proper as I take it <note place="margin">3. No peace to men that continue in sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel.</note> is this, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, saith my God;</hi> that is, there is no <hi>peace</hi> to men that <hi>continue</hi> in <hi>sin</hi> after Jesus Christ hath been <hi>offered</hi> them, and they have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> him, then there is no <hi>peace</hi> to them. Observe for it is a thing of great concernment: it becomes not a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> by any meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>curse,</hi> or <hi>damnation</hi> to a <hi>sinner, qua</hi> a <hi>sinner,</hi> as a sinner, he is not a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> if he doe, he is a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>old Testament,</hi> that saith, here comes a <hi>drunkard, eo nomnie,</hi> because he is a <hi>drunkard</hi> God will <hi>plague</hi> him, and <hi>damne</hi> him; this is the language of the <hi>old Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say; will you speak <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>drunkards,</hi> and <hi>sinners?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wee speak <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>curses,</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer</hi> How judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against sinners.</note> them, when once wee have first offered <hi>Christ,</hi> and they refuse him. And for this reason, and no other according to the Ministery of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>curse,</hi> to <hi>wicked</hi> men, because
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66290:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they <hi>refuse</hi> Jesus Christ: because they doe not <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

            <p>You will say, is it absolutely <hi>evil</hi> for a Minister to <note place="margin">Quest.</note> speak against <hi>drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> and to say the curse of God will fall on them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No; Why? because I speak against a <hi>drunkard,</hi> not properly because he is a drunkard, but his <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keness</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in sin a signe of unbeliefe.</note> is a signe that he continues in <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> and so hath not received Jesus Christ: So we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scriptures. There is a <hi>drunkard,</hi> a <hi>Sot,</hi> a <hi>jearer</hi> of godliness, I say the <hi>curse</hi> of God will come upon him, and the <hi>damnation</hi> of hell is ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him; why? not because he is properly <hi>such</hi> a one, but because those are signes that he is an <hi>unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> When God shall come to judge the world; There are people that he will judge <hi>eo nomine</hi> because they are <hi>drunkards</hi> he will throw them to hel, as those in the Mountaines of <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp;c.

But under the <hi>Gospel</hi> all are wrapped up in <hi>unbeliefe:</hi> So that this is the pin of Heaven, or Hell, the very wards that opens, or shuts, that you be believers, or unbelievers. But I will not stand longer on that.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed to shew what profit we may have by this Doctrine, by way of Application.</p>
            <p>There be divers speciall Lessons that I would have <note place="margin">
                  <hi>use</hi> 1. To learne that in the Gospel salvation s offered o sinner, s sinners.</note> you learne hence.</p>
            <p>The first is this, that this truth that I have now taught you, it is the <hi>doore</hi> of the Gospel, the very <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> into <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; the first <hi>stone</hi> as it were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66290:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Christian <hi>building</hi> in the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in <hi>Gospel</hi> Profession. There is a kinde of devotion and Profession, but it is not built according to the Gospel: but if you would walk according to the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> learne this lesson first, that is, that God gives <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> through Christ to <hi>sinners,</hi> as <hi>sinners</hi> though they be <hi>hard hearted, backsliding,</hi> and the <hi>chiefe of sinners,</hi> yet as long as they be <hi>sinners,</hi> and but <hi>sinners</hi> they may alway looke upon Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> in his hand to be bestowed on them. This is a truth that thou must learne, and be taught it of God, or else thou canst not goe one step into the Profession of the Gospel; for (beloved) till you know and learne this, you will be like men in the <hi>dark,</hi> you will be <hi>groping</hi> for Christ Jesus, but you will never be <hi>graffed</hi> into him, you will never be <hi>knit</hi> to Christ. I say this is the first step to Religion to understand this truth aright, that the Gospel brings <hi>glad tidings</hi> of salvation to be given to the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>sinners:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for though I see no good in me at all whereby I might receive <hi>good newes</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> and though I doe not see that I am a <hi>humbled</hi> sinner as such a Preacher teacheth, or a <hi>believing</hi> sinner, or a <hi>broken hearted</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as another Preacher saith, yet I say I am a <hi>sinner,</hi> and a <hi>sinner quasi,</hi> a sinner is the proper <hi>object</hi> of the <note place="margin">Unsetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whence.</note> 
               <hi>Gospel.</hi> You will be off, and on, and never be knit to Christ, but will be as a <hi>bone</hi> in and out till you come to that; for if you goe and lay hold on Christ any other way, in any other consideration, that you are <hi>humbled</hi> sinners, or <hi>broken</hi> hearted sinners, or <hi>mortified</hi> sinners, as soone as ever temptation tells you that you are not humbled <hi>enough,</hi> you will be gone againe, the <hi>bone</hi> will be <hi>out</hi> of joynt againe, and so you will be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66290:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as a <hi>reed tossed of the winde,</hi> you will never be fastened to Christ; whosoever holds Christ upon any <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> on his side, must let him goe one time, or other. As for instance, if he thinke the Gospel be directed to <hi>broken heartednes,</hi> and he can <hi>weep</hi> at a <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to morrow his heart may be hard, and then bee thinks, he is a <hi>devill</hi> that was but now a Saint. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Christians after many yeares Profession of Religion never felt their souls knit, till God right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and truly taught them this lesson: but then they were <hi>knit</hi> to Christ, and their soules were never <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out,</hi> they were never <hi>loose</hi> more; because they were able in all temptacions to retreat to this truth as a refuge. For let the devil tell a man he is no Saint, the soule can say, I am a <hi>sinner;</hi> if the devill say, thou art an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> I, but an <hi>hypocrite</hi> is but a <hi>sinner,</hi> I am a <hi>sinner</hi> still, though I be not a <hi>broken</hi> hearted sinner; so let the <hi>devill,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> say what they will, they shall never beat him from that refuge; And saith the soul being a <hi>sinner</hi> I am the proper <hi>object</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and though I have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as a Saint that I am in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet at least I have <hi>comfort</hi> that I am a <hi>sinner,</hi> and I may be there: though I have no comfort that I am <hi>in,</hi> yet I have comfort that I am neare, and the <hi>doore</hi> is <hi>open;</hi> though I be not a <hi>Siant</hi> I am a <hi>sinner,</hi> and if I have no reall <hi>interest</hi> in Christ as a <hi>Saint,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> have interest in the <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>sinner;</hi> and though <hi>I</hi> can not serve God <hi>chearfully</hi> as a <hi>Saint,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> will serve God as <hi>comfortably</hi> as <hi>I</hi> can, as one that may be a <hi>Saint.</hi> In <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. It is said of the Merchant man, he found the <hi>feild</hi> wherein was the <hi>treasure, he rejoiced. I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a worthy man of this countrie, he faith, hee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66290:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rejoyced not that he had found the <hi>pearle</hi> the <hi>treasure:</hi> but he rejoyced that he was come neare a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he was come to the <hi>feild</hi> where it was; so though I be not assured that I am a <hi>Saint,</hi> yet a sinner may rightly receive this truth with joy as a sinner, because he is <hi>neare</hi> a good <hi>bargaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the reason that you have many Professors <note place="margin">Many doe little for God, why.</note> that mislearne the first <hi>principles</hi> of religion of which this is the greatest, they will never doe any thing for God but when they are <hi>assured</hi> of their <hi>salvation,</hi> if there be the least doubt that the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> is not <hi>right,</hi> they <hi>mope,</hi> and will doe <hi>nothing</hi> for God, but <hi>vex,</hi> and <hi>fret,</hi> and <hi>tug,</hi> and when their <hi>qualifications</hi> are gone that they builded on, then they think they are <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>damned</hi> creatures, and God shall have no service from them; when other people that it may be have not fully <hi>assurance</hi> they are Saints, not one day of three in the whole yeare, yet there is a current, and streame of <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in God in some measure, and they goe on <hi>constantly,</hi> though not so strongly, <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> his holy will; Why? because they have learned the Gospel aright, they obey God in the notion of <hi>sinners;</hi> saith the soule, I see a great deale of <hi>love</hi> in God to poore sinners, and the Gospel containes nothing but <hi>glad tidings</hi> to sinners, and though I have nothing in me that may make me the childe of Christ, yet the way is <hi>open,</hi> therefore I will goe <hi>on</hi> with the work, let him doe what he will. Thus the soule is <hi>knit</hi> to Christ that come what will, it will never be beaten off from Christ I never knew my owne soule knit to Christ till God had taught me this, but it was off, and on, as a bone in and out, a Saint to day, and an Hypocrite to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66290:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to call God <hi>Father</hi> to day, and <hi>Enemy</hi> tomorrow. The Gospel is directed to a sinner, <hi>quasi</hi> a <hi>sinner,</hi> not as <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> sinner, but as a sinnner; there is the object of salvation. This makes a Saint I say go with <hi>constancie,</hi> if I cannot goe to Christ as a Saint, yet I can as a sinner; so he hath something that k epes him that he is not as many Professors, that are ready to <hi>kill,</hi> and <hi>hang,</hi> and <hi>drowne</hi> themselves, because they see the <hi>Gospel</hi> is made to Saints, and they see they are not Saints, then they are in a worse condition than <hi>sinners.</hi> Learne this you that are Professors of Religion, that are in and out, that have spent ten, or twentie, or thirtie yeares, and your soules are not <hi>knit</hi> to Christ, begg of the Lord to teach you this lesson.</p>
            <p>The next Lesson that I would teach you from the Lord is, that this being so, that in the <hi>administration</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66290:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that sometimes he shall call God <hi>father,</hi> and another while he will look <hi>strangely</hi> upon God, and be <hi>afraid</hi> to come to God, and be <hi>loath</hi> to goe upon his knees before him, and be glad when he is got <hi>out</hi> of his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi> there is a spirit of <hi>bondage</hi> mingled with the spirit of <hi>adoption.</hi> Now in the <hi>New Testament</hi> wee should labour for a <hi>full</hi> spirit of <hi>adoption.</hi> What is <note place="margin">Full spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what.</note> that? that is, that there may be nothing in my heart towards God, but pure <hi>love,</hi> because in his dealing to me there is not a sillable but <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>glad tidings</hi> to me, and my heart and life should be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For the reason of all the horrour that you finde <note place="margin">Feares, &amp; horrours, whence.</note> in your hearts, and all your feares and troubles that arise there, they are from this error in your mindes, this opinion that is not quite rooted out, that there is in the Gospel administration some <hi>ill,</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, there is some <hi>love,</hi> and some <hi>hatred;</hi> some <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and some <hi>wrath;</hi> you think that it may be God is your <hi>father,</hi> and it may be he is your <hi>enemie,</hi> and that because you have sinned he will damne you to hell. This is naturall, and ordinary. Now if you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there were <hi>nothing</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> since our Lord Jesus is gone to heaven, and is at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> there is <hi>nothing</hi> in his <hi>dispensation</hi> but <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>no</hi> wrath; <hi>hell,</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi> &amp;c. are all thrown away, and if I be perfectly <hi>righteous,</hi> and perfectly <hi>justified</hi> from all my <hi>sins;</hi> if I have the <hi>spirit</hi> of Christ given me, and am <hi>one</hi> with God for ever, by an everlasting <hi>Covenant,</hi> and shall have <hi>life,</hi> and a <hi>Crowne</hi> of glory for <hi>ever,</hi> and my <hi>sins</hi> shall not be laid to my charge; O, what a <hi>cleare,</hi> and <hi>sweet</hi> spirit should I have in Gods service! and not a <hi>muddie,</hi> and <hi>dogged,</hi> and froward <hi>spirit</hi> that ariseth from <hi>guilt</hi> soaking into the soule. When I view this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66290:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
truth over, and pull it by peice-meale, and see that there is no <hi>gall,</hi> nothing in the <hi>Gospel, first,</hi> or <hi>last,</hi> but what is <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>beautifull,</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> newes to <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> then there should follow this consideration, why should there be any thing in my heart, and spirit towards God, but <hi>amiable</hi> thoughts, and <hi>love,</hi> &amp;c? why should there be any of those coares of <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> and <hi>distruct,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>horrour?</hi> Those mixtures of <hi>adoption,</hi> and <hi>bondage?</hi> Why should there be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>feares,</hi> or <hi>guilt</hi> in me, since there is no <hi>wrath,</hi> not <hi>anger</hi> at all in God? Why should not the carriage of my heart be <hi>clear</hi> towards him, as his is in his Sonne, by the <hi>administration</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> towards me?</p>
            <p>Labour for a <hi>perfect</hi> spirit of <hi>adoption,</hi> that you may not have any of those <hi>bublings</hi> of <hi>bondage</hi> in your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that now over take you, and are <hi>twisted,</hi> and <hi>woven</hi> with that <hi>little adoption</hi> that you have. For, who is there among us to this houre, but when he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and hath a little <hi>smiling</hi> in his soule to see his <hi>favour,</hi> and a little <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> to come at him; and yet there is some <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> when he was on the <hi>waves,</hi> and what if God will not <hi>receive</hi> me? &amp;c. Therefore studie to keep up the spirit of <hi>adoption.</hi> It is a hard thing to keep up the temper of a <hi>childe</hi> in the soule, especially, when God lets a man fall into <hi>temptations,</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c.</hi> But though it be hard labour to keep up that temper, at least thus much, that thou never come to so low a condition (which was the prayer of one that was a good man) wherein thou can'st not with a full <hi>mouth,</hi> and with a cleare <hi>heart</hi> call God <hi>father,</hi> and thee his <hi>childe,</hi> though the <hi>unhappiest,</hi> and <hi>unworthiest</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:66290:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>childe.</hi> If thou come below this, if thou call on God with <hi>feare;</hi> and canst not cry <hi>abba, abba,</hi> that is as much as <hi>daddie, daddie,</hi> as our babes use to say, if thou doe not come so high, thou art <hi>spoiled,</hi> and <hi>undone,</hi> desire God to teach you this Lesson also.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if this be so that the Ministery of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> is all <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the <hi>worst</hi> of sinners; then I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale <note place="margin">The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them that refuse the Gospel just.</note> to you all, and let every man put his hand upon his owne breast, and if this be a truth (as I hope it hath been cleared) you shall all be your own judges; how just will the <hi>damnation</hi> of that <hi>sinner</hi> be that will not <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Gospel.</hi> If there were in the Gospel <hi>ridged tidings, sad</hi> newes, (as people are apt to fancie to themselves) then it were no wonder if one <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> it, and another <hi>despised</hi> it, and another <hi>neglected</hi> it, and another turned it into <hi>wantoness:</hi> But when it comes in such a streame that there is nothing but <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and all <hi>freely</hi> laid down at the feet of a sinner for his <hi>receiving;</hi> nay, he shall have <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> to receive it, he shall have <hi>salvation,</hi> and a <hi>vessell</hi> to carry it in; judge how <hi>justly</hi> thy <hi>damnation</hi> will be in the last day, man, or woman, whosoever thou art that settest thy selfe <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and wilt not <hi>receive</hi> salvation.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why <hi>damnation</hi> comes out so rife in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> it is scars ever mentioned in <note place="margin">Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the new-Testament why.</note> the <hi>old Testament,</hi> that I know of <hi>damnation</hi> is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> nor <hi>hell,</hi> but as it is taken for the <hi>grave, &amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> comes, <hi>damnation</hi> comes at the heeles of it; <hi>How can yee escape the damnation of hell?</hi> Then comes the <hi>worme that never dieth, and the fire that never goeth out.</hi> The reason is, because then <hi>damnation</hi> is <hi>proper;</hi> Then
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66290:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when a man will not receive <hi>salvation,</hi> not because he <hi>cannot,</hi> no man is damned because he <hi>cannot</hi> receive Christ: but because he <hi>will not</hi> receive this <hi>salvation,</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> Therefore saith Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Goe preach the Gospel, he that believeth shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> That is, saith that godly D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

it. If there were any thing in all this that were <hi>harsh,</hi> and <hi>cruell,</hi> and <hi>rough,</hi> and <hi>ridged</hi> it were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: but when God hath cast the Gospel into such a <hi>mold,</hi> and <hi>way</hi> that every thing <hi>smiles,</hi> and all is <hi>roses;</hi> and yet a <hi>wretch</hi> shall go and <hi>persecute</hi> it, and <hi>slight</hi> it, and <hi>neglect,</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> it, I leave such a man, let him judge <hi>himselfe</hi> at the last day <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>damnation:</hi> for he shall have <hi>judgment without mercy,</hi> that <hi>rejecteth</hi> this <hi>mercy;</hi> When men have this <hi>mercy</hi> without <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>judgment,</hi> it is fit that those men should have <hi>pure judgment</hi> withour mixture of <hi>mercy.</hi>

            <p>In the fourth place, if the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the Ministery of it be <hi>good tidings,</hi> and <hi>glad newes</hi> to the <hi>worst</hi> of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Then Beloved you should me thinks <hi>imbrace</hi> with all affection the true, and sincere <hi>Ministers</hi> of this <hi>Gospel,</hi> these Messengers that bring you these
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66290:26"/>
               <hi>glad tidings</hi> we. are (as the Apostle saith) <hi>the offscour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, a spectacle to men, and Angels.</hi> Truly, there are no <hi>Ministers</hi> in the world that are more <hi>persecuted,</hi> and <hi>hated,</hi> and <hi>despised,</hi> than the <hi>humble, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> Ministers of the <hi>new Testament,</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Jesus Christ, nor never were; This is a sore, and a strange thing, if we did bring one word that were <hi>sad,</hi> and <hi>greivous,</hi> and <hi>harsh</hi> to you, it were no wonder, but if all that wee speake be the voyce of the <hi>dove, doves</hi> language, all <hi>sweet;</hi> come to the Gospel Ministery, if there come a poore man full of <hi>sadnesse,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel speaks a word of <hi>comfort</hi> to him, if he be in <hi>darkness,</hi> and he knowes not which way to goe, waiting on a Gospel Ministery there is <hi>light</hi> to finde his way. If he be in <hi>feare,</hi> and know not his estate what he is, a Gospel Ministery will give him <hi>assurance</hi> of Gods love; so it brings <hi>glad tidings</hi> to some souls <hi>every</hi> houre. Is not this than madnesse in men that of all creatures in the world they <hi>hate</hi> that man, and those <hi>Messengers</hi> that bring these blessed <hi>glad tidings.</hi> There is a Prophesie in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 52. 7. <hi>How beautifull upon on the mountaines are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good things, that publisheth salvation; that saith to the righteous, thy God reigneth.</hi> How <hi>beautifull</hi> are their <hi>feet?</hi> much more their <hi>lips;</hi> you doe not in this as you doe in naturall things, if a man come, and bring <hi>glad tidings</hi> of taking of such a <hi>Towne,</hi> or of such a <hi>victory,</hi> though it may be there is losse, and little good in it, we all welcome it, and he is <hi>rewarded</hi> presently, and hath all wayes of encouragment, and yet when people shall come, and by the Spirit of God make known all the <hi>love</hi> of God in Jesus Christ, and all the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66290:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>riches</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in Jesus Christ, that your hearts should so rise against it, that you should receive and entertain so many prejudices against it, it is a strange, and wonderous thing. Therefore you should doe well me thinks, as you read in the booke of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 27. of two men that did bring tidings to <hi>David</hi> of the warrs, and the watchman said <hi>Me thinks the runing of the formost is like the runing of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok; and the King said, he is a good man, and comes with good tidings.</hi> He would have the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man open the gate quickly; why, because he was a <hi>good man,</hi> and did bring <hi>good tidings.</hi> So wee should, especially if men be good, and holy, and humble, and feele the power of that they speake, and expresse it in their lives, say as <hi>David, that is a good man, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good tidings;</hi> he will <hi>teach</hi> me if I be <hi>ignorant,</hi> hee will <hi>comfort</hi> me if I be <hi>sad,</hi> he will <hi>direct</hi> me if I have <hi>lost</hi> my way; hee will build me up if I thrive not in <hi>grace.</hi> The consideration of this truth me thinks should bannish all those strange thoughts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that wee have against the Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>In the first place another lesson is this, if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel be such <hi>good newes,</hi> such <hi>glad tidings,</hi> then you <note place="margin">
                  <hi>use.</hi> 5. To hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Gospel.</note> should <hi>hearken</hi> much after it, and <hi>inquire</hi> much into it. We all (you know) are naturally greedie to heare <hi>newes,</hi> and we know how much time is spent (here in the City especially) in reading <hi>Diurnalls,</hi> inquiring after <hi>tidings,</hi> and how much money is cast away that way. Wee should doe so much more about these glorious <hi>tidings</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Jesus Christ. It is not enough to heare a Sermon, or to <hi>read</hi> a Chapter <hi>once,</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> a day, as it is the manner of some, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66290:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will not bring us to know the <hi>mysteryes</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but we must <hi>search the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>compare spirituall things, with spirituall things.</hi> As in earthly tidings, if a man tell of such a victorie one way, and another after him another way, and a third a third way, you compare what they say, and their letters, and newes, to finde out the truth. So you should be earnest in <hi>seeking</hi> God, and bego his Spirit, compare Scriptures together, see what the Scripture saith in such a place, and how in another place, and this is the way to find out the mystery of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>These tidings are great, therefore inquire into <note place="margin">Gospel ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings great and true.</note> them, and they are <hi>true</hi> tidings, they are not fables, and tidings of common concernment to every Saint; therefore let this be the use that thou and I should make of it, to desire the Lord to lead us into the <hi>depth</hi> of those mysteryes, and to set our selves to studie it more, and more; for the <hi>further</hi> we goe the <hi>more</hi> wee shall finde, as in a <hi>myne;</hi> It is not as in your newes, many times you have a great deale of good newes, &amp; in a day, or two it vanisheth to nothing: But here you shall finde, first the <hi>feild,</hi> and then the <hi>pearle.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors are grown carelesse, they were wont to <hi>read</hi> Chapters <hi>morning,</hi> and <hi>evening,</hi> that was ordinary, but thou must doe more if thou wilt understand the <hi>mysteryes</hi> of the Gospel, compare one <hi>Chapter,</hi> and one <hi>Scripture</hi> with another, search the Scriptures, and goe to God to open the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>spread</hi> these <hi>glad tidings</hi> as much as you can <note place="margin"> 
                  <hi>use</hi> 6. To spread these glad tidings to others.</note> to others. You know when people receive <hi>good newes</hi> they run and tell it to others. The poore shepheards <hi>Luke</hi> 2. when they heard the <hi>newes</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they left their sheep, and ran to the Townes to tell it.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66290:27"/>
So, when Christ was risen <hi>Mary</hi> runs to tell the <hi>newes</hi> to the Disciples. Beloved, when we understand this <hi>good newes</hi> we should endeavour to spread it. People buy <hi>Diurnalls</hi> for their friends, and fold them in their Letters, and send them about the Kingdome; let us doe so with these spirituall <hi>tidings,</hi> that we may send them forth. O, I would to God that wee did see how the poore Countries in the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in many places, in Townes, they have not so much as a <hi>Service-booke,</hi> not so much as reading; if God settle, and compose these times the Lord give you hearts to joyne together to finde out a course, to send the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to bring the <hi>glad tidings</hi> to poore people, that lie in the Mountaines of <hi>darknesse,</hi> and in the <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us not be so <hi>curious,</hi> or <hi>scrupulous,</hi> as to <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching not to be hindred.</note> people that they should not <hi>preach</hi> the Gospel. Suppose people have no degrees in the <hi>University,</hi> or it may be have not the knowledge of the <hi>tongues,</hi> (though that were to be wished) let us not pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with them to <hi>stop</hi> their <hi>mouthes,</hi> and to <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And let us not think so <hi>hardly</hi> in these dayes, of those men that God hath raised to <hi>preach</hi> the Gospel. It is strange you shall have your Pulpits ring, calling them <hi>Tub-preachers,</hi> and <hi>Tinkers,</hi> and <hi>Coblers.</hi> We should think better of them; Why? they are filled with <hi>good newes,</hi> and they goo and tell it to <hi>others.</hi> We doe so usually in other things, when we have good newes, we run to our friends, and neighbours, and <hi>comrade's,</hi> and make it known.</p>
            <p>This is an age wherein God comes and fills his <note place="margin">New light discovered in these dayes.</note> people, with the glorious light of the Gospel, and poore wretched, they cannot chuse but speak what
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66290:28"/>
they have seen, and heard; therefore be not so <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and <hi>furious. The Lord hath spoken, who can but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.}</hi> Amos 3. 8. When God fills peoples souls with the knowledge of Christ; who can keep it in? It is as the <hi>new wine</hi> spoken of in <hi>Joh,</hi> it cannot be kept in. And surely the time is comming that <hi>young men shall see visions, and old men shall dreame dreames, and God will poure out his Spirit upon all flesh, and they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie;</hi> It is prophesied in <hi>Joel,</hi> and this is to be made good in the new Testament. And therefore if wee see that the Lord <hi>fills young men,</hi> or <hi>tradesmen,</hi> &amp;c. and gives them hearts to goe, and tell the <hi>good newes</hi> to others; why should you be so extreamely troubled, and spend your spirits in rage at it?</p>
            <p>I use not to tell stories, but let me tell you this one thing; since I have been from you of late, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and seen, in the <hi>Mountaines</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> the most <hi>glorious</hi> work that ever I saw in <hi>England,</hi> unlesse it were in <hi>London;</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> is run over the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> between <hi>Brecknockshire,</hi> and <hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> as the fire in the <hi>thatch;</hi> and who should doe this? They have no Ministers: but some of the wisest say, there are about 800 <hi>godly</hi> people, and they goe from one to another. They have no Ministers, it is true, if they had, rhey would honour them, and <hi>blesse God</hi> for them; and shall we raile at such, and say they are <hi>Tuh-Preachers,</hi> and they were never at the <hi>university?</hi> Let us fall downe, and honour God; what if God will honour himself that way? They are filled with good newes, and they tell it to others; and therefore <hi>vex</hi> not at them, and say, O, what times are these! and what will <hi>become</hi> of us? Why, what is the businesse? O, such a man he was never <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> hee was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66290:28"/>
               <hi>never</hi> at the <hi>university,</hi> and he rakes upon him to preach; when it may be he hath more of God in him than I, and a hundred that have all this.</p>
            <p>Only take two Cautions. <note place="margin">Cautions</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, I speak not to disparage <hi>learning,</hi> or <hi>learned</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Learning not to be disparaged</note> men, it were to be wished that there were more <hi>godly,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> men also in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, take this Caution, that because God <note place="margin">Men not run before they be sent.</note> 
               <hi>fills</hi> many with the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and they doe a great deale of good, take heed least any of you run before you be <hi>sent,</hi> that is, that a man goe not rashly; and believe his <hi>owne</hi> judgement rather than the judgement of the <hi>Saints;</hi> as divers in this City they think they are fit to preach, and other people of God that are better able to judge of their gifts think not so, and yet they will run presently. Take heed of <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>rashnesse,</hi> but if God fill a man with the tidings of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and others of the people of God see it spark le out as a <hi>vessel</hi> full of <hi>new wine,</hi> who am I that I should resist, if with <hi>humility</hi> hee make known this tidings to others?</p>
            <p>If the Gospel be such a thing (as I desire you to spend some thoughts in considering of this truth) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 7. Comfort against present troubles.</note> then this should <hi>comfort</hi> us, and help our <hi>patience</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in these trouble some times; that though all be out of order, and we suffer such losses, yet blessed be God wee have the <hi>voyce of the turtle still in the Land;</hi> thou maiest say, though I have <hi>hard</hi> newes at home; <hi>trading</hi> is <hi>low,</hi> and my <hi>stock</hi> is <hi>small,</hi> yet blessed be God I have the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that is, I have abundance of glad tidings made known to my eares, and to my soule every day. This is some comfort, you have lesse of <hi>outward</hi> things, but more of <hi>inward</hi> (I suppose) then ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66290:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Another thing is this, if this be so, then it is a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Vse 8. 1.</note> that is necessary to be observed by us that are Ministers, they must take heed of two things. <note place="margin">Not to corrupt the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, take heed of corrupting, and adulterating this blessed Gospel, and glad tidings with their owne wisdome, it is glorious enough of it selfe, every addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane wisdome makes it worse; take heed of sophisticating the word of God, of playing the <hi>hucksters,</hi> as the Apostle saith 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>wee are not those that play the hucksters,</hi> hucksters mingle <hi>apples</hi> and <hi>peares:</hi> they mingle their commodities, take heed of that.</p>
            <p>And then take heed of mingling the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> together. It is true the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>necessary,</hi> and is <note place="margin">2. Not to mingle Law and Gospel.</note> added to the <hi>Gospel;</hi> but God intends not in the <hi>new</hi> testament that it should be <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> with the Gospel. As to instance in a few; many <hi>ministers</hi> undoe the soules of people, I know this by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that a <hi>Gospel-heart,</hi> that is but <hi>weake</hi> in Gospel <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> had rather lie a <hi>yeare</hi> in close <hi>prison</hi> than to be a <hi>yeare</hi> under a <hi>ministerie,</hi> jumbling <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> together the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> for it <hi>routs,</hi> and <hi>on sounds</hi> a poore soule. As to preach <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> to a <hi>sinner qua</hi> a <hi>sinner,</hi> properly as a <hi>sinner;</hi> though we be called ministers of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> yet this is a part of the ministerie of the <hi>Law:</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> brings <hi>curses</hi> for a <hi>sinner,</hi> and <hi>blessings</hi> for him that doth <hi>well;</hi> now when we <hi>quatinus</hi> as a <hi>sinner damme</hi> him, and <hi>curse</hi> him, we <hi>harden</hi> him, and make him run <note place="margin">2. It is legall to do good or abstain from evill for fear of judgment.</note> 
               <hi>further</hi> from God then before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when men have <hi>drawen</hi> men to <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> men from <hi>evil</hi> with <hi>judgments,</hi> either <hi>spirituall,</hi> or <hi>temporall:</hi> this was the way of the ministery of the <hi>old</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66290:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>testament.</hi> When people shall take all the judgments of the <hi>old testament,</hi> and perswade a man to <hi>do</hi> this or to <hi>take heed</hi> of that, or else thou shalt have <hi>judgment</hi> fall upon thee, and thou wilt bring <hi>judgment,</hi> upon the <hi>Land.</hi> Beloved, this was the way of <hi>God</hi> certainly and the way of the ministery of the <hi>old testament;</hi> but I never knew a saint <hi>avoid evil,</hi> or <hi>doe good</hi> for feare of such <hi>judgments.</hi> Therfore looke to thy owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; men may play at <hi>dice</hi> with the word of God that way; if a mans wayes like them not, they may say they will bring <hi>judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Land,</hi> as <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> or as <hi>such,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> men; but these are but <hi>bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares,</hi> why? because in the Gospel, the saints are <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the hands of their enemies that they may serve God with out feare:</hi> they know that in <hi>God</hi> there is no <hi>cloud,</hi> God may <hi>chasten,</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> them out of <hi>love</hi> but there is no danger otherwise. And then againe they are <hi>delivered</hi> from <hi>men,</hi> they are <hi>not the servants of</hi> men.</p>
            <p>I doe think for my part constantly, that the mayne <note place="margin">Cause of divisions.</note> cause of all the <hi>divisions,</hi> and <hi>stirrs,</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us is because there's so much of the <hi>old testament</hi> in our <hi>ministery</hi> especially, and our <hi>profession</hi> must be accordingly; for our <hi>strength</hi> will be according to our <hi>meat.</hi> And truly a man may be a <hi>Godly</hi> man, and yet may be a <hi>minister</hi> of the <hi>old testament;</hi> and if you take a man, let him be a <hi>Godly</hi> man, if his <hi>grace</hi> be bred in him by the ministery of the <hi>old testament,</hi> and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him by that: and take <hi>another</hi> saint that hath <hi>grace</hi> planted, and <hi>bred</hi> by the <hi>ministery</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and nourished by that, the former man though he be godly, must of necesity <hi>persecute</hi> the latter. I pitty them when ministers rale against <hi>this</hi> man, and against <hi>that,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:66290:30"/>
and they know not why, yet they may be Godly men. <hi>Ishmael</hi> might be a <hi>Godly</hi> man for ought I know; he was a <hi>type,</hi> not of <hi>wicked</hi> men, but of men under the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> If ever you will have <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> in the <hi>Land,</hi> beg of God to remove an <hi>old testament</hi> spirit from our <hi>preachers,</hi> from our <hi>prayers,</hi> and our <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,</hi> and to set up the <hi>new testament,</hi> Jesus Christ in the Gospel, and then certainly the promise shall be fulfilled, we shall be all of <hi>one heart</hi> and <hi>one way,</hi> and <hi>one mind,</hi> but it will never be otherwise as long as some reach to the ministery of the <hi>new testament</hi> and others goe in the <hi>old,</hi> as <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and <hi>Isaak</hi> could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, no more will these.</p>
            <p>I will conclude all only with this last word, seeing <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 9.</note> it is cleare out of the word (and so truly I hope <note place="margin">To receive the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> you apprehend it through Gods grace that the whole Gospel is <hi>Good,</hi> it is <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>glad</hi> tidings to the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>sinners,</hi> much more to <hi>saints;</hi> then I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you in the name of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> that you receive this Gospel. O there is no reason why thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be so <hi>shie</hi> of Christ when we speake <hi>faire,</hi> and offer <hi>faire</hi> to your soules, and <hi>beseech</hi> you earnestly, and give you <hi>reasons</hi> why you should receive Christ, you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but a little, and you goe away so <hi>shy,</hi> there are some <hi>sinners</hi> still: beloved there is no <hi>reason</hi> for it, God deals <hi>plainly;</hi> there is no tittle in the Gospel but it is really <hi>good</hi> and <hi>glad tidings</hi> to the worst of <hi>sinners;</hi> therefore receive it. What is that? Indeavour to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive</hi> it, for the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> that is the <hi>faithfull witnesse</hi>

            <p>Then indeavour to <hi>imbrace</hi> it with joy, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2. Embrace it with joy</note> as in 1. Thess. 1. see <hi>how they</hi> received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
