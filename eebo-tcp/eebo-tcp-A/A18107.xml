            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But the leſſeſuſpicion there is of an iniury, the greater is the iniury done to a man, and the more hainouſly to be accounted of.</p>
            <p>Not many weekes ſince there was a Booke publiſhed vnder the name of <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon:</hi> Which for the Argument was not altogether vnlike thoſe workes of his, that he had partly publiſhed already, and partly vndertaken to write, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. And for the place; who would imagine that any thing ſhould come foorth in Print at <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon's</hi> diſgrace; where, as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hee was ſo much eſteemed of by his Maieſtie, and the chiefeſt of the land;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8110:6"/>
and now hee is dead, I hope I may ſay his memory is precious to all honeſt men? And beſides, for him that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the booke to be ſet foorth, hee is ſo profuſe in his praiſe, that a man would thinke hee meant him no ſmall addition of glory by his large commendations. But if you once reade the booke it ſelfe, you ſhall ſoone ſee it is ſuch kinde of ſtuffe, as cannot bee imagined to haue been my Fathers, without his great ſhame and infamie, being a Pamphlet full of ſuch groſſe ignorance, malignity, and moſt inſolent deſire of nouitie in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Surely the Author of it deſerues the name of a Schiſmatike, (that I may ſay no worſe) and whoſoeuer hee was, is worthy to bee puniſhed for ſuch a one, as being no leſſer enemy to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then hee is iniurious to my Fathers good name.</p>
            <p>But that the Reader may wonder the leſſe at it, it is no new thing for bookes of nouell and vnſound doctrine to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vpon ſuch men that be free from

Of which thing euen <hi>Origen</hi> alone may bee a ſufficient exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who was long ſince numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Arch-heretikes themſelues, and yet both by ancient and moderne writers is moſt ſtrongly defended to

Or rather it is moſt likely that ſome vnletter'd fellow, ſome ſharking companion, lighting vpon an old moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Pamphlet, which hee thought to be ſome great treaſure, and hard to be come by; and agreeing with a Sordid Bookeſeller to get it reprinted; thought it beſt to put ſome mans name of note before it, that ſo their gaines, which they gaped for, might come in the faſter by the ſale. And this laſt (howſoeuer the other two coniectures goe, for there may be more in it then this alone) they that haue had to doe, and enquire into the matter, haue found to bee moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and true.</p>
            <p>In the meane, who would not lament to ſee what a miſerable caſe we are now adayes brought vnto, when ſuch baſe fellowes as theſe, that neuer had any thing to doe with learning, nor hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie neither, ſhall take vpon them to iudge what Bookes may benefite the people, and deſerue to bee publiſhed?

The fault whereof, it is a griefe to ſee, how in a maner it comes from the very people themſelues, who hauing once got it by the end, that there is no ſmal religion in making long diſcourſes, and in oſtentation of much reading, gape after ſuch nouell Pamphlets as faſt as euer the Athenians did after newes. And ſo no maru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to make it no wonder, that theſe Impoſtors were in ſuch hope to couſen and deceiue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull multitude at eaſe; is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the degrees of impudence, that they ſhould goe about to make Them Patrons and witneſſes of their fraud, whom they ſhould much rather haue

feared to be the Reuengers &amp; inſt Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of it? Lord! what a licentious age doe wee liue in! that ſuch a lurking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure fellow (for hee is famous and knowen for nothing but villany) ſhould dare to inſcribe his Booke, which hee knew to be but forg'd and counterfeit, to our moſt Noble and Pious Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other great Lords, and all in hope of reward and gaine! But to let paſſe this iuggling knaue, that ſets vs foorth his wares and toyes with ſuch a vaunting kind of language, and to come vnto the Booke it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Certainly I ſuppoſe there is no lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, ſpecially to whom <hi>Caſaubon</hi> or his Writings were not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, that can bee ſo ſenceleſſe or groſſe, but vpon the firſt reading of this Booke, hee will preſently both perceiue and deteſt the fraud of theſe cheating companions. And therefore had the Booke come into their hands onely that were able to iudge of ſuch matters, and to diſcerne trueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſhood, I might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8110:9"/>
haue ſaued all this labour. But inaſmuch as the Booke came forth in Engliſh, and was ſnatched vp ſo faſt by the vnlearned multitude, and is now by their raſh iudgement ſo much commended and approoued; I haue heere briefly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the examination thereof, both to rectifie the ignorant, and to vindicate my Father from ſuſpicion of impietie; that ſo at laſt the vizard being pulled off the Pamphlet, it may appeare to all, as it is, in its owne naturall likeneſſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt I muſt ſeriouſly confeſſe, that for the originall Author of the Booke, I neither know him, nor euer heard the leaſt rumour of him, what hee was, <hi>

            <p>For his Religion, I thinke it will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a great many, and be enough for his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8110:10"/>
commendation too, to ſay, hee was no Papiſt, but rather a fierce enemy to them all. Indeed this may be enough for them, that thinke a man preſently right and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe enough, if hee doeth but once profeſſe himſelfe an Aduerſarie to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; it being their cuſtome to meaſure the integritie and ſoundneſſe of a mans Religion by his hatred againſt Papiſts onely. And it is to bee feared, leſt that the Booke, being written againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe, as the Title of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, becauſe I neither approoue the Booke, nor acknowledoe it to be my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both Father and Sonne, as men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken napping, be by ſome Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But howſoeuer it were a fault, to giue any occaſion of ſcandall vnto the weakeſt members in the Church, yet the loue of trueth muſt more preuaile with me to vndertake her defence, then the prauitie of other mens iudgements to deterre me from it. In my opinion he defined vertue well, that ſaid it was the meane betweene two extreme
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8110:10"/>
vices, which is not onely true in Morall and Practicall, but in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall vertues alſo; of which kinde the right apprehenſion of Trueth is. And therefore it is no marueile, if they, which take that way in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, doe oppoſe themſelues againſt two extremes, and haue two extremes oppoſed againſt them. Yet hee that keepes this middle courſe, howſoeuer he may perhaps differ in opinion from either ſide, yet in charitie he may be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto both. And for no other cauſe is hee more maligned by the hot-ſpurres on either part, then for ſeeking to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace and concord betwixt them, and for doing his beſt endeauour to make vp the great ſchiſme and rent of the Church, that againe wee might come to be all one body.

            <p>For the Papiſts, I haue nothing to ſay to them now. But I haue heere to doe with ſuch kind of men, who ſtriuing to runne as farre from Papiſts as they can, haue alſo vnaduiſedly runne withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of Truth. Theſe are the Men, that with incredible pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy deſpiſe all Antiquity; that moſt ſuperciliouſly contemne the ancient and holy Fathers, that ſtudie all they can how to abrogate and abandon all the ancient Conſtitutions of the Church; and in the meane while, that arrogate to themſelues a power of making what Lawes they liſt, of appointing Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at their pleaſure, and of bringing in ſuch a diſcipline, which the Chriſtians of olde neuer heard of, as if they had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne created the only perpetuall Dictators

and Gouernours of the Church of Chriſt. And though they haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at all of any publique tranquillitie, refuſing to giue way but to the leaſt thing that may make for the peace and vnitie of Chriſtians, yet neuertheles they would faine beare vp their credit, and for a colour of their bad intents, make vs beleeue they are wondrous zealous men. Of which ſort of men that he was one, whoſoeuer was the Author of this Booke, which theſe Impoſtors haue publiſhed vnder <hi>Iſ. Caſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There being I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſcarce any writing extant in this kind, which doeth more clearely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently argue, what an inſolent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, and raſh Author it had. A man would verely thinke that hee was one,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8110:12"/>
who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had proclaimed open warre and defiance to all Antiquitie, or one that being ſtarke-ſtaring mad with noueltie and fury, would abandon all the ancient Cuſtomes and Conſtitutions of our Forefathers.</p>
            <p>The Booke indeed by the Title is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be written againſt Papiſts, but in effect it prooues as aduerſe to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue, as to the Popiſh Church. And whereas the Church of England, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off ſuch corruptions as crept in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her in declining ages, hath retained many of the Sacred Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which the ancient Church had, yet ſhe is alſo cunningly ſtricken at through the Papiſts ſides, with ſo much the more danger, by how much the more craft and cloſe ſubtiltie it is done.</p>
            <p>Therefore let this be the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the reſt, to prooue, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon</hi> neither was, nor could be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Booke. For who was it that euer reuerenced the gray haires of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie more then hee? Who euer, without
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8110:12"/>
iniuring the holy Scriptures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? whoſe Doctrine and Diſcipline, Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies hee did ſo much approoue and embrace, that hee could neuer ſeeme to himſelfe to haue commended and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified it enough. Though there were none of his workes and writings left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, out of which it might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and demonſtrated what his mind was herein, yet there be many graue and religious men ſtill liuing, whom I could call to witneſſe, how often they haue heard him profeſſe and declare at large, that he was thus affected. But there will be no neede of that, ſeeing his owne Bookes are euery where extant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it. For howſoeuer hee had neuer any occaſion offered him purpoſely and <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> to handle this Argument, yet ſeeing all his Workes that belong to matters Eccleſiaſticall and Diuine, haue nothing in them, not onely contrary, or

For the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and puritie of theſe firſt ages was ſuch, that as the ancient Fathers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers doe witneſſe, not onely any day, but euery day was appropriated to this Sacred Celebration; the Chriſtians then for the moſt part neuer miſſing a day, but they did communicate. A long while after, when deuotion began to waxe cold, there grew a neceſſitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lawes, to meet with the peoples contempt of ſo great a bleſſing.

Was it likely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hee durſt venture to ſet foorth ſuch a virulent Booke as this, and one that was ſo vniuſtly written againſt the Papiſts? Or if he had ventured it, could hee haue eſcaped vnpuniſhed? Where were his Aduerſaries at that time, who, after his comming into <hi>England,</hi> and his firſt beginning to write about matters of Religion, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues againſt him, in ſuch number, and ſuch bitterneſſe as they did?
