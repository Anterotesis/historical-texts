            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT has been the ordinary practice of the French Poets, to dedicate their Works of this nature to their King, especially when they have had the least encouragement to it, by his approbation of them on the Stage. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I want the confidence to follow their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though perhaps I have as specious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to it for this Piece, as any they can boast of: it having been own'd in so particular a manner by His Majesty, that he has grac'd it with the Title of His Play, and thereby rescued it from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity (that I may not say malice) of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But, though a character so high and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, has not rais'd in me the presumption to offer such a trifle to his more serious view, yet I will own the vanity to say, that after this glory which it has receiv'd from a Soveraign Prince, I could not send it to seek protection from any Subject. Be this Poem then sacred to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tedious form of a Dedication, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out presuming to interrupt those hours which he is daily giving to the peace and settlement of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48934:3"/>
For what else concerns this Play, I would tell the Reader that it is regular, according to the strictest of Dramatick Laws, but that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which many of our Poets now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, and a beauty which our common Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do not easily discern. Neither indeed do I value my self upon it, because with all that sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of parts, it may want an air and spirit (which consists in the writing) to set it off. 'Tis a question variously disputed, whether an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may be allowed as a competent judg of his own works. As to the Fabrick and contrivance of them certainly he may, for that is properly the employment of the judgment; which, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builder may determine, and that without deception, whether the work be according to the exactness of the model; still granting him to have a perfect Idea of that pattern by which he works: and that he keeps himself always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the discourse of his judgment, without admitting self-love, which is the false surveigher of his Fancy, to intermeddle in it. These Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications granted (being such as all sound Poets are presupposed to have within them) I think all Writers, of what kind soever, may infallibly
<pb facs="tcp:48934:3"/>
judg of the frame and contexture of their Works. But for the ornament of Writing, which is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, more various and bizarre in Poesie then in any other kind, as it is properly the Child of Fancy, so it can receive no measure, or at least but a very imperfect one of its own excellencies or faillures from the judgment. Self-love (which enters but rarely into the offices of the judgment) here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates. And Fancy (if I may so speak) judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self, can be no more certain or demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of its own effects, then two crooked lines can be the adaequate measure of each other. What I have said on this subject, may, perhaps, give me some credit with my Readers, in my opinion of this Play, which I have ever valued above the rest of my Follies of this kind: yet not thereby in the least dissenting from their judgment who have concluded the writing of this to be much inferior to my Indian Emperour. But the Argument of that was much more noble, not having the allay of Comedy to depress it: yet if this be more perfect, either in its kind, or in the general notion of a Play, 'tis as much as I desire to have granted for the vindication of my Opinion, and, what as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touches me, the sentence of a Royal Judg.
<pb facs="tcp:48934:4"/>
Many have imagin'd the Character of <hi>Philocles</hi> to be faulty; some for not discovering the Queens love, others for his joining in her restraint. But though I am not of their number, who obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend what they have once said, I may with modesty take up those answers which have been made for me by my Friends; namely, that <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> who was but a Gentleman of ordinary birth, had no reason to guess so soon at the Queens Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, she being a person so much above him, and by the suffrages of all her people, already destin'd to <hi>Lysimantes:</hi> Besides, that he was prepossessed, (as the Queen somewhere hints it to him) with another inclination which rendred him less clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted in it, since no man, at the same time, can distinctly view two different objects. And if this, with any shew of reason, may be defended, I leave my Masters the Criticks to determine whether it be not much more conducing to the beauty of my Plot, that <hi>Philocles</hi> should be long kept ignorant of the Queens love, then that with one leap he should have entred into the knowledg of it, and thereby freed himself, to the disgust of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from that pleasing Labyrinth of errors which was prepar'd for him. As for that other
<pb facs="tcp:48934:4"/>
objection of his joyning in the Queens imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is indisputably that which every man, if he examines himself, would have done on the like occasion. If they answer that it takes from the height of his Character to do it; I would enquire of my over-wise Censors, who told them I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him a perfect Character, or indeed what necessity was there he should be so, the variety of Images, being one great beauty of a Play? it was as much as I design'd, to show one great and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute pattern of honour in my Poem, which I did in the Person of the Queen: All the defects of the other parts being set to show, the more to recommend that one character of Vertue to the Audience. But neigher was the fault of <hi>Philocles</hi> so great, if the circumstances be consider'd, which, as moral Philosophy assures us, make the essential differences of good and bad; He himself best explaining his own intentions in his last Act, which was the restauration of his Queen; and even before that, in the honesty of his expressions when he was unavoidably led by the impulsion of his love to do it. That which with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was objected as an indecorum, is the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the last Scene of the Play, where <hi>Celadon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48934:5"/>
and <hi>Florimell</hi> are treating too lightly of their marriage in the presence of the Queen, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seems to stand idle while the great action of the <hi>Drama</hi> is still depending. This I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise defend, then by telling you I so design'd it on purpose to make my Play go off more smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that Scene, being in the opinion of the best judges, the most divertising of the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But though the Artifice succeeded, I am willing to acknowledg it as a fault, since it pleas'd His Majesty, the best Judg, to think it so. I have onely to add, that the Play is founded on a story in the <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which he calls the Queen of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth;</hi> in whose Character, as it has been affirm'd to me, he represents that of the famous <hi>Christina,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> This is what I thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to write by way of Preface, to the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Queen; in the reading of which, I fear you will not meet with that satisfaction which you have had in seeing it on the Stage; the chief parts of it both serious and comick, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to that height of excellence, that nothing but a command which I could not handsomely disobey, could have given me the courage to have made it publick.</p>

                  <p>Nay, for that you shall excuse me; for I was never merrier then I was at a Creditors of mine, whose Book perished with him. But what new Beauties have you at Court? How do <hi>Melissa's</hi> two fair Daughters?</p>

                  <p>I, and both asunder; why, I hope there are but two of 'em, the tall Singing and Dancing one, and the little Innocent one?</p>

                  <speaker>Cel.</speaker>
                  <p>No, nor either of 'em I trust in Heaven; but I can keep them company, I can sing and dance with 'em, and treat 'em, and that, I take it, is somewhat better then musty marrying them: Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is poor folks pleasure that cannot go to the cost of variety: but I am out of danger of that with these two, for I love 'em so equally I can never make choice between 'em: Had I but one mistress, I might go to her to be merry, and she, perhaps, be out of humour; there were a visit lost: But here, if one of 'em frown upon me, the other will be the more obliging, on purpose to recommend her own gayety, besides a thousand things that I could name.</p>

                  <p>Well, if you will not be cruel to a poor Lover, you might oblige me by carrying me to their lodgings.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
                  <p>You know I am always busie about the Queen.</p>

                  <p>But once or twice onely, till I am a little flush'd in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with other Ladies, and have learn'd to prey for my self: I promise you I'le make all the haste I can to end your trouble, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love somewhere else.</p>

                  <p>And reason good: many a man hangs himself for the loss of one Mistris; How do you think then I should bear the loss of two; especially in a Court where I think Beauty is but thin sown.</p>

                  <p>Seriously! I know not that; if he did, perhaps I should not love him: but we sit and talk, and wrangle, and are friends; when we are together we never hold our tongues; then we have always a noise of Fiddles at our heels, he hunts me merrily as the Hound does the Hare; and either this is Love, or I know it not.</p>

               <l>'Twas onely for your person, not your Crown;</l>
               <l>I swear no second love</l>
               <l>Shall violate the flame I had for you,</l>
               <l>But in strict imitation of your Oath</l>
               <l>I vow a single life.</l>

            <byline>Written by a Person of Honour.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>OUr Poet something doubtful of his Fate</l>
               <l>Made choice of me to be his Advocate,</l>
               <l>Relying on my Knowledg in the Laws,</l>
               <l>And I as boldly undertook the Cause.</l>
               <l>I left my Client yonder in a rant</l>
               <l>Against the envious, and the ignorant,</l>
               <l>Who are, he sayes, his onely Enemies:</l>
               <l>But he contemns their malice, and defies</l>
               <l>The sharpest of his Censurers to say</l>
               <l>Where there is one gross fault in all his Play.</l>
               <l>The language is so fitted for each part,</l>
               <l>The Plot according to the Rules of Art;</l>
               <l>And twenty other things he bid me tell you,</l>
               <l>But I cry'd, e'en go do't your self for <hi>Nelly.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Reason, with Judges, urg'd in the defence</l>
               <l>Of those they would condemn, is insolence;</l>
               <l>I therefore wave the merits of his Play,</l>
               <l>And think it fit to plead this safer way.</l>
               <l>If, when too many in the purchase share</l>
               <l>Robbing's not worth the danger nor the care;</l>
               <l>The men of business must, in Policy,</l>
               <l>Cherish a little harmless Poetry;</l>
               <l>All wit wou'd else grow up to Knavery.</l>
               <l>Wit is a Bird of Musick, or of Prey.</l>
               <l>Mounting she strikes at all things in her way;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48934:41"/>
But if this Birdlime once but touch her wings,</l>
               <l>On the next bush she sits her down, and sings.</l>
               <l>I have but one word more; tell me I pray</l>
               <l>What you will get by damning of our Play?</l>
               <l>A whipt Fanatick who does not recant</l>
               <l>Is by his Brethren call'd a suffring Saint;</l>
               <l>And by your hands shou'd this poor Poet die</l>
               <l>Before he does renounce his Poetry,</l>
               <l>His death must needs confirm the Party more</l>
               <l>Then all his scribling life could do before.</l>
               <l>Where so much zeal does in a Sect appear,</l>
               <l>'Tis to no purpose, 'faith, to be severe.</l>
               <l>But 'tother day I heard this rhyming Fop</l>
               <l>Say Criticks were the Whips, and he the Top;</l>
               <l>For, as a Top spins best the more you baste her,</l>
               <l>So every lash you give, he writes the faster.</l>
