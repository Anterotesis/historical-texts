            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Letter ſhewing equally ſuch zeal for the Proteſtant Cauſe, and affection to me, hath made me read the Book incloſed, with ſuch a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Writer, as careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if it contained Reſponſes, and as impartially as if I were a Seeker.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion here moved, I ingenuouſly grant,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40378:4"/>
is the main Point (if ſolidly anſwered) could beſt reclaim me, and moſt of my Profeſſion, who amid'ſt ſo many Storms raiſed againſt us, have no ſmall motive to comply, if we could look at preſent to our little Temporal Intereſt, without making a greater and Eternal loſs, whereof there could be no hazard, if Proteſtants (as is here debated) could ſhew any aſſured and infallible ground for what they profeſs.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is all Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> through all his ten Papers requires, and we with him; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds and ſtates the Queſtion moſt clearly and ſmoothly, though in homely terms, by reaſon of his long abſence from home; he makes no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the main Point, what ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed beſide: (yet engageth after this Point once decided, to anſwer what ever is here retorted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, or urged againſt him) he anſwers hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and mildly, however provok'd with moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and lofty words; Like another <hi>Fabius</hi> or old Warriour, he keeps his Poſt, neglecting all the Flowriſhes and Skirmiſhes of his inſulting Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, who having engaged under his hand, to defend the Proteſtant Religion (the onely occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Diſpute) ſtrives ſtill nevertheleſs (<hi>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de &amp; arte punicâ</hi>) that is moſt deceitfully, to impugne the Catholick Roman Faith with a like ſucceſs to that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who let <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> be demoliſhed and redacted to aſhes, whil'ſt he inſiſted in vain to Sack and Ruine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40378:4"/>
               <hi>Rome.</hi> And this is proper to him with moſt Hereticks; all Hereſy tending rather to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then edification, Atheiſme rather then Religion, and to queſtion what hath been ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles conſtantly believed in the Church of God, rather then to ſettle their own new wavering and inconſtant Faith, upon any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Principle or Ground.</p>
            <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> moſt confidently thinking he had got as an unbloody, ſo an undoubted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory (hearing his Adverſary was dead) Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Senate of <hi>Aberdene</hi> as for a Triumph, that his Papers may be put in Print: His Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Loyalty, and Religion moſt juſtly deſerving it, for as he is of a daring and ſtirring ſpirit, ſo in all things Martially minded, his Learning being moſt in Polemics, his Loyalty much in debate, and his Religion ever in controverſy; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as Umpire in all, he deſerveth well a Crown, as his late late Victory by the Pen a Chariot of Paper. This his Triumphal Chariot is not drawn, but carried in the Air, with high and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blaſts; moſt ſuitable to his fierceneſs in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſcolding and railing Tongue, which makes his Adverſaries deepeſt wounds. Before it, go indeed ſome worthy Perſons, at leaſt in black upon white, and in the Paper, follow immediately the flying Colours, wherein his late Arms ſent from <hi>Edenbrough, (viz.</hi> The Bible reverſed) do ſhine, with this new Motto, I take
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40378:5"/>
from the preſent Subject The Grounds of the Proteſtant Religion. The acclamations of the People are not wanting in the mouthes of ſome ſighing Siſters. He is Herauld himſelf, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly his own praiſes aloud; nothing is brought into the Treaſury, as in Triumphs had wont in old, but ſome hundred Marks for the charges of the Triumph (that is, the Printing of the Papers) exported. One thing onely is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, practiſed in ſuch glorious ſhowes, one Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor ſitting with the Triumpher, to keep him in mind of humane weakneſs, leaſt too great honour ſhould ſo puff him up, as to think himſelf above the condition of men. And this defect, Sir, I intend to ſupply, in peruſing his Book, advertiſing him now and then of ſome weakneſs, both in Conduct, Courage and Strength, as his Anſwers to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſhall deſerve.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if I ſhould anſwer his moſt invective Babling, Scoldings, and Railings, with all the Venom he ſpits out to Ciment the Grounds of his Religion, I could eaſily pay him home, even with the general Applauſe and Acclamations of moſt Proteſtants, amongſt whom the more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and moſt conſtant Profeſſors ſcarce own him, his Religion, or Grounds; as beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Arragant, Proud, Contentious Spirit, his unbridled Tongue, his ſcandalous Carriage in ſo many Encounters, his wavering Belief, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled

Faith; and how oft he hath been <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Presbyterian, Independent</hi>: His Pulpit jars with his Collegue in the time of the Covenant, his baſe complyance with the Uſurper in the time of Rebellion, his variance with his Biſhop at the time, the Government of the Church was re-eſtabliſht; how many living Witneſſes have heard him Preach and foment Schiſm, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Church, Sedition in the State, and even treacherous and Treaſonable Sermons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Prince and King. I inſtance only that baſe and perfidious bewraying of Gods Word, belying of the known truth; and betraying of his Countrey and King, in that moſt unchriſtian Sermon, upon theſe words, <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for</hi> Saul, <hi>whom I have rejected?</hi> Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to our moſt Gracious Soveraign; which I ſhould have been aſhamed to relate, if this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Impoſtor, and moſt abſurd abuſer of Gods Word, had not firſt in the Preface of a Sermon in Print, and now again ſo often in this his Book moſt deceitfully and maliciouſly cryed out, <hi>Papists could be no good Subjects,</hi> as if their Tenets did tend to Rebellion; whil'ſt all Loyal Proteſtants in the three Kingdoms, both love and reſpect our Loyalty, how ever they hate our Profeſſion; and look upon him, with all his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting Fry, as a moſt fiery Incendiary of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Now Sir, if ſuch a man (whom you moſt cry up for his Eloquence, as, if like another
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40378:6"/>
               <hi>Samſon,</hi> his ſtrength conſiſted in his hair) be a Perſon fitted to give the Grounds of Religion, defend the Proteſtant Faith, or convert any one to his Belief, for that with a Phariſaical counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a Puritanical tone, and a ſtrong voice, colouring ſome ſlight Learning and reading of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> with plagiary Phraſes and Paſſages, to ſtuff up a Book in Print, and turn the Glaſs twice in his Sermons, let any be judge.</p>
            <p>As that Philoſopher of old, hearing himſelf praiſed by the rabble, who commonly approve nothing but ſuch ſtuff as is in themſelves, did preſently make an examen of his actions: I hope Proteſtants ſeeing their Religion Defended by ſuch a Writer, will more diligently enquire of its weakneſs, which they can never better ſee, then in his Papers, where having undertaken to give the Grounds of the Proteſtant Religion (the only Subject of this Diſpute, either by Word or Writ) in them all has not (as his Adverſary well re-marks) ſo much as ten lines to ſettle, clear, or defend them in the leaſt; but ſcraping together objections againſt Catholicks (ſo often anſwered by them) borrows ſome paſſages to no purpoſe at preſent, and heaps up undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, with ſuch injurious ſcoldings, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and imprecations againſt an Old, Grave, Learned, and Modeſt Man, that after he hath called him an impudent Liar, a Knave, Rogue, Sycophant, Fool, a dull and Lethargick-head, a

                  <p>Some brief Reflections on the Title of Mr. <hi>Menzei's</hi> Book, and his two long Epiſtles Dedicatory, and to the Reader.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HIs Title being in Latine <hi>Papiſmus Lucifugus,</hi> (according to that ſaying, a ſtrong Thief ſhall have a ſtrange name,) muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and ſurely underſtood of that New Goſpel Light in the Covenant, for in it Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> was a bright Star of the firſt Magnitude, or Fiery Comet himſelf, of which Light, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Poet in anſwer to a <hi>Satyre,</hi> upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of a Biſhop, Writes thus,

               <p>This Light indeed Popery ſhuns, as all other New Lights againſt old received Chriſtian Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but not that either of Scripture or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, the onely true Light of the Chriſtian

                  </gap>n of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and carried by ſo many holy Popes, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Prieſts in Communion with them, even unto the moſt remote corners of the Earth, as the converſion of all Kings and Countries to the Chriſtian Religion do teſtifie, which Light Mr. <hi>Dempster,</hi> no where declines, but conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds out to make nothing for clearing the Grounds of the Proteſtant Religion, except it be in ſhewing them both ruinous and falſe, ſo that Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> here, <hi>Offendit in Luce &amp; in limine,</hi> that is, ſtumbles both in the light, and in the ſpecious Title of his Book, whereof the very firſt line is not to the purpoſe. The Queſtion being only of the Grounds of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and not of Popery at all.</p>
               <p>He begins with a great ſhow of humility, <hi>who am I, the meaneſt of the thouſands of Iſrael?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Est qui ſe nequiter humiliat &amp; interiora ejus plena dolo, Eccleſ.</hi>—19. But let his late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the Church, Principal in the Colledge, and fellow Brethren in the Miniſtery bear witneſs of this, when they have oppoſed him in the leaſt: Yea, his own Jactancy through all his Papers and Book, with his baſe revilings in every page, and under-valuing of his Adverſary. It is thoſe his humble thoughts of his own abilities makes him ſo boldly aſſert there was conſultation uſed in the preſent Diſpute, Surprizal intended, and a choice Champion pitched upon to Encounter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40378:8"/>
with him as a Hector. But the known truth is to all them who had a hand in the undertaking (as they did witneſs in his preſence at the Meeting) that they had only yielded to his Importunity in deſiring a Meeting, and that they had taken him only who was next at hand for the time, a man moſt able indeed for a civil Conference, but moſt unable for a Clamorous Diſpute, as being of a very weak Conſtitution, and of a totally confiſcated health. But all this Conference muſt be ſet out by him in a diſguiſed Dreſs; Mr. <hi>Demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> proclaimed an Ignorant, Catholicks char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Calumnies, the better to Paint out his Victory and Triumph. As in like caſe another Conference (as he quotes) by Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> of late, whom he might have ſpared to name, being as good at Calumniating Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as either of them, and no doubt but he will be cited hereafter, as they now, who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs moſt deceitfully relates both the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Conference, and what paſſed in it.</p>
               <p>The clamours of women he ſpeaks of, if any (for it was a moſt modeſt perſon did ſpeak) was onely to ſuppreſs his clamours heard even at the Croſs, and witneſs to his face, that he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his engagement to them, which was to give and defend the Grounds of the Proteſtant Religion, as he had engaged under his hand; and this his miſſive, was the Paper Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> kept open at the Meeting (which he would have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40378:8"/>
generally ſuppoſed to have been the firſt exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Paper with him) but it is particularly known to us, Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> had never then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to write a line. But Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and conſcious to himſelf, that it had been eaſie to reverſe his Grounds, and Involve him in inextricable difficulties (as ſhall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) if he had anſwered directly by word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the performance of his promiſe, or to ſpeak for the Proteſtant Religion at all, but will only Impugne ſome Opinions of Authours in the School, which are neither fit for the Pulpit, (where he did firſt challenge them) nor the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of common hearers, and much leſs that which he chiefly inſiſted on, any Point of our Faith.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That men are not bound preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent when ever they have offended God, under the danger of incurring a new ſin; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> frameth his Argument, as if this were a Diciſion of the Catholick Roman Church; and then ſayes he, Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Major, whence he took witneſs that the Jeſuit admitted the Minor, a rare Inference and quick. He paſſeth under ſilence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Major denied, becauſe diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, who though he did think it a point of Faith, and that ſo unqueſtionable, yet could never prove it by Scripture, contenting himſelf with a weak compariſon, which he is aſhamed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40378:9"/>
to ſet down in his Book. But however Doctors vary in preſcribing a limited time wherein we ſhould repent, all hold the ſhorteſt delay both ſureſt and beſt, and publick Repentance is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taught to be neceſſary for publick tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, as publick Recantations for open Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, like to that of Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> againſt his Soveraign, <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, &amp;c.</hi> His Penitential Sermon being as yet to make, ſo well doth he preſently repent. Yea, not only his Practice, but Doctrine alſo (if truly a Proteſtant) is ſo far from preſently repenting, that Teaching mens beſt actions to be ſinful, he muſt either confeſs repentance at no time to be commanded, or elſe blaſphemouſly avouch, God hath commanded us to ſin. Is it not a jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Commands, and a ſcoffing of men, to affirm the Commandements to be impoſſible, and yet urge that even affirmative ones ſhould be hourly, and inſtanly kept? Forgetting two Maxims of the School, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile,</hi> and <hi>Praecepta affirmitativa obligant ſemper ſed non pro ſemper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond Argument, he both argues and and anſwers to himſelf, (Mr. <hi>Dempster</hi> being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced by his clamours) concerning the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prieſts in adminiſtring the Sacraments, which if requiſite, he will have it to make all Faith uncertain. But in vain, there being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance of their intention, then that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40378:9"/>
uſe aright the Elements, and pronounce the words, or that they teach not falſe Doctrine, and ſet not out corrupt Bibles. The aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit promiſed to his Church, and his particular Providence in Governing and Ruling it, aſſures us nothing neceſſary either to Faith or Salvation can be wanting in her; No want of Intention can wrong them who are come to age, they may ſupply by their own Intentions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and Acts of the love of God: And for children whom Proteſtants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will have to be ſaved by the faith of their Parents, and not by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Is it not more ſure, that publick perſons in the Church want not a right Intention, then that private men have true Faith? The confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Sacrament is not only <hi>Actio Hominis</hi> I hope, but alſo <hi>Humana,</hi> as the Divines ſpeak. What then if a Mad man in a frolick, or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median for a jeer, (as we read to have been done in deriſion of Chriſtians) ſhould pour out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on any one, and pronounce the words? yea, what if a Prieſt ſhewing a new Convert how he is to be Baptized, ſhould do the ſame? Were theſe lawful and valid Baptiſms, where nothing ſave the Intention is wanting. It is eaſie to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at the chief Heads of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but hard to ſay any thing ſolidly againſt them.</p>
               <p>After this; he comes to his Apologies, Firſt, <hi>for ſo much writing on ſo little purpoſe</hi>;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40378:10"/>
Anſwer, he ſhould have ſaid, ſo little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there ſcarce being ten lines preciſely to the purpoſe in all his Papers and Book.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That he was not ſo ſpeedy in Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Mr.</hi> Dempſter, <hi>upon his Incombacy's; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deliberating whether he ſhould anſwer, the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of Mr.</hi> Dempſters <hi>Scriblings, who antida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Papers, yet that he might gueſs with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles, <hi>at his great haſt by his foul work.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, his greateſt Imcombacy's, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are but to dite and declaim <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, or ſuch like, out of other Controverſy Books: And if it be an empty Queſtion to ask the Grounds of his Religion; Sure it muſt be an empty Religion, and void of Grounds. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Mr. <hi>Dempster</hi> Antidate his Papers, but did write back to him as currantly as any man could do a miſſive Letter, never intending they ſhould ſee the Preſs, and finding very little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity in his Anſwers. He gueſſes at his great haſt by his foul work, but can ſhew nothing foul in it, ſave onely when he reſumes his filthy ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but we may eaſily gueſs at his little wit by his Fooliſh Work and Anſwers no where to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>His third Apology, is for the Acrimony and bitterneſs of his expreſſions, which he ſayes <hi>had their riſe from Mr.</hi> Dempſters <hi>Dunghil Eloquence, Repetitions, Praeteritions, Calumnies.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> ſcoldings are the only Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40378:10"/>
of the Dunghil: moſt Learned men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes be not very Eloquent in the Vulgar Tongue. As to his Repetitions, he is no good Diſputant, who paſſes from his medium before the Argument be anſwered. For Preteritions, all wiſe men paſs what is not to the purpoſe, as moſt of his papers and Book. And as for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, I leave to his papers to juſtifie his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, however Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> moſt injuriouſly Calumniate him.</p>
               <p>In his Epiſtle to the Reader, he continues his Apologies for <hi>Diſputing, Writing, Printing,</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one might have ſaid more in a very few ſheets, for the ſatisfaction of a lover of Truth, then he in all his Papers,</hi> and this is moſt true; Nay, <hi>but he has been conſtrained to follow the anomalous motions of a tautologizing Jeſuit.</hi> Anſwer, Theſe two words ſet together ſound well in a Pulpit, but ſignifie nothing or little: for how can his motion be anomalous or irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, who ſteers ſtill to the ſame point, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounding the ſame thing? Or how can he be ſaid to Tautologize and uſe idle Repetitions, who inſiſts ſtill in the ſame queſtion, till he get a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer? as if a man come to require his money from a Debtor, ſhould hear from him many news of the late Wars, and then asking again his money, the Debtor ſhould ſpeak of our new League with many Forraign Princes: But the Creditor ſtill mindful of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40378:11"/>
main, did reiterate the occaſion of his coming, and ask a new, when he could expect his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? were this a tautologizing, and vain repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition? And in this ſenſe I grant Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> tautologizes, and in no other.</p>
               <p>But are not rather Mr. <hi>Menzies</hi> many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this his Epiſtle againſt the Catholick Faith, and ſo many times repeated in his Book, both tautologies and anomalous motions, as altogether falſe, frivolous, idle, and impertinent to the preſent Queſtion, concerning the Grounds of the proteſtant Religion? wherefore I reflect only on the laſt, viz. <hi>That Popiſh Principles, as improven by the Jeſuited party, are highly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Princes,</hi> Ergo, The Proteſtant Religion hath ſolid grounds; for this ſhould be his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in all he ſayes: And this an arch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter is not aſhamed to write, who ſo treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and publickly did preach againſt his lawful Soveraign; but the love and eſteem, ſo many of the Greateſt and Wiſeſt Monarches in the Chriſtian World have for Jeſuits, ſufficiently vindicate them from all the Calumnies of ſuch a diſloyal perſon.</p>
               <p>After this he ſayes, <hi>If he know his own genius well, he takes no pleaſure in altercations:</hi> Anſwer He is then of a moſt auſtere Nature, who ſo ſhuns all pleaſure; for it ſeems Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> lives in altercations, as the <hi>Salamander</hi> in the fire, all his Preachings and Writings being full of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40378:11"/>He delights ſo to cavil, that he lets not paſs Mr. <hi>Dempſters Orthographick treſpaſſes,</hi> which ſhould have been at moſt imputed to his Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis or Scriviner. But, if Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> were as Orthodox as Orthographick, all were well. In his voyage to <hi>London</hi> to complement the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, he made himſelf Orthographick in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; but coming down an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he was far from an Orthodox mind, yet thinks to keep up ſome reputation amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, by his Imputations on Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No hope,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of prevailing with the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faction, whoſe Deſign as appears, is to keep up a ſtated Schiſm in Chriſtendom, they hinder the converſion of Jews and Infidels.</hi> Anſwer, No Sir, it is only the Hidra of Hereſy, and chiefly yours, divided in ſo many heads, keeps up Schiſm and Diviſion from the Church, and amongſt themſelves; which Monſter Jeſuits ſtrive to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, they, yea, one of them, called Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Xavier,</hi> hath converted more Infidels to the Chriſtian and Catholick Religion in ten years time, then all the Proteſtants in the World, for a hundred and fifty, if all Records of Hiſtory be more worthy of credit, then you. The converſion of Jews, Infidels, Hereticks as ever in old times, ſo conſtantly now, is a mark of the true Church, to which Hereticks can no wiſe pretend, whoſe buſineſs is to pervert Catholicks, rather then to convert Infidels, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> well remarks,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40378:12"/>
ſo that in all prudence, this he ſhould not have mentioned, his younger brethren the Janſeniſts, (of whom he borrows moſt of his Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſuits) ſpeak not of this, being no little aſhamed, when yearly the notable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſo many thouſand Infidels, only by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and other Prieſts in Communion with the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> come out, wherein neither they nor he have any hand.</p>
               <p>Next amongſt many controverted points ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the peace and unity of the Catholick Church, he ſets down firſt, <hi>the Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> as if the true Church were not infallible, both according to the Scripture and Fathers (as I ſhall, God willing, hereafter prove at length) or as if the Church being infallible, peace and unity could not be had.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Popes Univerſal Supremacy, as obſtructing Unity, forgetting what St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> ſayes, l. 1. in <hi>Jovin. That even amongſt the Apostels themſelves, one was made head, that the occaſion of Schiſm and Diviſion might be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Ut capite constituto Schiſmatis tolleretur oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio</hi>: Doth the Popes Supremacy in the whole Church hinder peace and unity, more then my Lord Archbiſhops Primacy in the Kingdom? Is not this a fling at Biſhops in their Dioceſſes, and the Primate in each Nation, to ſay their Supremacy over inferiour Paſtors, is a let and ſtop to Peace and Unity in the Church? So all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40378:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenanting Miniſters ſpeak with him, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they aim at being nothing but a Monopoly to ſet themſelves above Pope and Primate, upon the ruines of both Church and State.</p>
               <p>Are not theſe ſtrong and witty Objections, put in the Frontiſpiece of his Book, as in the Van? The reſt I proſecute not, they being the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry controverted Tenets betwixt Proteſtants and us, anſwered in every Pamplet of Controverſie; but the laſt is too remarkable to let it paſs: Nay, ſays he, <hi>Is it not one of the firſt Queries wherewith Jeſuites do aſſault our people, how do you know Scripture to be the word of God? As if they would have people rather turn Atheiſts, then remain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</hi> A very pretty Reply; ſhews not this his Anſwer, Jeſuits and others have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to move the Queſtion, to which ſo great a Divine can not better reply. Proteſtants call Scripture their ground of Faith, but can evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by no ſufficient Motive of Credibility, (ſtanding to their principles) this Book they call Scripture, is the true and Authentick Word of God, ſhould not Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> then have ſetled, cleared, and vindicated from all Objections and Cavils this his ground? but that could have diverted him from Impugning the Romiſh Faith: no it would have done more againſt it, then all his Calumnies of Idolatry; being more to the purpoſe, yea ended, (to the Proteſtants great advantage) all the preſent debate, but all Mr.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40378:13"/>
                  <hi>Menzeis</hi> can anſwer, is to call the queſtion Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical, and a demand proper to Infidels; as if good Chriſtians might not ask for Inſtruction, how they may prudently believe, and firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the grounds of their Religion and Faith. In fine, he ſays, <hi>Many Romaniſts have called for Reformation.</hi> Anſwer, true, and do as yet daily call for Reformation in Life and Manners, but not in matters of belief, none of them with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, preſuming to correct Gods Word, and reform the Doctrine of his Church, or to cenſure their Paſtors, and all the Ancient Fathers, with Phariſaical, and Puritanical pride. This way of calling for Reformation was proper to prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at their firſt riſe, for reforming the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Roman Church, and again in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for the reforming their own; They like Foxes indeed, (to uſe Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) did raiſe ſuch duſt (not to ſay worſe) with their tails and heads both, that ever ſince, the very air they breath is infected, and their eyes ſo blinded, that they cannot open them to ſee the manifeſt truth.</p>
               <p>After all this, fearing his Book may have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, he deſires <hi>all things then be noticed he hath ſaid.</hi> Anſwer, No, this his demand is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that at the time one only queſtion is in debate, and that a main one, concerning the Grounds of the Proteſtant Religion, any thing elſe ſhould be taken notice of, till this be put to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40378:13"/>
a cloſure. On this all the Proteſtant Religion depends; let their grounds be proved ſolid, and we have done; for by that we look not on his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions as Golden Apples, to make us run out of our way in the leaſt; they being ſcarce like to the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> (in his confuſed Rapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) that is pleaſant to the eye, though no leſs rotten in the heart, as who has beſt right to the Root and Tree, may juſtly claim the Branches and Fruit; ſo whoever proves he hath the true Grounds of Religion, may eaſily prove all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures on this ground to be true, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary followeth the principal; and this is the chief and principal queſtion amongſt us; let this be once decided in their favour, and we have no more proceſs with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he deſires <hi>nothing be brought has been anſwered by Protestants.</hi> Anſwer, if he had given example in this, he had never written a line: However, if any thing has been ſolidly anſwered, to what I bring againſt his great principle, of no Infallible viſible Judge of Controverſie, or both his grounds, as I moſt ſincerely proteſt, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did come to my hands, ſo let Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> ſend it me, and here an end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That perſonal Criminations be laid aſide.</hi> Anſwer, then theſe perſonal Criminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he calls Mr. <hi>Dempster a dull and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy-head, a Neat-herd, a man of a Prostitute reputation, a Knave, a Sycophant, a Devil,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40378:14"/>
have been blotted out of his Book. As Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons are not received for witneſſes, ſo Calumnies can be no wiſe ſooner refuted, then by ſhewing that he who calumniates has loſt all reputation and credit. If it were not ſoftly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, what a quick wit Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> is, who names Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> a dull and Lethargy-head: How learned a Paſtor, who calls him a Neat-herd; how famous, who challenges him to be of a proſtitute reputation; how honeſt, who calls him a Rogue and a Knave; how ſincere and ingenuous, who terms him a Sycophant: and how great a Saint, who compares him to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, his ſole authority in Print might perhaps endanger Mr. <hi>Dempsters</hi> good name, wherefore he muſt not take ill a little hath been ſaid of this, not for Criminations, but as Anſwers to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and notorious falſhoods; eſpecially his Apology being the greateſt of his wrongs, as if Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> had extorted them, he was forced to it, becauſe for ſooth, he can ſuffer no man to withſtand him, or not to be ſatisfied with what he brings: This is all the Injury we read in Mr. <hi>Dempſters</hi> papers, which can be no excuſe certainly to him, who eaſily foreſeeing what might be replyed, dare glory with <hi>Job, he takes injuries for a Crown,</hi> citing as a Heroick word in <hi>Luther, Indies magis mihi placeo, ſuperbus fio, quod video nomen peſſimum mihi creſcere. I pleaſe my ſelf more and more daily, yea I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40378:14"/>
proud, to ſee that I have got a very ill name, and that it grows upon me</hi>; which if true, his pleaſure may be great, and his pride too, for few of his coat after <hi>Luther</hi> have got a worſe name, for changes in Religion, Jars and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his brethren, diſobedience to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and diſloyalty to his Prince.</p>
               <p>Here preſently to ſet up his good name a little, he playes the Prophet, ſtriving to pry into Mr. <hi>Dempsters</hi> Intentions and thoughts, why he ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the points ſtated by him, and Inſtances only that he ſhould prove, there be two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and no more; but here the Spirit fails him in all his Divinations, the only reaſon of this being, for that all other controverted Tenets with Proteſtants are borrowed from divers old condemned Hereſies, and this only proper to them.</p>
               <p>However, Mr. <hi>Dempster ſhould have proved ſeven Sacraments.</hi> Anſwer, No, not this, or any thing elſe (in the preſent diſpute, as not to the purpoſe) ſave only, that Proteſtants for their Religion could ſhew no ſolid ground, this he ſticks to, this he inſiſts upon, and this only whileſt Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> like a Bird ever upon wing flies from branch to branch, a mark of no great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Solidity, either in Wit or Learning.</p>
               <p>But he will needs bring in the Romiſh Religion by the head and ſhoulders upon the Stage, and have Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> to <hi>decline it be tryed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40378:15"/>
and the Doctrine of the Church in the first three ages.</hi> Anſwer, The Romiſh Religion has no part in the preſent Scene, neither is Maſter <hi>Dempſter</hi> acting any thing directly in defence of it, but Impugning the Proteſtant grounds, and this Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> in his firſt anſwer clearly grants; his words are: <hi>The Theſis—then which we defend, and you impugne is this: The Protestant Religion is the true Religion</hi>; No mention here of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Roman Faith, and yet Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> in all his papers and Books ſpeaks very little for the Proteſtant Religion, but always againſt the Popiſh, laying aſide the Theſis which he ſets down himſelf, as his Text ſo often in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, to rail at random againſt us.</p>
               <p>And this with a like Sincerity and Candor, as when he ſays, <hi>Quakeriſm is but Popery under a diſguiſe.</hi> Anſwer, then moſt men miſtake it, thinking it ſo far from Popery under what ever diſguiſe, that it is nothing but <hi>Puritaniſm, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris naturalibus,</hi> and undiſguiſed. Is the private Spirit our Ground and Guide? Do we allow Laicks and Women to preach? or private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever, upon pretence of New Goſpel Light to reform the Church? This <hi>Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> in the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and again in the Covenant, did with them: Yea on the ſame very ground, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to <hi>the pure Word,</hi> and <hi>to the Spirit and Light within them,</hi> againſt all Authority in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40378:15"/>
Church and State; Is not this the <hi>Quakers</hi> chief Argument againſt Proteſtants, when they ask their Power and Call: <hi>We are come to Reform you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and all your Hirelings, even as you the Papists and Prieſts; We ground our ſelves on the pure and naked Word; the Spirit ſpeaketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; we regard not men; Church, Councels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have erred.</hi> Which Anſwer, Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> if conſtant to his own principles, with all his Needle-headed Nicities (as he ſpeaks) will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refute. In fine, he ſayes, <hi>Romaniſts boast his Papers ſhall have an Anſwer; theſe ſix Moneths might have done it; Our Reply will diſcover we apprehend ſome danger; &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer, Few Romaniſts do think his papers deſerve a Reply, yea, nor their pains to read them, as ſaying little to the purpoſe; much leſs do they eſteem the enterpriſe to anſwer them ſo high, as it ſhould be called a boaſt: He <hi>who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contends with us in ſolidity of reaſon, then celerity of diſpatch,</hi> will neverthleeſs have this expected anſwer ſix Moneths before his Book did appear, at which time he makes the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates command the Stationer under the higheſt pains, that he ſhould Print no Reply. Yet after his Book has been a twelve moneth under the Preſs at home, we may have a Book Printed at a ſtart abroad, neither is there ſuch haſt in replying for any danger we apprehend, his railings never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wronged Catholicks in the leaſt, but much
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40378:16"/>
Proteſiants, many whereof have turned <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> to hear Tub-preachers profeſſing greater Modeſty, Sincerity, yea, and Solidity in belief, then he; who by his frequent changes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, from <hi>Prelaticks</hi> to <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> from <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> to <hi>Independants,</hi> from <hi>Independants</hi> to I know not whom again, is more like the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercock on the Steeple (turning at every wind) then the Member of any one Church.</p>
               <p>His Exclamations wherewith he concludes his two long Epiſtles, are both ludibrious and childiſh, in miſapplying ſo many Scripture Phraſes to the Catholick Roman Church, whoſe Faith is ſo highly commended by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and holy Fathers in all Ages; who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amongſt them did tax her of Errour, flie her Communion, renounce her Faith, decline her Cenſures, queſtion her Authority, diſapprove her Doctrine, or chalenge the Supreme power and Headſhip of her Biſhop? In the ſecond age St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> extols her Authority; All Churches (ſays he, l. 3. c. 3.) <hi>round about ought to reſort to the Roman Church, by reaſon of her more powerful Principality.</hi> In the third, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. 55. <hi>calls her St.</hi> Peters <hi>Chair, and the principal Church, to which Infidelity or falſe Doctrine cannot have acceſs.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Queſtion is ſtated, as propounded by Mr. <hi>Dempſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Grounds ſet down as cleared by him; with the Deſign of the Author thereon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſole Argument that I find Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> urges in all his papers, in ſubſtance runs thus, in this one Syllogiſm.</p>
               <p>That Religion cannot be a true Religion, which hath no peculiar principle or ground to prove that it is a true Religion, and conform to the true ſenſe of the word of God.</p>
               <p>But the Proteſtant Religion hath no peculiar ground or principle to prove it ſelf the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then the Proteſtant Religion cannot be true.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> cavils at this Syllogiſm, as not being in form, both the premiſes being Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as well as the Concluſion. Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> Anſwers, the ſecond is Affirmative, and only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40378:17"/>
Negative: As if one ſhould ſay in Latin (wherein the form of Syllogiſms beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) <hi>Sed omnis Religio Proteſtantium eſt talis, ut nullum habeat peculiare fundamentum quo ſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet veram,</hi> or elſe, <hi>Eſt habens nullum peculiare fundamentum,</hi> &amp;c. which the leaſt Logician in the Colledge preſently ſees to be an Affirmative Propoſition: And yet what Clamours hath not Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> made for this? as if at the firſt bout he had diſarmed his Adverſary: So well this great Profeſſor of Divinity is verſed in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, that he cannot reſolve and anſwer a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, if not ſet down as to a Bajan: Like to that young man who lately come from the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-School, and hardly put to it, miſtaking the thruſt, is put off his Guard, and ſo both wounded and mocked.</p>
               <p>So the Syllogiſm ſtanding in good Form, the firſt Propoſition in it ſuffers no debate. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is denyed by Proteſtants, whereupon they are required to produce this peculiar Ground which proves their Religion to be true. Maſter <hi>Menzeis</hi> after many Wheelings, Turnings, and Windings in his Scoldings, Digreſſions, Retorſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at the end brings two grounds for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion. <hi>The firſt Scripture, and that clear in Fundamentals, or things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The ſecond, its agreement in Eſſentials, with the Faith of the purest and most ancient Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, in the firſt three Centuries or Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40378:18"/>To clear his firſt Ground (which in his ſixth paper he ſtorms to have called his <hi>Achilles</hi> or ſtrength, ſeeing he had given another, which it ſeems he holds no leſs ſtrong then it) he ſets down, <hi>That all Scriptures are not clear: Secondly, that Protestants do not exclude means of Interpretation.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>by perſpicuity, he understands in Terms, or by firm and clear conſequence.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>that by this perſpicuity again, he means an External and objective Evidence which is nothing impeached, by the miſunderſtanding of Hereticks or others.</hi> Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that by things neceſſary, is here underſtood, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary as means, or as commands.</hi> What he cites in his eight paper, as Maximes taken out of <hi>George Scholarius a Grecian,</hi> is but to the ſame purpoſe with what he hath formerly ſaid.</p>
               <p>One onely thing I add, which he urges moſt in all his Book, that though Proteſtants do not exclude means of Interpretation in explaining of Scripture, and in deducing conſequences from it, yet no neceſſity there is, that we ſhould know that he who gives the true Interpretation and Senſe, have the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe forſooth, <hi>this ſavours rankly</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of that Erroneous Popiſh Tenet, concerning the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an infallible viſible Judg of Controverſie:</hi> whereof he proves in his third paper there is none, for that a Juriſt without any ſuch Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſiſtance, may be known to explain aright
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40378:18"/>
a Municipal Law, and a Mathematician to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a Propoſition of Euclydes.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtate of the Queſtion, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Mr. <hi>Dempſter,</hi> and this in ſubſtance is Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Anſwer to it, their debate is long; Mr. <hi>Dempster</hi> conſtantly putting Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> to it, that he would prove theſe Grounds to be peculiar to Proteſtants, and ſupport their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Tenets with us; but this he ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to bring any Poſitive proof for either, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his adverſary ſhould rather Poſitively prove the contrary. No ſays Mr. <hi>Dempſter,</hi> make good your Aſſertion, as he who affirms ſhould prove; I will not be ſo put off of my <hi>medium,</hi> I have taken againſt you: Let us ſee the Grounds you build on in the ſence you take them, and without any Infallible viſible Judg of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, aſſuring you either of the uncorrupt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſincere Doctrine of the Fathers in the firſt three ages, or of the uncorrupt Letter, and genuine ſenſe of Scripture, firſt, to be ſolid and Infallible, and then to agree peculiarly to you, and the buſineſs is done. You confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert both; but what Sectary ſayes not the ſame? their claim to the foreſaid Grounds, ſay ye, is meerly pretended; reſts to ſee how your own is proved as juſt. Many Digreſſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions againſt Popery are made: Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writers ſpoken of who have done this, but nothing as either borrowed from them, or as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40378:19"/>
laid out by himſelf is brought in: Many paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Fathers are miſapplyed; Many Cavils, Criminations and Calumnies are objected: Many ſtrong words, as Logomachies, Vertigo's, —and Needle-headed Nicities, with Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from Poets are uſed; a great part of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Chilias</hi> ſpent in Proverbs: Much paper blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but what concluded? I ſhall not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe my judgment, as Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> publiſhes his victory, as Trumpet in the Triumph himſelf, leaving to each one to read and judge of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; adding only of him, what was ſaid of a Prolix and tedious Orator, who on little matter ſpent much time in many flouriſhes of words, and frequent Digreſſions. <hi>Nullum vidi qui magis operosè nihil diceret.

                  <p>This is indeed that great Principle Proteſtants did broach to themſelves in the beginning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and at their very firſt leaping out from the Church, they would admit of no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible viſible Judge, ſtand to no Sentence or Decree of Church, Councils, Fathers.

                  <p>I leave to the Phyſicians judgment, what foot of this Diſtemper and Madneſs had the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the Church, not only thinking and calling what ſhe practiſed Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but even judging and condemning her of Apoſtacy, Schiſm, and Hereſy, as Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> here of Arrogancy and Pride; <hi>Odi Eccleſiae illius faſtum, I hate ſays he that Churches Pride,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Catholick Roman Church, for calling her ſelf Infallible, but let me anſwer him as <hi>Plato Diogen.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> de bapt. contra do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. l. 1. c. 7. <hi>concludes, That no doubt ought to be made, of what is by full Decree eſtabliſht in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> Neither is Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Objection from him of any force, for when he ſpeaks, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de bapt. c.</hi> 3. of mending Councils by Councils upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experience, his words are, <hi>Cum aliquo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum experimento aperitur quod clauſum eſt, &amp; cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcitur quod latebat,</hi> clearly ſhewing he means not any Deciſion of Faith can be mended, which no experience can learn us, but Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone can teach.</p>
                  <p>Thus to ſhun prolixity in Citations, do not all the Fathers who were ever preſent at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Subſcribe their Canons and Decrees, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anathemas and Excommunications againſt all who oppoſe them in the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>I hear Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Reply to all this firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where is that Infallible Church the Scriptures and Fathers ſpeak of? Anſwer, That is not here
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40378:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the queſtion, but that there is one, which is contradictory to his great Principle, <hi>That there is no Infallible viſible Judge.</hi> Only I add the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church cannot be this, they ſpeak of, ſhe not being Infallible as themſelves confeſs, and conſequently cannot be the Church and Houſe of God, which the Apoſtle calls the Ground and Pillar of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How many Queſtions may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved touching the lawfulneſs of Councils, now the Fathers ſpeak not of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but only of lawful ones? Anſwer, a contentious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will queſtion any thing; but St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited, tells you of what is by full Decree eſtabliſht in a Council, no doubt or queſtion ought to be made. Whatever Proteſtants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> did not the <hi>Arians</hi> againſt the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council? <hi>Nolo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba quae non ſunt Scripta,</hi> that is, I will believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the written Word, which is but the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho repeating now, what was at firſt cryed out then.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God has obliged no man to hear Church or Council againſt his expreſs and clear Word. Anſwer, This is true, but is not the Church the moſt faithful Depoſitary of Gods Word, beſt Judge of what is clear, and beſt Interpreter of what is Obſcure? For no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſays St. <hi>Peter, Is of private Interpretation</hi>; and doth not Chriſt in his written Word moſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40378:25"/>
clearly and expreſly command us <hi>to hear his Church, if we will not be holden as Publicans and Heathens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, No Council can be general, where all are not called, and ſit with a deciſive voice. Anſwer, Should even Hereticks be called to, and have in Councils their deciſive voices? What agreement could this make in Points controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? why not <hi>Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> ſhould <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſit with Biſhops &amp; Prelaticks in Proteſtant Aſſemblies? what a pitiful ſhift is this? If ſo, let the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be renewed, Biſhops again thruſt out, and Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> ſet high, for yielding obedience to them, only through compulſion and fear of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his place.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Church her ſelf when fallen in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, cannot be Judge, being Criminal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of moſt hainous crimes, ſhe cannot be both Party and Judge. Anſwer, This Objection is all <hi>Utopian</hi> and <hi>Chymerical,</hi> if we hear the Scripture and Fathers aſſuring us ſhe cannot err: But giving, and not granting ſhe did; who then her Judge? When Subjects riſe againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, Citizens againſt their Magiſtrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Children againſt their Parents, leave they to be their Judges, becauſe arraigned by them? Even Hereticks, muſt ſubmit to the Sentence and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, when they fall at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with her; though they turn Unnatural,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40378:26"/>
ſhe cannot become a Stepmother to them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Infallibility in judging is proper to God. Anſwer, yes, none but God has it Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, and by Nature, but none I hope will deny, he may make the Paſtors of his Church, as well Infallible in teaching points of Faith, as his Prophets and Evangeliſts, in penning the Scripture Books, or at leaſt as any Proteſtant in reading and underſtanding them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. Anſwer, we take it not ſo, when we ſay the Catholick Roman Church, but for all Churches in Communion with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as all Countries under the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, are called the Roman Empire, and all people under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Jewiſh Church, though that name taken ſtrictly, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> becauſe the chief City appertained to that Tribe, where the High Biſhop reſided. So the Univerſal Church is called the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> by reaſon of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, her high Biſhops reſiding there, whence <hi>Rome</hi> is the Centre of Eccleſiaſtical Communion, infuſing unity in the whole diſperſed body, as the Form of Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Catholickſhip. Wherefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. ad Cornel. <hi>Calls her, Eccleſiam principalem unde unitas Sacerdotalis exorta est:</hi> That is, the Principal and chief Church, the Source and Centre of Unity amongſt the Prieſts of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40378:26"/>
all other Churches, and conſequently the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, But whereon Grounded this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority of the Church? Anſwer, On the clear places of Scripture and Fathers above cited; It is the Ground and Pillar of truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot err. It hath the promiſe of Gods Spirit to lead it into all truth, therefore cannot err. It is ſaid to be built on the Rock, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot err. Chriſt hath placed in it Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Doctors, Paſtors, and Biſhops to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and perfection of the whole body, that we be not carried away with every blaſt of new Doctrines, therefore it cannot err. It is the Houſe, the Spouſe, the Myſtick body of Chriſt, his Lot, Kingdom, and Inheritance in this world, therefore cannot err. On the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church the Fathers have received the Originals, Tranſlations, and Senſe of Scripture Books, yea ſome chief Points of Faith, not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, as perſons in the Trinity, Sacraments in the Church, keeping holy the Sunday, &amp;c. therefore cannot err. Chriſt has commanded, and that under pain of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to hear the Church in matters of Faith and Religion, therefore it cannot err. All are obliged to live in Communion with the Church, therefore cannot erre. The Church hath from Chriſt, and ever has exerciſed a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40378:27"/>
Power in all belonging to Faith and Worſhip, therefore cannot err. Chriſt hath ſealed conſtantly in all Ages her Doctrine with Wonders, and Miracles, therefore it cannot err: To conclude, if the Church and her Paſtors aſſembled in Councils miſtake clear Scripture, miſapply Scriptures, deceive, or be deceived, what particular man can either juſtly cenſure her, and them, or ſolidly Ground himſelf? <hi>Magna vis veritatis,</hi> great is the ſtrength of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and nothing more true then what is here holden out, that to admit with Mr. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> of no Infallible viſible Judge of Controverſie, is the only Fountain and Spring of all Diviſions, Schiſms, and Hereſies, to which this one Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Principle, opens ſo wide a Gate.</p>

upon other mens teſtimony and report, as that the Doctrine propounded to them to be believed, is ſet down in the Scripture or written Word at all.</hi> Whence followeth according to theſe learned Proteſtants, the ground of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be only the Scripture in the Original Languages, that is Greek, Hebrew and Syriack, which of a thouſand Proteſtants, 2. does not under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand: Where then muſt all other Proteſtants ground their faith (a very few number of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſts being excepted) ſhal they believe only Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, and on other mens report, as D. <hi>Baron</hi> will have them? But this is the Colliers Faith Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> jears, though I fear all his skill in Languages, often force him to turn a Collier himſelf: or ſhall they rely on Tranſlations which <hi>Chamiers</hi> after all diligence uſed, and Doctor <hi>Daniel</hi> with him, confeſs not to be the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Word of God, but in ſo far as they are known to agree with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Texts, and how few undoubtedly know this? Yea Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tranſlations of the Bible are ſo generally corrupt, that you ſhall find none that has not been challenged, even by moſt learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, for manifold corruptions, and that very groſs. To begin at <hi>Luther,</hi> let us hear <hi>Zuinglius</hi> of him, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Luther C. de Sacram. fol.</hi> 412. Where after detection of many corruptions in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he concludes thus, <hi>See how thy caſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in the eyes of all men thou art ſeen to be a

manifest and common corrupter of holy Scripture, which thing thou canſt never deny before any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how much are we aſhamed of thee, who hereto have esteemed thee beyond all meaſure, and now find thee to be ſuch a falſe fellow.</hi> Neither can <hi>Luther</hi> deny his corruptions himſelf, for in that place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where a man is ſaid to be juſtified by faith, he grants <hi>l. Contra Cochleum p.</hi> 408. <hi>he puts into the Text, the word, only, which the Apoſtle has not, Licet Paulus verbo, ſola non u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur qou ego uſus ſum</hi>; and is not this a main place Proteſtants uſe againſt us, ſo well are they grounded in Scripture.

concerning Chriſts deſcending into Hell, ſays, <hi>as for the</hi> Geneva <hi>Bibles, it is to be wiſhed that either they be purged from thoſe manifold Errours, which are both in the Text, and at the Margent, or elſe utterly prohibited.</hi> Now as to our own Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Engliſh, Mr. <hi>Bruges</hi> in his Apology, <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Says plainly, that the approved Proteſtant Tranſlation, hath many omiſſions, many additions, which ſometimes obſcure, ſometime pervert the ſenſe. And M. Carleil p.</hi> 116. <hi>remarkes that the Engliſh Proteſtants in many places detort the Scriptures from their right ſenſe, and ſhew themſelves to love darkneſs more then light, falſhood more then truth, they have corrupted and depraved the ſenſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the Truth, deceived the Ignorant, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the ſimple.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> a chief Linguiſt in <hi>England,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Lords of the Privy Council, deſireth them to procure ſpeedily a new Tranſlation, becauſe that which is now is full of Errours. And in his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of corruptions to the Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſaith, <hi>that their publick Tranſlation of Scriptures is ſuch, as it perverteth the Text of the Old Teſtament in four hundred forty eight places, and that it cauſeth millions of millions to reject the New Testament, and run to Eternal flames.</hi> How many divers and different Tranſlations in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> times? how often what was firſt at the Margent, hath been put in the Text? Now if Tranſlators of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40378:30"/>
Scripture in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> men furniſhed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helps, endued with ſo many gifts, ſo well verſed in the Hebrew, and Greek tongues, ſo guided by all the Rules Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> gives to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the right meaning and ſenſe of Holy Writ, have fallen into ſo many, and ſo groſs errours and Miſtakes, as to have <hi>depraved, detorted, wreſted, obſcured the Scripture and Word of God, ſo that it, as Tranſlated by them decieveth the Ignorant, ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſimple, perverteth the Text in ſo many places, as that it carrieth milions to Eternal Flames</hi>; What hope can any one have of meaner Talents with fewer helps, and leſs learning and knowledge, to attain by his own private reading of Scripture, the undoubted Truth, Steadineſs in faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a full and ſatisfactory ſolution of all doubts, or ſecurity of Salvation? and yet theſe very ſame ſo corrupt Tranſlations (as their own Ghoſpellers teſtifie) are read in Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in Pulpits, and put in the hand of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who underſtands neither Latine, Greek nor Hebrew, as his ſole ground of Faith; and Judg of controverſie, whereby he is made able to Judge, not only of Popiſh Errors, the Writings of the Fathers, and Decrees of Councils, but even of his own Paſtors Doctrine, his Churches Faith, and his Countries Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to come to the Originals; Shall they then onely be the Proteſtants Ground of Faith? If ſo, I ask Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> where we ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40378:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find them? Yea we are ſo far from having all the Originals, that it is doubted in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſome parts of Scripture were written. The purity of Originals is ſometimes called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and <hi>Calvin</hi> Inſt. l. 1. C. 13. <hi>Doth imagine even theſe the Fountains run not always clear.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enar. in Iſ. <hi>Cryes out on the Jews for cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Text, as well as Chriſt, and upon</hi> Gen. C. 24. <hi>Says again, he has often told many words there be in the Hebrew Text, which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews themſelves do not understand.</hi> And to ſay true, amongſt the Jews, the leaſt of their three Maſſoreſhe's (ſo they call the Book which contains the many corruptions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lections in the Hebrew Text) counts eight hundred places diſagreeing, ambiguous or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, neither do the moſt learned Rabbies agree in the Letter of Scripture: In Hebrew it ſelf, ſome reading according to the Points, or Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els put in by <hi>Rabbi Jacob,</hi> and ſome by theſe of <hi>Rabbi Aron,</hi> moſt different one from another; all the points being added to the Text, Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, and that by his profeſſed Enemies the Jews, long after the Vulgar Latine Tranſlation which was made before the Text, and Letter of Scripture was corrupt. But Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants take in alſo with theſe the corruptions of the Greek Text remarked in part by St. <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and others, ſays <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when the ancient Hereticks the <hi>Arians, Macedonians,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40378:31"/>
Nestorians,</hi> &amp;c. had corrupted and adulterated the Word of God, to ſupport their Errours, as Proteſtants at preſent in all their Tranſlations do. I know M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will tell me perhaps he hath ſeen both the Hebrew and the Greek Texts; well but who aſſures him they are not corrupt? Yes, but the Proteſtants have corrected them, and that according to the Authenticks, which never any Proteſtant did ſee. The moſt Learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Proteſtants have never ſeen the Original Scriptures which were firſt penned by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts; Copies are no leſs ſubject to faults in the Letter, then Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to miſtakes in the ſenſe. Yea, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that great &amp; famous Bible that is Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London</hi> (if not yet ended) in ſo many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, witneſſeth in the Preface they have ſet out, not ſo much as one Copy could be found they can aſſure to agree in all things with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal: their labour may be great in this vaſt Volume to correct the Copies they find defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but their Authority is not Infallible: In a word, no Infallible Authority is admitted by Proteſtants to judge either of the Letter or Senſe, <hi>For that ſavours rankly,</hi> ſays M. <hi>Menzeis of that Erroneous Popiſh Tenet, of an Infallible viſible Judge of Controverſie.</hi> And I Anſwer, to deny one in all theſe and ſuch like caſes ſavours rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a tottering, wavering, groundleſs Faith, moſt like to that of M. <hi>Menzeis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40378:31"/>I ſay yet further, if no Tranſlations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be a ground of Faith, as moſt learned Proteſtants grant, ſo neither any Original it would ſeem, without ſome Infallible Judg; for I muſt ever be ſure they are unccorrupted; and again all the defect in Tranſlations coming from the miſunderſtanding of Originals; I ask who dare ſay he underſtands them, better then they who have Tranſlated, and upon this, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reads, and conceives, ground his Religion and Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, before all this, if M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will prove it a ſolid Ground to rely on ſole Scripture, as the onely ground of Faith, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible viſible Judge, or aſſurance, that he who tells me this is the uncorrupted Letter, this the true and genuine Senſe, has the peculiar aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Ghoſt: I demand what Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Motive can prudently perſwade Proteſtants that the Word of God they rely on, was ever ſet down in Writing, or is extant at this day? Is it the teſtimony of Scripture calling it ſelf Gods Word, or the Innate Light of the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhowing it ſelf to be ſuch, to a well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Intellect and mind? If the firſt, do not <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Goſpels carry the ſame titles, with theſe of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark?</hi> If the ſecond, then the Fathers of the firſt three ages (whom M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> moſt owns) were not well diſpoſed perſons, who did not acknowledge ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40378:32"/>
Books of Scripture till the Authority of a Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> had declared them Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and much leſs <hi>Luther,</hi> that holy man, who rejecteth St. <hi>James</hi> Epiſtle with ſome others.</p>
               <p>As Proteſtants ground their Faith, ſay they, on Gods word, ſo <hi>Quakers</hi> on the Spirit: and we deny not but both be equally Infallible, if once known Infallibly to be the Spirit or Word of God. But we demand of each Sect, what Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible External Rule or Motive they give us, to know either Gods Word ſpeaking in Scripture, or Spirit in them? Both anſwer with M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis,</hi> they both ſhow themſelves to all who are well diſpoſed. But this clears not us, the well diſpoſed heart being only known to God; let all then be objectively true, (as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> ſayes his Religion is) which they both teach, (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is, what ever by Gods Word or Spirit is revealed) we only inſiſt to know Infallibly that God did reveal ſuch Doctrine as theirs, either by his Word or Spirit. For we receive now no Immediate Revelations, as the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did in old times, nor have we <hi>Evidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in atteſtante,</hi> as the Divines call it, that is any Evidence that it is God who ſpeaks; points of faith being only propounded to us by men, who either put the Scriptures in our hands to read, or teach us by word of mouth. The Proteſtants great Principle, let's own no man or Church as an Infallible Judge; yea M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> in his ſixth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40378:32"/>
paper, offers upon this to turn Papiſt, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance of the Propounder can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neceſſary: but never clears what other way we can be Infallibly aſſured that all which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do teach, was revealed by God. Unleſs it be in his third paper, where ſpeaking of the True and Genuine Senſe of Scripture, he tells us we may have it as from a Juriſt, the Explication of a Municipal Law, or from a Mathematitian, a demonſtration of Euclides. But what a weak Anſwer is this? Do any receive Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Authority as Points of Faith? Or is the aſſent I give to the Law ſo explained by a Juriſt Infallible? If Chriſt himſelf had not ſhown his Divinity by his Works and Wonders, he grants the Jews had committed no ſin in refuſing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live him: The Apoſtles Credentials were their Miracles, both did thus evidence the Infallible aſſiſtance they had of Gods Spirit to the World; and ſhall any man truſt M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> boldly aſſerting there is no neceſſity of any? was it not for this the power of Miracles was left in the Church, as the marks of her aſſiſtance, and ſeals of her Doctrine, with other Motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility? Notwithſtanding Proteſtants with M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will propound to us the Catalogue of Canonical Scripture Books, aſſure us of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Copies and Letter, enforce upon our Conſciences the ſenſe they give, whil'ſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently obtruding all this, they neither dare,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40378:33"/>
or do ſay, nor can evidence by any external mark or ſign, they have the particular aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit; As if all this were clear in it ſelf, with Mathematical Demonſtrations. But doth Scripture in our Bibles, ſhow it ſelf better to be the Word of God now, then when Chriſt was ſpeaking in perſon? Then an external Evidence, <hi>God did ſpeak by his Son,</hi> is acknowledged as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by him, and now ſhall any man reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſay, there is no neceſſity of any, when he ſpeaks by his ſervants and Church? however this prove efficacious and ſtrong for M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> converſion, it would ſeem to me more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any mans conviction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to claim to Scripture, yet ſo as they can no wiſe evidence they take it aright, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Proteſtants with all Hereticks, ſo no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Ground. When Sectaries claſh with Sectaries, is not all their babling out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? You ſhall ſee, ſays <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> c. 35. <hi>Hereticks ſo abound with Scripture, as they fly through all the Volumes of the holy Law, through Moſes, the Books of Kings, the Pſalmes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. read the works of</hi> Paulus Sam ſatenus, Priſcillian, Eunomius, <hi>&amp;c. you ſhall not find ae page which is not Coloured and painted out with the ſentences of Old and New Teſtament. Neſtorius</hi> to ſupport his Hereſie gloried (as <hi>Gennadius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth in his Catalogue) in the evidence of threeſcore Teſtimonies which he produced, as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40378:33"/>
the Covenant in three hundred, whereof ſcarce three any wiſe to the purpoſe. The <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Marcionists, Arians,</hi> will ſubmit to none but Scripture, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> witneſſeth of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhop in his firſt Bok a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Neither doth it avail M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> to ſay <hi>Scriptures are clear in terminis, or made clear by conferring of places, or ſhow themſelves clearly to a well diſpoſed mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for that though a place of Scripture be clear in it ſelf, yet when divers Sects take it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, a man may juſtly ſuſpect his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing ſo many of a contrary mind. So that it wanteth not difficulty to determine always what is abſolutely clear, there being many clear places as would ſeem, not to be taken in the clear and obvious ſenſe, as the paſſages Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did moſt build on, will preſently ſhew. As when <hi>Marcion</hi> deſpiſeth <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets upon Chriſts own clear words in S. <hi>John</hi> the 10. <hi>How many ſoever have come before me are Thieves and Robbers.</hi> The <hi>Manichees</hi> affirmed Chriſt to be the Sun, upon a like Scripture in St. <hi>John</hi> the 8. <hi>I am the light of the world.</hi> The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> taught no man could be put to death, no not by the lawful Authority of a Judge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear Scripture again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> &amp;c. The Devil citeth clear Scripture to Chriſt, and the Jews againſt his death, <hi>we have heard in the Law the Meſſias abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40378:34"/>Moreover many ſeeming Contradictions in Scripture, you ſhall find in <hi>Becan</hi> and others, one might think clear. And many things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved even by Proteſtants, which be not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture at all: as Perſons in the Trinity, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church, and the Command of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy the Sunday; the Scripture neither naming perſons, or telling what a perſon is, defining Sacraments (as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> doth) or ſetting down their number; abrogating the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath, or having for the Sunday any command. Many places of Scripture again are flatly againſt Proteſtants, and clear for us, as for the Real Preſence, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood, S.</hi> Matth. 26. <hi>For Juſtification not by Faith only,</hi> but alſo good works. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith only, S.</hi> James 2.24. For Traditions from the Apoſtles, beſides the written Word. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren ſtand faſt and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by Word, or our Epiſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. And ſuch like places ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in moſt Books of Controverſie, for all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Tenets, Proteſtants never being able to bring any one clear place of Scripture againſt any of our Tenets, not evidently miſtaken or confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly corrupted, as when they make S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, a man is juſtified by faith only; <hi>Luther</hi> above cited, granting he has put in the word <hi>only,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath not; or, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40378:34"/>
any Graven Image,</hi> in place of Idol, as is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the word <hi>Peſel</hi> in the Hebrew Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as to conferring of places, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the more obſcure, by theſe which are clear, did not <hi>Arius</hi> boaſt of this againſt the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> proving the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Nature of the Father and Son, out of theſe words in S. <hi>John</hi> the 10. <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> No, ſays the <hi>Arian,</hi> this place as obſcure to us, and paſſing the reach of Humane capacity, muſt be explained by this other more clear in St. <hi>John</hi> 17. where Chriſt prayes his Apoſtles, <hi>May be one with him, as he and his Father are one</hi>; that is in will and affection, and ſurely the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is clearer to us, and conſequently according to M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Rule, the <hi>Arian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie muſt prevail; neither will he ever be able ſtanding to his Rule, to anſwer an <hi>Arian</hi> Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler making this Objection, as Learned Writers remark. <hi>Eutyches</hi> conferring theſe two places, <hi>The Word was made fleſh, in S. John</hi> 1. and <hi>the water was made Wine, in S. John</hi> 2. fell in this deteſtable Blaſphemy, That the Humane Nature was changed into the Divine, as the Water was converted into Wine. And without all doubt again, the ſecond is the clearer place to us, the firſt, that two Natures ſhould be united in one Perſon, ſurpaſſing as the Divines teach, even the Natural capacity of Angels. <hi>Manicheus</hi> explains the ſame paſſage, <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40378:35"/>
and in ſhow, as Proteſtants, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and that by a clear place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. where it is ſaid, <hi>Christ took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> Moſt clear words as would ſeem in favour of this Hereſie, and ſuch that if Proteſtants could bring any, with as great a ſhow againſt the real preſence, all their Pulpits ſhould ſound with them till their hearers became deaf. But there be none in all the Scripture ſo clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the real preſence I ſay, as the words quoted have a ſeeming clearneſs againſt the real Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the four Evangeliſts, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking in ſo expreſs and formal words for the former, that the Fathers with St. <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> Hom. 6. have recourſe to the words for the real preſence as clearer, to prove, that giving in the Sacrament his body and blood, he muſt have taken the Nature of Man. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will have theſe words of S. <hi>John the</hi> 2. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ye this Temple, and in three dayes I ſhall raiſe it again,</hi> to be taken Litterally, and not Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; and upon this holds out a new Hereſie, that the Son of God did dwell only in his Holy Humanity as in a Temple. <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris</hi> reading in S. <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>no man hath aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, but he that deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> gain ſayes the Myſtery of Chriſts Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wil needs have his fleſh to have deſcended from Heaven, as his Manhood afterwards aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40378:35"/>
thither. And this Heretical Expoſition, they confirm by conferring the enſuing places in St. <hi>Paul to the Epheſians</hi> 4. <hi>He that deſcended, the ſame is alſo he who aſcended.</hi> And in the <hi>first to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths</hi> 15. <hi>The firſt man of Earth Earthly, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Man of Heaven Heavenly.</hi> A thouſand ſuch Errors in the greateſt Fundamentals of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have Hereticks drawn out of the clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Brooks of holy Writ, by the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and deceiving ſearch of weighing places; Why not Proteſtants with them? they ſail on the ſame Sea, and deep of Scriptures with them; they direct their courſe by the ſame Card of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring clearer and obſcurer places: the ſame Rule they apply to all the crooked lines of their Errors and Deviations. What can be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all this: M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Principle always ſtanding, <hi>No Infallible viſible Judg,</hi> but to have recourſe with him to the well diſpoſed mind, wherefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay this doth not yet ſatisfie to the Queſtion, no not with all the means of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> doth bring, it being as hidden, Intricate, Doubtful and Inſcrutable, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all theſe Conditions aright, as to find out certainly and infallibly the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without an Infallible Judge. Yea ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one uſes them aright, yet let us learn from no leſſer Proteſtant then Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> what certainty of the true ſenſe men can attain by

them: His words are ſo remarkable to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in a Diſcourſe of liberty in Propheſying, Sect. 4. that here I even ſet them down at length. Firſt then ſays he, <hi>Sometime the ſenſe is drawn forth by the Context, and Connexion of Parts. It is well when it can be ſo. But when there is two or three Antecedents and Subjects ſpoken of: What Man, or what Rule ſhall aſcertain me, that I make my Reference true, by drawing the Relation to ſuch an Antecedent, to which I have a mind to apply it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath not. Secondly, One other great pretence is, the conference of places, which is of ſo indefinite capacity, that if there be ambiguity of words, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſenſe, alteration of Circumſtances, or difference of Style amongst Divine Writers, then there is nothing which may be more abuſed by wilful people, or may more eaſily deceive the unwary, or that may more amuſe the moſt diligent obſerver. Thirdly, Oftentimes Scriptures are pretended to be expounded by a proportion and Analogy of reaſon, but it is with Reaſon as with mens taſts, When a man ſpeaks reaſon, it is but reaſon he ſhould be heard,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>yet becauſe it muſt be reaſon that muſt judg of reaſon, unleſs other mens underſtandings were of the ſame Air, the ſame Conſtitution and ability, they cannot be preſcribed unto by another mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>; eſpecially becauſe ſuch <hi>reaſonings as uſually are in Explication of particular places of Scripture depend upon minute Circumſtances and Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which it is ſo eaſy to be deceived, and ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40378:36"/>
hard to ſpeak Reaſon regularly and always, that it is the greater wonder, if we be not deceived. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Others pretend to Expound Scripture by Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Faith.</hi> This he ſays <hi>is but a Chimera, a thing in the Clouds, which varies like the right and left hand of a Pillar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fifthly, Conſulting of Originals, is thought a great matter to Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scriptures; but this is to ſmall purpoſe, for indeed it will expound the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and the</hi> Greek, <hi>and rectifie Tranſlations: But I know no man that ſays, that the Scriptures in</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi> Greek <hi>are eaſy, &amp; certain to be underſtood, and that they are hard in</hi> Latine <hi>and</hi> Engliſh. <hi>The difficulty is in the thing, however it be expreſſed, the leaſt in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> &amp;c. Then numb. 6. he ſaith in general, <hi>All theſe ways of Interpreting Scriptures, which of themſelves are good helps, are made either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or by our infirmities, ways of Intricating and Involving Scriptures in greater difficulty, becauſe men do not learn their Doctrines from Scripture, but come to the understanding of Scriptures, with precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and</hi> Idea's of <hi>Doctrines of their own, and then no wonder Scripture look like Pictures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every man in the room thinks they look on him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that whereſoever he ſtands, or how often ſoever he changes his Station. So that now what was intended for a remedy, becomes the Promoter of our Diſeaſe, and our Meat becomes the matter of ſickneſs: and the Miſchief is, the wit of man cannot find a remedy for it; For there is no Rule; no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40378:37"/>
no certain Principle by which all men may be guided to a certain, and ſo Infallible Interpretation, that he can with any Equity preſcribe to others to believe his Interpretations in places of Controverſie or ambiguity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oſiander <hi>in his confutations of the Book which</hi> Melancton <hi>wrote againſt him, obſerves there are twenty ſeveral Opinions concerning Juſtification, all drawn from the Scriptures, by the men only of the</hi> Auguſtan <hi>confeſſion. There are ſixteen ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning Original ſin; and as many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of the Sacraments as there are Sects of men that diſagree about them.</hi> Laſtly, He concludes <hi>Num.</hi> 8. <hi>ſince thoſe ordinary means of Expounding Scripture as ſearching the Originals, Conference of places, Parity of Reaſon, and Analogy of Faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible: He that is the wiſeſt, and by conſequence the likelyeſt to Expound truest in all probability of Reaſon, will be very far from confidence; becauſe every one of theſe, and many more are like ſo many degrees of Improbability and uncertainty, all depreſſing our certainty of finding out truth in ſuch Mysteries, and amidst ſo many Difficulties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remark well all this diſcourſe from ſo great a Proteſtant Doctor, finding no certainty of the true ſenſe of Scripture, by all the means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and reflect with all a little in how hard a condition Proteſtants ſtand, admitting no Infallible viſible Judge in Controverſy, but bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40378:37"/>
undertaking to decide all that which is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſole Scripture, Explained by ſuch fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means, and yet more fallible men. It is but a Labyrinth of windings and turnings to paſs from Scripture as clear in words, to conferring of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deducing conſequences, after Prayer u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and diligent ſearch made, with a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind, then to the inward motion, or the private Spirit, againſt which the Prophets and Apoſtles ſo generally exclaim, <hi>Ezekiel in his</hi> 13. <hi>Chapter, wo be to the fooliſh Prophets, who follow their own Spirit. S. Peter in his</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſtle Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>No Prophecy of Scripture is of Private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Neither is the queſtion here, what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly required in every private man to believe Scripture (but what is the external, viſible, and infallible Rule of Faith) for that is out of all doubt with us. Faith is a ſupernatural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed virtue, to which the pious motion in the will is no leſs requiſite, then the Supernatural light in the underſtanding to aſſent to what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God. But ſeeing neither this light nor pious motions as they are ſupernatural, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline only to believe a revealed truth, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt themſelves to be ſuch: Therefore many thouſands even well diſpoſed perſons, and who ſeek God in the ſincerity of their hearts, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſwade themſelves (till they be better inſtructed) they believe ſuch a thing as a reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth by God, which is a condemned Error
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40378:38"/>
by him. And this none can deny, who will not maliciouſly condemn a world of zealous Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, yea ſome even moſt learned and holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who with St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, have believed an Error for a reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, before it was clearly decided by the Church.</p>
               <p>However, whether it be this, or ſomething elſe M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> calls a well diſpoſed mind; others the Spirit, or the private ſpirit, the Spirit of the Righteous man, and ſo forth; I ſay, it cannot be either with the holy Scripture, or alone, the Rule of Faith, and Judg of Controverſie. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none without ſome Particular help can be Infallibly aſſured of this Interiour Motion, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or Spirit, whether it be Natural, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, from God or the Devil, the Spirit of Darknes or Light, now no man, as M. <hi>Field</hi> confeſſeth, L. 4. C. 7. <hi>Proveth any thing is, or may be doubted of, by that which is as much to be doubted of as it ſelf.</hi> 2. We are counſelled in the 2 Epiſtle of St. <hi>John Ch.</hi> 4. <hi>Not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits if they be of God</hi>: But if the Spirits muſt be brought to the Touchſtone of Trial, if they muſt be judged and approved by ſome other well known and undoubted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they are not the ſole Rule and Supreme Judg of Faith and Controverſy: Becauſe this Spirit is ſecret and hidden, our Faith publick and evidently credible; this Spirit particular, our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40378:38"/>
Faith Catholick or Univerſal; this Spirit the gift of every particular man, our Faith ſubject to no private cenſure. Wherefore M. <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccl. Pol. L. 1. Sect. 14. and <hi>Whitaker</hi> againſt <hi>Stapleton</hi> C. 2. C. 4. Ingeniouſly grant, that the outward Letter of Scripture, ſealed with the inward and private Spirit, is not a ſufficient Warrant for every particular man to receive or reject Scripture Books, but that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority of Gods Church, is neceſſarily required. Whence I ſay further with S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> l. Contr. Ep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fund. c. 5. <hi>That Authority which we obey and believe, teſtifying the Books of the holy Ghoſpel, the ſame muſt we believe, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this to be the ſence of the Ghoſpel, that</hi> is not the private Spirit, but the ſame Authority of the Church. Thirdly, This private Spirit is ſo far from being the Judge of controverſy upon any pretence of adhering to Scripture, either as clear in it ſelf, or explained by it, that inſtead of compounding debates and keeping unity (the chief Office of this Judg) it is the very Root of Diſſention, and Fountain of Hereſies and Schiſms, for as by experience we ſee it to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in divers perſons, ſo as the Bell to fools, it ſpeaketh as they fancy, it inclines as they are affected, it points out the Object according to the Colour which is in the eye; It is like a falſe light which makes the Aſpect of beſt and faireſt Figures vary; It is often a blind zeal, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40378:39"/>
Opinion, which hinders to ſee what is clear in Scripture, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> l. 3. de Doctr. C. 10. <hi>well Remarks, If the Prejudice,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of any Erroneous Opinion preoccupate the mind, whatſoever the Scripture hath to the contrary, men take it to be a Figurative Speech.</hi> So that it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth to every Sectary reading Scripture, his own Spectacles, in conferring places, his own Rule of proportions: His private Weights to ponder Reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his particular Forge to coine Opinions, his ſecret Touch-ſtone to try Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, his own Reed to meaſure the Temple, Sanctuary and Altar: Makes him his own high Prieſt, Paſtor, and Judg, ſetting up within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Supreme Judicatory, giving ever ſentence in his favour, and cenſuring all the world beſide; So that none ſtanding to this Rule, can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to the unity of the Church, and yet none can be accounted Hereticks, as the learned <hi>Suares,</hi> l. 1. de defi. fid. C. 11. moſt judiciouſly remarketh, if we take Scripture as men read, who think themſelves well diſpoſed, or Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it ſelf according to the Dictamen of the private Spirit, for ground, for who can ſwarve from Scripture as clear, according to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgment and Spirit, which he even eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Scripture therefore cannot be Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will have it. 1. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the ſentence of this Judg muſt breed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40378:39"/>
and Infallible aſſurance of all that can come in doubt, which Scripture cannot do. It being infallible indeed in it ſelf, but not to us, who may doubt if ſuch a Book be Canonical, ſuch a Copy conform to the Original, ſuch a Tranſlation Authentick, ſuch a place clear, ſuch a ſenſe genuine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Judge of Controverſie ought to give a clear ſentence, which the learned and unlearned may equally underſtand, and as the Law, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>is not for the just, but the unjuſt,</hi> ſo the Judg of Controverſie is not only for the well diſpoſed, but more in ſome manner for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and eſpecially the unlearned and unſtable, who according to St. <hi>Peter, Wrest the Scriptures to their own damnation</hi>; Yea the moſt learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Fathers, as S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> after much pains in the ſtudy of Scripture, as teſtifieth <hi>Ruffinus</hi> l. 11. Hiſt. C. 9. refuſe to interpret them, but according to the Rule and Uniform conſent of their Fore-fathers, not relying on all the means of Interpretation M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> preſcribes; and they had reaſon, the Scripture being the Book S. <hi>John</hi> deſcribeth <hi>to be claſped with ſeven Seals,</hi> Apoc. 5. v. 16. which Ezekiel <hi>termeth the enrolled volume, written within and without. S.</hi> Ambroſe Ep. 44. <hi>A Sea contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt profound Senſes of Prophetical Riddles. S.</hi> Auguſtine l. 2. de doctrina. Chriſt. C. 6. <hi>hard in the Stile, Diſcourſe, Places, as well as in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

and Matter:</hi> which makes him cry out, l. 12. Confeſſ. c. 14. <hi>O the wonderful depth of thy ſpeeches, O the wonderful depth</hi>; S. Hierome Ep. 13. C. 4. <hi>Says the Text of Scripture has a Shell to be broken, before that we can taſt the ſweetneſs of the Kernel:</hi> and Vincentius Lyrinenſis, C. 2. <hi>That all take not holy Scripture by reaſon of its deepneſs in one and the ſame ſenſe, but ſome interpret one way, ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo that there may ſeem to be picked out as many ſenſes as men; for</hi> Novatus <hi>doth Expound one way, and</hi> Sabellius <hi>another, otherwiſe</hi> Donatus, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> Photinus, Apollinaris, <hi>and other Hereticks with them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very neceſſary it is for the manifold turnings and by-wayes of Errors, that the Line of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Apoſtolical interpretation be levelled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Square of the Eccleſiaſtical and Catholick ſenſe,</hi> whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> de Praeſcript. gives this reaſon, <hi>for that the ſenſe adulterated, is alike pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous as the Stile corrupted.</hi> But what danger of this, ſays M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> if Scripture be clear, men cannot miſtake (if not wilfully blinded) what is ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Could not the Law-maker ſpeak as clear as the Judg?</hi> Anſwer, we have ſeen there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt in Scripture, but has been, and ſo may be miſtaken: Therefore the neceſſity of a Judge, however the Law ſpeak clear, has been acknowledged by the greateſt men, and beſt wits in the world; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt Book of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and fourth of his Politicks, And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Republick, prefers good Judges even to beſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40378:40"/>
Laws: Judges have been ever eſtabliſht by the Laws in all Nations, as by Scripture, in the Church of God; and the neceſſity of one to keep concord and unity, is partly grounded on the nature of moſt clear Words and Sentences, which may be taken according to the Letter or Senſe, Properly or Figuratively, Morally, or Myſtically, and ſo forth: Partly on the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinions, men commonly judging as they are affected, and diverſly of one and the ſame thing as their underſtandings, inclinations, or intereſts leads them. His Majeſties Secretary of State may write no doubt, as clear as the Lords of Council and Seſſion ſpeak, yet his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are directed to them in moſt buſineſſes of weight, leaſt others ſhould take them otherwiſe then written, or wreſt them to their own ends; even ſo is it of Scripture written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, and delivered to the Paſtors and Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>Whence Catholick Romans build their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon Scripture, not taken as they fancy, but Explained by Apoſtolical Tradition conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church, and the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, and if any doubt ariſe of both theſe, on the General Definition and Deciſion of the preſent Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Proteſtants, as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> holds out, ground their Faith on Scripture, which they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, or rather corrupted, as clear in it ſelf, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40378:41"/>
made clear by diligent reading and conferring of places with prayers, and (as they imagine) a well diſpoſed mind, that is a Prejudicate Opinion that their own Tenets are right.</p>
               <p>Now let any man judg, which of theſe two is moſt conform to Scripture it ſelf in both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the practice of the Church in all ages; to the conſent of Fathers above cited, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For firſt, This the Proteſtant way would ſeem vain, arrogant and preſumptuous, in ſo far as that a man who followeth it, muſt be ſo confident of himſelf, that if he fancy Scripture to be clear for ſuch a Tenet, were all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World in a contrary judgment, yea had all Chriſtians been ſo from the time of the Apoſtles, yet muſt he ſtand to his fancy grounded upon clear Scripture, as he thinks; So that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion can remove him from it, for that it is a point of his Faith, but for a man to be ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily reſolute in the ſenſe he hath found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by his private reading, is very preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I ſay, for wherein can he ground prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a ſtrong aſſent, as is required in Divine Faith, which ought to be above all can be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Shall it be on the clearneſs of the words? conference of places? on his skill in Tongues? on his weighing the precedent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent places? or on the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit given to him? If ſo, is it not intollerable pride and preſumption in any one man, to think
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40378:41"/>
that no other was ever ſo clear ſighted, or quick witted, to ſee and underſtand in Scripture what is clear? no other in ſuch a multitude of Doctors and Fathers, ſo well verſed in the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, ſo circumſpect to confer places, ſo exact to weigh Circumſtances, ſo acute to draw Conſequences, in fine, ſo well diſpoſed to find the Truth, ſo fervent in Prayer, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enlightned, directed, and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God? What is whymſical, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick, and Fooliſh, if this be not? wherefore Doctor <hi>Field</hi> aſhamed any ſhould think this to be Proteſtant Doctrine, ſays, <hi>None of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines teach the Scriptures to be ſo clear, that they may be certainly underſtood by reading and conferring of places. For the Rule of Faith ſays he, in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> 2. <hi>p. p.</hi> 12. <hi>is Doctrine deſcending by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the Apostles, according to which the Scriptures are to be Expounded.</hi> And in his fourth Book C. 14. <hi>The Rule of Faith is the conſenting judgment of them that went before us, the Rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot know the meaning of the things that are in Scriptures, for who ſhall be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, but he that is ſetled in theſe things which the Apoſtles preſuppoſed in their delivery of Scripture.</hi> Afterward in the 15. Chap. having ſaid, <hi>There is no queſtion but there be many obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in Scripture.</hi> And in the 18. Ch. having ſet down many ſenſes of Scriptures, in the 19. he writes thus, <hi>We confeſs that neither conference
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40378:42"/>
of places, nor conſideration of what followeth, or goes before, nor looking into Originals, are of any force, unleſs we find the things which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be understood and meant in the places inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to be conſonant to the Rule of Faith,</hi> (that is, Tradition conſerved in the Church) <hi>neither is there any of our Divines that ever taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> Where you ſee by Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis</hi> is diſcarded from being a Proteſtant Divine; the Scripture however clear, is declared to be no Rule or Ground of Faith, but according to the ſenſe of them that went before us; as all other means beſides Tradition in his 16. Ch. are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be but probable Conjectures, and not infallible grounds. And this moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, for what private man, as I have ſaid, can aſſure himſelf, that either the finding out the true ſenſe of Scripture, as to him, is tyed to the means of Interpretation M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> ſets down, or that he makes a right uſe of all theſe means? For as the ſame Dr. <hi>Field</hi> judiciouſly remarks, and ingenuouſly grants with S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> contra. Ep. Fundam. and de Util. cred. few men have leaſure, fewer ſtrength of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to examine the particular Controverſies, ſo many, and ſo intricate in theſe our dayes: and that the way to ſatisfie their Conſciences in this moſt important affair, is to find out the true Church, and reſt in her judgment. <hi>Ad ſapientiam, ſays</hi> S. Auguſtine, <hi>in Eccleſia Spirituales pauci per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40378:42"/>
caeteram vero turbam non intelligendi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacitas, ſed credendi ſimplicitas tutiſſimam facit</hi>; that is, <hi>few, even Spiritual ones in the Church at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to perfect knowledge, the reſt being made moſt ſure, not by their quickneſs in underſtanding, but by their ſimplicity in believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This the Proteſtants way is but a trifling loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of time, never having been found able to ſettle debates amongſt themſelves, as witneſs 60. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods holden in 60. years time, ſays <hi>Reſcius</hi> l. de <hi>Atheiſmo,</hi> in which all taking Scripture for their ground, without any Infallible Judge, did ſo little agree, that they parted not ſo much as good friends. <hi>Neque dantes dextras fraternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis aut humanitatis.</hi> How many Examples of this amongſt <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calvinists, Prelaticks,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and even in our confeſſions of Faith, and Covenant among our ſelves? I know M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Anſwer will be, their Diſſentions are not in Fundamentals, (of theſe I ſhall ſpeak pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in the next Section) only here I ask, why then ſo great cruelty, ſo much bloud, ſo many Excommunications and Curſes? If they did not think them ſo, who moved ſuch troubles, they were either moſt cruel, or mad, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> l. de praeſcr. moſt truly ſays, <hi>in Diſputing out of Texts of Scripture</hi> (that is as every man reads and underſtands) <hi>there is no other good got but either to make a man ſick or mad.</hi> It is not ſo in the Catholick Church, what ever M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis</hi>

ſays of Jeſuits and Dominicans, neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty having ever conteſted in any thing, that was once decided by the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Proteſtants way is Prepoſterous, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion being Eſtabliſhed before the Scriptures, and they only written to true believers, whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> preſcribing againſt all Hereticks, ſays, <hi>We do not admit them to diſpute from Scripture, till first they can ſhow who their Ancestors were; from whom, by whom, when and to whom, the form of Chriſtian Religion was delivered.</hi> Whereupon to conclude all this, I ask at M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular man amongſt Proteſtants infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſured by Scripture of what he believes? If ſo, why not then Catholicks, and all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? they receive the Scriptures with Proteſtants, yea Proteſtants only from them: their Churchmen read the Scriptures with as great diligence, they be in a far greater number, they have ten for one who have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouded it; they apply no leſs all the means for a right Interpretation, they ſtudy the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, confer Places, pray many hours both day and night, have no Wives, Children, or Family to divert them, moſt of them have renounced all pretence to Riches, Honours, and all Temporal Intereſts, wherewith they might be Byaſſed any wiſe in what they profeſs: The extraordinary and unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led pains they take in the moſt Barren,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40378:43"/>
Savage, and cruel nations of the Earth, for their converſion to Chriſtianity would ſeem ſufficient to evidence both the good diſpoſition of their minds, and the ſincere intention of their hearts, beyond the Preachers, of whatſoever Sect: Their manifold Writings witneſs enough the ſolidity and quickneſs of their wits; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Wonders and Mracles in latter ages, in all moſt Authentick Records of Hiſtory, would make believe they want not the aſſiſtance of the the Spirit, yea, and of the power of God; and yet that we ſhould think that they are blinded, Proteſtants ſee clear; they miſtake Scripture, Proteſtants take it aright; they are miſled by the Spirit of Errour, Proteſtants directed by the Spirit of Truth; what Reaſon, Proof, or Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for this? But why do Proteſtants pretend it is ſo? Forſooth chiefly, becauſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one high Biſhop in the whole Church, as Proteſtants a primate in each Kingdom, with the Negative voice to ſilence all private ſowers of Diſſention, and keep unity; becauſe they take the Canons and Rules of their Faith from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture explained in general Councils, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous conſent of the Church and Fathers, and not by private Reading; becauſe in a word they reverence Publick Authority eſtabliſht by God in his Church, above particular Opinions and Conceits. Why then ſhould Scripture be called a Ground to Proteſtants, who neither

did receive it from Chriſt and his Apoſtles (as all Hiſtorians, and Chronologues marking the riſe of Proteſtancy in <hi>Luther</hi> his dayes do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) nor have it uncorrupt, as their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and Ghoſpellers do acknowledge: Nor take it in the true ſenſe upon publick Authority, but as they fancy upon private Reading, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation againſt the Apoſtle? And not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Catholicks, who having received the Scriptures from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as the Word of God, left to his Church, which ſhe is bound to have an Eye to in all her Deciſions, Statutes, and Laws; ſo that none of them be Repugnant to it in the leaſt, neither by adding or pairing in Words or Senſe, but all fully conſonant and conform to both: In acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement whereof, in all her General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſhe placeth it above Pope, Prelates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who in all the ſearch they make into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Councels, Fathers, Schoolmen, Tradition or practice of the Church, intend nothing elſe (generally ſpeaking) then to find out by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence, the true ſenſe and meaning of what is taught us in General and Particular Terms in the Written Word.

               </argument>
               <p>LEt us come at laſt to the Fundamental Points of the Proteſtant Religion, which Mr. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis</hi> holds out to be clear in Scripture. Whereupon his Adverſary demands, what things he eſteems Fundamental? He Anſwers, to ask a Catalogue of Fundamentals, is to ask how to make a Coat to the Moon in all her chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And this his quick Reply he borrows, from a learned Divine, as he calls him, (Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is the man, as I conceive, for he has the ſame words, a meer Sceptick in Religion, and who takes away all certainty in Faith) and to ſay true, the Proteſtant Religion is ſo Obnoxious to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40378:45"/>
Reformations, Alterations, Innovations, that it is moſt fitly compared by him to the Moon in all her changes. Yea Proteſtants are of ſo different Opinions, even in what they call Fundamentals, that ſcarce two ſet down the ſame, <hi>Perkins</hi> in Cath. Reform. p. 407. <hi>and in his Expoſition of the Creed,</hi> p. 503. <hi>will have all Fundamentals included in the Apoſtles Creed.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40378:45"/>
there being, as matters now ſtand, as great neceſſity of believing thoſe Truths of Scripture, which are not Fundamental, as thoſe that are.</hi> And yet other Proteſtants with M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> harp upon nothing more then the Diſtinction of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals from not Fundamentals, as if thoſe were neceſſarily believed, theſe not. I know in other places of the ſame Treatiſe, this Author contradicts himſelf, which ſhews not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants diſagree in Fundamentals, one from another, but even the ſame man from himſelf; ſo well grounded they are in theſe their Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals and Grounds, wherein, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their monſtrous Diviſions, they vainly bragg to agree. But how can it be diſcerned, whether all Proteſtants, or a few agree in Fundamentals, unleſs it be preciſely known, what and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fundamentals there be? <hi>Potter,</hi> in fine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the number of Fundamentals beyond all his Brethren have ſaid; his words are, page 24. <hi>it is Fundamental to a Christians Faith, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his ſalvation, that he believe all revealed Truths of God, whereof he may be convinced they are of God.</hi> And doth not this diverſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions equal the changes of the Moon? Or is not all this a moſt clear and manifeſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, however Scripture be clear in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals (which now I do not diſpute) at leaſt it is not ſo even to the Learnedſt and moſt ſharp ſighted Proteſtants, who ſo little agree in that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40378:46"/>
Point, that ſcarce two are of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Mind. If others did thus miſtake what is perſpicuous in Scripture, Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> would preſently tell us, no wonder they do ſo, by reaſon of their evil diſpoſed intellect. But that Proteſtants, and theſe not of the Vulgar ſort, but even the Pillars of their Religion, and Defenders of their Faith, by Volumes in Print, ſhould not ſee what in Scripture is moſt clear, but ſo vary and divide in ſuch a multiplicity of Opinions, and yet maintain Scripture in theſe ſame things, wehrein they ſo vary, is clear, what a wonderful thing is this? Or who I pray you, can truſt men, both at once ſaying Scripture is clear in Fundamentals, and yet ſetting down the ſame Fundamentals diverſly? By this plainly confeſſing either their own blindneſs, and ſo that they are not good Guides, nor to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when they ſpeak of what in Scripture is clear, or elſe that their Doctrine in this is falſe.</p>
               <p>What M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> holds Fundamental, ſo great a ſecret it is, that neither will he tell us himſelf, nor can any other know it, he having ſo often changed Houſe, and built upon diverſe Grounds. Yet that he ſhould not ſeem to ſay nothing, a mark he gives us, to know what in Scripture is Fundamental, to wit, <hi>if we find it commanded to be believed by all, or a Character of neceſſity to be put upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40378:46"/>Whereupon I reflect firſt M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Doctrine is here very Incoherent, for both he teaches, it is commanded in Scripture all men believe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, as things abſolutely neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and nevertheleſs the Catalogue of theſe ſame things, he will have impoſſible, as a Coat to the Moon. Would not this argue he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant himſelf, of what all ſhould know and believe? Otherwiſe ſurely, he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have judged this Catalogue impoſſible, it being eaſie to a man to call to memory what he knows, yea we know no more then we can call to memory, ſays the Roman Orator, <hi>Tantum ſcimus, quantum memoriâ tenemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I reflect, that rejecting the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority of the Church, teaching every particular perſon what is Fundamental, and what we muſt neceſſarily know, and explicitely believe to attain ſalvation; &amp; pretending all this is clear, and may be found, by the marks he has given in Scripture; he remaines obliged to a very hard task. 1. To prove in General, from evident and clear Scripture, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed are clear and evident in Scripture. Let him anſwer then, Firſt where he reads this, and to the Fathers teaching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as we ſhall ſee below. 2. To prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fundamental Point in particular immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and clearly from Scripture: And this ſo, that the words cannot be taken obviouſly and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40378:47"/>
in any other ſenſe. For if they can be ſo taken, then I have no Infallible Evidence but they ſhould be ſo taken, without ſome Infallible Guide, telling me they ſhould not be ſo taken in the place alledged. As for example, theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> undoubtedly may at leaſt ſignifie, and that moſt Obviouſly and Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, that Chriſts Body is really in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as when I ſay, this is a piece of Gold, this a piece of Silver, theſe words litterally ſignifie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gold and Silver: Wherefore, if I will take the words Figuratively, as clearly ſo ſpoken in Scripture, ſome other place of Scripture muſt be brought, or ſome other Infallible Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, telling me this in expreſs words, otherwiſe I cannot have that certainty of it, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Divine Faith. 3. Amongſt all the clear places in Scripture, to pick out the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ones, how hard is it for every one? Not to ſay Morally impoſſible, M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf granting he cannot do it, more then make a Coat to the Moon. For by this means all ſhould be obliged to know all Texts of Scripture, and then to examine diligently each one, firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be evident or obſcure, leaſt it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon examination to be evident, which at the firſt ſight did not ſeem ſo. And ſecondly, Whether it be generally commanded, and have a Character of neceſſity to be believed by all, for then according to M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Rule, I know
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40378:47"/>
it to be a Fundamental, but <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> his learned Divine, tells him a little above, <hi>to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh what was written becauſe it was profitable, from what was written, becauſe neceſſary, is an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate piece of buſineſs.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. C. 6. V. requires no more as neceſſary (as would ſeem) then that he who cometh to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him. S. <hi>John</hi> 3. Ch. 6. ſays, he that believeth in the Son, hath everlaſting life; the Prophet <hi>Royal,</hi> that all who fear the Lord are bleſſed; and many other ſuch paſſages there be in Scripture, which might make a <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n think one thing or two at moſt were neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as ſometimes the believing of one Point, ſometimes the doing of one good action; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is promiſed to Prayer in one place, full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to Alms deeds in another, &amp;c. and yet who will ſay either of theſe two is ſufficient for working a mans Salvation? Add to all this, I find in Scripture, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments, S. Matth.</hi> 19. Yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teach that to be impoſſible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenly this Fundamental muſt lead all to deſpair, as that other make all to preſume; it being a Fundamental again amongſt Proteſtants, that every man ſhould believe he is one of the Elect, which being an Article of his Faith, may reaſonably ſecure him, and yet all not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this number, ſome from this Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40378:48"/>
muſt or ſhould at leaſt preſumptuouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye. Further the eating of blood and ſtrangled meat, is generally forbidden by the Apoſtles, to all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted to the Chriſtian Faith, as it was before to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whence I infer; what is generally commanded to all, ſhould generally be believed by all; and ſo if M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Rule be good, this muſt come in amongſt the Fundamentals of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which if it be ſo in the Pulpit I know not, but at Table I am ſure it is not. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch abſurdities follow, upon ſeeking Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals in Scripture, by theſe deceiving ſignes and uncertain marks M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> gives us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Infallible Guide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be remarked, that Proteſtants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree in ſetting down Fundamentals, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a preciſe Catalogue of Points of Faith, they think to be Fundamental, as was required of M. <hi>Menzies</hi>; but that alſo they miſtake the very Notion and name: A Fundamental verity in the Chriſtian Religion, being either that which makes us believe all the reſt, or without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs knowledge and belief whereof, none can be ſaved. Now the Queſtion amongſt us, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this; but whether a Man may either ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his aſſent, or poſitively diſſent, from leſſer things then theſe, when they are revealed by God, and propounded to him by the ſame Authority with the former. For then ſay Catholicks he is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40378:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
equally obliged to believe them, by reaſon of the form<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Object, which is Divine Revelation, &amp; can in nothing deceive, or ſhould in any thing be ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lled in queſtion, though in reſpect of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Object or thing revealed, we be not ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to know it. For there is nothing leſs or more certain when God ſpeaks, he being the firſt verity, yea verity it ſelf, who delivers all he ſays with one and the ſame Infinite Certainty, where no degrees, of more or leſs certitude can have place.</p>
               <p>Proteſtants it would ſeem, as they take Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, will not be tyed to this, whence they receive in communion with them, and as the true Members of their Church, ſome who hold moſt contrary Tenets, as M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes, Wickliffians, Huſſiſts,</hi> who in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Paper grants <hi>the whole body of the Church collectively taken, cannot err in Eſſentials or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, yet ſo as that in ſome whole ages the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals may be vitiated.</hi> But if he underſtand by Integrals leſſer Points of Faith, as to their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Matter, yet equally revealed by God, and propounded by his Church to us, with chief Myſteries, (wherein the Proteſtants miſtake, and Errour in their Diſtinction of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Integrals conſiſts) his Aſſertion is both Erroneous &amp; Heretical, becauſe an Act of Faith grounded on the Motive of Gods Infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Veracity in revealing, is a Vertual and Implicite Belief of all he has revealed, ſo that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40378:49"/>
the true Belief of one Article, implyes a belief of all. Wherefore S. <hi>Athanaſius ſays in his Creed, whoſoever doth not hold the Catholick Faith whole and inviolate, he ſhall periſh for ever. And S. Hierome l.</hi> 3. <hi>contr. Ruff. for one word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith, many Hereticks have been caſt out of the Church. Yea, S. Gregory Naz. tract. de fide, ſays, nothing can be more dangerous then thoſe Hereticks, who when they run through all things uprightly, yet with one word, as with a drop of poyſon corrupts the true and ſincere Faith of our Lord, and of Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi> S. <hi>Baſil</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reports l. 4. Hiſt. c. 6. being deſired to relent a little to the time, Anſwered, <hi>That ſuch as were inſtructed in the Divine Doctrine, do not ſuffer any Syllable to be corrupt, but for its defence if need require, willingly imbrace any kind of death.</hi> And the Church in her Publick Decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils ſtrikes with the Thunder bolt of Gods Curſe and Excommunication all ſuch as refuſe to believe any one Point decided to be of Faith; which ſhe could not juſtly do, if every Article ſhe declares were not neceſſarily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when known to be decided by her. So doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> Excommunicate all who hold any thing contrary to the 39. Articles, though they judg them not all Fundamental. As the <hi>Athenians</hi> puniſhed without remiſſion the leaſt word againſt the received opinion of their Gods, and the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſays <hi>Joſeph contra Appion.)</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:40378:49"/>
the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the Law. So God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he ſhall be blotted out of the Book of Life, who ever ſhall deminiſh any word of the Revelation, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 19. Yet <hi>Luther</hi> reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole Epiſtles of Scripture, in M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Book is called a holy man; but ſo ſpeaketh not <hi>Luther</hi> of him denying the Real Preſence, who in his Book againſt the Sacramentarians, ſays plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>They believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt in vain, all theſe things avail them nothing, for as much as they deny, this Article of the Real Preſence, and attach him of falſhood, who ſaid of the Sacrament, This is my Body.</hi> And he had reaſon, for St. <hi>Thomas</hi> 2.2. q. 5. a 3. with other Divines teach he has no Spiritual Faith, who believeth not every thing little or great, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental or not, Propoſed to him by the ſame Authority. Whereupon they infer, that no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary upon his own choice adhering to this or that, believeth any thing. So <hi>Tertullian,</hi> l. de praeſc. <hi>ſpeaking</hi> againſt <hi>Valentine,</hi> ſays, <hi>ſome things of the Law and Prophets he approveth, ſome things not, that is, difalloweth all, whil'ſt he diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From all this appeareth, how idlely this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of fundamntals, &amp; not fundamentals in the Proteſtans ſenſe was brought in by them, it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to no other purpoſe, then to palliate their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions at preſent, &amp; deceive Ignorants in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſucceſſion, they claim to in old condemn'd

how conſtant a Proteſtant M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> is, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Doctors and Doctrine, and what Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit again he deſerves, after ſo many clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and that even of learned Proteſtants, and the very writings of the perſons in queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing him of moſt notorious falſhood and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

               <p n="4">4. As to that he ſays all Fundamentals are clear in Scripture, and that according to S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of

                  <hi>Aquine,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> holding what ever is obſcure in one place, to be clear in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I anſwer, very eaſily with a manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, 1. To ſuch eminent Doctors of the Church, as he cites, moſt Scriptures are clear I grant, to all indifferently I deny. 2. To ſuch as take the places of Scripture commanding us to hear the Church; and hold faſt the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apoſtles conſerved in her, as two main Fundamentals, for clearing all the reſt, I grant, to others I deny. 3. With <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> c. 2. to ſuch as level the Line of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Apoſtolical interpretation, to the ſquare of the Eccleſiaſtical and Catholick ſenſe I grant, to others I deny. 4.

Neither are theſe my Diſtinctions any wiſe to ſhift the Argument, which maketh nothing either againſt us, or for him. But to clear the Fathers words in the very genuine ſenſe they ſpeak them. See S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> his meaning in his 14. Hom. on S. <hi>John.</hi> S. <hi>Augustines</hi> contra Creſconium. C. 33. where he ſays, if any one fear to be deceived in this queſtion, through its obſcurity, let him ask Councel of the Church, which the holy Scriptures do demonſrate without any ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That of <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> in his 2. Book Ch. 47.

and more expreſly in his 1. Book Ch. 49.

               <p n="5">5. But I would ask M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> did ever any of theſe Fathers receive the Scriptures as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Word of God, otherwiſe then on the Churches Authority? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaying, <hi>I would not believe the Scriptures, if the Authority of the Church did not move me to it,</hi> is no leſs clear for this, then Scripture it ſelf in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals. Or did ever any of them fancy to himſelf a place of Scripture, as clear for any thing, the whole Church ſtanding in a contrary Judgment? For this is the only Point we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with Proteſtants, and clearly prove both by the Scriptures and Fathers againſt them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. However Scripture be clear in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, in the ſenſe I have given, that is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in as many words, or generally, and as commanding us to hear the Church, yet ſurely it doth not ſet down all that is Fundamental in expreſs terms, if we truſt the Fathers, whom M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> appeals to, as holding Scripture
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40378:54"/>
clear in Fundamentals; or can all be ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from ſcripture, but by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, that Hereticks be ſilenced, and Unity preſerved in Faith. S. <hi>Chryſostome on</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>ſays it is evident that the Apoſtles did not deliver all things by Writing, but many things without, and thoſe be as worthy of credit as others.</hi> Which he could not have ſaid, if Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals were only the infallible Truths, and they clearly revealed in Scripture. S. <hi>Epiphanius, Hereſ.</hi> 61. <hi>we must uſe Traditions, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have not all things</hi>; yet no neceſſity of uſing Traditions, if all Fundamentals were in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they only being neceſſary according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. S. <hi>Auguſtine l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Bapt. Contr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.

What if a man ſhould receive the New Teſtament as ſufficiently containing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and reject the Old with the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees?</hi> admit of ſome of the Evangels, but not

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. How many Scriptures are clear againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in all controverted Tenets? So that however it be clear in Fundamentals, it clearly ſpeaketh againſt them. See for this the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the Reformed Goſpel; with the Manual of Controverſie, and after you have pondered the places quoted in them, judge whether the Proteſtant Religion be rightly defined by M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis, The Chriſtian Religion as contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their proteſtancy, only their proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popiſh Errours.</hi> Which Definition if good, having its <hi>Genus proximum &amp; differentiam ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi> ſhould diſtinguiſh Proteſtants from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sectaries; but this it doth not, it being common to them with moſt Hereticks, who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40378:55"/>
have ever been: all of them profeſſing with you Sir, to adhere to the written Word they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and as underſtood by themſelves, as the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Pelagians, Photinians,</hi> &amp;c. and all proteſting againſt the Churches Errours, and Popes Authority. For as the ſole Roman Church did ever oppoſe all Hereticks, as the only zealous Defender of the true Faith and Doctrine, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to her; So all generally how ſoon they turn Hereticks, Proteſt, prattle, Preach chieflly againſt her; turn over all the Writings of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, who have made mention of Hereſies, and you ſhall find that all from the firſt to the laſt have oppoſed themſelves to that company of Chriſtians, which was in communion with the Pope and Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the time; and that this company hath oppoſed it ſelf to them all, neither did they oppoſe themſelves all to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company whatſoever. Yea this was ever the diſtinctive mark of Hereticks, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Pope and Sea of <hi>Rome</hi>; as may be ſeen in the Writings of the Fathers. St. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 3. S. <hi>Hierome Ep.</hi> 57. S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Cornelius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine in Pſ. Contr. part.

It is very plauſible I muſt confeſs to poor Ignorants, when Preachers make them believe they teach nothing, ſave only the pure Scripture and written Word, proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all unwritten Traditions as Popiſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. But if any man conſider a little with himſelf your Tenets in particular, he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find, it is openly againſt God, and his written Word ye proteſt, in all points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, under the falſe pretence of proteſting againſt Popery; and that not ſo much as one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net peculiar to you is contained in Scripture. This I evidence in moſt Articles of Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine you proteſt againſt, where all may ſee and judge how well your Religion is contained in Scripture.</p>

And yet ſo impudently bold is this ſpirit of Hereſie, as to dare ſay, that that is contained in Scripture, which Scripture moſt evidently contradicts; that is only in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Popiſh Errours, which impugnes the very Fundamental, and moſt ſubſtantial Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Goſpel and Chriſtian Faith; that by the pure and uncorrupted word, it will reform the Church, when corrupting the Word, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Church as ſubject to failings and Errours in Religion, it ruinateth both Church and Word.</p>

                  <head>What has been ſaid in this, and the former Section, further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in two Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Points; The Real Preſence, and two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Proteſtant Religion is, The Chriſtian Religion as contained in Scripture: Sole Scripture is their Ground, and in it all Fundamentals are clear</hi>; Says M. <hi>Menzeis.</hi> How falſe all this is in general, doth evidently I hope appear, by what I have ſaid above. Here I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only further two particular Points, he handles at length, the better to make ſee the falſhood of his ſtrong and bold Aſſertions, in the weakneſs and nullity of his Proofs. And this firſt in his refuting one of our chief Tenets, <hi>viz.</hi> The Real Preſence, then in maintaining one of his own, to wit, That there are two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and no more.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40378:59"/>1. Then to prove Chriſts body is not really in the Sacrament, theſe moſt clear words, <hi>This is my body</hi>; muſt not, ſays he, be taken in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, but Figuratively: why ſo, doth the Scripture ſay this? no, no Scripture is brought. What then? a Philoſophical Demonſtration as he pretends. <hi>The word this, in the literal ſenſe is inexplicable, and the Propoſition implyeth a contradiction,</hi> ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why the Pronoun <hi>this</hi> inexplicable, becauſe <hi>let Romaniſts ſtrain their wits,</hi> Anſwers M. <hi>Menzeis; and ſqueeze their Authors, they cannot tell what it can ſignifie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bread, Body, or ſomething indeterminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Who would not laugh here to ſee Mr. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> a profeſſor of Divinity take ſuch a weak Argument for a Demonſtration? moſt like in this to a certain Romantick Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand call'd <hi>Don Quicſot,</hi> who imagining to himſelf a Windmil to be a Gyant, and then fighting with it, as with a Hector, he did both blunt his Sword, and batter his Reputation. For what, I pray you, doth the Pronone <hi>this</hi> ſignifie in any proportion, but Indeterminately, till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſome particular thing, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words. So that let a man ſay a hundred times <hi>this,</hi> he determines nothing but by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing words, as here <hi>This is my Body,</hi> makes a determinated ſenſe, the laſt words determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the firſt, which alone, and of it ſelf ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing determinately, and ſo to ſeek what it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40378:59"/>
ſignifies determinately alone, and before the other words be pronounced, is to quibble and ſpeak non-ſenſe, by ſeeking a determinate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under a word, which of its nature hath none. And this is the firſt part of his Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for eſtabliſhing, by a Logick Sophiſm, without any clear Scripture, a main Point of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of this Demonſtration is, <hi>That it implyes a manifest contradiction, a true Affirmative Propoſition, de praeſenti, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its Object.</hi> Why this, becauſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Nature wherein the Propoſition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd before its Object, as the cauſe before its Effect: the Propoſition ſhould be true as is ſuppoſed, and not true, becauſe the Object in that inſtant is not. The ſame Argument he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the inſtant of time wherein the <hi>Copula</hi> is pronounced, or Particle <hi>is,</hi> before the two laſt words. And for that Catholick Authours give many and diverſe Solutions of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Cuſtome is in the School, he will be ſatisfied with none. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Menzeis</hi> is good at Retortions, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort his Argument thus: Is not this a true Affirmative Propoſition, <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> which produces its Object in St. <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>This is my command, that ye love one another.</hi> Now what difficulty in the former Propoſition, either in the word <hi>this,</hi> or in the Inſtants of Nature
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40378:60"/>
and Time, or that a true affirmative Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on make its own Object, which is not here? do not theſe words make a new Command ſays Chriſt, as the former his body? what if M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis</hi> could have brought an Axiome of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy againſt the Real Preſence (as that Maxime, ſo commonly propounded and anſwered in the School, <hi>quae ſunt eadem cum uno tertio ſunt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem inter ſe</hi>) proving as would ſeem, that the three perſons being Identified, and the ſame thing with the Godhead and Divine Nature, cannot be really diſtinguiſhed one from another. Should a Chriſtian bely Chriſt, who is the firſt Verity, upon pretence he ſpeaketh againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon? who will ſo reaſon with God; let him hear S. <hi>Bernards</hi> moſt Excellent ſaying, Ep. 109. <hi>What is more againſt Reaſon, then that one ſhould strive to go beyond Reaſon by force of Reaſon.</hi> But true it is, no Myſtery of our Faith is againſt Reaſon, though ſome there be above the reach of Humane Weakneſs. Wherefore as the former Maxime, though much ſtronger, then what M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> here objects, is ſhown to have no repugnancy with the diſtinction of perſons by our Divines; So I eaſily anſwer him, the Propoſition is true in the inſtant of Nature, the Object being only extant in the inſtant of Time wherein the Propoſition is compleatly end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it affirmeth only its Object to be extant, in that inſtant of time, and not before.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40378:60"/>
In that inſtant of Nature, wherein the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion precedes its Object, it affirms indeed the Object to be, but not for that inſtant, as I ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this day what will be to morrow; <hi>In instanti naturae vera eſt propoſitio, ſed non pro inſtanti na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> ſay they in the School. But M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> Argument if ſolid, would prove againſt all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, there could be no Practick Knowledge, which hath no real Object, but what it makes to it ſelf; for that in ſuch conceptions of the mind, the act of the underſtanding is ever prior to the Object, as its cauſe; and ſo in that inſtant of priority (if his Objection have place) we ſhall have a knowledge of nothing, becauſe in it the Object is not. Yea it ſhould prove in all theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Let the Light be made, let the Firmament be made, young man I ſay unto thee riſe; I will, be thou healed,</hi> and in ſuch like, the Omnipotent Word of God not to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if the words did not produce what they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, as theſe other words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> So that M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> here, taking this his trifling, &amp; whimſical Sophiſm, for an unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhews not only his weakneſs both in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Grammar, but alſo manifeſtly that Hereticks contradict Chriſts moſt clear words, and the Authority of his Church upon moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant and frivolous objections. And upon ſuch trifling Sophiſms ſhall any Chriſtian refuſe to believe, what Chriſt hath taught in ſo expreſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40378:61"/>
terms? what the Evangeliſts have ſo accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in holy Writ: what the Fathers have confirmed in ſo many Volumes: what the Martyrs have ſubſcribed with their blood: what the Church doth teſtifie by her Paſtors and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: what God hath ſealed with ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Wonders; ſometime appearing in the Conſecrate Hoſt in form of a man; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (when it has been ſtabbed by Jews and Hereticks) making it guſh out in blood; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by its vertue, caſting out Devils, or quenching fire, as ſo many Authentick Records, both of Hiſtory and Fathers do witneſs. O bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impudence of Hereſie ſo to cavil at Chriſts own words, and yet proudly pretend, pure Scripture is its only Ground!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inſtance how M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> again, from Scripture clear in Fundamentals, proves that Fundamental Tenet of Proteſtants, yea their proper and only Tenet (all the reſt being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from old condemed Hereſies, as we have ſeen.) <hi>There be two Sacraments and no more.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a huge work in his laſt Paper, and a whole year ſpent, before the anſwer to this Query did appear, inſtead of clear Scripture (which he was only deſired to bring) he gives the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To clear the ſtate of the Queſtion, he ſays, <hi>know we do not affirm, that the word Sacrament is to be found in Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40378:61"/>2. <hi>We underſtand by a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, a Substantial Viſible Sign inſtituted by God, recorded in the Goſpel, to Seal up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Salvation, which is to endure in the Church to the end of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We do affirm in this ſenſe, there be only two proper Sacraments in the New Testament, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then coming to prove there be two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and two only; that there be two, he proves it thus, <hi>to Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, agree all the parts of the foreſaid Deſcription, for you have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Divine Inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing with water,</hi>, Mat. 28.19. <hi>and of the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25. <hi>That they are Seals of the promiſes of Salvation is no leſs clear: And firſt of Baptiſm,</hi> Act. 2.38, 39. <hi>and alſo of the Lords Supper, in ſo much that the Cup is called the New Teſtament, which you muſt acknowledge to be no proper ſpeech, but it is only ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is, ſigillum foederis; hence alſo in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, mention is made of the remiſſion of ſins, and of the giving of the Body of Chriſt, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood for us, holding forth that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and all other bleſſings, purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt, and promiſed in the new Covenant; are by this Ordinance ſealed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. And that theſe Ordinances are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the word, is no leſs manifeſt from</hi> Matt. 28.20. <hi>and</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. In fine, he proves
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40378:62"/>
there be only two Sacraments, <hi>by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more cannot be produced out of Scripture, as ſhall be proved, ſolutione objectionum er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now to reflect how judiciouſly, and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> here proves from Scripture there be two Sacraments, and two only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth not affirm the Word Sacrament to be in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of all the Definition or Deſcription he brings, not ſo much as one Particle is affirmed in Scripture to be Eſſential to a Sacrament: (I do not diſpute at preſent how much of it is true in it ſelf, or granted by us) I only deſire it may be made clear from Scripture, as clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all Fundamentals of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is the only thing in queſtion. But nothing is proved by him, ſave only that Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper are of Divine Inſtitution, as many other things be, which are not Sacraments. To prove they are Seals of the promiſes of Salvation, he cites for Baptiſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.28, 29. The words omitted by him, I hear ſet down. <hi>But Peter ſaid to them, do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and be every one of you Baptized in the name of Jeſus Christ for remiſſion of your ſins, and you ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt: for to you is the promiſe, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomſoever the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> No word here Baptiſm is a Seal
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40378:62"/>
of the promiſes of Salvation. It is ſaid indeed to be given for the Remiſſion of ſins, and that to whom it is given, they receive the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which both Proteſtants deny; maintaining there is no virtue in Baptiſm to confer either of theſe Effects. It is ſaid further, that to the Jews and their children, yea to all that God ſhall call, promiſe is made, but that Baptiſm is a Seal of the promiſe of Salvation, neither the Text, nor any conſequence he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it doth evince it.</p>
                  <p>The way he proves from Scripture, the Lords Supper to be a Seal of the promiſes of Salvation, is rare; for that ſays he, <hi>it is called the New Teſtament, which we muſt acknowledge to be no proper Speech, but to be only ſo called, becauſe it is, Sigillum foederis.</hi> This is his Commentary on the Text; but what a neceſſary and clear conſequence is this? If ever ſuch a conſequence as clearly deduced from Scripture was heard of, I leave it to the Reader to Judg; So clearly are the Sacraments, and main Fundamentals of the Proteſtant Religion, contained in Scripture, or clearly deduced from it.</p>
                  <p>But M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> thought it (as it ſeems by his ſo long a digreſſion in his laſt paper) a more eaſie task to impugne our Sacraments (though no part of the preſent work) then to prove his own. <hi>No Scripture, Councils, or Fathers hold out ſeven Sacraments.</hi> Anſwer, yes Sir, both
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40378:63"/>
Scripture, Councels, Fathers do; not as bare ſigns with you, but as viſible or ſenſible ſigns of the inviſible grace they produce in the Soul, as inſtituted by Chriſt our Lord, for our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. In this ſenſe, there be ſeven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet down in the Goſpel, Decreed by Counc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls, approved by the Fathers. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Fathers did ſo underſtand a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is confeſſed by Proteſtants, who even dare cenſure the Fathers for this: As <hi>Muſculus</hi> loc. comm. p. 299. did S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiderately, that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament give ſalvation; <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> Tom. 2. de Bapt. fol. 70. All the Antient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for ſuppoſing the water of Baptiſm to purge ſin. The Century Writers, Cent. 2. C. 4. Col. 47. In particular cenſures, S. <hi>Clement</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Apoſtles, and <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> for thinking Regeneration not only to be ſignified, but wrought by Baptiſm: and in the 3. Cent. C. 4. S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for teaching that the perſon Baptizing doth give Sanctity, and the Holy Ghoſt, to the Baptized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That ſuch a number of viſible or ſenſible ſigns inſtituted by Chriſt, for conferring grace, and taking away ſin, is ſet down in Scripture, is clear from the following Texts.</p>
                  <p>For Baptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Be every one of you baptized for the Remiſſion of Sins. Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.

                  <p>For extream Unction, S. <hi>James</hi> 8.14. <hi>If any be ſick, let him bring in the Prieſts of the Church, and let them pray over him, anoyling him with Oyl, in the name of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if he be in ſins, they ſhall be remitted him.

                  </p>
                  <p>In all which places of Scripture we have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the External Sign, either called a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40378:64"/>
or to it annexed the forgiving of ſins, or conferring of Life and Grace, which makes it a Sacrament of the New Law. So that there is no lurking here under ambiguity of words, as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will have it. However Hereticks vary in explaining Scripture, the Word of God doth not vary, nor his Church in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

Baptiſm by reaſon of its neceſſity to ſalvation. And the Euchariſt for its Excellency, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity both in his opinion. But to inſiſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this here, is neither to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or any part of what I did at firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> running here and there, as in a Labyrinth, to ſhew the fathers take not alwayes the word Sacrament in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe, doth only involve himſelf in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable difficulties, ſtanding to his ground of Scripture clear in Fundamentals, which no where defines what properly a Sacrament is, or any where reſolves and determinates what may be ambiguous and doubtful, either in it ſelf, or the Fathers. How then ſhall we be aſſured of this without an Infallible Viſible Judge? When ſome take even the cleareſt Scriptures and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers in one ſenſe, ſome in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

               <p>From all which Teſtimones of moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants, yea, and of the very firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers is evidently proved: Firſt, that they did not think any viſible Church to have conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at all times, the purity of the Goſpel, which M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> calls blaſphemy to deny. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they claim not a Succeſſion from any that went before them (except only from the Apoſtles) what ever later Proteſtants do falſly pretend. Thirdly, that they own no more the diffuſive body of the Church infallible then the Repreſentative, ſeeing no Church proſeſſing the Doctrine they did teach, is acknowledged by them for many hundred years before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Fourthly, That Popery was the only Religion generally prevailing, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, for no leſs time then fourteen hundred years before <hi>Luther.</hi> Fifthly, how well M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis</hi> agreeth with other Proteſtants in this his ſecond Ground of Faith.</p>
               <p>You ſhall preſently, God willing, hear both greater and better witneſſes depoſing againſt him; but firſt I ask what peculiar reaſon he has, why the Church in her childhood, and younger age,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40378:68"/>
ſhould be a ground of Faith, and not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in her full maturity? as we grant her, the fulneſs of Divine Wiſdom even from her birth, which did not increaſe by age, ſo by age it cannot decay. We ſhall now preſently ſee, how like the Proteſtant Church is to that of the three firſt Centuries; but before this, I would know, why M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> gives her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine rather for a ground, then in following times? Is there any peculiar promiſe made to her, any particular reaſon militates for her, or any teſtimonies of the Scriptures, or Fathers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to her in one time, rather then in another? was her Doctrine then purer? her Condition more flouriſhing, her authority greater? Doth not M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> grounding his Faith upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church in any age after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, confirm that Romiſh Tenet of the Church Doctrine as a Ground in other Ages, by pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſon?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I reflect that M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> who will admit of no Infallible Viſible Judg of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, of no Infallible Tradition not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, nor of any Aſſembly of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Paſtor of the Church in a General Council as infallible in their Decrees: Here either acknowledgeth the Records of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Hiſtory, and Writings of the Fathers, as witneſſing infallibly to us, the Doctrine of theſe ages, or elſe muſt grant he hath no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40378:68"/>
aſſurance that this his ſecond ground of Faith is ſolid and Infallible. There being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way left us (without particular Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to know what Doctrine the Church did teach, and believe in the firſt three Ages, ſave only the Writings of the Fathers, and Tradition of the preſent Church; which conſequently M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> muſt either here own as Infallible, or avouch he builds his Faith upon a ſandy and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ground.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reformers ſtanding better to their own Principles then he, and of much greater ſincerity and learning, grant plainly the Fathers of the Primitive Church, to hold many things in oppoſition to them.</p>

Yea and for the very ſame, which are moſt objected againſt the Romiſh Church, a moſt invincible Argument from the confeſſion of our Adverſaries; That the Church and Fathers of the three firſt Ages, did teach the ſelf ſame Doctrine with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Roman Church, and with Pope <hi>Pius</hi> in his confeſſion of Faith in all thoſe Points quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, Free Will, Merit of Works, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, honouring of Relicks, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Sacrifice for the Dead, S. <hi>Peters</hi> Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amongſt the Apoſtles, the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Church, Maſs, Traditions, the Real Preſence, Confeſſion, Pennance, Abſolution, &amp;c. So that if M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will ſtand to his own word, and truſt the Writings of his brethren, He is here again engaged to turn Papiſt.</p>
               <p>Many more ſuch Quotations could I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from chief Proteſtant Writers, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging both the Church and Fathers, of the firſt three Ages, holding moſt controverted Tenets, flatly againſt Proteſtants. And yet ſo confident M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> is, he dare take the Church Doctrine at that time, for a Ground of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and this no doubt to ſhew the deepneſs of his Learning, and how well he is verſed in Antiquity, till preſently we hear the Fathers themſelves ſpeaking, the better to make both his Weakneſs and Igorance appear.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon this, I remark M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> in his 8. paper, ſays, we agree with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in all their Poſitive Tenets, and only in their Negatives diſagree. How true this is, I do not now diſpute; yet muſt here reflect, that all chief Hereſies, for the moſt part, with that of Proteſtants have ever conſiſted in Negations,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40378:71"/>
and in denying ſome Points of Faith, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received in the Church. <hi>Sabellius</hi> denyed three perſons in the God-head, <hi>Eutiches</hi> two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt; <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in Chriſt one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: The <hi>Monothelites</hi> two wills in Chriſt, as two Natures: The <hi>Arians,</hi> Chriſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with his Father: The <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the conſubſtantiality of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> that Baptiſm in the Church ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred but once, The <hi>Novatians,</hi> that ſinners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm could be abſolved upon Repentance; and even ſuch Hereſies Proteſtants moſt claim to; as the <hi>Grecians</hi> deny the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son; the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> deny Princes and Magiſtrates to conſerve their Digities and Power when fallen in mortal ſin: The <hi>Huſſits</hi> deny that the predeſtinate could ſin; the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> Marriages to be lawful; the <hi>Wickliffians,</hi> Free Will, and ſo forth. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio eſt Malignantis naturae,</hi> ſay the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Negations are of a Malignant Nature, whence we ſee, that as Atheiſm conſiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God, ſo Hereſies are moſt in Negations, as flowing from the Spirit of Pride, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Rebellion.</p>
               <p>However it is time we ſhew what conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is betwixt Proteſtants Negative Tenets, and the Doctrine of the Church in the firſt three Centuries, or Ages; M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> provoking ſo confidently his Adverſary to bring any Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40378:72"/>
difference from the Authentick writings of theſe Fathers, and upon this engaging to turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. I do not here queſtion further then I have done in my ſecond reflection, how he who admits of no Infallible Viſible Judge, can be ſufficiently aſſured of their Authentick Writings, for if he take this only upon their conformity with Scripture, they can make no peculiar Ground to him, rather then other mens Writings, having the like conformity with it, or can they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly a diſtinct Ground from it; But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen how many chief Proteſtants diſown the moſt antient Fathers, chalenge them of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold Errours; cenſure their Doctrine (a moſt ſtrong conviction againſt M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> that they take not their Writings for a Ground) let us hear themſelves depoſing clearly in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour againſt him, and ſee if they who have confounded ſo many Atheiſts, convinced ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infidels, converted ſo many Hereticks, may even happily prevail with M. <hi>John.</hi> I cite here only the Fathers in the firſt three Centuries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> makes only his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to them: In which Ages, the Church being ſtill under perſecution, had not indeed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Writers as in following times, to witneſs her Doctrine againſt all Hereticks: Yet you ſhall God willing ſee how clearly the chiefeſt of them diſſent from Proteſtants in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                  <p>I Begin even at what is moſt Principal, to wit, the Popes Supremacy, this Poteſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

                  <p>S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Diſciple of S. <hi>John,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Romans, extolling their Church, calls her, <hi>The Church that preſides at Rome.</hi>

and moſt antient:</hi> And again, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 3. <hi>all Churches round about ought to reſort to the Roman Church, by reaſon of her more powerful Principality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third Age, <hi>Zepherinus</hi> Pope, in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Biſhops of <hi>Sicily</hi> decreed, <hi>That the greater cauſes of the Church, were to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtolick Sea, becauſe ſo the Apostles and ther Succeſſors had ordained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third Age, <hi>Origen</hi> on the 6. Ch. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> ſays, <hi>The chief charge of feeding Chriſts Sheep was given to S. Peter, and the Church founded upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame Age, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. ad Jul. <hi>We hold Peter the Head and Root of the Church</hi>; and again, <hi>Ep.</hi> 55. <hi>he calls the Church of Rome S.

                  <p>So well has Proteſtant Doctrine in this Point, a Ground in rhe Fathers of the firſt three Ages; that <hi>Danaeus</hi> a Proteſtant, in his Anſwer to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> acknowledgeth Soveraign Authority to have been practiſed by the Popes of the third Age, the Centuriſts, Cent. 3. that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did think the keys to be committed chiefly to S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the Church to be built on him; and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to have taught, that the Roman Church ought to be acknowledged of all others, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40378:73"/>Now ſhall all this be called Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head and Root of the Church, that the Church was founded upon him, that the chief charge of Chriſts Flock was given to him, that he is the Supreme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Divines; that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is his Chair, which for this hath a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Principality, as greateſt, ſo that the greater cauſes in the Church ought to be decided by her? where by parts, all the Controverſie of the Popes Supremacy is holden out againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Proteſtants deny we ſhould believe any thing not contained in Scripture, upon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition conſerved in the Church.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Proteſtants deny the unbloody Sacrifice of Chriſts body and blood offered up to God in the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the firſt Age, the very Liturgies of the Apoſtles are extant, and in that of S. <hi>James, we offer unto thee (O Lord) the unbloody Sacrifice for our ſins:</hi> And S. <hi>Andrew</hi> in the Book of his Paſſion, written by his Diſciples, ſayes unto the Tyrant. <hi>I ſacrifice daily the Immaculate Lamb to Almighty God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the ſame Age, S. <hi>Clement, Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>It is not lawful to celebrate Maſſes in other places, but in theſe wherein the proper Biſhop ſhall appoint, theſe things the Apoſtles receieved from our Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to you.</hi>

                  <p>S. <hi>Ignatius, Ep. ad Smyrnenſ. It is not lawful without a Biſhop to offer, or Sacrifice, or Celebrate Maſs.</hi>

But I hope M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will make no exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moſt Authors I have produced, unleſs paſſing from his appeal to the Fathers of the firſt three ages; he paſs alſo from his ſecond ground of Faith, as certainly after all has been ſaid he ſhould do, ſeeing I may juſtly ſpeak home to him here, with S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 11.

Whileſt we had no debate as yet with you before them as Judges, our caſe was pleaded amongſt them; we were not as yet conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you, and nevertheleſs by their decree we have the victory over you.</hi> Neither is this victory imaginary (as that of M. <hi>Menzeis</hi>) but real, as the three Arguments I have brought make good; which by way of recapitulation, I ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in this one Argument: the Doctrine of the Church, and writings of the Fathers in the firſt three Ages, can be no ground to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40378:80"/>
for what they teach: Firſt, if the chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers diſown them. Secondly, if moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants accuſe them of many Errours. Thirdly, If their own Writings in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Tenets be flatly againſt Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: but all this is true from the places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; then their Writings can be no ground to them. Yet Proteſtants will needs make up their Religion from the Writings of the Fathers, as ſome Poets from the Centons and broken Verſes of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> the life of Chriſt. They challenge the Fathers for their Hereſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a word or two picked out of places wherein they have an Orthodox ſenſe: In ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Volumes of the Fathers writings, that ſome word or paſſages ſeem to favour Hereſie, what wonder? Gods own Word, if we will ſtick to the naked Letter, ſeeming to favour ſo many, as we have ſeen above. They oppoſe Fathers to Fathers, and ſometimes one to himſelf, ſo they are poſſeſſed with the Spirit of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all may turn Problematick, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted among them. They cite the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt the Fathers, as if their new and giddy headed ſtart-ups, did better underſtand them, then the moſt antient and ſolid Divines; they will at times, by paſſages of the Fathers or Scripture, ſtrive to condemn the practice of the Church, and Decrees of Councils: but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever amongſt the Fathers did ſo? doth any one
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40378:80"/>
of the Fathers (with the firſt Reformers) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Scripture as underſtood by them) to the Authority of the Church, or to the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as explained by her? Doth any of them attach the Roman Church of Errour? To ſay ſuch a Church, ſo great and glorious in the Chriſtian world, did Apoſtatize, and none did remark her Apoſtacy; is like a general Eclipſe of the Sun, remarked by none. The leaſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of particular Hereticks, the Fathers have ſo narrowly ſifted, ſo ſharply cenſured, ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly confuted: and ſhall we think, they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not ſpyed, or ſpared to cenſure the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a whole body and Church. But let wiſe men and greateſt Shcollars be at variance as they pleaſe, about ſome places both of Scriptures and Fathers, as ſurely it will be to the Worlds end; God hath given us both a ſure and ſhort way, promiſed by the Prophet, wherein even igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and fools cannot err, Chriſt having left us the preſent Catholick Church in all ages, as the moſt faithful Depoſitary of his Doctrine, and the Infallible Viſible Judge of all that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in matters of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Before I end this Section, to give you but a ſcantling with what ſincerity and candor Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks cite the Fathers; this I borrow from M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Menzeis</hi> in his third paper, where in general, he moſt confidently ſays, <hi>That whatever the antient Apologiſts, as</hi> Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, <hi>and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenagoras
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40378:81"/>
                     <hi>have ſaid for the Chriſtian Religion, the ſame Proteſtants may ſay for their own.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having diligently read over the firſt of theſe Apologies, which is that of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (as any may do in an hour) I have found him ſo groſly miſtaken in citing this Father, that I may juſtly ſay, he could not more forfeit his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This I evidence in four chief Points aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by us, and denyed by Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Free Will, for which <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his Apology is ſo clear, that having ſaid, <hi>If men had not in their Free Will, to fly what is filthy, and chooſe what is honeſt, they ſhould be no wiſe to blame for what ever action</hi>; he will have it a Demonſtration, <hi>That men have freedom to live virtuouſly, or fall in ſin, becauſe we ſee them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to paſs from one of theſe contraries to the other.</hi> His words are, <hi>ac niſi libero arbitrio &amp; ad turpia fugienda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ad honesta deligenda facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem habeat mortalium genus, non fuerit in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſâ ſive culpâ qualiumcunque demum, factorum: Sed enim libero id delectu tum recte per virtutem vivere, cum per peccatum labi, ad hunc demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus modum: hominem eundem ad contraria ſubin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de tranſire videmus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is Merit of Works, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a reward to them, his words again are, <hi>Atque hoc etiamſi paucis perſuaferimus, maximum tamen inde feremus lucrum; nam ut boni agricolae amplam à domino capiemus mercedem.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:40378:81"/>The third is the efficacy of Baptiſm, in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us by water from all former ſins, and making us the children of God, <hi>Ut ne neceſſitatis &amp; ignorantiae liberi permaneamus, ſed <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth the Real Preſence, ſaying of the Conſecrated Bread and Wine in ſo expreſs words; <hi>Not as common Meat and common Drink do we take theſe things, but even as by the Word of God, our Saviour JESUS Incarnate had fleſh and blood for our Salvation, ſo we are taught that the Euchariſt is the fleſh and blood of the ſelf ſame JESUS Incarnate:</hi> His words are; <hi>Non enim ut communem panem neque communem potum iſta ſumimus; ſed quemadmodum per verbum dei, caro fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Jeſus Christus Servator noſter, &amp; carnem &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem habuit: ad eundem modum, etiam eam in quâ per preces verbi ejus ab ipſo profecti gratiae ſunt actae, alimoniam, incarnati illius Jeſu carnem &amp; ſanguinem eſſe edocti ſumus. Nam Apoſtoli in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentariis à ſe ſcriptis, quae Evangelia vocantur ita tradiderunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diverſe other things in the ſame Apology I paſs, theſe few things being ſufficient, to ſhew M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> ingenuity, and how he with other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks dare cite the Fathers, who even moſt evidently and expreſly condemn them.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40378:84"/>
Controverſies are driven to nothing, but idle and endleſs Contentions and Quarrels: Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are called Conventiles when they ſentence or cenſure them; the Church is changed into a Synagogue; the Fathers forfeit their credit; places, and paſſages from Scripture, are applyed or miſapplyed as they liſt; Now a jeer, now a jeſt in handſome Language (which jovial and jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humours moſt look upon) are their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Anſwers to ſolid Reaſons: Evidence in Motive of credibility is mocked at: Faiths cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is changed into probability: a few Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals comprehending chief Myſteries (what or how many they cannot tel) are judg'd only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed; Errors in Integrals (as they call them) which make the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, are taught to be things indifferent to our belief: In them even the Apoſtles were not in allible, ſay <hi>Rainolds</hi> and <hi>Whitaker,</hi> with ſome other Proteſtant Divines; In them the whole Church may err, ſays M. <hi>Menzeis</hi>; and upon this, as if ſhe had erred, come in all Sectaries to reform her: ſhe is old, and her Spirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; they have the fulneſs of the Spirit: her Eyes by age are dimmed, ſhe ſees not what is manifeſt in Scripture, they as younger ſee clear: ſhee is too Superſtitious in her Religious Ceremonies, they as more familiar with God uſe none: like Prophets Extraordinarily ſent by God, they preach againſt Prieſts and people:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40378:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they ſet out a New Goſpel of their own, as if they were Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, finding no true Scripture before: Yea as if they had Chriſts own power, they abandon the Antient Church as the Synagogue, and make up a new one, changing both the Prieſthood and Sacrifice: No more pennances and ſatisfactions of men to Gods Juſtice for their offences, becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied for all: No more faſting, except very ſeldom, and that only for temporal ends: No good Works are left in our power, they are too hard, yea impoſſible, ſeeing even our beſt actions are ſins, Faith only juſtifieth, and to believe is an eaſie task: So the ſtrait path is made plain, and the narrow way broad to them: Whil'ſt others ſtrive to work their ſalvation with fear and trembling, chaſtizing their bodies with the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, leaſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reprobates</hi>; They live ſecure, that each of them is one of the Elect, making even this an Article of his Faith. And this they perſwade to ſimple ones with ſome refined words, uttered in the tune of the <hi>Sybilles,</hi> giving reſponees from the belly, ſo far they are fetched with a deep ſigh, as if they breathed nothing but zeal: ſome more Learned, relying on the acuteneſs of their wits, go willingly along with them, not to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their underſtandings, or ſubmit to any Viſible Judg; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Come hear us ſay they, and you ſhall not be troubled, we ſeek no more, and of their moſt underſtanding hearers they get no more, as I have often heard from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We are not (ſay they) ſo Proud and Arrogant as Papiſts, to call our Church and her Doctrine Infallible, the Scripture is only ſo: By it judg of us and what we teach, as you your ſelves read and underſtand: This is the liberty of the children of God, to be tyed to no Churches Faith, to no Councels Decrees, to no Fathers Doctrine: The Word as clear in it ſelf, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by it ſelf; the Spirit ſpeaking inwardly in our hearts, and every mans Natural Reaſon directed by certain Rules for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of both, is the only means God hath left for the converſion of Infidels, conviction of Hereticks, and ſetling of every good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in his belief.

The firſt is, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing, <hi>Deus revelans</hi>: And the ſecond is, God ſhowing himſelf Authour of ſuch a Revelation; <hi>Deus proponens ſe authorem revelationis,</hi> ſay the Divines. What God hath revealed, is taught us by his Church as an infallible Propounder; that he is Author of the Revelations made to her, he atteſts in the Motives of credibility, as infallible marks, that it is he who ſpeaks: So all in our Faith is infallibly from God, and all infallibly propounded to us. The things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40378:86"/>
by the true and infallible Church; and the Revelation by infallible Motives, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear to all who have Eyes, Ears, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, make evidently credible, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain all and every one Point of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Faith.</p>
               <p>Now to prove what I have ſet down, to be the only true ſolid and infallible Grounds, of the true Chriſtian and Catholick Faith. 1. That Scripture is this Ground, is granted by M. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeis,</hi> and all Proteſtants, ſo needs no proof as to them. 2. That ſole Scripture without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Expoſition of the Church, as an infallible Propounder, Expounder, and Judge, cannot be this Ground, is proved at length in my fourth Section, and preſently you ſhall ſee it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. 3, That Apoſtolical Traditions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily joyned with Scripture; Is 1. proved from clear Scriptures, moſt expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to receive them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Therefore brethren ſtand faſt, and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or by Epiſtle.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Now I command you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every Brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the Traditions which he received.</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Remember me in all things, and keep the Traditions as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them to you.</hi> 2. By the Authority of the Fathers of the firſt three ages quoted in my

ſixth Section, with that of S. <hi>Chyſostome,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and others above mentioned. 3. From manifeſt and Demonſtrative reaſon, in ſome chief Points which all Chriſtians believe without any expreſs Scripture, as I have inſtanced in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity, Sacraments in the Church, the keeping of Sunday, &amp;c. and in many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies condemned by the Church, Councils, Fathers, yea and Proteſtants themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any clear Scripture can be brought againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> avoucheth of the Errour of <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Reſts then only to prove that the Church's Authority as an infallible Propounder is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to make all theſe Divine and infallible Truths in themſelves, contained either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or delivered by Apoſtolical Tradition, both ſolid and infallible Grounds to us.</p>
               <p>For this I preſuppoſe, 1. From the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, Hebrews</hi> 11. <hi>That without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> 2. From the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. <hi>That there is but one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, one Lord JESUS Chriſt.</hi> 3. From him again, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.23. <hi>That we muſt hold faſt the profeſſion of our Faith without wavering.</hi> From which Texts, importing the Neceſſity of Faith, the Unity of Faith, and the ſteadineſs in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving required in Divine Faith, it doth follow that ſome infallible means which all may make uſe of, muſt be appointed by God to attain to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40378:87"/>
this Faith ſo abſolutely neceſſary to all. For to ſay God hath commanded us, and that under the pain of Eternal Damnation, to believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly; and not furniſhed infallible means to attain to ſuch belief, were to accuſe his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Providence, and Wiſdom. And this no Chriſtian or rational man will deny, ſo that all the Queſtion that can be moved, is about the infallible means to attain without doubt or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to Divine Faith, which may perſwade infallibly all ſort of perſons, that ſuch things are revealed by God, removing all reaſonable doubts that can ariſe, either concerning Gods Revelation (which is the formal object of Faith) or the things he hath revealed (which makes its material Object) and this means I ſay again, muſt not only be ſolid and infallible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively and in it ſelf (as M. <hi>Menzeis</hi> will have the Proteſtant Religion and Grounds of it) but alſo ſubjectively, and to us; it being the ſame thing, as to make a perſwaſive motive, not to appear, and not to be, according to that Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe &amp; non apparere.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ground however infallible in it ſelf, yet not appearing ſo to us, and known to be ſuch availeth nothing as to our belief. The Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians Demonſtrate, the Sun to be many times greater then the Earth, and their Demonſtration no doubt is both certain and evident in it ſelf, yet never ſhall perſwade a Country clown that it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40378:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is greater then his Cap, for that no Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this is clear and certain to him. Even ſo is it in the Ground of Faith, it muſt be both ſolid and and infallible in it ſelf, and it muſt be known to be ſuch by all who prudently rely upon it.</p>
               <p>This preſuppoſed, to conclude all that has been ſaid, and fully prove both the Ground of Faith in the Catholick Roman Church, ſolid as the Rock it is built on, and the means for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it to us infallible; I firſt ſhow againſt M. <hi>Menzeis,</hi> or rather for him and his converſion, the neceſſity of an infallible Propounder of what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e muſt undoubtedly believe (for if this can be made good, he engageth again to turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt) 2. That the true Church is this infallible Propounder. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. That the Catholick Roman Church is the only true Church. 1. Then as to the neceſſity of an infallible Propounder: If no men, no Church be infallible in propounding, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and conſequently all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, is only delivered to us by fallible means, and ſo no infallible certainty in Faith. The conſequence is clear, for moſt infallible Truths may be changed, altered, corrupted, and both fallibly and falſly propounded to us, as the firſt and chief Myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion by Hereticks have been. 2. <hi>Faith comes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle then as there be infallible believers and hearers, ſo muſt there be infallible
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40378:88"/>
Teachers, for Hearing and Teaching are Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives. 3. No other infallible means is, or can be aſſigned by Proteſtants to Ignorants, yea to all who underſtand not the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, for what is contained in Scripture, ſave only the Authority of their Paſtors and Church, but this Authority in propounding is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged infallible by them, then no infallible means is left. 4. There is no leſs neceſſity the Church be infallible in propounding, then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts in penning, and the Apoſtles in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no diſparity can be given, Gods Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally infallible in it ſelf before both, as i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is now. 5. Our Saviour Chriſt moſt expreſly owns the neceſſity of an infallible propounder, granting the <hi>Jews</hi> had not ſinned in refuſing to believe him, if by his Works and Wonders he had not evidenced himſelf to be the Son of God, and conſequently infallible in his Doctrine. 6. For this, the gift of Miracles is given to the Apoſtles, and left in the Church, to ſhow their infallible aſſiſtance in propounding. If you anſwer that was neceſſary at firſt, but not now, becauſe it is the ſame Doctrine you teach, which the Apoſtles did propound infallibly: You ſay nothing, for that it is we doubt of, or rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly we deny, that your Doctrine is the ſame. You preſently appeal to Scripture, but in vain, till firſt you anſwer to all that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in my fourth Section, how ye know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40378:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what ye call Scripture to be Gods Word, then the Letter you read to be uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the ſenſe you give to the genuine, &amp;c. and to all the clear places of Scripture I have brought againſt moſt of your particular Tenets. I do not here ask ye <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prove that to be infallibly Gods Word which was preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, this they did ſufficiently themſelves: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Doctrine of Authentick Scripture is infallibly true, (that was alſo done before there was a Proteſtant in the world) but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe Generals (which make all the Anſwers of your beſt Writers) we deſire ye ſhew by ſome infallible ſign that your Bible is Gods pure Word; and your Gloſſes on it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Senſe and Letter. To reply, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth evidence it ſelf by its innate light to be Gods Word, ſo that all may ſufficiently know it by this, and all be obliged to believe it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by Chriſt himſelf, preſently telling us his own hearers had not ſinned in not receiving it as ſuch, if he had given no External Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his infallibility in propounding; for as I have remarked above, Scripture hath no greater Efficacy, Evidence, or Light in our Books, then in our bleſſed Saviours own mouth. Neither will the Majeſty of the Stile, or the purity of the Doctrine do it, both theſe being as great in the the Books of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> which Proteſtants reject, as in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:40378:89"/>
which they receive. Beſides that the firſt of theſe two is imaginary, as to the Letter, there being leſs Majeſty in the Letter of Scripture, then in the Philoſophers and Orators Writings, as is con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſed by <hi>Paul.</hi> And the ſecond is in queſtion chiefly in Proteſtant Bibles, which do not agree with any Original or Copy that before <hi>Luther</hi> can be found, if we truſt their own Authours whom I have quoted.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If all Councils, all the Fathers, all the Paſtors of the Church be fallible, then let Proteſtants bring nothing but Scripture againſt us, (for we will receive nothing but upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority) and all their Volumes of Controverſie ſhall not come to one line. Yea further, could they bring Scripture for what they teach (as they will never be able to do) yet without an infallible Propounder and Judg, well might we diſpute, but conclude nothing, wrangle, but agree in nothing to the Worlds end. For as ſole Scripture without an infallible Church propounding, and Explaining it, ſo a naked Church without infallible Marks, and a Doctrine without infallible Motives, prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay the true Church is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible propounder, on whoſe Authority we muſt rely. For proof of this, It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in holy Scripture there be three Foundations or Grounds of Faith mentioned
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40378:90"/>
by the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The 1. Is our bleſſed Saviour Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Another Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no man can lay then that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The 2. Is the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Built upon the Foundation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets.</hi> The 3. The Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>The houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which clear places of Scripture, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, 1. The Foundation of Faith is ever a Living, Viſible, and Speaking Ground, to wit, Chriſt, the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Church, the dead Letter of Scripture being no where called this Ground. 2. That theſe three Grounds of Faith, both in the Old and New Law, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking make but one, according to the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>for another Foundation no man can lay,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>beſide Chriſt JESUS.</hi> So that the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Church muſt not be thought different Foundations from Chriſt, all their Vertue in upholding Faith, and Veracity in propounding Faith (Whence they are called the Foundation and Ground of it) coming from the particular aſſiſtance of his Spirit, Strengthening, Inſpiring, and Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Hence alſo is their infallibility, for <hi>the Foundation of Christ ſtands ſure,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And conſequently is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together infallible. 3. That the Church here
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40378:90"/>
called a Ground which ſupporteth our Faith, is not to be ſaid the only diffuſive body of all true Believers, but more the Repreſentative Church in her chief Paſtors, as the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in old. Wherefore ſome few Catholick Authors ſo often objected, as holding the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Decrees of Councils only infallible, when they are generally received by the whole Church; in my opinion are highly miſtaken, and ſurely to be underſtood (if any in Expreſs terms ſpeaks ſo) of Councils not wholly Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical, or not Lawfully convocated, and known<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved by the Pope, or whereof ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional doubt may be made in things eſſentially required; in which caſes I grant the general belief of the Church could beſt warrant the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their Decrees. Otherwiſe a few particular perſons might cope with General Councels, as <hi>Luther</hi> and his Adherents at firſt, Vendicating to himſelf the Negative voice, as if he had been high Biſhop in the whole Church; which were to take away all poſſible means of preſerving Unity in Faith, yea to foment all Schiſms and Diviſions, every one pretending the whole Church holds no ſuch Doctrine; whil'ſt he who is a Member diſſents. So that ſuch Doctors if they ſhould allow no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in receiving the Decrees of the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, to the which they do and muſt ſubmit even this their Sentence, could neither
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40378:91"/>
be thought Catholicks or rational men.</p>
               <p>But however ſome few ſpeak or think, God did promiſe us an infallible Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. <hi>V.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Wherein he ſhould teach us his ways, and judge amongst the Nations himſelf,</hi> not perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he never went out of <hi>Jewry,</hi> but by her Paſtors. He has eſtabliſh'd this infallible Church, in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>V.</hi> 19. Upon the Rock. Chriſt hath commanded us to hear her, in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>V.</hi> 17. And the perſons we ſhould hear in this Church, as well as the end wherefore we would hear them, and reſt upon their Authority, is clearly ſet down in theſe words, 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, till we all come in the Union of Faith, that we henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. From all which places of Scripture, it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively manifeſt, that as the true Church is infallible, and we bound to hear her, yea and to rely upon her Authority, as the Pillar and Ground of our Faith; ſo is it moſt evidently clear, that as ſhe ſpeaketh only to us infallibly by the voice of her Paſtors and teachers united, it is them we ſhould hear, ſeeing God in her, (not perſonally as I have ſaid, but by them) both Judgeth and Teacheth, as the infallible Propounders of his Divine Truths (with the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40378:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prophets and Apoſtles in old) and the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judges of our Controverſies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame is proven from the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, quoted at length in my third Section, for the infallibility both of the Church and Councils; And may be confirmed even by the confeſſion of many Rational and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Proteſtants, who receive the Scripture, and conſequently all, and every Point contained in it, as the Word of God, upon the ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; As M. <hi>Whitaker againſt Stapleton, p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>I deny not but the Churches Tradition is the Argument whereby to convince, what Books are Canonical and what not.</hi> M. <hi>Fulk in his Anſwer to a Counterfeit Catholick; The Church hath judgment to diſcern the Word of God from the Writings of Men.</hi> M. <hi>Covel in his defence of Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Doubtleſs it is a tolerable Opinion of the Church of Rome, to affirm, that the Scriptures are holy in themſelves, but ſo eſteemed of us for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church. And M. Hooker in his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Policy, we all know that the first out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motive leading men ſo to esteem of Scripture, is the Authority of the Church.</hi> And as theſe own her Authority in Propounding the Scripture Books, ſo other Proteſtants in reſolving all Doubts, and deciding all Debates; as <hi>Bancroft Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>in his Sermon on the</hi> 8. <hi>of</hi> February 1588. <hi>God, ſays he, hath bound

Hooker in the Preface of his Books of Eccleſiaſtical Policy: We are right ſure of this, that Nature, Scripture, and Experience have taught the World to ſeek for the ending of Contentions, by ſubmitting it ſelf to ſome judicial and definitive ſentence, whereunto neither part that contendeth, may under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence refuſe to ſubmit.</hi> And what is this but a General Council? M. <hi>Bilſon in his perpetual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is clear for it; To have no Judge, ſayes he, for the ending of Eccleſiaſtical Contentions were the utter ſubverſion of all peace. Synods are ſureſt means to decide doubts.</hi> Sr. <hi>Edwin Sands in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40378:92"/>
of the Religion uſed in the Weſt parts of the World. The Proteſtants are as ſevered and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Troops, each drawing a diverſe way without any means to take up their Controverſies, &amp;c. No or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way to Aſſemble a General Council of their part, which is the only hope remaining ever to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage their Contentions.</hi>

No doubt he ſhould firſt ſpeak of one true God, then of Chriſt and Faith in him, as neceſſary to ſalvation, telling his Proſelyte, how out of his Goodneſs and Mercy towards us, he had made himſelf Man, and died upon the Croſs for our ſins; Yet afterwards had riſen again, and by his Miracles, ſhowen both his Civinity and Power, and by theſe ſtrange Works and Wonders, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſtabliſhed his Church, he had delivered his Will and Doctrine to her in his Written Word, called the Holy Scripture. Upon this, the Infidel no little aſtoniſhed at ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſurely ſhould ask him ſome Ground for it, and how he could be perſwaded it were true? Here I imagine the Bible is produced, as the Word of God, and ſole ground of Faith: But who aſſures me of this, ſays the infidel? It was atteſted by many Miracles which Chriſt and the Apoſtles did work, who firſt pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>hed it, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Proteſtant, they were holy men, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by our Saviour Chriſt, for the converſion of the World: they did Teach his Word Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly; They did ſet it down in Writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with Wonders, and left it to the Church. How long ago replies the Infidel? Nigh 1700. years anſwers again the Proteſtant. One Queſtion more, ſays the Infidel; have you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40378:93"/>
any infallible Witneſs in your Church, or any Infallible External Motive, that this is the ſame Word of God that was Preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and delivered by Chriſt; or that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, ever any Miracle was wrought? The firſt needs none, ſays the Proteſtant, it is clear to all well diſpoſed perſons; turn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and you will Evidently ſee it to be the Word of God; and the ſecond is ſufficiently atteſted in it. Preſently the Infidel having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived further inſtruction in moſt Points of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, and made more earneſt to ſee how all that has been taught him, is true; deſires he may have for a time the Bible, and diligently peruſing it, finds ſome things in the Hiſtorical Books, look like Fables, many more in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets he doth not underſtand, many ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions betwixt the two Teſtaments, many points he was taught by his Proteſtant Maſter, not in Scripture at all, yea many things clearly againſt it. Of all which he asks his Maſter a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent account; And firſt whether at preſent there be no man, or company of men can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him infallibly of all theſe doubts? None, concludes the Proteſtant but Scripture it ſelf, for ſince the Apoſtles there is in the Church no Judg, no Propounder infallible. If ſo, Sir, you conclude nothing with me, ſays the Infidel, but here I end with you; for the Book you ground all you have ſaid upon, as if it were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40378:94"/>
clear and infallible to me, like the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in our Philoſophers Schools, is ſo deeply obſcure, and highly above the reach of reaſon, that without ſome powerful motive and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no reaſonable man can believe it. And ſince you grant it was at firſt propounded with infallible Motives which now have ceaſed, It ſeems God would have it believed no more. For who can prudently believe things not clear in themſelves, or at leaſt not ſo to us, without ſome infallible Propunder evidencing by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Motives (as Miracles) that ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is from God? Neither can a Proteſtant ſtanding to his Principles ſay any more; whence no converſion of Infidels amongſt them.</p>
               <p>But no end of their cavelling with us. They here urge, 1. Suppoſe the true Church were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in her Paſtors aſſembled in a Council; yet all we bring in proof of this, may be retorted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our private Teachers, who are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in propounding. But to this it is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that as God moſt infallibly, both by his general Providence, and particular Promiſe directs, rules, and governs his Church; ſo ſhe by vertue of his ſpecial aſſiſtance overſees infallibly her private perſons, in order to our certainty in Faith. For in the holy Hierarchy of the Church, God hath placed Watchmen moſt vigilant over their flocks, who ſuffer them not to be miſled: they have diſcovered the very leaſt Errors, ſowen
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40378:94"/>
in Corners, and branded their Authors as falſe Teachers. Wherefore as unity in belief is the Form and Soul of that great body of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Univerſal Church, ſo whatever Doctrine is commonly taught and received in her without any contradiction from her Paſtors, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to be infallible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They object there is no infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of this Article of our Faith; <hi>The Church is Infallible,</hi> Anſwer, Yes, 1. God ſhows himſelf the Propounder of this in the Markes of the Church, which we ſhall preſently ſee. 2. As our Saviour Chriſt calling himſelf the Son of God, and working Miracles, did ſufficiently, yea, infallibly evidence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it was true what he ſaid: So the Church calling her ſelf infallible, and working the like Miracles in all Ages, doth infallibly evidence to the world that it is true what ſhe ſays, otherwiſe it would follow that God did employ his Omnipotency and Power to work Miracles in favour of an Impoſtor, thus cheating the world with a lye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore I ſay, the Catholick Roman Church, is the only true Church, in which the Doctrine of Chriſt is infallibly propounded, and certainty in Faith and Salvation to be found. This Point is of higheſt concern according to the Fathers; For, <hi>it is only the Catholick Church,</hi> ſays <hi>Lactantius, l.</hi> 4. <hi>that hath the true Worſhip and Service of God: That is, the Well-ſpring of

Truth, the dwelling place of Faith, the Temple of God, into which, whoſoever entereth not, and from which, whoſoever departeth, is without all hope of Life and Salvation. Whoſoever is divided from her,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Augustine in his Epiſtle,</hi> 152. <hi>how laudable ſoever he ſeems to himſelf to live, for this only crime, that he is ſeparated from the unity of Chriſt, he ſhall be excluded from life, and the wrath of God ſhall remain upon him.</hi> And again <hi>in his</hi> 50. <hi>Epiſtle, as a Member cut off wants the ſpirit of life, ſo a man ſeparated from the body of Chriſt, cannot have the ſpirit of Juſtice, &amp;c. They have not the Holy Ghoſt who are out of the Church.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian de Unitat. Eccl. The Spouſe of Chriſt cannot be defiled with adultery, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever divided from this Church cleaveth to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſs, he is ſeparated from the Promiſes of the Church, he cannot have God for his Father, who hath not the Church to his Mother.</hi> S. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 40. <hi>in the Church God hath conſtituted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Prophets, Doctors, and all the reſt of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Spirit, whereof thoſe are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers who repare not unto the Church; where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God. Vincenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Lyrinenſis, contr. haereſ. C.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. ſays, That he having very often moſt diligently inquired of many Holy and Learned men, how he might certainly diſtinguiſh the true Catholick Faith from all Hereſies, it was ever anſwered him by the Law of God, and the Tradition of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40378:95"/>
Church, <hi>Divinae legis authoritate &amp; Catholicae eccleſiae traditione.</hi> Then making to himſelf the common Objection of Proteſtants, ſeeing the Rule of Scripture is perfect, what neceſſity of joyning to it the Tradition of the Church? He preſently Anſwers, becauſe all take not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one way, and in the ſame ſenſe, becauſe of its deepneſs. All the Fathers run upon this, out of the Catholick Church, no true Religion, no Divine Faith, no infallible Guide, no ſure way to Salvation, no hope of Heaven, no means to attain Eternal Happineſs and Life.</p>
               <p>Wherefore God by his Divine Appointment, Order, and Decree having tyed us, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no leſs pain then the damnarion of our Souls, to live in the Unity and Communion of this Church, in which only he has placed the Chair of his Doctrine, and Channels of his Graces. I preſuppoſe, 1. This Church may be eaſily known, and that by clear Marks in all Ages, and by all, ſhe being ſo amply great, and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently high, that the Prophet <hi>Iſa. Ch.</hi> 2. calls her, <hi>The Mountain of the Lords houſe eſtabliſhed in the top of Mountains, and exalted above the Hills, to which all Nations ſhould flow</hi> 2. Tat thoſe Marks be the ſame now, which did evidence her in Chriſts, and in the Apoſtles time; for all things are beſt conſerved by the ſame means by which they received their being, ſays the Phyloſophers, <hi>Conſervatio continuata productio.</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:40378:96"/>
3. That whatever Church is found to have theſe Marks, ſhould be undoubtedly acknowledged for the true one, otherwiſe they could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her the true Church at firſt.</p>
               <p>This preſuppoſed, that the Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is the only true Church, I moſt evidently prove in ſhort (for this hath been often done in large volumns) and that by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few undoubted Signes, and as it were moſt legible Characters of the Primitive Church in the time of the Apoſtles, paralelling the one with the other.</p>
               <p>Three things are chiefly remarkable in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Church under them. 1. Their Sanctity and Holineſs of Life. 2. The great converſion of Infidels wrought by them. 3. Their manifold and wonderful Miracles. Theſe be the Marks of their miſſion, by which they ſhow themſelves to be the ſervants of God, to be ſent by God, and that God by his Vertue and Power concurreth and cooperateth with them. Their Holy, Humble, Poor, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Life, makes them like to their Maſter Chriſt, and fit Inſtruments for the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment they are going about: Miracles make their Credential Letters, and witneſs the fulneſs of their power; Converſions are the end of their Embaſſy, which as it was to laſt till all the Nations of the earth were brought to the Unity of Faith, and boſome of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40378:96"/>
Church, according to that Promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>There ſhall be one ſhepherd, and one Fold,</hi> ſo their true Succeſſors are conſtantly known by the ſame Signs in all Ages, as the undoubted Marks and Badge of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I begin at Miracles, which I call the Apoſtles Credentials, and make the chief infallible Mark of the true Church, and all infallibly credible which is taught in her, as the great Seal God ſets to her Doctrine. In the firſt Age, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Apoſtles and Diſciples are ſet down in holy Scripture, ſo need no other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. In the ſecond Age, <hi>Juſtin Martyr quaeſt.</hi> 28. reporteth many wrought by the bodies, and at the Sepulchers of Martyrs, and <hi>Irenaeus, l.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 58. innumerable others for the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In the third Age many moſt great ones are wrought by S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturge,</hi> or worker of Miracles, related by S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Niſſen</hi> in his Life, and S. <hi>Baſil de Sp. Sanct. c.</hi> 29. divers whereof by the Sign of the Croſs. S. <hi>Cyprian ſerm. de lapſ.</hi> relates with many others, three very ſtrange Miracles in this Age, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Real Preſence. In the fourth Age, a dead body is reſtored to Life by the holy Croſs, when it was firſt found by the Empreſs <hi>Helena,</hi> as witneſs <hi>Ruffinus, Nicephorus</hi> and others.

Many

likewiſe are to be ſeen in the Life of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf, and one moſt notable in confirmation of the whole Catholick Roman Faith.

In <hi>England</hi> we have from their beſt Authors, how in a publick Aſſembly the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of a ſingle life in Prieſts are all ſmothered under the ruines of the room, only S. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> and thoſe who with him defended it, being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly preſerved; where alſo the many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of S. <hi>Winefride,</hi> Virgin, to the great good and conſtant cure of the multitude having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to her Chppel and Fountain, continue even in our days.

               <p>Now to reflect a little upon what I have ſaid. 1. The Miracles I here ſpeak of, are for the moſt part the ſame, or like to thoſe which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the ſuddain cure
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40378:99"/>
of naturally incurable Diſeaſes, the raiſing of the Dead, the caſting out of Devils, &amp;c. 2. They have been done in all Ages, in the Catholick Roman Church, and in no other. 3. The Workers of them, are Popes, Biſhops, Prieſts, Eremits, Monks, Fryars, Jeſuits, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, all knowingly oppoſers of Proteſtancy; all living in Communion with the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. They are witneſſed by the moſt Learned, Judicious, and Vertuous Witneſſes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, yea are ſo notoriouſly Evident, that Hereticks cannot but avouch them, with the Centuriſts of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and others. 5. Many of them are not only Perſonal Miracles, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing the holineſs of the Perſon that Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them (as theſe which ſerve for the Cononi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of our Saints) but alſo Dogmatical, confirming our Doctrine againſt Proteſtants, as being wrought by Reliques and Invocation of Saints; the Sign of the holy Croſs, holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying of Maſs, Exorciſms, Pilgrimages to holy Chappels of our bleſſed Lady and other Saints; by real Apparitions of our Saviour Chriſt in form of a Man in the Conſecrate Hoſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What then can Proteſtants Anſwer with any ſhow of Probability, to this firſt Mark of the Catholick Roman Church? Shall they grant a falſe Religion to have ſo many Miracles, and theirs which is the true, to have none? or ſhall
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40378:100"/>
Chriſts promiſe in S. <hi>John Ch.</hi> 14. made to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Believers prove falſe, that Proteſtancy may at leaſt ſeem to be true? They will rather deny theſe Miracles which I have brought, and all others ſince the Apoſtles, for their Negative Faith, Engageth them ever to a ſtrong Denial, as all their New Religion is but a denying of moſt Antient and known Chriſtian Truths; Yet ſhall any man upon their bold denyal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt ſuch a croud of ſo Famous Witneſſes, and Writers? Shall they ſay many Miracles have been fained? ſo ſome Goſpels; but what maketh that more againſt theſe of the Catholick Roman Church, then thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? What has not been counterfeited? Gold, Silver, Jewels, Wines; doth it follow there be none true, or that no man can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh things Sophiſticated from pure and real? Could not S. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> S. <hi>Baſile,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> relating ſo many done by Reliques, and Invocation of Saints, judge of true ones?

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40378:100"/>
the preſent Romiſh Faith? But it is by ſaying of Maſs, making the ſign of the Croſs, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Saints, honouring of Reliques, they have been done. Shall they have recourſe in fine to the falſe Miracles of Infidels, Hereticks, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, the Antichriſt or Devil? So did the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Eunomians,</hi> and other Hereticks, as reports S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Sermon of S. <hi>Gervaſe</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſe,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and <hi>Victor Uticenſis</hi> in his ſecond Book of the perſecution of the <hi>Wandales,</hi> and is the ſame the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſay to Chriſt, but more then either Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils can do. All thoſe things which Hereticks, or Infidels have done, or that Antichriſt ſhall do, being but like theſe of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Magicians, little curious Trifles of a ſhort laſting, and that may proceed from Natural Cauſes: But ſo are not the Miracles I ſpeak of, for they are the very ſame with thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; they are atteſted by the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church, who could beſt judge of true and real ones; and as they have been wrought in the Catholick Roman Church, and in her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all Ages, ſo in every Age have they brought in ſome Nation of Infidels to the boſome of the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond thing remarkable in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and no leſs Conſpicuous in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Roman Church. Whoſoever then deſires to ſee this ſecond Mark of the true Church veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40378:102"/>
But what Kingdom, Province, or Town did ever Proteſtancy enter in, which it did not find Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick? Never ſo many Sects of Hereticks, yet not one goes to convert Infidels, all their buſineſs is with Papiſts, and all their Forces employed againſt the Roman Church, a clear Demonſtration ſhe is the only true Church, ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally oppoſed by them all.

               <p>And this is the third thing remarkable in the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, which in all following Ages hath ſo gloriouſly ſhined in the Catholick Roman Church, their examplary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in following Chriſt by renouncing to the World, living chaſt, contemning both Riches and Pleaſures, their holy hatred of themſelves, the hardſhip of their travels, and labours for the converſion of others, their continual Faſting, and frequent Prayer.

               <p>Now let us ſee in what Church the greateſt Lights of the Chriſtian Religion have ſhined? what Church hath moſt Monuments of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an piety? in what Church the Examples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, have been moſt narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed? Who have built moſt glorious and goodly Edifices of Churches to the honour and for the ſervice of God; who ſo many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries to harbour his more devoted Servants; who ſo many Hoſpitals for the poor? who beſt Evidenced true Faith by good Works? who have moſt put in practice all the hardeſt Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the Goſpel? who taken greateſt pains for the Salvation of Souls? who ſhow'n greateſt love towards God, and greateſt charity to their neighbour? whether Papiſts giving ſo liberally to God and his Church, or Proteſtants taking back what they had given? <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſays our Saviour Chriſt, our actions give teſtimony of our Faith.

               <p>What can all the Sectaries which have ever been, ſhown like to this, or what can they ſay againſt it? ſhall it be that all are not Saints even amongſt our moſt Auſtere Religious men? but neither were all Saints amongſt the Apoſtles; and the Primitive Church even in their time wanted not its ſcandals, which ſhoweth it was not only compoſed of the Elect: the total ſeparation of the good from the bad, is not the work of men now, but of the Angels at the laſt day; till then as the Tares grow up in the beſt Fields of Corn, ſo ſhall there be ever many wicked and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the true Church. But out of it, no Saints, no ſafety for ſinners, no Sacraments that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, no means of reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p>I inſiſt not here any further on the other Marks of the true Church, as their Antiquity, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality, Unity, and the very name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which are to be found at length verified of the Roman Church, in many whole and large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. No other Church having e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in Old; ſo the <hi>Lutherians</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> now. And if we call this Catholick or Univerſal Church alſo the Roman Church, we ſpeak with S. <hi>Paul</hi> calling the Catholick Faith ſpread through the whole world, theirs. No other Church having conſtantly appeared viſible in her Paſtors and people, by a continued ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Apoſtles, which held S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in her, <hi>Tenet me in Eccleſiâ,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Succeſſie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum,</hi> I am holden in the Church by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Prieſts, then he reckons out the only high Prieſts and Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> as the lawful Succeſſors of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as in his 162.

No other, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Proteſtant Church, having either U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality or Antiquity, as is clear from their late Riſe, and little Extent.</p>
               <p>Whatever Proteſtants and other Sectaries ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtically or Subtilly Object againſt all this, is but weak, and ſhould ſtumble none, many ſtronger Objections, <hi>Atheiſts, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> have made againſt God, our Saviour Chriſt, and the holy Scripture. The firſt Principles moſt clear by the light of Nature, ſuffer their Objections, whence the Scepticks amongſt Philoſophers, as the

               <p>Wherefore to conclude all, I have ſaid: the Catholick Roman Church being ſo gloriouſly marked, ſo generally atteſted, and ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to be the true Church eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ever conſpicuous and viſible, ever working Miracles, converting Infidels, making Saints; ever holding Councils, deciding controverſies, keeping unity, oppoſing Hereticks, and maintaining true Faith upon Solid and Infallible Grounds, having ſo clear teſtimony from the Fathers, from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from God; having <hi>chariſma veritatis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the Gift and Grace of certain and infallible Truth, ſays <hi>S.
