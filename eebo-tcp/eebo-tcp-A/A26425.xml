            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as well as the Tenderneſs ſhe had <hi>for</hi> her, <hi>and that ſhe</hi> was afraid of ſome private Amours, that were going on between her and the Gallant Stranger that had made of late ſo fine a figure; to which ſhe added her Cautionary Advice, to take care of <hi>Souldiers</hi> of <hi>Fortune;</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding an handſome Perſon and Equipage, he might have but little to ſupport either: That all Towns and Cities, eſpecially <hi>Theirs,</hi> was known to be full of invidious Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and injurious Reflections. The Old folks, whoſe Virtues are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Neceſſity, reviling the innocent Liberties of the <hi>Young,</hi> for wanton Licentiouſneſs; and the young ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing the ſtaidineſs and gravity of the Old only for a ſupercilious dotage. That the odneſs of Marrying an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Stranger (whatever his merits or perfections might be) would ſound as ſtrange to all her Friends and Acquaintance; would make her the Subject of Table-talk, and be a ſlur
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47692:19"/>
to the Young <hi>Britiſh</hi> Gallants of the ſame Province, as if all <hi>Albion</hi> could not afford her an Husband deſerving enough, but ſhe muſt ramble ſo far as to find out an <hi>Helvetian.</hi> With theſe courteous Admonitions and <hi>kind Reproaches,</hi> did the Counteſs Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager entertain her Daughter; who much ſurprized at the Diſcourſe, and ſevere reprehenſion for a fault ſhe was but beginning to commit, the very Intentions of which ſhe thought none had been privy to but her ſelf, and her faithful <hi>Druſilla:</hi> This ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, I ſay, made the Fair <hi>Vicentina,</hi> whoſe Complexion was naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to a lovely white, o'reſpread her Lilly Cheeks with a little Roſy bluſh; but recollecting her ſelf and Courage agen, ſhe thought it beſt for the Young folks to be as cunning, as the Old are ſly; and did not much doubt but the Counteſs Dowager, when at her Years, was as good at Diſſembling as any, eſpecially in matters of Love and Amour; in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47692:20"/>
which the ſevereſt Moraliſt allow it, even though they made a Lye for it, ſo long as it is only an Officious and Jocoſe one. This put the Young Lady upon Impoſing on the Old, and upon this cunning Reply, <hi>That her Lady Mothers will ſhould be alway a Law to her;</hi> that ſhe had no thoughts of Matrimony, much leſs of any Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriage, or ſo much as ſecret engagement: That ſhe was obliged to ſo tender and careful a Mother, for giving her ſuch good Advice, which ſhould be her conſtant endeavour to follow, for the making both her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and her own Life comfortable: That Diſobedient Children would bring their own Golden Locks, as well as their Parents Grey Hairs with ſorrow to the Grave; That for her part, her own Countrymen appear'd to her the more amiable to make Husbands of: that to lye by the ſide of a Foreigner, an <hi>Outlandiſh-Man,</hi> differing in Speech, Cuſtome, Manners and Behaviour, muſt needs be but a

               <hi>cold Comfort,</hi> eſpecially if they come out of ſo Cold a Country; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe had read and heard of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and its Old Inhabitants the <hi>Helvetians;</hi> but that all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, both Ancient and Modern Authors gave of the Men, was that they had <hi>Grim</hi> and <hi>Grizly</hi> Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>Briſtly Beards,</hi> and <hi>Bruſhy Whiskers;</hi> ſo that her Ladyſhip had no Reaſon to fear ſhe had any Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the new-comers from that rugged Country, of which they ſay this Stranger is one; Therefore, Dear Mother, do not afflict your ſelf with ſuch Jealous thoughts, for my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be certainly placed on ſome ſmooth handſome <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> and no rugged Bear of <hi>Bern</hi> or <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Old Counteſs being a very good-natured Lady, and very <hi>Godly given,</hi> hearing her Daughter anſwer ſo <hi>Piouſly</hi> and ſo <hi>Religiouſly,</hi> ſo Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and Rationally too; ſeem'd very well ſatisfied with that <hi>Evening-Lecture</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47692:21"/>
ſhe had given her; and was very glad the Young Lady abounded with ſo much <hi>Grace,</hi> as to <hi>unfold</hi> her Heart ſo Dutifully to her Mother, and to <hi>fold down</hi> in <hi>it</hi> all the <hi>proofs</hi> and <hi>reproofs</hi> ſhe had given her, for <hi>Edification;</hi> not doubting but ſhe would make good <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of her <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> and that then there was no fear of any <hi>Application</hi> of any <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> whatſoever. Thus cloſed their Diſcourſe, and upon them the Night together; all things ſeem'd huſh'd for the Young Ladys happineſs; but the Old Counteſs, though ſhe went to bed ſeemingly ſatisfied, did not taſte that repoſe the neſt of Mortals enjoyed; <hi>Sleep! Sweet Sleep!</hi> That only Solace to the troubleſome ſtate of Human Life, had left her <hi>wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> thought, and <hi>watchful</hi> Eyes; which neither Nights Sable Curtain, no more than thoſe of her Bed could be ſaid to cloſe: Jealouſy, which reigns in a Parents Breaſts, has all the Torments of a Lovers too, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47692:21"/>
perhaps more anxious and acute from the purer flame that kindles it: 'Twas a <hi>Child</hi> ſhe was concerned for; 'twas a <hi>Child</hi> ſhe feared might prove falſe to her, and treacherouſly miſcarry; and the Violations of the Bed cannot be more afflicting, than the breaking through the Bonds of Nature, the Belly and the Womb; the former may cauſe the Head to ake, but the latter muſt make the Bowels yern: This baniſh'd not only Reſt, but the very thoughts of it, with perplexing Arguments, and troubleſome Objections of her own raiſing; and who knows, ſays ſhe, to her ſelf, but theſe fair Anſwers ſhe gave me, may be full of Guile? paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Love may prevail over the moſt Dutiful Affection: 'Tis an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs Power, and ſo not to be truſted; and its powerful effects I found once to operate too ſtrongly in my ſelf, to truſt it in my Daughter: It would make even a Saint to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and the ſincereſt Soul to turn
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47692:22"/>
Hypocrite; ſhe is Young, Fair, and Rich; her Youth may make her Amorous, her Beauty to be much Courted, and her Fortune to be very fairly ſtole and carried off beyond the <hi>Alps</hi> or <hi>Apennines,</hi> by ſome <hi>Swiſs,</hi> or ſwaggering Rodomontado; and then farewel Daughter, farewel For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, my joy, and my hope; and this Intriegue that is buz'd about, may notwithſtanding her ſtiff denial, be a thing that has ſomewhat of truth in it, and is warning enough to me how to truſt young Girls under Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. With this ſhe raiſed her ſelf more early than ordinarily from her uneaſy Bed, and put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden Reſolution, that was like to have changed all the Scene of this Amorous affair.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe was up, ſhe calls to <hi>Jacomo</hi> her Coachman, and gives him private Inſtructions to get his Equipage ready; and when her ſelf with the Young Miſtreſs was ſeated in the Coach, to drive directly away
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47692:22"/>
for the Caſtle of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Seat; without expecting farther orders or inſtructions; all things being thus prepared, the Counteſs Dowager accoſts her Dear Daughter, juſt then awakened from a pleaſant Dream of Viſionary Love, and the imaginary Embraces of her Dear <hi>Armadorus; She Dreamt</hi> of flowry Fields, and purling Streams: The Groves and Grotto's of beguiled Lovers; beneath the Amorous Shades of one of thoſe, ſhe fancied her ſelf ſitting by the ſide of her admired Hero; and he as full of paſſion, Contemplating the perfections of his adored Miſtreſs: Their pointing Eyes were fix'd on each other, and ſhot thoſe flames their breaſts had kindled; their nimble Tongues ſupplied each others Story, and were always ſeconds to one another in ſome innocent and pretty Tale of Rival Lovers; of happy or unfortunate Amours. The Nightingale, that over their heads di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them with his ſweet Notes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47692:23"/>
put them in mind of the misfortunes of <hi>Philomela;</hi> and the Silver Swan on the Streams below, made them remember how proudly <hi>Leda,</hi> once enjoyed a God: The Grove, that with its ſhady Trees preſt upon the Grott wherein they ſate, ſeem'd to inſinuate to this Youthful pair, the happy ſtate of Old <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that under their rural Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, grew Grey and Aged with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Bliſs, and undiſturbed Love; that ſuch Innocent ſimplicity the Gods themſelves did not diſdain to viſit, nor to Conſecrate into a Temple ſo homely a Cell: when from this pleaſing Covert, they were pleaſed to divert thoſe fixed Eyes from their ſtedfaſtneſs of eager <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition;</hi> (which like that of <hi>Angels</hi> they could wiſh might be <hi>Eternal)</hi> and ſuffered them to Expatiate a little o're the Fields and Meads that lay before them, at the opening of the Grove wherein they ſate, where every Flower they ſaw ſeemed to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47692:23"/>
repreſent a new Scene of Love. The <hi>Hyacinth</hi> minded them of its pretty Metamorphoſis; the <hi>Wild Mint</hi> bid them remember the Fair <hi>Minthe,</hi> a Nymph of that Name once as fragrant and as ſweet: The yielding <hi>Anamone,</hi> wav'd about with every Wind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected to their thoughts the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtory of <hi>Venus</hi> and her Dear <hi>Adonis,</hi> whoſe Purple Blood the Flower had imbib'd; the lovely <hi>Daffodil</hi> that grew by ſome adjacent <hi>Fountains</hi> ſide, did <hi>doubly</hi> reflect and repreſent both the Love and Diſaſterous Fates of the Enamoured <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> ſo that they could not forbear from riſing up themſelves, and each of them to crop a Flower; and with a ſort of <hi>ſelf-Love,</hi> (though they only <hi>Loved moſt</hi> one another) to look a little in that fatal mirror that had coſt the lovely Youth his Life. The Laurel, ever green, made them wiſh their Loves to laſt as long, and be ſo too; and ſeemed to exhibit to them the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flight of Timerous <hi>Daphne;</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47692:24"/>
the eager purſuit of their Innocent Loves: and the Stock-Dove in the Grove, made them think on the change of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> or the Chariot of <hi>Venus:</hi> The Eccho often would repeat the pretty Terminations of their pleaſant Tales; and at the ſame the pratling Nymph ſeemed to tell her own.</p>
            <p>The gliding River run their thoughts upon the Loves of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> and <hi>Egeria:</hi> The Murmuring Brook would needs mutter out ſome ſoft ſtory, of ſome ſilent Lovers; and tell the Tales of <hi>Byblis</hi> and <hi>Meander;</hi> and the Fiſh that glided with the Streams (as mute as it is) would needs ſay ſomewhat too, and Record to theſe <hi>retired Lovers,</hi> the wondrous tranſmigrations of <hi>Nais</hi> and <hi>Dercetis;</hi> all that <hi>Lovers Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Poets Fancies</hi> could invent, they ſeemed to have before their eyes; unleſs it were the fate of the Unfortunate <hi>Acteon,</hi> and the Diſcover'd Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Revengeful <hi>Diana;</hi> but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47692:24"/>
Chaſter thoughts attended their more Innocent Loves and Speculations; and no ſuch wanton objects appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>Dodona-</hi>Grove, to pollute their purer Imaginations. Thus lull'd almoſt a ſleep, with the delightful variety of ſuch innumerable repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their Innocency and Love (this Fair Couple in this pleaſant Viſion, the Young Counteſs had) ſeem'd to lye down together on the Roſy Banks of a Murmuring Stream, where, with the bluſhing Roſes, was confuſedly intermixt the Amorous Myrtle, and minded them (even half a ſleep as they lay down) of the ſweet Bed of <hi>Venus;</hi> and the Paſtoral Amours of <hi>Myrtillo.</hi> But this bright Scene of ſome bleſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſium laſted not long with the Charming and Enchanted <hi>Vicentina;</hi> for as ſhe Dream'd on, ſhe fancied all thoſe <hi>ſoft enjoyments</hi> of <hi>ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> ſeem'd on a ſudden to vanquiſh and diſappear. The Verdure of the Grove was changed into a Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47692:25"/>
Wan, and Yellow Complexion; the very Trees look'd as if they were <hi>ſickning</hi> with the <hi>Jaundice;</hi> the Leaves <hi>droop'd</hi> and <hi>dropt</hi> down before their Faces. The flowry Meads, and florid Fields, that ſmil'd under the feet of the Lovers that trip'd over them, began to look and languiſh, with a ſullen aſpect. The Raven, Owle, and Batt, and all the fore boding Birds of Night, and winged Omens of the Air, upon the Grotto where they fate, were ſadly perch'd; and ſpitefully poſſeſt the Nightingale's ſweet place; and chas'd from thence the Turtle and the Dove, and brought the Baleful Story of hapleſs Lovers, and blaſted Love, to diſturb their thoughtful Imagination. The frightful Fables of <hi>Corvus,</hi> and <hi>Nyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timine,</hi> with the transformation of <hi>Aſcalaphus,</hi> awaken'd their ſlumbering Senſes, and interrupted their ſo ſweet Repoſe.

ſeem'd ſtain'd with Blood; and the dreadful Lyon with his guilty Jaws, but half withdrawn within the Neighbouring Thicket: The Streams that flowed with little falls and ſofteſt Murmurs, unknowing how to glide, began to turn to Pools, and Stagnate; inſtead of murmuring ſounds, to Croke with Frogs that plunged from out the Weeds and Ruſhy Banks; as if the incenſed Goddeſs had made another Metamorphoſis of all the Ruſtick Inhabitants, for their ſurly rudeneſs: ſad <hi>Progne Tereus,</hi> and poor <hi>Itis</hi>'s Tale, took up her ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering thoughts that only wak'd but now, to Dream ſo ſweetly: The clear Sky, and ſerene Air, that juſt before glar'd, and enlighten'd all the Hemiſphere, was dwindled into a few faint glimmerings, or a gloomy Miſt, juſt light enough to let them ſee the <hi>harmleſs</hi> Graſs whereon one while they ſoft and <hi>ſafely</hi> trod, ſtrewed o're with Adders, Snakes and Serpents; whoſe hiſſing Heads,

            <p>While at her trembling Feet <hi>a grave Old Matron ſtood, with grim</hi> Meduſa'<hi>s Head, whoſe Curled-Locks ſeem'd falling on the Ground, and to produce thoſe Vipers in the Graſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this the frightned <hi>Vicentina</hi> wak'd, ſurpriz'd to ſee her Mother at the end of the Bed, and ſoftly opening of the Curtains; which, (perceiving her Daughter to ſtir) ſhe ſoon drew and ſaluted her with a Good-Morrow: The latter part of the Dream had put the Young Lady into a little Cold-Sweat; which the Old Counfeſs took notice of; but the Fair Daughter as handſomely palliated the matter, by imputing it to her putting her Head under the Bed-Cloaths, while ſhe ſlept: but after this Melancholly Viſion that followed ſo pleaſant a Dream, the riſing Sun ſhone in upon the Bed,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47692:26"/>
and promiſed a glad and joyful Day; which occaſioned the Counteſs-Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager to have a finer opportunity, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting the Young Lady to take the Air in her Coach, in ſo lovely a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vicentina,</hi> that was always obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant enough, did not much reſiſt her Mother's deſires, and was as ſoon dreſt; and with her Dear <hi>Druſilla,</hi> accompanied her to the Coach: but ſtill ruminating on the ſtrange Dream, and the wondrous Revolutions that had befel her in her laſt ſleep; the latter part ſhe was glad was but a Dream, and as ſorry that the former part of it was ſo too; for the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of which ſweet Repoſe ſhe could have ſlept Eternally: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe thought this happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude of her Love, might portend as ſad a Cataſtrophe; and then agen her Reaſon ſway'd, and rejected Dreams as Fooliſh and Fantaſtick, and to have no other Effects or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, but in the idle predictions of their dull Expoſitors; but by this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47692:27"/>
time the Driver (well inſtructed as before) began by his making ſuch haſte, to let the Young Lady ſee ſhe was not brought out only for to take the Air; for inſtead of gently driving round a pleaſant Hill, whoſe top advanc'd up to Serener Air, was all o're-grown with wholeſome Health, whoſe dry and Thirſty clefts gap'd down upon the watry Sea that waſh'd the barren Mountains ſertile fect; and ſo afforded the lov'd proſpect to the longing ſight, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Waters bounded with the Skies. The furious Charioteer, (I ſay) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſoſtly driving round the pleaſant Mountains top, ran directly over it, with all the haſte his Horſes heels could make or carry: And then too late the Alarm'd Lady ſaw ſhe was deceived, and carried only from the expected ſight of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured Lover, and a Youth ſhe ſo entirely Lov'd.

as ſhe forc'd her ſelf to think it, ſhe found now to be too truly foreboding; and ſo not able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her ſelf under the weight of ſo much grief and fear, ſell down into the Arms of <hi>Druſilla,</hi> in a deep and dangerous ſwound; out of which, by the time they were arrived at the Caſtle of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> by <hi>Druſills</hi> rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of her Temples, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the Fair one, where he had already fixt his Heart, he reſolv'd patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enquire for what Intelligence he could get, and of the manner of her going off; and long it was not before he was informed (this Amour beginning to be the talk of the Town) that the Counteſs-Dowager carrying her out one Morning, upon pretence of taking the Air, had convey'd her to her Country Seat, their famous Caſtle of <hi>Ogliano;</hi> ſome Twenty Miles diſtant from the City, where ſhe was detained under her Mothers Eye, with a great deal of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection: That the Old Counteſs had made all her Domeſticks to keep Watch and Ward over her; and that ſhe had committed her more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the charge of one whoſe Duty it was to take care of Souls as well as Bodies; the Learned Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Caſtrucio Caſtrado,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Prieſt, whoſe Godly Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could not but make her lead a Life very <hi>Regular:</hi> That the Young

Lady when ſhe perceived ſhe was thus deceived, by the cunning of the Old, fainted away in the Coach, as ſhe was hurried away.

Love and Honour had agreed to pull on both Boots before; but theſe warm Lines like the Spirits of good Wine, put ſuch a Spur in our Hero's head, that was ten times better than the tother two in his heels; which he clapp'd both preſently to the ſide of his Horſe, and ſo ſalli'd forth out at the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Port, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient till he arrived to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that Fair Creature, whoſe obliging diſpoſition was ſuch as to Compaſſionate a poor Stranger's ſufferings, and to Crown his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with her own Love.</p>

The Old Lady ſeemingly took no further notice of this; but only to return theſe warm expreſſions, with this cold Compliment, That Young Gallants were thus uſed to rally on the frailties of weak Women; and to ramble into wild diſcourſes of their praiſes and perfections, only to ſhew their own Eloquence, and by commending <hi>their</hi> Sexes Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, to take an opportunity of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth their <hi>own</hi> Abilities: and ſo with an Amorous Smile, and a grave bow to the Fair <hi>Helvetian,</hi> would have forced off the Diſcoure from her Daughter's Amours, and (but that ſhe was Married to the Noble Lord of <hi>Ogliano)</hi> could have wiſh'd the Addreſſes made to her ſelf.

and ſo abruptly replied; <hi>Madam, The Affection that I have declared for your Fair Daughter, though it ſeem not to affect you, yet I aſſure you is not meerly Complimental or Counterfeit, but a real Paſſion: It has been my Honour and Happineſs to have ſeveral times ſeen her;</hi> but alas! <hi>the firſt ſight was ſufficient to make ſuch an Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Beautiful Idea in my Heart, that all the remainder of my Life can never raiſe or eradicate.</hi> He would have gone on; when the Tart Old Lady, with a Brow that wrinkled without a Frown, took him up as ſharply: <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Your ſtrange Addreſs is very ſurprizing to me; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that am unknown to you: and from you above all, who both by your</hi> own <hi>Accent, as well as</hi> others <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, are not only a Stranger to me, but the Country; and if you have ſuch an Affection for my Daughter, I muſt aſſure you, 'tis moſt Unfortunately plac'd, for to my knowledge ſhe has nothing like it for your ſelf.</hi> This ſeemed a

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47692:35"/>
her Curioſity ſo far to overcome her reſentment, as to examine them; and ſeeing them ſomewhat to agree with her Daughter's Hand, if not the very ſame, diſſembles her Paſſion, to diſcover the depth of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's, (though two very different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mind) and ſo parting from the paſſionate Stranger, tells him ſhe'll Examine the Lady <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> upon the Contents of thoſe Papers.</p>
            <p>Rage now poſſeſſing her, inſtead of Reaſon, away ſhe runs up to the panting <hi>Vicentina,</hi> whoſe Heart ſeemed to labour under a Thouſand concerns for her Lover, for her ſelf, under Hope, Deſpair, Love and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety; ſo that the Pulſations of her Breaſt could keep no Time; and went faſter than the Pendulum of her Watch: when the Old Lady en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and began to ring the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</p>
            <p>See, falſe <hi>Vicentina!</hi> See perfidious Girl! To what a ſad paſs you have

enrag'd; and then you'l ſoon ſee, that ſimilitude of Hands is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Convict any Perſon; and that Letters have been often Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited in matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concern, by dextrous and deſigning Knaves: And who knows but this poor Gentleman may be as much deluded as I am abuſed; for I diſown them utterly (looking upon thoſe <hi>Druſilla</hi> had Compoſed). This calmed a little the Impetuoſity of her Paſſion; and will you then aver this (ſaid the Old Counteſs a little more Calmly) to the Gentleman's <hi>Face?</hi> Yes, indeed, ſaid the cunning <hi>Vicentina,</hi> (who deſired nothing more than to ſee it) I am ready to aver it to his <hi>Face,</hi> and that my Hand was never to thoſe Writings; come then with me, ſaid the Counteſs-Dowager, and put an end to your Mother's trouble, and your own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance; and let this deluded and abuſed Young Gentleman know what he has to truſt to; how much he

has been deceived; and that he puts an end to that Paſſion which will only run him into ſo many Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and in which he can <hi>never</hi> hope to accompliſh his deſires. This word <hi>never</hi> ſounding like Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Everlaſtring Torment to <hi>Vicentina,</hi> had almoſt put her into a Swound, in which indeed ſhe might have paſt away to her Eternal Reſt: but her Mother's bidding her to follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made her pluck up her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and go after; and <hi>Druſilla</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, deſcended into the great Hall.</p>

Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I muſt always acknowledge your tender care in my Education; and that I cannot make ſufficient returns for that Motherly Affection you have always ſhown me; and ſhould I do any Act contrary to your good liking, much leſs be guilty of downright Diſobedience, I muſt needs be the vileſt Creature Living. And as for this Gentleman, with whom you challenge me to have had ſuch intimate Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to ſend him the Letters here produced, I do declare before him and you, (taking up one of thoſe <hi>Druſilla</hi> had imitated her hand in) that this is none of my writing; that ſome perſon has Counterfeited my Hand to abuſe both the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and my ſelf; and as for this worthy Gentleman, (for ſo his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence beſpeaks him;) He is a Stranger to me, and with whom I never had any Converſe: 'tis true indeed, I have ſeen him often in the great Church, Madam, when at my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47692:40"/>
and frequently ſeen him paſs the Streets, without being ever in his Company; nay, I have <hi>praiſed</hi> him, as well as heard him <hi>Commended</hi> for a Comely Perſon (and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Stranger, I think may deſerve ſo much Commendation); but I hope, Madam, all this may be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any injury to Modeſty; much leſs be ſo maliciouſly interpreted, as to be made matter of Love and Amour. If the <hi>Noble</hi> Foreigner (for I muſt give the <hi>Gallant</hi> Perſon, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, ſo much his due, that I think him of no mean Birth and Deſcent) has made himſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be in Love with me, that am never like to be his, and who am ſubject wholly to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſpoſal, it muſt be attributed to his misfortune, and not to my fault; all that I can ſay to him is, that perhaps he deſerves a better Miſtreſs to Crown his Affections, and that in his <hi>own Country,</hi> where his Perfections being <hi>more</hi> known,

            <p>She would have gone on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in ſome further Panegyrick: but the Counteſs-Dowager began to be afraid of theſe fine words; and was glad her Daughter diſowned the Letters, and was willing ſhe ſhould break off with our Hero, juſt where ſhe had Complimented him back again into his <hi>own Country,</hi> and where the Old Lady wiſh'd him with all her heart.

               <hi>Armadorus,</hi> that was got on ſo far in his Affair, in a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to meet with ſuch an Embarraſt Intriegue, was almoſt <hi>eſtranged</hi> from himſelf; and like <hi>Strangers</hi> in an Houſe where they were never before, knew hardly the way where he came in, or by which way he was to get out; when the Young Lady's heart began to <hi>ake,</hi> for the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47692:41"/>
that <hi>his</hi> was in: and with as much <hi>Wit</hi> as <hi>Good-humour,</hi> told her Mother, <hi>That</hi> ſhe hop'd ſhe would look on it only as a Specimen of that Good breeding ſhe had beſtow'd upon her, and not in the leaſt an Indication of her Love and good liking to the unknown Stranger, if ſhe thought it was but handſome if her Ladyſhip ſhewed him the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that are commonly due to Strangers; and which ſhe thought even ſhe her ſelf might do without any breach of Modeſty, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would ceaſe all other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and that without the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Love and Affection; Pity and Compaſſion required ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy to be ſhown the Gentleman that had been ſo baſely Impoſed upon, and <hi>Deluded.</hi> This made the Old Counteſs relent a little, and make the Aſtoniſh'd <hi>Armadorus</hi> a cold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to ſtay <hi>Dinner.</hi> But his Stomack was full with the <hi>Breakfaſt</hi> they had given him: However this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47692:41"/>
cunning Diſcourſe of <hi>Vicentina,</hi> gain'd that point, that the ſtay was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed; and that the Mother's Eyes did not ſo exactly watch the Lovers: when <hi>Armadorus</hi> perceiving ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the breaſt of <hi>Vicentina,</hi> (who had withdrawn her ſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Accident or Deſign, to the remoteſt part of the Room) eagerly ſteps up to the Window where ſhe ſtood, and with a ſubmiſſive Voice, as well as geſture, thus briefly and paſſionately Expreſſes himſelf. <hi>And is it true then, Madam,</hi> that I am this Poor, Miſerable, Deluded; and abuſed Perſon? Are none of thoſe dear Lines then your own; that I have <hi>hugg'd</hi> ſo long, as <hi>the Records</hi> of my <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Treaſured as the <hi>Evidences</hi> of my <hi>Life?</hi> Ten thouſand times more dear to me than thoſe of my <hi>Eſtate?</hi> Alas! wretched <hi>Armadorus, doubly wrack'd to periſh in the Port:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Compaſſionate Madam, a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, ſinking Man; <hi>A Shipwrack'd Stranger, beaten on your Shoars; and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47692:42"/>
lend one helping hand to keep the next Wave from waſhing him away:</hi> Tho' I may have been ſo miſerably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon as to found my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon a malicious piece of <hi>Forgery</hi> of your Letters; yet I am ſure, I am not miſtaken in your Ladyſhip, in your Perſon; that is too pure to be <hi>Counterfeit;</hi> and the firſt ſight I had of it, made too deep an impreſſion in my breaſt, that I ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in its Idea.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Vicentina</hi>'s Heart was ſo <hi>ſoft</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you may be ſure it was now <hi>melting</hi> away at theſe <hi>tender</hi> expreſſions from a perſon ſhe as <hi>tenderly</hi> Lov'd; her Eyes <hi>trembled</hi> and <hi>twinkled</hi> like two little <hi>Stars,</hi> that were <hi>fixt</hi> on him, tho' they <hi>moved</hi> in their own Orbs; her <hi>Lips</hi> quaver'd for an anſwer they were hardly <hi>able</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, and her <hi>Tongue</hi> that would have <hi>ſpoke, falter'd;</hi> her <hi>Breaſts heaved</hi> and <hi>ſtrugled</hi> with thoſe <hi>ſighs</hi> ſhe ſo violently endeavoured to <hi>ſuppreſs;</hi> her <hi>heart failed her</hi> for having uttered ſo much

already, as to make her Dear <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> believe ſhe had <hi>failed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perceiving her Mother to be more regardleſs ſince the matter ſeemed to be cleared now; or elſe caſually gone out of the Room, ſhe took Courage to make this Ingenious Reply and Confeſſion; <hi>Sir,</hi> You are indeed, as I have truly confeſſed to my Mother, an utter <hi>Stranger</hi> to me: having never till now had any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you; this you know to be true, as well as my ſelf; and your indiſcretion (which pardon if I call it ſo, when perhaps it might be imputed to the ardour of your Affection) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo raſhly expoſed thoſe Letters to my Mother's view, has put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great pain how to Extricate my ſelf and you from that labyrinth of difficulties to which that raſh adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has expoſed us to; I can't but confeſs that I have a great deal of <hi>eſteem</hi> for your Perſon; and were you not a Stranger to our Nation, it might bear the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47692:43"/>
but alas! ſuch is my misfortune, that I dare not call it by the <hi>right name;</hi> and for thoſe Letters you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, though I might really diſown them, as I did, they having not been <hi>Penn'd</hi> by me, at leaſt the firſt; yet I muſt own I was not altogether a ſtranger to their <hi>Penning;</hi> and what I've ſaid, and done, has been both with a ſalvo to my Conſcience and Reputation, as well as for your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and a further Correſpondence.</p>
            <p>The tranſported Youth could hardly contain himſelf, but burſting out into this Extatick Expoſtulation; And am I then brought back from the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Deſpair,</hi> to be <hi>plunged</hi> into an <hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>Eternal Happineſs?</hi> He would have <hi>dilated</hi> himſelf into more <hi>Pathetick</hi> Exclamations, and turned all the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> into <hi>Ecphoneſis</hi> and <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> but time cut him ſhort, and put him upon the Apoſeiopeſis;—leaving her to Expound what he would have ſaid had he not been forc'd to this abrupt

ſilence: but, <hi>Madam,</hi> added he (to begin where your Ladyſhip ended) where may be this happy place, where I may have one hour of your farther Converſation, or Correſpondence? Is there no Grove, nor Grot, no Wood, nor Covert, no quiet Retirement near your Houſe, where I may have ſome ſecret acceſs to your Perſon? for tho' our Affections are no way Criminal; more Innocent than thoſe of our firſt Parents in Paradiſe; and that we need not ſo much as a Fig-leaf to cover us; yet I'le venture through any dangers and difficulties to bring my Affairs to that happy period, and prize that one moment of my Life, more than all my Years that are paſt, or whole Ages that are to come: The Young Lady, like Lovers that are loath to loſe time; let him know, that behind their Palace-Garden, (or juſt at the end of it) there was a little place of no common acceſs to which if he would repair ſuch a Night, ſhe would be found there; in the mean

time adviſing him to take the ſooner leave to give the leſs umbrage to the Mother, who by this time too was returned into the Great-Hall; and ſeeing her Daughter as it were in ſome Diſcourſe with the Stranger, moving up toward them,—<hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> Addreſt himſelf in this manner, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſince it is my misfortune to be ſo treacherouſly impoſed upon by ſome abuſive Villains, that deſigned maliciouſly to abuſe your Daughter as well as my ſelf; I am reſolved to make my utmoſt effort for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of thoſe Execrable Authors, not ſo much for my own ſake, as for the good Ladies that ſuffers with me: It was indeed my haſty Ambition, raiſed by the excellencies of this Ladies perfections, that made me ſo eaſily credit thoſe Counterfeited Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors; my Credulity I now as much Condemn, as I do my Deſtiny, that has brought me to this unhappy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; I only wiſh this Fair Lady a Perſon anſwerable to her
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47692:44"/>

            <p>The Old Counteſs glad to ſee the Affair ſo finely daſh'd, was as loath now to part with the Youthful <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian;</hi> and could have wiſh'd her ſelf almoſt Unmarried for his ſake: but the Young Hero, the better to take of all ſuſpicion, pretended the Poſt he was in, and his relation to the Publick, required his preſence, and precluded him from thoſe Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhe intended him; and ſo with a languiſhing Eye, and as ſorrowful <hi>Heart,</hi> he made his <hi>Obeyſance</hi> to her that commanded <hi>it,</hi> with a Courteous though more negligent bow to the Old Lady, and ſo left them: but far from thoſe diſconſolate thoughts that he once thought he ſhould have parted with; his whole mind, and all the faculties of his Soul were rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating upon the happy hour, and the place wherein he was to have the Company of her, for whom he could have gone a Pilgrimage over the

Globe. The Evening being coming on, it being not long after the laſt interview; the Gallant <hi>Armadorus</hi> (that never violated his promiſe to any <hi>Man,</hi> you may be ſure would leſs fail a <hi>Woman,</hi> and one to whom his very Soul was devoted) ſet forth from the City where his Poſt <hi>was,</hi> toward the place where his tender Heart was to <hi>be:</hi> a more agreeable encounter than the pointed Pike, or Steeled Javelin; and the ſoft Lips of his beloved Lady made him March more contenredly than he was wont againſt the Roaring Mouth of a Cannon: Tho' <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Bellona,</hi> with our Hero, had their Charms too, as well as the fineſt <hi>Juno,</hi> or faireſt <hi>Venus</hi> of them all; but here in his Adored Miſtreſs he thought them <hi>all</hi> met, <hi>all</hi> that was <hi>Deity,</hi> all that was <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was about the dusk of a Ruddy Evening, that promiſed a fair Day, when the ſinking Sun had fringed the neighbouring Clouds with a glorious Reflection, that he rid-out from the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47692:46"/>
Renowned City, toward the ſweet place of his Amorous Rendezvous; and his Journey being <hi>Weſtward,</hi> had the <hi>glaring beams</hi> of that little <hi>glimmering</hi> Light that was left, reflected on his Face; this he looked on as a good Omen and Preſage to his future Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, of which he was as Ambitious, as that <hi>Perſian</hi> that obtain'd a Crown by firſt ſeeing the Sun to riſe; and ſo indeed might well Worſhip it: <hi>all</hi> that was <hi>bright,</hi> all that was <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> to him, was to meet him amidſt the very <hi>Shades</hi> of <hi>Night;</hi> and which like a <hi>Phoſpherus</hi> could <hi>ſhine</hi> beſt even through the thickeſt <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things were huſht, and Nature in repoſe, nought but theſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lovers was awake; the very Birds of Night were percht and faſt aſleep, forgetful of their time to roam abroad?—Forgive, <hi>Druſilla,</hi> that we thee forget, thou careful, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature to them both, and 'twas for both of them you Centry ſtood, you with them wak'd for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47692:47"/>
both.—Whilſt in this quiet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>ſtill</hi> Night, the lovely <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> did arrive, ſo ſtill it was, they heard his Horſes hoofs that at a diſtant did rebound and ſhook the trembling Earth, and <hi>Vicentina</hi>'s ſympathizing Heart.</p>
            <p>The gay <hi>Helvetian,</hi> led by Love, (as blind as the little god is ſaid to be) prov'd a good Guide and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel, bringing him directly to the Poſtern-gate of that Garden, where they had appointed to meet: <hi>Armadorus</hi> approaching, could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh even the ſoft whiſperings that paſt between <hi>Druſilla</hi> and his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſtreſs from the eaſy repercuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were made on ſo free and open an Air; and found his heart affected with a more than ordinary tranſport at ſo joyful an approach; no ſooner did he alight at that Gate of his Paradiſe, where there was no Angel, no Flaming Cherub placed to drive him off, but invite him in; no ſooner did he make a ſign of

Knocking, and a ſoft Whiſper through the Keyhole, but <hi>Druſilla</hi> was ready to let into the <hi>Arms</hi> of her <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> the Noble Youth, whom ſhe knew to be <hi>Maſter</hi> of her <hi>Heart: Armado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> after his awful Reſpects paid, with the Licenſe of a Lover, took the liberty to take the fair <hi>Vicentina</hi> by the Hand, and conducting her to a ſoft Bank of Moſſy-graſs, and the moſt convenient place for them to ſeat themſelves on at ſuch a diſtance from the finer Walks of the Houſe, where they might not be heard, much leſs ſeen; The Young Lady, with the liberty that one might well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to take that lov'd ſo well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to chide more lovingly, than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily, his raſh diſcovery of thoſe Letters to the Lady-<hi>Dowager,</hi> enough to have undone them both for ever, had ſhe not ſo ſhuffl'd the Cards, as to get a good after-game at laſt. <hi>Armadorus</hi> had nothing to urge in his Defence, but his Paſſion for her ſelf alone, that tranſported his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47692:48"/>
beyond his Reaſon; and hoped that ſince he was ſo willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bear her kind Rebukes; ſhe would as kindly, and as eaſily forgive his Tranſgreſſion, into which the blindneſs of his Love and Paſſion had cauſed him to fall; and that now, ſince it was their happineſs, as to be able to concert Matters together more freely; they would be capacitated to manage them the better for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They were both agreed (you may be ſure) to be very indulgent to one another, and neither could ask the leaſt modeſt Requeſt, which, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his part was not as ready to grant; ſo this Pardon was granted as ſoon as askt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armadorus</hi> preſſing of her fair hand, could not but imprint on her Cherry Lips an eager Kiſs; which ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd rather to be <hi>ſtolen</hi> then allow'd, only perhaps that it might ſeem the <hi>ſweeter:</hi> The Starry Sky, with the Luſtre their own brightneſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brought with it, afforded them

Light enough to diſcover one anothers Pefections; and thus ſate theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Lovers repeating their paſt Adventures with a pleaſantry that ſweetned the Diſcourſe from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they had paſt; and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to prevent all Dangers; Diſturbances, and Interruptions for the future. Whilſt <hi>Druſilla</hi> had now changed her Poſt, and was keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi> near the great Door of the Garden that came out from the Caſtle of <hi>Ogliano;</hi> and as vigilantly proud of her Office, as the Centry-Gooſe that ſav'd the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol.</hi>

the foreboding Dream ſhe had the Morning before her Mother hurried her away; and at length repeated it to her Deareſt <hi>Armadorus,</hi> who pleas'd with the beginning of it, diſſatisfied with the end, and ſurpriſed at the whole, comforted her in theſe words,—<hi>Had it not been, Deareſt</hi> Vicentina, the deſigns of our Fates and Deſtinies (though through many Difficulties, by which they only endear their Bleſſings) to make us at laſt happy, they had never permitted us thoſe happy Minutes we now enjoy. 'Tis a Maxim among the blindeſt Heathens, and taught by Chriſtians too in their Schools, that their Fate, or our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, never order'd any thing in vain. Thoſe Stars that we ſee there twinkling above us, are not only Witneſſes, and the only too, of our unfeigned Loves; but the Archives and Records, where the future Events of it, and our Fate is writ.

            <p>Theſe Rovings, and Rallying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, while time and the Night lay upon their Hands, helpt them on to paſs both away, intermixing with thoſe more ſerious and ſullen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, ſome pleaſant Sallies of Love and Amour: But <hi>Druſilla</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from the Houſe-ſide, to inform them that ſhe heard the Cocks begin to clap their Wings, and were juſt going to Crow, they thought it time

to fall to their buſineſs; looking up too to the Skies, and perceiving a Dawning Azure to break out from behind the Sable Curtain of the Night, which was juſt a drawing, and which haſted them to theſe neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, 1.

            <p>It was the Young Counteſs's ſole concern now, how to come up to the Capital City of that Province, to concert Matters according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her Dear <hi>Armadorus:</hi> To come up with the Mother's Privity, lookt like an Inſuperable difficulty; and to ſteal away clandeſtinely, would raiſe in her the greater Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy;

ſo that this was a task that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a ſerious Conſultation between <hi>Druſilla</hi> and her ſelf; but ſo pregnant is the Wit of Woman, that it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at a loſs for Contrivances: Her faithful <hi>Druſilla,</hi> that never fail'd her, had found out this Expedent; To propoſe to the Lady-mother Her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to Embrace thoſe Propoſals made her by the Young Signior <hi>Ricco</hi> (a Perſon for whom the Old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs had a great deal of Inclination, both for his Perſonal qualities as well as his Wealth and Eſtate); And that it was neceſſary to bring Matters ſooner to a Concluſion, that the Young Lady ſhould reſide ſome time in the City, where the Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was arriv'd, till all things were ſettl'd to both their Satisfaction, and ready for Conſummation; this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Druſilla</hi>'s being well laid, was lik'd as well by <hi>Vicentina;</hi> and ſo both dreſſing it up in the beſt manner they could, offer'd it to the conſideration of the Counteſs-Dowager: The good

Old Lady was ready to melt into Tears at this dutiful compliance of her dear Daughter; Propheſied of nothing but Showers of Bleſſings, the Dew of Heaven to deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Head; and ſo gave her her own Benediction into the bargain, and began to Expound in a long Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph upon the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The reſult of it was, That the Young Counteſs was to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the next Morning in her Coach, well attended, to the City, to reſide there in a fair Manſion-Houſe, the reſidence formerly of the Old Counteſs of <hi>Albania,</hi> and to what the Young Counteſs after the Mother's deceaſe was Heir apparent. <hi>Vicentina</hi> could hardly Sleep that Night, you may imagine, for ruminating on the Bleſſed arrival of the next Morning. All her Dreams (if ſhe had time to ſlumber into any) were all of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Lovers here above, and the bleſt abodes, and <hi>Elyſian</hi> ſhades below:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47692:54"/>
The next riſing Sun, which could not prevent her from being up firſt, found her dreſt and apparell'd for her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and with his kind Beams ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to make it look more auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; which (after a little warm Collations of Caudles and Sack-poſſet, which the Old Counteſs could excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well prepare) ſhe ſoon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, parting from her tender Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an <hi>Heavy</hi> Countenance, and as <hi>light</hi> an Heart, letting her know as her laſt words at departure, (which put the Lady-Dowager into a joyful fit of Tears and Extaſy) that ſhe hop'd ſoon to ſee her ſelf up to their City-habitation, to ſee her joyn'd in that Holy Matrimony ſhe intended for her; and ſo left the good Old Lady in the Arms of her Maids, ready to melt away for Joy.</p>

When in Converſation with thoſe of her own Sex, ſhe was wont to be ſuddenly ſeiz'd with thoughtful Sullenneſs, and ſo with the uſual raillery taxt with <hi>Love</hi> by her merry Companions, to be ſure ſhe would return ſome negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or contemptuous Anſwer to any Interrogatories, or pleaſant Queries, put her about her Hero, the <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> That <hi>Je ne ſcai quoy;</hi> that, <hi>What do ye call him?</hi> The Outlandiſh-man, and the like; and then turn her whole Rhetorick into Praiſes and Panegyricks upon the Accompliſhments and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of Signior <hi>Ricco;</hi> but her <hi>Armadorus</hi> at the next Encounter was to know how cunningly her Tongue had given her Heart the lye; nay, ſo well had ſhe order'd her Affairs, that while ſhe was entertaining in one Room her <hi>Mother</hi>'s Favourite, ſhe would place her <hi>own</hi> in the next, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47692:55"/>
make him privy to all that paſt. This Ambidextrous Dealing (which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>fairneſs</hi> of the Sex can excuſe from <hi>foul</hi> play) did ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ſome conſiderable time, till the Counteſs-<hi>Dowager,</hi> whether out of diſtruſtful Jealouſy, or affectionate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee her hopeful Daughter, ſent for her again into the Country, with a Reſolution, as 'twas thought, there to compleat what ſhe ſuppos'd had been ſo long in Agitation, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Marriage with the Gentleman ſhe had deſign'd for her, and whom her Daughter ſeem'd to have choſen for her ſelf at her parting.

This <hi>Cannonading</hi> Language and <hi>Bombardous</hi> Style, tho it might come agreeable enough from a Souldier that is ſuppoſed to <hi>Thunder,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when <hi>Lightning,</hi> or his <hi>bright</hi> Miſtreſs is before his eyes; Yet this was not <hi>Armadorus</hi>'s way of writing or Diſcourſe; which was always ſoft and ſweet, eaſy and good-humour'd, and of a clean contrary Air; but here was the Bombaſt wiſely affected by him, for he conſidered the caution his Lady had given him, leſt the Anſwer from him ſhould by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fall into her Mothers hand; this he thought would ſpoil the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating</hi> Journey, upon which they were ready to ſet out; ſo that if the Old Lady ſhould by miſhap meet with this, <hi>Vicentina's</hi> Wit and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſoon put it off for a Banter; and 'twas well for both that it was ſo managed; for the Counteſs-Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager finding the Lad wanting, had watch'd his return, and on his firſt unlighting took him into her Cuſtody,

Moſt unfortunate Child! muſt my Heart never be at reſt for you? muſt I be always thus Tormented, Alarmed, Afflicted, with new matters for fear and Jealouſy? See here a new ſet of Addreſſes, ſo impudently offer'd you, as if you were going to Church to be Inſtantly Married: This muſt come from your old Suitor <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> that I thought had been long ſince lay'd aſide; or elſe ſome New Hectoring Spark, that has hopes of carrying you by Bluſterings and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadoes; yet his Letter ſeems to Anſwer one of yours that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and I have brought the Boy to Confeſs that <hi>Druſilla</hi> delivered him a Paper, Sealed and Directed to the Gentleman that delivered him this.</p>
            <p>The Young Counteſs, tho' a little ſtartled at the Adventure; yet upon peruſal of the Letter, ſoon ſaw ſhe had room enough left to evade: And boldly told her Mother that it was nothing but a meer piece of Banter and Roguery: That the Letter <hi>Druſilla</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:47692:60"/>
had ſent by the Boy, was about common buſineſs to a Tradeſman; and that her Maid was ready to vouch the ſame to the Boy's Face, which accordingly being called, <hi>Druſilla</hi> did (as well ſhe might); for <hi>Armadorus</hi>'s Letter her Miſtreſs left with her to ſend, ſhe had encloſed in that to a Friendly Citizen to be Communicated as directed; and that which the Boy Received, was from a ſtrange hand, and perſon that he could only ſay was a Gentleman by his looks and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: ſo the unlucky Lad was left at ſtake; and being too young to make diſcoveries, could not unriddle the Plot he was like to ſuffer for; for the Old Lady a little better pleaſed with her Daughter upon the preſumption that ſhe had been banter'd and abus'd, turned all her Reſentment upon the Innocent Lad, for Receiving of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from unknown Gentlemen for his Young Miſtreſs; and that he might the better remember his fault for the future, exerciſed the Rod

as pleaſing to his <hi>Vicentina,</hi> as it was terrifying to the Canonical Courage of her Guardian Divine, that but juſt before had thunder'd out ſuch defiance; but now his heart failed him, and was got below his Girdle; and tho the Courteous <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaluted him kindly, he was ready to piſs in his Boots, which he did not ſtay to pull off, but like the Night-Bird that had ſeized ſome prey which ſhe dropt at the ſight of the Nobler Hawk, and makes haſt away; ſo was the flight of this Renowned and moſt Reverend Hero; Poſt he rid, but backward, leaving his comely Charge at the mercy of that Friendly Foe, that certainly never came to do her much hurt; and the <hi>Out-guards</hi> being thus fled, or defeated, the <hi>Caſtle</hi> was ready for <hi>Capitulation;</hi> and the Articles of ſurrender being ſoon agreed on, they were ſolemnly ſeal'd and ratified the next Morning, in the adjacent Pariſh-Church; and the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Helvetian,</hi> to the Crowning
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47692:63"/>
of all his <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Fortreſs</hi> he had <hi>Beſieged</hi> ſo long, that very Night.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Gallant <hi>Armadorus,</hi> and the Comely <hi>Vicentina</hi> were Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Bedded, and (as they thought) to their Eternal Content and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The joys they conceiv'd, to find themſelves approaching thoſe mutual Embraces that ſweet <hi>Hymen</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in ſtore for Innocent Lovers in their Marriage-Bed, did almoſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate thoſe enjoyments they were to find in it. The Vertuous <hi>Vicentina,</hi> unknowing of thoſe joys ſhe was ſo ſenſibly to feel, trembled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Nuptial-Bed, with a ſort of eager Fear, that ſeemed to edge her forward, while ſtill afraid; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhe knew was to be done, that look'd like <hi>dying;</hi> and the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Death</hi> will always carry ſome terror with it to a <hi>tender Maid;</hi> and though one Foot was enter'd the Liſts, the other made a ſtand, to conſider with her ſelf whether ſhe was to <hi>dye</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47692:63"/>
indeed; for her Ingenuity had led her often to read the beſt Hiſtories of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; where thoſe Immortal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſo feelingly Recorded, that ſhe could not but be ſenſibly touch'd at what ſhe was about to do: ſhe had ſeen there how their eager lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments were deſcribed to the Life, their Eyes lifted up, as if they were ready to be cloſed; their labouring Breaſts, and their panting Breath, as on the point to expire: theſe were Terrors enough to have pall'd the Courage of any <hi>Amazon,</hi> or the Stouteſt of the Female Sex, much more the Young Counteſs's that had been ſo carefully Educated, as to know none of theſe things, but only by Reading and Contemplation: There was no diſpute here between <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that made once the One Boot to go on, and the other off; but <hi>Love</hi> here, and <hi>Honour</hi> both, agreed to pull off <hi>both</hi> Stockings; and ſhe yielding at laſt to the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and Encouragements of thoſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47692:64"/>
about her; and conſidering alſo, tho ſhe was ſoon to <hi>Dye,</hi> that there was as great hopes of as ſudden a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſhe enter'd at laſt the liſts <hi>boldly,</hi> looking about for that Gallant Man, by whoſe Victorious Sword ſhe was but now ſo much afraid to fall.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the Noble <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madorus</hi> had no ſuch ſenſible diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and troubleſom <hi>Emotions;</hi> he had made many a Campaign, and ſtar'd all ſorts of <hi>Deaths</hi> in the Face; all that <hi>moved</hi> him, was <hi>Tranſport;</hi> and all that <hi>troubled</hi> him, was <hi>Delay;</hi> for no ſooner did he hear that his Fair Foe expected him, and was ready to give him Battel, or ſuſtain his ſhock and Charge, but he immediately March'd to the Field with his wonted Bravery, only worthy of the Noble <hi>Armadorus;</hi> and both Combatants being undreſt, to ſhow they had neither <hi>falſe</hi> Armor on, but were to Fight it out <hi>fairly</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pure <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and this being a ſort of Duel, beſt to be decided in the dark; The Diſcourſe is beſt cloſed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47692:64"/>
with the putting out the Lights, and the drawing of the Curtain.</p>
            <p>Modeſty here obliges us to make a break,—and leave the defects of theſe fragments, to be ſupplied by thoſe Lovers of either Sex, that have been ſo engaged, or gathered an Idea of it from the Learned Works of <hi>Petronius,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus theſe Gallant Lovers were at laſt engaged, and paſt the <hi>tedious</hi> Night with greater <hi>toyle;</hi> but as ſome are ſaid to <hi>make a toyle of a pleaſure,</hi> (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the Aphoriſm here was truly verified, and) this might be called the <hi>Pleaſure of a toyle.</hi> The Morning-Sun ſaluted them both, lock'd in each others Arms, and made them look like Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts after cloſing, ſtrugling on the ground for Victory. The lovely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs had a new luſtre added to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Complexion from the warmth of the Engagement; and the brisk <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian</hi> was more ruddy with the heat of the Combat; and under ſuch a doubtful Victory, they ſeemed both to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47692:65"/>
bluſh, for being both ſo foiled; but with the Sun they roſe from their Beds, to recruit and refreſh themſelves by the beams of it, as if they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Fight at another meeting with greater Vigour: And tho the Bridal-Solemnity, from the homelineſs of a Country place, did not ſet forth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Gallantry of ſuch Noble Perſonages; yet did their Preſence and Meen make as gallant a ſhow, that was able even to turn a Cottage into a Court; Conſorts of Muſick indeed they wanted, Songs and Epithalami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, Balls and Dances; but tho the Country-Crowders play'd, and <hi>Selin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s Round went about; this look'd more like a <hi>Whitehall-</hi>Wedding, than a <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> or <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> one; for the Bride and Bridegroom, like a King and Queen, made all the figure. The honeſt Pariſh-Prieſt that aſſiſted at the Ceremonies of the Church, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alſo to thoſe of the Nuptial Bed: and look'd as big as a Biſhop, after the Marrying of a Counteſs, and a Couple
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47692:65"/>
of ſuch tranſcendent Quality; and Miſtreſs <hi>Abigail,</hi> now the Lady Vicareſs, was the only perſon that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the next Morning to ſend the Sack-Poſſet: but while this ſmall Caudle is tiffing with the Parſon and his Wife the beſt of the Pariſh; it will be time to relate what became of the Guardian Prieſt, that <hi>fled</hi> for the <hi>ſame;</hi> and left all his <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels</hi> to him that is now <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Vicentina's</hi> Invitation, nor <hi>Armadorus</hi>'s Civil Deportment to him (as we told you) could retrieve his Abdicated Courage; but he fled like a <hi>Wolf</hi> when the bleating <hi>Lamb</hi> is taken from between his Jaws: ſor certain it is, that the Fair <hi>Shepherdeſs Vicentina,</hi> took only <hi>Armadorus</hi> for her true <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> whatever this other <hi>Paſtor</hi> might appear, or pretend to; and never was purer Love ever known in <hi>Arcadia;</hi> but as <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> when the prey is gone, will oft look back and Grin for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe he had loſt, and for fear of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47692:66"/>
Purſuer; ſo did this Reverend Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montado, when routed only with the fight of the Enemy, make haſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with houlings as he went, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his plaints to the regardleſs Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and unrelenting Stones; never <hi>Stopping</hi> till he came to a Water, over which he was to Ferry, which yet could put no <hi>Stop</hi> to his furious flight or Panick Fear.</p>
            <p>For no ſooner was he got into the Boat, and putting off to the other Bank, but he charg'd the Ferry men, whatever they did, to let no ſpark in a <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Blue Coat,</hi> or any <hi>Coat,</hi> but a <hi>Black Coat,</hi> and that they were ſure was no Souldier or Officer, to paſs the Ferry, till they might think that he was paſt being overtaken <hi>(Love</hi> has Wings, and ſo has <hi>fear);</hi> for with that he flies as faſt from his <hi>Andromede,</hi> as ſwift as <hi>Perſeus</hi> did to her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; tho' I think his Excellencies Palfrey did not put in for a <hi>Pegaſus</hi> too: I am ſure the lovely <hi>Armadorus</hi> was with them lookt upon as the

            <p>The Young Counteſs melting into Tears with the ſoftneſs of his Speech, and diſturb'd with the tendency of it to Law and Diſcord, had her Soul divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and her Senſes loſt, between the Love ſhe ſtill retained for him, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhe would ſeem to have for her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but indeed the deepeſt regard that diſordered her, was what ſhe had for her ſelf: The Old Counteſs having inculcated ſo often, that her Husband was a Man of no Fortune, and if of any Fortune, at beſt but a Souldier of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, with ſuch like malicious Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that made the poor Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman confounded, diſtracted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with variety of thought, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of mind, which way to manage her ſelf in ſuch an intricate affair, where ſo many different paſſions and affections, which like winds from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Quarters, were ſporting with her floating Soul like a bubble, both filled and agitated with each blaſt of Air: Inſomuch that theſe fluctuating

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47692:82"/>
ſhe have ſtopt, kept down, the riſing Ball of grief, and ſtrangled in her Breaſt thoſe ſtrugling Paſſions, that would riſe to Choak her; but too weak alas! ſhe was to bear up againſt the Tide of ſwelling Sorrow, or by Imre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Reaſons wiſe Command, to Rally, Rank and File her fierce diſorder'd Spirits; and ſo with lift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up Eyes, and drooping Head ſhe fainted, fell down in her Lover's Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armadorus</hi> ſurprized at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Diſaſter, did all he could to recover her out of her fit, by chafing her hands, rubbing her Temples, and by chance having a Bottle of Salts or Spirits about him, which he applied to her Noſtrils, all the while calling for help and aſſiſtance, which ſoon came in to him; at laſt ſhe began to open one of her languiſhing Eyes, letting them know there was Life enough left, but only the wheels of it a little diſorder'd by ſome ſudden Emotion in the Blood and Spirits; which being compoſed by degrees, ſhe ſoon came to her ſelf:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47692:83"/>
And ſeeing both her Mother and her <hi>Armadorus,</hi> both at the ſame time buſy about her, ſhe recover'd her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion a little the ſooner with a bluſh: And hardly knew whom ſhe ſhould thank firſt, for their friendly offices, and care of her Recovery; ſhe ſaluted both with Duty and Affection; and all paſt over as an Accidental fit, tho' what indeed might here be truly ſo called, <hi>A ſit of the Mother;</hi> neither was this like to be the laſt that the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Old Counteſs was like to bring her to; notwithſtanding which the poor <hi>Armadorus</hi> was traduc'd for it, as if by his Severities, Threatnings, and even Violence offer'd, he had made her fall into that Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armadorus,</hi> after ſeveral opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities he had taken to prevail with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centina,</hi> but with all the mildneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, but all ineffectual and vain; was forc'd at laſt to reſolve to recover that by Law, which was denied him againſt Reaſon; and ſo without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſting his Dear Miſtreſs any more in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47692:83"/>
a matter he found her ſo averſe to, prepar'd himſelf for a Journey to the Capital City, the Metropolis of the Kingdom, there to Conſult with the Men of the greateſt Abilities in their Profeſſions, and the knowledge of the Cuſtoms an Co mmon Uſuages, the Civil and Municipal Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. His deſign he kept to himſelf, and only made his Journey occaſional. But <hi>Vicentina,</hi> tho Love had once blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, was too quick ſighted now to be eaſily deceived; and ſeeing him bent to undertake this long Voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her will and inclination, was very ready to miſtruſt the right matter and meaning of it; and ſo with more haſty Paſſion than ordinary, which was once a ſtranger to her tender Love, told him, ſhe knew his deſign that he went about, that it was to get her Fortunes and Eſtates into his poſſeſſion; but if he mov'd one ſtep towards the Law, he muſt never more expect to ſee her Face.</p>

The Young Hero, tho Love had got once the Aſcendant, and ſomewhat E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated him by the Blandiſhments and ſoftneſſes of his Fair <hi>Venus, Vicentina,</hi> yet he had not wholly Abandon'd <hi>Mars</hi> and his wonted Courage; but anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her now a little more roughly; That it was time for him now to look about for himſelf; and ſince ſhe was in a Combination with her Mother for his Ruin, he was reſolved to take up ſome Commiſſions again in the Army, which her Importunity had cauſed him to lay down; and that this was the chiefeſt buſineſs he went about: that he perceived her wonted Affection for him, that was once ſo warm, was by this time very well cooled; and that the Dangers he ſhould be Expoſed to in a Camp, might quickly rid her of an Husband, for whom ſhe had ſo little Kindneſs and Eſteem, and one that with his continual Careſſes had Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Marriage more like a Lover, and not Governed, or Commanded her like her Lord: and indeed, <hi>Armadorus</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:47692:84"/>
his fondneſs (as 'twas generally thought) Fool'd the Young Lady into a more Refractory Obſtinacy, than was Natural to her Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but as much Marble as ſhe was, ſhe melted into Tears at his talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of expoſing of his Perſon to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of uncertain War. But the Counteſs-Dowager, that deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than by ſome obliging Ball or Bullet to be rid of her Son-in Law, perſuaded her Daughter not to lay it ſo much to heart; that there were Men enough going in the World, and better Husbands to be had: However the piteous <hi>Vicentina</hi> was not become yet ſo obdurate; ſhe wanted a little more of her Mothers Stony Heart to petrify hers; and ſo beſeeched him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly not to think of any ſuch thing, and ſhe would bear with his Abſence for a while, if his occaſions required it, if he would promiſe a return to her, and not to the Army: <hi>Armadorus,</hi> that perhaps never deſigned it, was eaſily prevailed on to promiſe ſo much; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47692:85"/>
ſo for that time affairs ſeemed a little accommodated. He prepared for his Journey, with <hi>Reluctancy</hi> parted from his Spouſe; who throwing her longing Arms about his Neck, ſhowed alſo how <hi>loath</hi> ſhe was to part with him; they ſighed by conſent, and their Tears mingled as they Kiſs'd: They parted indeed, but purſued one another ſo long with their looks, till a cruel diſtance cut off the Communication of their Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armadorus</hi> arrived no ſooner among the <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of the Law thoſe Oracles of the Courts of Juſtice, but you may be ſure he received good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the carrying on the Cauſe, which as yet carried ſomewhat of merit with it; ſo it had with them a promiſing aſpect of Profit too. He came to take Counſel with a Meen that carried Gold in both Hands, and that did declare, he was not come to <hi>Starve</hi> his Cauſe, <hi>In forma Pauperis;</hi> and that was able to make any <hi>Nokes</hi> a <hi>Tertullus</hi> or <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Stiles</hi> a <hi>Chryſoſtomus:</hi> For

            <p>It is a happy thing for a <hi>good Cauſe,</hi> to have a <hi>good Client</hi> too, or ten to one but it miſcarries; <hi>Armadorus</hi> had the good luck to make both theſe ends to meet, and ſo went on merrily with his Negotiation: and firſt to qualify himſelf with the privileges to Traffick as a Native, obtained an Act of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization,</hi> to bring himſelf upon the ſame bottom with thoſe that had dealt ſo <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Tho this Gallant Youth had yet made no progreſs in his Law-Suit, only qualified himſelf by his Naturalization to proſecute one if he had occaſion; yet the Cunning Old Counteſs had very good Intelligence, as appears by the Contents of what ſhe dictated to her Daughter; and thoſe Anonymous Ladies which ſhe muſtered up in the latter end of the Letter, were as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly inſerted, for the perplexing of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47692:90"/>
               <hi>Armadorus,</hi> and the amuſing of <hi>Vicenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> even to madneſs and jealouſy; ſome there were, that thought this bitter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was all of the Young Counteſſes own penning; but ſo much cruelty could never be lodged in a Breaſt that was once ſo loving and tender. <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> at the arrival of this, had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and good fortune to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſtrength; and 'tis well he was a little fortifi'd againſt ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, ſuch ſharp and bitter invective from one that he thought could never have been prevailed upon to hate him; He read it over again and again, disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd his Eyes, and doubted his Senſes; thought the hand counterfeited, and her name forged; but his affection he found forc'd only this fond fancy upon him; he knew her hand too well really to doubt it; all the comfort he had left him, was the hopes that it was the effect of that power her imperious Mother had over her; and tho' it might be of her penning, yet he was perſuaded it was all of the old Ladies inditing; but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47692:91"/>
it did not a little afflict him to find that <hi>Vicentina,</hi> who by all her Mothers threats and ſtratagems, Careſſes and Artifices, could not be prevailed upon to refuſe him for her Husband, could now be won to forſake him when he was ſo, to put her helping hand to ſuch ſevere Satyr and reproach, and that to her languiſhing, (and for ought ſhe knew) her dying <hi>Armadorus.</hi>

               <hi>Ah Vicentina!</hi> cry'd he; (tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch an unexpected alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Ah cruel Creature! Could you write theſe lines, and drop no Tears to waſh away thoſe Blots and black ſtains your Ink ſtill left behind it! every Letter is a Character indeed, but of your unkindneſs; and that Hand you once would have wiſh'd to have wither'd, before it had been guilty of ſuch cruelty to your <hi>Armadorus,</hi> to <hi>deny</hi> him thoſe laſt favours of officious Friendſhip; to catch his dying ſighs, and ſoft expiring Breath; to ſeal his cloſing Eyes, and warm his trembling Lips with one relenting kiſs; to make

Come, unkind, ungrateful Fair; Come <hi>Vicentina,</hi> with your own Hand and pointed Dagger, Stab this Heart of mine, and feel its throbbing pulſe to beat its laſt; rather than thus to wound it at a diſtance, and tear it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder in Effigie. With that his Heart too much oppreſt and ſwoln with grief, ſent forth an heavy ſigh, whilſt his declining Head his Shoulder bore; and the weak ſpine unable to ſupport the lightned Trunk, tho' by late fick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made leſs burthen ſome, the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>As good luck was, the Nurſe and Tender was at Hand, and by the help of ſome Spirits very ſtrong and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, which by a Spoon clapt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his fixed Teeth, and faſtned Jaws, ſhe got within his ratling Throat; he began a little to revive, and by an Emiſſary Groan, the Herald and Embaſſador of Life, let her know that all was not gone yet; and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhe began to get him to himſelf a gain, to which he was no ſooner come, but to himſelf he ſeem'd another Man, and immediately repented for having had ſuch hard thoughts of his ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Vicentina,</hi> and ſo would force a kind conſtruction from a cruel Letter of hers, that had no more mercy in it than an He <hi>Tyger</hi> can be ſaid to have Milk.

With what vain hopes doſt thou, diſſembling Boy, feed the poor deluded flattering Lover! Late it was by the time that <hi>Armadorus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed arriv'd at the Caſtle of <hi>Ogliana,</hi> but not ſo unſeaſonably but that any ſtranger might have found admittance; the Candles were yet burning in the Socket as he knockt, when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all the Snuffs went out, and all the Avenues were Barricado'd, and he himſelf ſhut in between the outer great Gate of the Palace, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Porch of the Houſe; caught like a Vermin (as it were in a Trap) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd from going forward; and his retreat ſhut up behind him: In this woful condition, ſuch as had never yet
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47692:93"/>
befel him in all his wooing, was he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at his wits end; often went he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Window where his deareſt lay, and with a doleful voice call'd up, <hi>My Vicentina!</hi> Then to the Porch as pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively return'd, and with a gentle knock admiſſion craved, but all in vain. His <hi>Vicentina heard,</hi> but would not <hi>hear;</hi> and the Fat Cook-Maid ſnor'd beneath her greaſy Dreſſer, and could not <hi>hear</hi> a Drum.</p>
            <p>Thus lockt up in a pound was the Hero faſt, and forc'd to lodg all that night on the cold ground, hardly faring ſo well as his Horſe, who was better accuſtomed to ſuch a ſort of lodging; and as it happen'd it was very happy that his kind Hoſt, where he laſt ſet up, had kindly forc't upon him a good Campaign Coat; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the violent Rains that fell that night, had infallibly penetrated to his tender Skin, tho' his doleful voice could not to his Ladies harden'd Heart; he had alſo been accuſtom'd from his Youth to lye rough in the Fields when

He could not gueſs at the meaning, or what ſhould merit ſo much barbarity: He could never imagin his Dear <hi>Vicentina</hi> could have come to that exceſs of cruelty, ſo as to ſuffer him to be ſhut out from her preſence, and to lye expoſed in ſuch a night to the open Air, without any thing but his Cloaths, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to cover him; and yet he was ſatisfied ſhe muſt needs have heard his voice, when ſo near to the Window of the Chamber where ſhe alway lay; but for that ſhe was provided of an excuſe from the panick fear that her Mother had put into her head, that he might fire his Piſtols at her, if ſhe look't out.</p>

Thus with penſive Heart, and moſt perplexing Thoughts he paſt away the tedious and uncomſortable Night, till the next Morn broke with the Eaſtern Dawn, ſaluted with approaching Day the longing Eyes of the diſconſolate <hi>Armadorus:</hi> As he had reſted with the Lark that Night, (tho in a colder Neſt) ſo he was up with her too the next Morn; but had not ſo good Appetite to ſing as that Bird generally riſes with; however, being a Perſon of a gay and good Humour, and apt to put the beſt Conſtruction upon the worſt; impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to his fault, that he came ſo late when all the Family was gone to Bed; and ſo being pleaſant, even under his misfortunes, thought it would be a pretty ſort of Gallantry if he ſhould go and Serenade his own Wife under her Chamber-window, and ſurprize her ſo early with his Voice and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: He had obtain'd with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Facility of Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a tolerable and pretty intelligible Pronunciation of the Language of the

Country; and all the defect that he had, ſeem'd only like the little Liſpings of a fine Lady, that at the ſame time advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces her Features, and graces her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and makes both to look more Amorous: He was not to ſeek for Songs on any Subjects, having had ſo much of the <hi>Beaux,</hi> and the Beauteous Sexes Converſation, and <hi>the Academy of Compliments,</hi> that <hi>Courtuous Inſtructor</hi> of Strangers, had alſo paſt his hands; beſides his Voice was pretty tolerable, and more paſſable when his Face was ſeen; for a good Meen and Aſpect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly give the pleaſing turn of a good Air too; it was none of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Voice; ſoft and ſweet, yet high enough to aſcend one Story to reach his Lady's Ear, if it could but have toucht her Heart. Muſes he had no need to invoke. His <hi>Academy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments</hi> had a couple of Sonnets in ſtore, that ſeem'd Set and Compos'd for the very purpoſe; ſo ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Window, he began the ſorrowful old Song, tho indeed

            <p>So home was this woful ditty to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Caſe in every Line of it, that he thought ſhe muſt needs liſten to it, and melt into Tears; but <hi>Marble</hi> indeed might have <hi>wept;</hi> ſhe with her Mother's Enchantments was grown more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; perfect <hi>Flint</hi> or <hi>Adamant,</hi> and thoſe <hi>hardned</hi> Minerals are beſt broken <hi>(we know)</hi> on a <hi>Pillow,</hi> or a <hi>Feather bed;</hi> and that <hi>he knew</hi> too, but the matters were ſo laid, that he was not like to come to her <hi>Bedſide.</hi>

            <p>The Accompliſht <hi>Armadorus</hi> had a dexterous hand too at playing on the Baſe Viol; but his Inſtrument was out of the way; and beſides, his fingers were ſo benumb'd with the Wet and Wind, the Rain and Cold, that he could not have plaid his part if the Inſtrument had been by him; wherefore truſting all to his Voice, which he knew with leſs labour and ſtraining, and ſuch ado, had formerly charm'd and enchanted <hi>Vicentina;</hi> therefore laying aſide the foreſaid Sonnets as old and obſolete, and ſo not ſo taking with her, tho the very Emblems of his hard uſage, he began to think upon ſome better words, that he might at laſt get ſome <hi>Mouth-ſpeech,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Armadorus</hi> ſmiled at the innocent Folly of the old Creature, which was a piece they had entertain'd in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47692:98"/>
and ſo did not know him, nor his buſineſs; wherefore finding the Domeſticks begin to ſtir, he went bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Door, and began more eagerly to knock for admittance, which now he ſoon had; and indeed, 't was time of <hi>Day;</hi> for during the <hi>Night</hi> there was no coming in: He askt immediately for his Wife, of whom the Servants well-inſtructed could give no account; then demanding to ſpeak with the Old Lord of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> and the Counteſs <hi>Dowager;</hi> but they were not yet come down from their Apartments; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Door where his Deareſt was wont to Lodge, he found it faſt lockt, and no admittance. Thus full of Doubts and Fears, he attended in the Great Hall the coming down of the Old Folks, who by Breakfaſt-time did appear, having better Stomachs than <hi>Armadorus,</hi> whoſe Appetite was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pawl'd with his cold Lodging; he Addreſs'd himſelf to them with a Courteous and Kind Application, that had us'd him ſo <hi>cruelly,</hi> and now ſeem'd

to eſtrange themſelves ſo much, that they hardly vouchſafed to know him; he demanded of them where his Wife was?

            <p>All the Gentile Youths of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince were alarmed at this unparal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lel'd Treatment of an Husband. The Batchellors that were eagerly purſuing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47692:99"/>
their hot Loves, began to cool upon their Scent, to run counter when they ſaw the young Ladies to uſe ſuch Shifts and Doublings; they did not know how ſoon it might be their Caſes, ſhould they meet with ſuch Wives: And the young Married Husbands began to be uneaſy under their Condition, not knowing how ſoon theirs might prove ſuch. This made the Virgins fret to find themſelves neglected by their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and the young Married Women fume to find their Husbands ſo jealous of their Conſtancy; ſo that in ſhort, the whole <hi>Poſſe</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> almoſt from <hi>Sixteen</hi> to <hi>Sixty,</hi> were ready to be up in Arms againſt the Old Counteſs and the Young, as the Common Enemy and Diſturbers of their Loves, their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their Tranquility and Repoſe; ſome execrated the old Lady, ſome curſt the Young, and moſt condemn'd both; but the tender <hi>Armadorus,</hi>—who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complain'd, that his Dear Spouſe ail'd anything, but that ſhe was troubl'd now and then with ſome <hi>Fits</hi> of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47692:100"/>
               <hi>Mother.</hi> And theſe general Murmurings and Mutinies of both Sexes for a while, made the two Counteſſes a little Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how they came abroad in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and as every Bodies houſe is the beſt Caſtle, ſo they kept cloſe in theirs at <hi>Ogliano;</hi> for as nothing is more mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing than a raiſed and enraging <hi>Mobb,</hi> ſo no Multitude more dangerous than that which is animated to <hi>Anger,</hi> by the abuſing of their <hi>Love.</hi> 'Tis like a wild <hi>Stagg</hi> or <hi>Bull,</hi> that is diſturb'd in his Amours, or Act of Coition; it ſhakes its claſhing Beam, or brawny Neck, and bellows as it goes to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Revenge.</p>
            <p>The Chambers of <hi>Armadorus</hi> in (this) his abdicated Condition, were the conſtant Reſorts of the Youth of both Sexes to hear him with that humble modeſty recount his Memoirs of their Cruelty: <hi>Progne</hi>'s Rape, <hi>Philomela</hi>'s Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the Tale of <hi>Itis,</hi> were never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with ſuch attentive Abhorrence. The Ladies and Gentlemen that had not that intimacy to qualify themſelves
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47692:100"/>
to make him Viſits, yet would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the matter ſo as to introduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his Acquaintance, and make Invitations to the Courteous Stranger, only to be preſent at the Relation of his Wrongs; which the injur'd <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> did not refuſe, tho it was with unwillingneſs he was always brought to ſay any thing that ſeem'd to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or detract from the goodneſs of his Dear <hi>Vicentina,</hi> upon whoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he would always caſt a good Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and place the Mother's Picture in the beſt Light, that it might ſeem the more odious, and ſo ſerve for a foil the better to ſet off <hi>Vicentina</hi>'s; nay, the very Old Maidens and Batchelors, that were mumping upon their muſty Virginities, that were paſt the hopes of Matrimony, would all deſire his Converſation for the hearing of his Tale, and the pitying his hard and barbarous Uſage; inſomuch, that the Tranſported <hi>Armadorus</hi> would be oft ſurpriz'd at this Univerſal Friendſhip in a <hi>Strange Country,</hi> and did ſo ſenſibly

            <p>This univerſal agreement in the Commiſeration of the hard Caſe of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madorus,</hi> made the Old Counteſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſomewhat muſt be done to wipe off that general Odium that was fallen upon her. And ſo that the World might ſee that it was not without ſome Reaſon that they had thus <hi>hardly</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Helvetian,</hi> ſhe not only got her Daughter to complain of <hi>hard</hi> uſage received from him, but to go to a ſort of Magiſtrate, <hi>Advoyers</hi> (I think) they are wont to call them in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and there ſolemnly make Oath, That ſhe was afraid, that her Dear <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madorus</hi> had ſome deſign upon her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Life;</hi> indeed (as has been related before) the Young Lady was deeply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of <hi>Dying;</hi> and that her Love was like to <hi>kill</hi> her the very Wedding Night; but moſt People thought now that fear was pretty well over; However <hi>ſwear</hi> it ſhe would, and who could help it?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47692:101"/>
The worthy Magiſtrate was generally Condemn'd for admitting it, where the Act ſeemed Raſh, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of danger not ſo ſtrong; but thoſe Cenſures indeed were undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for what he did was <hi>ex officio,</hi> and ſo unavoidable; for ſhould <hi>Armadorus</hi> afterward have <hi>killed</hi> his <hi>Vicentina</hi> (tho it were but with <hi>kindneſs),</hi> and ſhe have <hi>Dyed</hi> within the Twelvemonth, the <hi>year</hi> and the <hi>day,</hi> (perhaps as he might have been Indicted upon the <hi>Statute of Stabbing)</hi> ſo the Magiſtrate might have been grievouſly Fined for not having bound him over <hi>to the Good behaviour;</hi> ſo after the Oath was Adminiſtred according to the form of Law and Juſtice, and the Cuſtom of the Country, the <hi>Advoyers</hi> Orders, Declarations, Warrants, Placaets, were by conſequence Iſſued out for the Apprehending, Securing, Seizing, Arreſting, Detaining, Conveying, Bringing into ſafe Cuſtody the Body of <hi>Armadorus,</hi> the <hi>Helvetian,</hi> late of the Canton of <hi>Bernino;</hi> and to bring

Remember how concerned I was always for your being but the leaſt indiſpoſed, how you could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to languiſh with you, and pine away by Sympathy.

            <p>Theſe were his ruthful Complaints, that all that heard them regarded, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, condoled, (but the hardned Mother, and unrelenting Wife); and therefore finding he could make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon them, nor that <hi>Time</hi> that <hi>ſoftens Iron and Stone,</hi> had turn'd their Natures, nor all the Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Friends and Relations, the powers of Fleſh and Blood could mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify their <hi>petrified Hearts;</hi> he betook himſelf to the Courts of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to make his Complaints and

receive Redreſs; who ſoon Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him by a Legal Proceſs to demand his Spouſe whereſoever he might ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her to be; which accordingly he did, in a ſolemn manner of the Lord of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> at the Gates of the ſaid Lord's Caſtle, and afterward in the Manſion-Houſe it ſelf; but ſhe being deni'd there to be, or that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any ſuch Lady, he was left to make out his proof by Law, and a ſolemn Tryal; for which both ſides prepared amain: The Gentlemen of the Long-Robe were engaged with Gold, and to fight it out like <hi>Switzers</hi> that were well paid (one againſt another). The Wittneſſes were to be Muſtred up by Multitudes, and to Swear luſtily, and perhaps for Gold too; And being thus ranged in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, were all ready againſt the time appointed to give Battel.</p>
            <p>The adverſe party had ſo packt their Cards, and ſhuffl'd the Young Lady from place to place, that it was a difficult matter to fix that of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47692:104"/>
and prove where ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; for <hi>Vicentina,</hi> that was now brought to ſtoop to all their Lures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſguiſe her ſelf whereever ſhe went; and ſhe that was once like <hi>Juno</hi>'s Bird, or <hi>Venus</hi> Dove, the beauty and ſplendor of the Day; like a Bat began only to buz about by Candle-Light, or hover like a night Bird in the dark; nor would ſhe ſtir by twilight unleſs <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> and (once like the <hi>Italian</hi> in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, that would mimick at a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>French-man, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te per pale,</hi> at the ſame time both in dreſs and geſture) ſhe was obſerved to ride forth in a <hi>Cavalcade</hi> ſomewhat extraordinary pleaſant, <hi>viz.</hi> a good rich Velvet Saddle, and faſhionable, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſorry Horſe with a ſwitch-Tail that that us'd to carry Lime, and not Ladies; A gentile <hi>Surtout</hi> or riding-Suit; with her Shoulders warmly wrapt up in a good White Serge whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: A pretty handſome Commode of the neweſt faſhion, upon which was gracefully plac'd a good homely Straw-Hat,

But 'twas too late for her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; ſhe had her <hi>Irons</hi> in the <hi>Fire,</hi> ſhe was to ſtrike while they were <hi>hot,</hi> tho' they <hi>burnt</hi> her <hi>Fingers;</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> he was drawn in to <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe</hi> the Cauſe upon the account of the old Counteſs his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> and perhaps out of hopes, if all things went well, the Signiory of <hi>Albania,</hi> the young Counteſs's Patrimony might come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Family; otherwiſe he had the Repute of a well-meaning perſon, that did not love any litigiouſneſs but what his <hi>Old Lady</hi> led him to; who having the aſcendant, made her <hi>good Lord</hi> ſubmit to ſuch conditions, ſometimes that went down with reluctancy; and <hi>Armadorus</hi> himſelf would alway do him that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as not only to think, but to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as unconcern'd in thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47692:105"/>
they had brought upon him.</p>
            <p>The time approacht in which this great Cauſe was to be decided, not by <hi>Combat</hi> as of old, when <hi>Appellant</hi> and <hi>Defendant</hi> met to decide it by a <hi>Duel:</hi> The <hi>Principals,</hi> as we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had been thus engag'd on the <hi>Nuptial Night,</hi> where it prov'd but a <hi>drawn Battel;</hi> here it was come to the <hi>Dernier Reſort,</hi> and almoſt the <hi>laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> except the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by a <hi>Judicial Sentence</hi> and <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Finale;</hi> and for that both ſides ſeem provided, when the Learned <hi>Podeſta</hi> or Judg took his place upon the Bench. After the preliminaries of the Trial were come to be adjuſted, and the Jurors and the People full of expectation to hear the Evidences, Proofs, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, whether by error in proceſs of the one, or diſtruſt of their cauſe in the <hi>other,</hi> at the inſtance of the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this ſo Remarkable Cauſe of <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> was put off to another ſitting of the Itinerary Judges: to the great diſappointment of all the gay Youth and gallant Young Ladies, who
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47692:106"/>
ſeem'd all mightily concern'd for the lovely <hi>Armadorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this was only a <hi>Remora</hi> that for a little while <hi>retarded</hi> the Affair, a <hi>Rub</hi> in the <hi>Way,</hi> or a <hi>Plank</hi> that their <hi>ſinking</hi> Cauſe caught hold of; for before the ſucceeding <hi>Podeſta,</hi> or the next ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Judges, it came again to be Canvaſs'd and to have a full and fair hearing: The Gallant <hi>Armadorus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in all his bravery and ſplendor, and the Court of Juſtice was throng'd with all the gay Ladies and Gallant Gentlemen the rich Province could afford, full of eager expectation, and itching Ears, for the pleaſantries and diverſions that the Dialogues and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of this Love-Intrigue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Amour might afford them. The matter was modeſtly diſcuſt, and ſo might not anſwer expectation, tho' it did all their hopes in the Cauſe being carried for the Noble <hi>Armadorus:</hi> Cannon play'd on both ſides; on both ſides did the evidence ſwear and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Earth ſhook withal: But it being clearly made appear, 1. That
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47692:106"/>
the Gallant <hi>Armadorus</hi> had actually married the Gay <hi>Vicentina,</hi> 2. That ſhe had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him in the Caſtle of <hi>Ogliano,</hi> contrary to the Laws of Marriage. 3. That he had us'd to be very fond of her, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail'd to exerciſe all his Faculties and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt efforts, for the giving her all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſatisfaction in her conjugal affection. 4. That this Elopement or Kid-napping, or Spiriting away of his dear Spouſe was to his great prejudice; and to the hazard and temptation of a wicked violation of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conjugation. 5. That he had ſuſtain'd great Damages, and that it had coſt him very dear to purſue his <hi>Daphne,</hi> that fled and had abſconded her ſelf from him only with a deſign to deceive him, and by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing her <hi>fair Face,</hi> to beguile him of her <hi>fairer Fortune.</hi> 6. To conſummate all, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Cavaliero,</hi> Signior <hi>Armadillo,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant <hi>de Bernino,</hi> and Father of the gallant <hi>Armadorus, viva voce</hi> teſtify'd that his Son (our Heroick <hi>Helvetian)</hi> had Overtures made him by richer and higher perſons, and that no leſs then 6. or 7000. Piſtols had been offer'd him for Dower in his own Country; an huge ſumm, and ſufficient to defray a Tax of an whole Canton in their <hi>Helvetique</hi> Body; amounting nearly to 77000. Livers. That the adverſe party had brought an Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

ſcandal upon their Noble Family by endeavouring <hi>ſecretly</hi> to <hi>deceive,</hi> and <hi>openly</hi> to traduce his Son <hi>Armadorus,</hi> the flouriſhing Branch and greateſt Hopes of it: That in his Old Age he had undertaken a long Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by Land and Sea, to vindicate his Son, by his own preſence, from the ſcandal of being of an obſcure Birth. That himſelf was Generaliſſimo to the vaſt Republick of the Canton of <hi>Bernino,</hi> and his Son was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in that high Command; and that he hoped (tho Strangers) they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Juſtice for their Injuries ſuſtain'd.</p>
            <p>The Adverſe party on the other hand, undertook ſtrongly to prove, that the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate <hi>Switzer,</hi> was able to ſwear <hi>Thundring</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> Oaths; that the Young <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian</hi> had been ſo robuſt, that he had broke all the Bonds of Matrimony: That he had taken his Ladies beſt Bits, and the Food ſhe moſt delighred in, and barbarouſly given it to the Dogs. <hi>Item</hi> that longing once but for a <hi>Woodcocks Leg,</hi> he had before her face inhumanely thrown it into the Fire, and made a <hi>Grillion</hi> of what ſhe deſign'd for a <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cazee: Icem,</hi> That being wont to humble himſelf on his Knees whilſt ſhe did uſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire him in her beſt Commode and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming dreſs, he was of late grown ſo ſtiff and ſtubborn, as to force her to kneel while

he attir'd her in his long Peruke, and cocking Beaver. <hi>Item,</hi> That he had put his Lady often into many fainting Fits that ſhe could hardly fetch her Breath, and was ready to dye away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—All which formidable Averments being made out upon Oath, made the whole Court of Ladies mightily concern'd for their admir'd <hi>Armadorus,</hi> as doubting what might be the iſſue of ſo dubious a point; and ſorry that his kindneſs to the Female Sex ſhould have all this ſad occaſion to be call'd in queſtion; but to be ſhort, after the Eloquent, and the Learned Lawyers, and the Councel on both ſides had ſufficiently Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangu'd and Satyriz'd; after the <hi>Tres Sage,</hi> and <hi>Tres Reverend</hi> the <hi>Jage,</hi> had imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ingenuouſly with much Judgment and Learning ſumm'd up all that had been materially ſaid in a little, and taken the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of along cauſe in ſhort-hand; It was left to the Jurors, or 12.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47692:108"/>
of what evil conſequences it would be to the whole Country, (and what might be every Man of them their own Caſe) ſhould their Wives be ſuffer'd to make ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Elopements, and unnaturally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from their Husbands to lye ſingle when the Law obliges them to be under Coverture; They therefore <hi>in terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> to all ſuch Female Offenders, did award, declare, aſſign, decree, or give unto the Illuſtrious <hi>Armadorus,</hi> Son and Heir Apparent of the Noble Signior <hi>Armadillo</hi> Commandant <hi>de Bernino</hi> in the Country of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> the ſumm of 1200 Doppio's or Piſtols <hi>D' Eſpaign,</hi> amounting to 13200.

            <p>This Verdict for <hi>Armadorus,</hi> as it tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not a little, ſo it affected no leſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Court: The Adverſe Party being but a few, could not obſcure with their cloudy Countenances, the Serenity that ſeem'd to appear in every Face.
