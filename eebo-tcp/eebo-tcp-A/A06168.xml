            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Howe Willyam Long beard betraied his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto his death, of his falling in acquaintance with the Abbot of <hi>Cadonence</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> and how cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and coulourably they got authority from the Kinge to accomplish their ambitious pretences.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilst all the world was in vprore, and schismes raigned in the Church, when God by prodigious signes, threatened pestilent plagues: at suche time as two sunnes appéered in our Horizon in England, and three Moones were discouered in the West in Italie, <hi>William</hi> with the longe beard was borne in the famous Cittie of London, of greater minde then of high parentage, a graft of mightie hope at the first, though (as it afterwards proued) his parents spent too much hope on so little vertue. This frée Cittizen borne, tenderlie fostered in his infancie, was afterwards trained vp in good letters, wherin he profited so suddenlie, that most men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his capacitie, and the wisest were afraid of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: And for that the age wherein hee was bread (being the third yeare of Henrie the Second) was full of troubles, this yoong mans rare guifts were raked vp in the embers, little regarded because not yet ripened: but at last as years increased the minde ordained for mightie thinges began to mount, the rather because ambition sealed his eies, which made him with the Doue soare so hie, till his own cunning
<pb facs="tcp:20221:3"/>
and labour made him be ouerturned: for when he perceiued his fathers foote alreadie prepared for the graue, his mother seazed by age, and more besotted with affection, himselfe at mans estate &amp; without maintenance, he thus began the first fruites of his impietie, the sequell whereof exceedeth all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and testifieth his deuilish and damnable nature. He had a brother elder than himselfe in yeares, but yoonger in policie, who (hauing by his owne frugalitie gotten great wealth) was called to be a Burgesse of the cittie: a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of all men for his vpright dealing, and lamented of al men for his vntimelie death. For William little regarding the benefites he had receiued of him in his youth, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie kindnesse, the bountifull curtesies, sought all means possible to betray him, who had trained him vp, to suck his hart bloud, who had sought his harts rest, and to that intent séeing the opportunitie fitted him, in the raigne of Richard the first, that noble Prince of famous memorie, he suborned certeine lewd and smister confederates of his to accuse him of Treason: for which cause poore innocent man being sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie apprehended, his goods were confi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cate, his body im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, his wife and children left succourlesse, whilst wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>William</hi> being both complotter, informer, and witnes, wrought so cunningly with the kings councell that the goods were his, which his brother with his long labour had gotten, and the poore innocent man brought out before the Iudges with wéeping eies, beheld his yoonger brother both reuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his ritches, and reiocing at his ruine. Many were his obtestations before God, and protestations to the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, manie his exhortations to his brother, and detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his periurie. But <hi>William</hi> whose hart was the very harbour of all impietie, ceased not in his owne person to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite, and by his companions to incense the Iudges in such sort, that his brother was at last by them condemned and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to death, as some Writers suppose for coining. And being led forth to his execution like an harmelesse innocent, the people mustering about the place, the curssed brother the occasion and compactor of his confusion accompanie him,
<pb facs="tcp:20221:3"/>
with these or such like words he finished his life. Thou God that knowest the cause of my vntimelie death, canst in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ice punish my vniust accusers, meane while take mercie on my poore soule, who am forsaken of my priuate friends, be thou a safeguard vnto me, whoe am left without succors, and helpe the desolate widdow with hir distressed children: This said, after some priuate conference by permission, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his brother and him, he suffered torment.</p>
               <p>But <hi>William</hi> hauing gotten wealth began to take vpon him state, and vnderstanding his father and mother through hartie griefe were in their extreame age committed to the graue, he seazed on their goods, carrieng such a countenance in London that all men wondered at him: In wit he was pregnant; in publike affaires pollitike; in reuenges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, in speeches affable, in countenance graue, in apparell gorgeous, yea so cunning was he to insinuate himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Commons, that as the report went, he had more Prentises clubs at his command, then the best Courtier had seruants to attend him.</p>
               <p>And as the custome is whilest thus he behaued himselfe, it fortuned that hee fell in companie and conference with the Abbot of <hi>Cadonence in Normandie,</hi> a man as high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as himselfe, and more subtill than <hi>Sinon,</hi> by whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise and directions he grew so craftilie conceited, that vnder a holie pretert he wrought more mischiefe, than either the Councell of England could for a long time remedie, or by industrie reuerse, and thus it fortuned. After that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and warlike <hi>Richard</hi> the firste of that name, had to his immortall glorie recouered his rights in France, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed peace with the French king, and by the perswasions of his mother Dame <hi>Elianor,</hi> reconciled his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> who had before that time béene at deadlie <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d with him. It ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Maiestie, partlie for his owne recreation sake, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to remedie the discontents of his subiects, to goe on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the eight yeare of his reigne, and in the yeare of our Lord 1197. at which time the Abbot of <hi>Cadonence</hi> and <hi>William</hi> watching an occasion and oportunitie, so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:20221:4"/>
wrought she matter, that they had audience at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties hands, and attained vnder the broad seale the whole summe of their requests. The Abbot couloured his strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem vnder the coppie of conscience: assuring the king that the corruption of his officers were the chiefest groundes of publike contention, praieng him in the bounty of an heroick and princelie potentate, to take some order for she correction of them, least at the last it should turne to his owne confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>His maiestie that had euer regard of the poore, with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious good words thanked him for his good will, giuing him warrant and authoritie to redresse those inconueniences, and promising him great promotions, if he tooke any profite by his pollicie. <hi>William</hi> now that hath the second subtiltie to enact, suted his lookes in all sobrietie, and stroaking his long beard which he curiouslie fostered euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, tolde the king of the insolence and outrage of rich men who spared their owne and pilled the poore, robbed <hi>Irus</hi> and clawed <hi>Midas:</hi> beséeching in the commons behalfe, a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for this inconuenience: wherevnto the king easilie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended, so that he likewise was authorized to redresse such enormities, and both he and his fellowe Abbot, were with manie princelie fauours dismissed.</p>
               <p>Mounted thus vpon the whéele of Fortune, which euerie waie sheweeth hir selfe as fickle as she is fauourable, as ful of gall as she hath honie, they both of them depart for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, carrieng so high countenances as euerie one were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at their manners. My lord Abbot first suted in his Pontificallbus called forth diuers officers, purposing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their accounts, taunting them with vntowarde lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and accompanieng threates with imprisonment. But as the Giants that threatened the heauens were ouer, throwne in their most hautinesse, and as <hi>Phaeton</hi> vsurping his fathers seat was confounded for his ambitious pride by vntimelie death, so the Abbot of <hi>Cadonence,</hi> when he thoght to cauell at all accompts, was called to accompt himselfe, before she Tribunall iustice seat of God, and died in midest
<pb facs="tcp:20221:4"/>
of his iollitie. But <hi>William</hi> who towred with the <hi>Phaenix</hi> to burne in the sunne, and aduentured to crosse the troblesome seas of this world to perish with ouermuch wrastling in the same, now began his pageant exhorting and stirringe the commons to loue and imbrace libertie, to fight and labour for freedome, brieflie to detest and blame the excesse and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of ritch men, whoe as he tolde them reaped the sweet whilst they poore soules sweat for it. Heerevnto wrested he manie stories of antiquitie: First the <hi>Laconian</hi> state, next the popular gouernement of <hi>Athens,</hi> wherein peace neuer flourished better said he, than when the Commons had frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of speech. With these and such like honie spéech, he so animated the multitude, that like a second <hi>Hercules</hi> he drew them by the eares thorow the honie of his eloquence. And to his words he annexed action, vndertaking manie poore mens causes, who were ouerborne by the rich, handeling his matters with such pollicie, as that he was held for a second God among the poore, and for a long time esteemed for a good subiect by the Prince. Yet notwithstanding this, the mightie maligned him greatlie, for that he had informed the king that by their meanes his Maiestie lost manie forfeits and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>scheats which were due vnto him: and for that his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted subtleties may be more apparant, where through he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his succéeding treacheries, I haue thought good to sette downe some one of them, which may giue a taste to those tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike miseries which shall ensue.</p>

               <p>First therefore, he ioyned the papers, and conferred the manner of the iniurie with the other circumstances, and at last he euidentlie found, and therewithall certified others, that these torne papers, was the bill of debt for forty marks. Finallie, comparing the estate of the poore man with that of <hi>Besaunts,</hi> the time the money had béene in the defendants hands, and the corrupt intention of the riche man, whoe by renting the bill, thought to race out the remembrance of his due debt, he called him before him, charging the officiall to bring the widdow and hir children before him in open sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: where after long debating, and trouble on both sides, <hi>Besaunt</hi> standing on his credit, the widdow on hir innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: <hi>William</hi> willing to catch the cat with his owne clawe, began thus. Maister <hi>Besaunt,</hi> you are called into iustice, not that we suspect your honestie, or detract from your esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but for this cause are you called: that if you will be deposed, that all allegations which may be alledged against you by this widdow are false, you may see hir punished, and iustice executed. <hi>Besaunt</hi> little suspecting the snare that was laide, and the subtiltie intended, began with huge oathes to protest, that he neither stood any waie indebted to the poore Coblerlatelie deceased: neither was in any sort liable to the false suggestions of the widdowe. <hi>William</hi> perceiuing euidentlie she vngodlie intent of the man to defraud, and how gratious a déed he should doo, to speak in the innocents defense: First commanded <hi>Besaunts</hi> Oath to be taken, and after that rowsing himselfe in a maiesticall manner, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus.</p>
               <p>I sée well my countreymen, that iustice had need of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, when those that should maintaine hir, séeke to maime hir: Ah what a world liue we in, when trust shall be betraid: when simplicitie, shall be vndermined with subtletie: and pouertie ouertopped by power.

(and therewithall he caused the two children to bee placed by him) two harmelesse infants: for whom the poore father laboured in his life time, both left to begge after his death.

Now therefore countreymen giue eare, and hea ring, pittie: and pittieng, patronize these poore soules. This <hi>Besaunt</hi> wrongeth them, making his credit the countenance of his craft, and his goods the coulour of his vngodlinesse: behold his hand writing, wherein he thinking to extinguish the memorie of his debt, hath renewed the meanes of his owne destruction, (which said, he publikelie shewed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) and after that turning him to M. <hi>Besaunt,</hi> he expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thus; Well sir, since your corruption is found out, and your vngodlie oathes haue doubled your offence, by that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which I haue receiued from his maiesty: I condemn you to pay the summe of fortie marks with the vse thereof, for ten yeares, vnto this widdow and hir children: next, for your periurie, wherein you haue offended God especiallie, and next your countrey: I adiudge you to paie, in waie of a fine to his Maiestie, two hundreth poundes sterling: adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing you hereafter, to vse your conscience more vprightlie, and to deale by the poorer sort more iustlie.</p>

of his traitorous practises, and finallie, as the fruits of such sinister follies conclude with his tragicall end. After he had for a time, vntill the princes minde were otherwise withdrawne with more waightie matters, ceased both his routs and riots; the old ranckled venome of his ambition began more fréelte to breake forth, so that what before time he colored vnder conscience, now at last he manifested with audacious considence: The mightie in court that maligned him, he ouermaistered by his attendants, swashing out in open streats vppon euerie light occasion: for himselfe, hee thought no man sufficient to suppresse him, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

From some he extorted wealth by corrupt witnesses, sparing no meanes to inrich his followers, by racking and wresting the kinges authoritie: and no sooner did he heare that the kinge had giuen order to his councell to sensure on his bad demeanors, but gathering to himselfe a huge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he openlie vsed this discourse vnto them, beginning his exhortation with this place of Scripture:

                  </q>
Which is as much to say, as, <hi>You shal drawe waters with Ioy out of the fountaines of our Sauiour.</hi> For, quoth he, my worthie and faithfull friends, whoe haue more courage than coine, and abilitie in armes then possibilities of wealth, I am the sauiour of you that are poore, and the soueraigne of such as are penilesse: you that haue assaied the hard hand of the rich, shall be succoured by the happie hande of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Now therefore draw your happie fountaines of councell out of my words, and turne the troubles you haue, to assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red triumphs: for the daies of your visitation is at hande. I shall depart waters from waters; I mean, the proud from the poore, the mercilesse from the mercifull, the good from the

euill, and the light from the darkenesse. I will oppose my selfe against all dangers, to preuent your domage; and loose my life, but you shall haue liuing. Be confident therefore and bolde: for such as haue courage, are sildome conquered. Let the greatest vpbraid, they shall not bite: we haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to withstand, as well as wordes to perswade: we are as couragious as our enimies are craftie. Stick therefore vnto me, who will striue for you: let me be supprest, you are subdued: let me flourish, you are fortunate: but if finister chance threaten; whie, <hi>Alea iacta est:</hi>

Thus dailie and hourelie animated he the ill minded sorte: and although the king did oftentimes summon him, and by letters disuaded him from his ill demeanour: yet was hee enforced to vse violence; or otherwise, that stripe which at first séemed to be but a fillip, would at last haue growne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fistula.

                  </gap>se good men that follow you, that either they would be drawne to violate iustice, or you could be induced to violate and al ter their honest and christianlike duties. Our onelie request to you in the kings behalfe, is to cast off this Lordlie traine, and suffer these poore men to follow their professions, least being vnawares assailed by want, they shall at laste desparatelie attempt wickednes. As for these good fellows who in their lookes promise no losenesse, I beséech them in his Maiesties name to kéepe their houses, promising them in generall, that if any one of them be wronged, they shall haue remedie. Nay, we will haue remedie in spight of you, said they, as long as <hi>William</hi> liues. And this said, without all reuerence they departed the place, carrieng with them their captaine commander, scoffing at the fainthartednes of the Archbishop: for full well was he assured, that greater

seueritie was concluded vpon, then he there would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: for which cause he continuallie stood on his guard, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all such men as hee thought were abettors of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
               <p>The Bailifes of London, according to their authoritie, séeing matters were growne to such extremitie, kept dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and strong watch, drawing some of the commons from him by faire words, and some by guifts: This notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, William was neuer vnattended. The Councell, who euerie waies were vigilant to roote out this viper from the common weale, what they could not by proues, they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by pollicie, animating diuers valiant men with huge promises to marke his manners, and when the occasion was offered, to apprehend him at such time as he little suspected. But long was it yer they either could finde oportunitie, or catch the Fore in his forme: yet at last, when he least suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they caught him tardee in Breadstreat, attended onlie by ten or twelue; at which time, they drawing their swordes assailed him valiantlie.</p>
               <p>But he, who in all conflicts of Fortune was both confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and couragious, first animated his retinue to the fight, and after that wresting himselfe by maine force out of their hands, he tooke him to flight towards the hart of the Cittie, and ranne int<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

By this time, the cittie was in an vprore: the poorer sort laboured to rescue William: the Bailifs with the best Cittizens armed them to back the kings officers: so that the cittie was altogither vp in armes. William long beard séeing himselfe hotlie pursued, and knowing no mean to escape, stept to a poore Carpenter who staid in Cheape for worke, and taking his Axe from him, desperatlie assailed his pursuers, and with his owne hands valiantlie siue some of them: but when he perceiued the factions of his enimies to be great, and his friends wel nigh tired, he betooke himselfe at last into Bow church, not for his sanctuarie, but for a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of his safetie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20221:15"/>
Thither repaired all the poore commons, some with bats, some with spittes, and such weapons as they had, driuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie all the kings officers in despight of their friendes, and determining with themselues rather to dy than to lose their <hi>William</hi> Long beard amongst the rest <hi>Maudline</hi> his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowing that his wracke was hir ruine, came vnto him where wéeping mild teares from hir immodest eies, shee so mollified his marbell heart, that (as some testifie) he was more moued therewith, then with the threats and terrors of his greatest enimies: but sée impietie where it preuaileth, how it worketh? That church which was sacred to praiers, was now made a den of rebels: those places which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to holie vses, were now soiled with dishonest abuses: where before our Ladie was praied to, lewdnesse was plaid withall. But to bring these causes to their <hi>Catastophe,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth it that darknes for this time ended the discention, and the comming on of the night, wrought also the conclusion of the fight.</p>

To offend of obstinate will, were brutish: but vnder some limits of reason to defaulte, can you (my Lords) but thinke it pardonable? I haue rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one or two assemblies, and what of this? peace was not broken, onely my safetie was assured: and were it that the Law had béene iniured, might not the righting of a hundred poore mens causes, merit pardon for two vnlawfull assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies?

For my soule, since it is deriued from a more immortall essence, I dare boast the libertie thereof, knowing that eternitie is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, and mercie may attend it. But for these poore ones who haue defaulted thorough no malice, but haue béen misled through vaine suggestions, howe gratious a deede should your honnors do, to exemplifie your mercie on them? poore soules, they haue offended in not offending, and but to enthrone me, haue ouerthrowne themselues: for which cause, if consideration of innocent guiltines, &amp; guiltie innocence may any waies moue you, grant them life, and let me solie enact the tragedie, who am confirmed against all Fortunes tyrannies.</p>

These latter words were deliuered with so great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of spirit, and attended with so quickening motions and actions of the bodie, that euerie one pittied that so rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues should be rauished by vntimelie death, or accustomed with so manie vngodlie practises. The Iudges, whoe were <hi>Socratical</hi> in all their spéeches, shewing their Rhetorique in their vpright iudgements, not quaint discourses; after the examinations, indictments, verdicts of the Iurie, and suche like, at last gaue finall and fatall iudgement: That <hi>William</hi> with the long beard with his confederates, should the nexte daie be hanged drawne and quartered: and so, after some other worthie exhortations to the people to mainteine peace, and that they should shew themselues more dutifull, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thanks to the Bailifes and good cittizen for their faithful and good seruice to his Maiestie, the assemblie broke vp, and the prisoners till the next daye were committed to the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the gaie mistresse of the daie break prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in hir roseat coatch, powdering the heauens with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the Bailifes repaired to the prison, leading foorthe <hi>William</hi> and those his other confederates to their execution. Then flocked about them diuers sorts of people, some to sée those who were so much searched after: others to lament him whom they had so loued: at laste arriued at the place where they should finish their daies, &amp; all stood to beholde their death. <hi>William,</hi> as principall in his life time of seditious practise, was to enact the first and fatall part in the tragedie: for which cause boldlie climing vp the ladder, and hauing the rope fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie cast about his neck, after some priuate praiers, he spake after this manner vnto the people: My good countreymen, you are repaired hither to sée a sorie spectacle, to beholde the follie of life paid with the fruits of death, to marke how sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster treasons, ende with condigne torments: if you applie what you here see and beholde to your owne profits, I shall be glad, whoe now euen at this my last hower, desire rather you shuld reconcile your selues from all wickednes, then be dismaied ormoued with my wretchednesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20221:17"/>
Oh my déere friends, I now protest before God, &amp; vowe before men, that mine owne presumptuous climing hath béene the iust cause of my confusion: I haue had more desire of glorie, then respect of God, more regard of dignitie, then of dutie, déeming it better to be a famous Traitor, then a faithfull and true subiect. For which my inestimable sinnes I crie God hartilie mercie, I beseech his Maiestie to forgiue me, and pray you all by your praiers to implore Gods grace for me. Neither deserue I death only for the offence I haue made the king, but my conscience accuseth me, and I heere doo openlie confesse it, that I was he who murthered <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Browne,</hi> in that he was a riuall in my most lewde loue, This, this, if nought else, my countreymen, sufficeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me, for this and al I am hartilie sorie. My God, I repent me from my soule, my God. Which said, lifting vp his eies to heauen, he praied a long time verie vehementlie and after manie fruitfull exhortations, finished his life to the comfort of those who wished his soules health. The reste his confederates after their seuerall confessions, were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the same sauce, and thus ended the troubles with their tragedies.</p>
               <p>Their bodies cut downe, were buried by their friends, and happie was he among the poorer sort that had any thing to inritch the funerall of <hi>William</hi> Long beard: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his confession at his death, and diuers other eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences at his condemnation: yet were there diuers, whoe after his death held him for a saint, casting out slanderous libels against the Archbishop, terming him the bloudsucker of good men. There were manie superstitious women, who in their deuotion were wont to pray to him, and after his death digged vp the ground about the gallowes trée, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that manie had beene healed of sundrie sicknesses by the touch thereof. All this their idolatrous constructions at first began by reason of a priest, a néere alie to <hi>William,</hi> who openlie preached, that by vertue of a chaine wherewith <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> was bound, during the time of his imprisonment, ther were diuers men healed of hot feauers, the bloud that fell
<pb facs="tcp:20221:17"/>
from him at such time as he was quartered, they cléerelie scraped vp, leauing nothing that could yéeld any memorie of him, either vnsought or vngotten: But at last the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canturburie remedied all these thinges, who firste accursed the Priest that brought vp the fables, and after that caused the place to be watched, where through such idolatrie ceased, and the people were no more seduced. But for that <hi>William</hi> wrote many notable Poems and translations in the prison, which if you pervse will notifie vnto you his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular wit, I haue thought good to subscribe them, desiring your fauourable censure of them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were manie worthie Pirates in our forefathers daies: but among all of greatest reckoning, <hi>Dionides</hi> was not least, who exercised his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenies in the <hi>Leuant</hi> Seas in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> disdaining either to serue the one, or submit himselfe to the other: yea so resolute was he in his robberies, and dissolute in his life, that he neither spared friend nor sauoured foe, but robd all in generall. Against this man <hi>Alexander</hi> leuied a great armie, and by strong hand subdued him: and afterward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him into his presence, he said thus vnto him: Tell me <hi>Dionides,</hi> whie hast thou treubled all the Seas? to whome he thus replied: Tell me <hi>Alexander,</hi> whie hast thou ouerrun the whole worlde, and robbed the whole sea? <hi>Alexander</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him: bicause I am a king, and thou art a Pirat: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (replied <hi>Dionides)</hi> D <hi>Alexander,</hi> both thou and I are of one nature, and the selfe same office: the onelie difference is that I am called a Pyrat for that I assault other men with a little armie, and thou art called a prince, because thou sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duest and signiorest with a mightic hoast: But if the Gods would be at peace with me, and Fortune should shewe her selfe peruerse towards thée, in such sort as <hi>Dionides</hi> mighte he <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Alexander Dionides,</hi> perhaps I should be a better prince then thou art, and thou a worser Pyrat than I am.</p>

               <hi>Stilcon</hi> for sixtéene yeeres space was a pirat in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathean</hi> Sea, and executed manie great robberies vpon the

            <p>
               <hi>Cleonides</hi> was a pirat in the daies of king <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and scowred the seas for the space of twenty and two yeares, and for seuen of them neuer set foot on land from out his Gallie: This <hi>Cleonides</hi> was squint cied, and crup shouldred, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthilie in that manner marked by nature, because euery waie he was most tyranouslie minded against cuerie priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he tooke: he neuer obserued promise, or pittied prisoner: but those enimies he tooke (amongest other millions of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments where with he tyrannized ouer them) he powred hot scalding oile into their fundaments, and set their féet in boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling oile, till they were burnte and scorched. Against him, <hi>Ptolomey</hi> sent out an armie; and hauing taken him, called him before his iudgement seat, and spake vnto him after this mannre: Tell me <hi>Cleonides,</hi> what barbarous inhumanitie or infernall furie haue instigated thee, to inflict such insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torments on those who as thy selfe are men, and being as thy selfe, ought to be pittied by thy selfe? to whom <hi>Cleoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> gaue this churlish answer: It sufficeth not me thou king, to execute my enuie vpon the bodies of those I hate, &amp; whoe haue persecuted me in their life times; but also I resolue to burne their bowels vp, and scalde out their harts wherewith they hated me. <hi>Prolomey</hi> wondring at his desperate inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, gaue him this iudgement: that he should likewise

by little and little be dipped in scalding oile, to the ende hee might tast the selfe same torment where with he had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manie others.</p>

               <hi>Chipanda</hi> the pirat was a <hi>Theban</hi> borne, and flourished in the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a man of high minde, great valour, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous hart, and vertues hardinesse: for he had vnder his conduct 130. shippes, with which he brought vnder his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection all the kingdomes of the Leuant, and struck continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feare into all the heartes of the princes in the West. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him <hi>Cyrus</hi> rigged out an armie, by whome his ships were conquered, and himselfe taken captiue: who comming into <hi>Cyrus</hi> presence, was by him saluted in this manner: Tell me <hi>Chipanda,</hi> whie forsookest thou my paie, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards submittedst thy selfe to the seruice of the <hi>Parthian?</hi> to whom he thus answered: The lawes which are made on land binde not those that serue by sea: and those also which we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate at Sea, are not accustonied or vsed on lande: and I tell you this O king, because it is an auncient Custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs pirats, so often to alter and change our patrons as often as you shall sée the windes alter and change at the Sea.</p>

               <hi>Alcomonius</hi> was a pirat at such time as <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> flourished (and following the faction of <hi>Scilla,</hi> was he that tooke <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> when he fled from <hi>Scilla,</hi> whom <hi>Caesar</hi> very often after a pleasant manner assured, that he had delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hang him and all his confederates by the neck, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his words accomplished his promise, at such time as he came to the gouernement of the <hi>Romaine</hi> common-weale. This <hi>Alcamonius</hi> being readie to die, said; I am lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gréeued for that I lose, and lesse afflicted for the maner of death by which I die: but this is it that vrgeth me, that I fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into his hands who was once my prisoner, whome I might haue hanged then, as he now hangeth me.</p>
            <p>There were likewise manie other ancient and moderne pirats, whom for that I am studious of breuitie, I in this place willinglie pretermit: It onely suffiseth you, that you consider that no one of them died in his bed, neither made testament of his goodes, but as soone as the fatall houre of their destinies was arriued, they died both defamed vnto the world, and detested for their wickednes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Agisincts</hi> were famous pirats in the time of <hi>Themo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles,</hi> who turned out a hundred Gallies amongst them, and tooke all of them: and after he had imprisoned and disarmed them, hanged them vp: which act of his caused him to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured in <hi>Greece,</hi> and feared on the sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frauncis Enterolles</hi> a famous pirat was borne in <hi>Valentia</hi> of noble parents and a princelie stocke: This man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mightie and manie robberies at sea, and in the riuer of <hi>Genoua:</hi> and finallie, when in the yeare 1491. he had longe time followed a chace, he was by tempest and Fortune dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon the Ilande of <hi>Corsica,</hi> and those wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> by chance escaped the daunger and sury of the Seas, incountred death on the land, and were all of them with their capteine <hi>Francis</hi> hanged by the neck for their piracies, the rest that were left,
<pb facs="tcp:20221:21"/>
were made Gallie slaues, being by the Ilanders surprised in their Gallie: and this was the end of this noble <hi>Valentinian.</hi>

               <hi>Monaldo Guecca</hi> a famous pirat borne in <hi>Nauar,</hi> flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the yeare 1496.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Artaritus</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Albert</hi> kinge of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> who after the death of his father raigned himselfe in <hi>Millan,</hi> and <hi>Gundibert</hi> his brother in <hi>Pauia.</hi> Betwixt these twoe there grewe a mortall discention, for which cause <hi>Gundibert</hi> sent <hi>Caribald</hi> Duke of <hi>Turinge</hi> to <hi>Grimoald</hi> duke of <hi>Beniuent</hi> a most worthy and valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, requesting his assistance in armes against his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and promising him in rewarde thereof, to bestowe his sister vpon him in mariage. But <hi>Garibald</hi> vsed Treason against his Lord, animating <hi>Grimoald</hi> to the enterprise not as an a better, but a conqueror. For (said he) you may easily occupie the kingdome, by reason of the twoe brethren, whoe
<pb facs="tcp:20221:21"/>
through their dissentions haue almoste ruinated the same. <hi>Grimoald</hi> asserteined her of, made his sonne Duke of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent:</hi> and leuieng a mightie power, set onwards on his way to <hi>Pauia,</hi> and through euerie Cittie that he passed, he drewe friends vnto him, and won the better sort with benefites, to the end they should assist him toward the attainment of the kingdome: and comming to parlie with <hi>Gundibert</hi> who (lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle suspecting the trecheries which <hi>Garibald</hi> had complotted, came slenderlie and courtlie accompanied to intertain him) he on sudden slue him, and occupied the kingdome. <hi>Partaritus</hi> assertained hereof, abandoned <hi>Rhodeline</hi> his wife and his iit tle sonn, and fled to <hi>Cucano</hi> king of the <hi>Auarior Huns: Grimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald</hi> confirmed in the kingdome of <hi>Pauia,</hi> vnderstanding that <hi>Partharithus</hi> was entertained by <hi>Cucano;</hi> sent ambassadors vnto him, threatning him, that if he retained <hi>Partharithus</hi> his enimie in his kingdome, he shoulde be assured to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of him a mightie enimie, and more, to occasion a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and dangerous warre.</p>
            <p>The king of the <hi>Hunns</hi> assertained héereof, called <hi>Partari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> vnto him, and said thus: I pray thée, gentle friende, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into some other place: for if thou be héere resident, my good will towards thee will occasion great warres againste my selfe. <hi>Partharitus</hi> vnderstanding the kings mind, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Italie, went and sought out <hi>Grimoald,</hi> reposing his life vpon the good dispositions of his enimie: And drawing neere the Cittie of <hi>Lodi,</hi> he sent before him one of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruants called <hi>Vnulfe,</hi> who might make manifest to <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moald,</hi> both how much he trusted him, and what he required at his hands. <hi>Vnulfe</hi> presenting himselfe before the kinges Maiestie, told him that <hi>Partaritus</hi> his maister had recourse vnto his clemencie, and sought succour in his court: <hi>Grimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald</hi> admiring his confidence, faithfullie promised him that he might repaire vnto him, vppon the faith of a prince assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that before he should be harmed, he would hazard his owne hart.</p>
            <p>A little while after when <hi>Partharitus</hi> presented himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Grimoald,</hi> and humblie knéeling on his knées be sought
<pb facs="tcp:20221:22"/>
his fauour, the king pitiouslie and gratiouslie entertained and kissed him, whome in humble manner <hi>Partharitus</hi> salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus: mightie Soueraigne, I am thy seruant, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that thou art a Christian, doubt not of thy compassion. I might (as thou knowest O king) haue liued among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: but what life were that? and howe base confidence were I in rather to trust the faithlesse, then humble my selfe to the faithfull? I beseech thée of mercie, and kissing thy feete craue maintenance. The king according to his maner swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a solemne oath, promised him saieng: By him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat me, since thou hast recourse vnto my faith, I will neuer forsake thée; but I will take order for thee in suche manner, that thou maiest both honestlie and honorablie liue in this countrey. Wherevpon he commanded him to be worthilie lodged, giuing charge that he should be furnished of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries whatsoeuer, vpon his treasurie.</p>
            <p>It chanced that <hi>Partaritus</hi> departing from the king, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to his lodging, was suddenlie encountered with a whole troope of Cittizens of <hi>Pauia,</hi> who came to sée him and salute him, as their sorestemed friend. But sée what great mischiefe procéedeth from an euill and detracting toong? For some malignant flatterers beholding the same, sought out the king, and gaue him to vnderstande, that if he made not <hi>Partaritus</hi> suddenlie out of the waie, himselfe without all doubt should lose both his kingdome and life: swearing to him, that all the cittie was alreadie addicted to take his part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grimoald</hi> considering these thoughts, and by his ouermuch credulitie suspecting more then he néeded, suddenlie resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the death of miserable <hi>Partharitus:</hi> and calling his councell vnto him ceased not to contriue the meanes howe the innocent might be made awaie. They séeing that daie far spent resolued the déed shoulde be doone, the next morrowe animating the king by good words, who otherwise through feare was almost out of his wits: notwithstanding thorow their perswasions gathering to himselfe more confidence, the better to coulour his intention, hee sent vnto him that
<pb facs="tcp:20221:22"/>
night manie excellent dishes and strong wines, purposing (if it were possible) to make him drunke: assuring himselfe that by the meanes thereof he for that night shoulde haue more care of his sléepe than regard of his safetie.</p>
            <p>But see how God helpeth the innocent: for a certein gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who before time had béene a seruitour in <hi>Partharithus</hi> fathers court, presenting him with a messe of meate from the king, and leaning downward as if intending reuerence to his Maiestie, tolde him secretlie howe the kinge the next daie had resolued to put him to death. For which cause <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi> suddenlie called his squire, willing him for that night to giue him no other drink but a little water in a siluer cup: knowing this, that if those who presented him in the kings behalfe would request him to carouse to his health, he might easilie doe without intoxicating his braines, drinking onelie water. Those that serued him at the table, seeing <hi>Partaritus</hi> take his liquor so liuelie, certified the king thereof: who with much ioyfulnesse said, let the drunkerd drinke his fill for this night: but to morrowe yer euer he suspect the banquet, I meane to feast him with his owne bloud.</p>
            <p>This saide, he caused his guard to be set the house, fearing and suspecting, least <hi>Partaritus</hi> should escape him in any sort. The supper being ended, and euerie one hauing taken his leaue, <hi>Partharitus</hi> thus left alone with <hi>Vnulfe</hi> his trustie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and the Page who ordinarilie attended on him to bed, he discouered vnto them howe the king had resolued to kill him: for which cause <hi>Vnulfe</hi> winding him about the necke with the shéetes of the bedde and laieng the couerlet and a Beares skin vpon his backe, leauing him without capp, as if he were some rusticke or common drudging fellowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to driue him out of the chamber, dooing him manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and villannies, so that he verie oftentimes fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grimoalds</hi> guard, whoe were appointed vnto the watch, seeing al these outrages, asked <hi>Vnulfe</hi> what he meant. Why said he, my maisters, this rascal slauehath made me my bed in the chamber of that drunken palliard <hi>Partharithus,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:20221:23"/>
is so full of wine, that he sléepeth as if he were dead without stirring: and this is the cause whie I beat him, and I praye you dooth he not deserue it? They hearing these words, and beléeuing them to be true, did all of them laugh verie harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to heare the tidings, and giuing both of them licence to depart <hi>Partaritus</hi> hasted to the cittie of <hi>Hasti,</hi> and from thense went into <hi>France,</hi> praising God for his happie deliuerie.</p>
            <p>As soone as they were gotte awaie, the faithfull page loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the door verie diligentlie, remaining all that night alone in the chamber: and when the messengers of the king came with commission to bring <hi>Partaritus</hi> to the pallace the nexte daie, they knocked at the doore, whome the page in humble maner saluted, praieng them to haue patience for a while: for (saith he) my Lord being wearie of his last iourney, slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth now verie soundlie: The messengers returning to <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moald,</hi> told him the pages answer: who all inraged, charged them presentlie to bring him to his presence: who repairing againe to the chamber doore, were in like sort once more soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the page to vse forbearance: but they admitting no delaies, cried out hastilie and hartilie, tut, tut, the droonkard hath now slept enough, and therevpon bearing the doore of the hinges they forceablie entered the chamber, and sought <hi>Partaritus</hi> in his bed, but found him not: wherevpon they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the page what was become of him, who answered them that he was fled: The messengers all amazed herewith, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie laieng hands on the childes bushie lock, and buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him pitiouslie, brought him to the pallace: and conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to the presence of the king, saide, Mightie Prince, <hi>Partharitus</hi> is fled, and this caitife boy helpt to conuey him: and for that cause meriteth death: <hi>Grimoald</hi> commanded them to laie hands off him, and willed him with a friendlie countenance to discouer vnto him the manner and meanes how his maister had escaped awaie: The page told him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing as it had past; whose faithfulnes when the king had considered vpon, he royallie offered him to make him one of his pages, assuring the lad that if he would be as faithfull to him as he had shewed himselfe towards his old maister,
<pb facs="tcp:20221:23"/>

            <p>After this, he made search for <hi>Vnulfe,</hi> who being brought before his presence, was pardoned by him, and not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but commended. But as where affection is rooted, there no fauors can supplant it, nor promises suppresse it: so these two louing their maister <hi>Partarithus</hi> verie deerelie, took no delight but onelie in desire they had to sée and serue him: for which cause a few daies after they repaired to <hi>Grimoald,</hi> beséeching him of license to séeke out their maister.

By God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Vnulfe,</hi> I had rather die with <hi>Partharithus,</hi> than liue in all other worldlie contents and delights. What (saied the king to the page) wilt thou also rather séeke out a bannished man, then serue a king? I my Lorde, saide he: for they are bad seruants that will leaue their maisters in miserie. <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moald</hi> wondering at their confidence, &amp; praising both their faithes, dismissed both of them with all fauour, giuing them both horsse and money to furnish and further them on theyr iourney.</p>
            <p>The two faithfull seruants humblie thanking the kinge, tooke their waie into France, hoping to finde their maister in that place according as was appointed. But <hi>Partaritus</hi> fearing least by reason of a peace latlie capitulated betwixt <hi>Dogobert</hi> kinge of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Grimoald,</hi> he shoulde be there surprised suddenlie by some sinister subtletie, tooke shipping for England: and hauing alreadie sailed from the shore, the voice of a man was heard among the rocks, which asked for <hi>Partaritus</hi> and whither he were in that ship. Whereto when answer was made that there he was, the voice replied, Then will him presentlie repaire vnto his countrey: for <hi>Grimoald</hi> a three daies hence is departed this life: <hi>Partaritus</hi> suddenly returned backe, commanding the marriners to reenter the harbour: and as soon as he was landed, he diligently sought out the messenger that had thus informed him: but finding him by no meanes possible, he supposed it to be some messu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age sent from God. For which cause, poasting towards his
<pb facs="tcp:20221:24"/>
countrey, and arriuing amongst the confines of Italie, hee found there a great number of <hi>Lombards</hi> who expected him, with whom he entered <hi>Pauia,</hi> and driuing out a little son of <hi>Grimoalds</hi> from the kingdome; he was by generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent created kinge of <hi>Lombardie</hi> thrée monethes after the death of <hi>Grimoald.</hi> For which cause he presentlie sent vnto <hi>Beneuent</hi> for his wife <hi>Rhodolinde,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Cunibert:</hi> And being a godlie Catholike and iust man, a liberall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the poore, and father of the innocent: as soone as he hadde quiet possession of the kingdome; in that place from whence he fled, which is on the other side of of <hi>Tesinus,</hi> he buil ded a monasterie to the honor and glorie of God his sauiour and onelie defender, wherein there were diuers Nunnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, whom he alwaies enriched with manie very goodlie possessions.</p>
            <p>The Quéene likewise builded a church in honour of our Ladie without the cittie wals, adorning it with maruelous rich ornaments: his page and trustie seruant returning to his court, as soon as they had tidinges of his establishment, were by him fauourablie intertained and richlie rewarded. Finallie, after he had reigned eighteene yeares, he departed this life not without the generall lament and teares of the whole inhabitants of <hi>Lombardie.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as well the nobles as commons, behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, ran with all hast vnto him, and after their saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions said thus vnto him: Mount vppon this horsse, and goe with vs: <hi>Libussa</hi> hath chosen thée for his husband, and the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> admit thee for their prince: <hi>Primislaus,</hi> although he were a poore countrey clowne, not incapeable of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall desire of rule which attainteth all men, gaue vnto them a homelie salutation after his manner, and tolde them that he was addressed to doo whatsoeuer pleased them: and vnder standing that he was to goe to <hi>Libussa</hi> (as if hee had a longe voiage to make, he fastened his bottle to his saddle bow, and grasping his bread and chéese in his hand he rode on féeding like a rusticke king, which was a verie sufficient euidence of that which <hi>Libussa</hi> before time had declared and told vnto them.</p>
            <p>As soone as his guttes were full and his bottle emptied, he mended his pace, and they conducted him with great pomp and honnour into the cittie, where he tooke <hi>Libussa</hi> to wife, and during all his life time was wholie ruled and gouerned by hir counsels and perswasions. But after she had submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hir selfe to the destinies, the gouernment remained who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in <hi>Primislaus</hi> hands, and the authoritie of Ladies ceased, which euen vnto that hower was both maintained and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by <hi>Libussa.</hi> After this, <hi>Valasca</hi> (which whilst <hi>Libussa</hi> liued was hir secretarie) being a Ladie of great valour and no lesse resolution then an <hi>Amazon,</hi> not induring or abiding that the authoritie of women should be thus annihilated, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling one daie in a priuie place all those that were of her

faction, she said thus vnto them:</p>
            <p>My sisters, we haue lost our good Ladie, who alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended vs from the outrages of men, neither could she euer endure that we should be ouer borne by them, so that she her selfe h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

You see now, how inforced we indure a hard and miserable seruitude, liuing vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of our husbands after the maner of slaues, except of our selues we shall gather head and courage to recouer our former liberties. Wherefore, if your thoughtes be as mine is, let vs ioine like heroick Ladies, and we will easily recouer our estates. I (as you know) was secretarie vnto <hi>Libussa,</hi> of whom I learned that which she knew: I am skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in inchantments, and the nature of hearbes is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vntome: if therfore you haue any meaning or will to followe me, assure your selues, that you shall be once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine lords ouer men.</p>
            <p>Upon these words, the whole assemblie of women condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to <hi>Valascas</hi> words, and mutuallie conspired against men. During this time, <hi>Primislaus</hi> dreamed one night, that a virgine gaue him bloud to drinke: for which cause he being a notable soothsaier, and willing to preuent a mischiefe which (as he imagined) might verie easilie be impugned, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocated all the chiefe nobles of his Prouince, vnder intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prohibit the ouer-great licence and libertie which wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had in the common weale: namelie, the women were accustomed to ride and run the race on horssebacke, to tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, shoote, and followe the chace, and brieflie to exercise themselues in all warlike discipline, which (as he thought) were matters manageable by men, and vnfit tasks for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But the Barons scoffed at him when he told them ther of, and said, that they rather deserued loue and reuerence for their agilitie and hardines, then reproofe and dishonor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valasca</hi> meane while desisied not neither daie nor night to exhort hir confederates, and often with drinks &amp; inchat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments turned away their affections from the loue of men, and daie by daie drewe more and more into this her League

Finallie, when she perceiued that she hadde gathered a sufficient power both of married wiues &amp; maids, in one night she caused euerie one of hir faction to kill their fathers, husbands, brethren, and sonnes in their beddes, and afterwards taking armes, with great expedition, they all of them marched togither to a place appointed them by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasca,</hi> not farre distant from <hi>Prage,</hi> and subduing some that had them in chace, they made a roade to <hi>Vissigrade</hi> whereas <hi>Primislaus</hi> aboad, intending there to surprise him: but séeing they could not take the fortresse, they retired themselues into a mountaine, a place naturallie impregnable, and there building a castle, they called it <hi>Deiuizo</hi> that is, the place of virgines, bicause that in their toonge a virgine is called <hi>Deiuize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This action of theirs seemed abhominable to all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the countrey, as wel in respect of the great slaugh ter they had made, as also because they had a great suspition of further mischéefe, for which cause they generallie gaue <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mislaus</hi> to vnderstand, that they were addrest to bidde these new <hi>Amazons</hi> battell, and that, if it pleased him to marche forward with his hoast, they also were in a readinesse to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.

But they, who set light by his counsell, leuieng by them selues a great armie, marched toward <hi>Deiuizo</hi> and striking battell with <hi>Valasco,</hi> were ignominiouslie ouerthrowne and put to flight with the slaughter of the greater part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and whereas in this seruice <hi>Malada, Nodea, Sua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>At that time <hi>Francis</hi> by reason of his yoong yeares, and the sound complection of his bodie, was verie proane and addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wanton and effeminate pastimes: and although hee were inueigled by the tender yeares and excéeding beautie of the maiden, notwithstanding he inquired of hir whither she had rather consent vnto euerie pleasure wherin he might imploy hir, or remaine in their handes whoe had first taken hir. Whom she thus answered, that she would be alwaies readie to obay him, so that it might please him to set hir frée from the handes of base iniurie. Where vpon <hi>Francis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie commanded that she should be conducted vnto his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion. When night came, and before he entered the bed, he asked the maiden againe, if she were of the same minde, or whether she had changed hir purpose. Who answered him that she continued resolued, then he willed that she shoulde disrobe and vncloath hir bodie, and so to laie hir selfe downe by him.</p>
            <p>But no sooner was she entred bed, but she espied the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Ladie painted after the maner, wheron turning

towards the Earle she wept and with all reuerence &amp; sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse she saied vnto him: O my Lorde I pray thee for that vnspotted virgines sake, whose image is in our sight, vouchsafe to be the protector of my virginitie, and thorough thy clemencie grant that without stain or dishonour I may returne vnto my betrothed spouse, who liueth a desperat and desolate life amongest the other captiues. And whereas I promised thee to submit my selfe to thy will, no other thinge moued me there vnto, then the desire I hadde to deliuer my selfe from the hands of those who rauished me: and not that alone, but the iustice and pietie I haue heard of thee, made me conceaue a great hope to submit to him who had so great vertues to command.</p>
            <p>These words had so great power in the mercifull and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind of the Captaine, that they extinguished in him all heat of vaine desires, so that of his owne proper charges he rescued the husband and redéemed him from shraldome, restoring the yoong virgine vnto him as soone as he came in to his presence. Hir spouse knéeling vppon his knees, and sighing bitterlie, said; My Lord thou dooest fullie answere the great expectation and fame which through euerie part is dispersed by thee, so that there is no land nor no péere in the world that either may match thee for humanitie, or conquer thee in clemencie. Almightie God, who may requite thée in our behalfe, yeeld thee condigne fauours for thy vertue: The Countie would haue giuen him manie thinges of that praie that he had taken, but the yong maiden would accept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, saieng that the neighbours séeing such gifts, woulde thinke and imagine that it were the price of hir virginitie that she had lost, and so by that meanes she shoulde fall into verie great infamie, which she euer rather chose to flie than death, wherevpon <hi>Frauncis Sforze</hi> dismissing them, they ioy fullie returned into their countrey.</p>

Empire, departed <hi>Rome,</hi> and repaired to <hi>Salona</hi> in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> where he was borne. But two yeares after that he had refused the <hi>Romain</hi> empire, an honourable embassage was sent by the Senate vnto him, praieng him earnestlie that he would haue pitie on the commons, and content himselfe to returne to <hi>Rome.</hi> It chanced that at such time as the said Embassadors came into his poore and homelie cottage, hee himselfe was in a little garden he had, setting of Lettises and diuers other hearbes; and assoone as he had heard the discourse of that they were to deliuer him, he returned them this answer: Séemeth it a requisite matter vnto you my freendes, that he who hath planted, cut, and watered lettice as these be, should leaue them to seeke royalties, and not to eate them in repose and quiet in his owne house? yes my friends, it is better eating these in quiet, then gouerning of <hi>Rome</hi> with care.</p>
            <p>Moreouer he said vnto them, Now haue I proued howe much it auaileth to commande, and howe healthfull it is to plough and dig. Leaue me therfore, I pray you, in my house: for why, I rather desire to get my liuing in this village with my handes, than to haue the charge of the <hi>Romaine</hi> empire accompanied with hate. <hi>Porides</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> hauing in great iustice gouerned his common weale for the space of sixe and thirtie yeares, at laste growing olde and fatiate of publike affaires, departing <hi>Athens</hi> he went vnto a certein Lordship of his left him by his auncestors in a certeine vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage without the cittie; in which plieng his booke by night, and labouring his fields by day he liued fiftéene years more; Aboue the doores of his house these words were written.
