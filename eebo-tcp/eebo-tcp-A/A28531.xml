            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Written when this Treatiſe was Finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.</p>
            <p>ESteemed truly Honourable highly Learned Sir; after my hearty deſiring of the Grace, Love and Mercy of our Dear IMMANUEL, as alſo all temporall welfare of Body, for you, I will not conceal from you Sir; that I have received and read the Book with the Appendix, and conſidered the Oppoſers <hi>underſtanding</hi> apprehenſion and Opinion, in the Love and Fear of God; and ſufficiently underſtand in what apprehenſion the Man runneth on; and that he hath <hi>not at all</hi> in the leaſt underſtood my Writings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Alſo I very much Lament the Man, that he hath plunged himſelf into ſuch a Lake, with the <hi>Election</hi> of God, out of which aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he cannot get, unleſſe he learne to underſtand the <hi>Center</hi> of all things or ſubſtances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Alſo he lamentably goeth aſtray concerning the <hi>humanity of Chriſt,</hi> and concerning his Mother <hi>Mary;</hi> which Opinion, is quite contrary to our Chriſtian or Spirituall Faith, upon which our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi> Salvation ſtandeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But I deſire from my heart, that this Man might become ſeeing, for he is <hi>zealous,</hi> for then his Zeale would be profitable: only the way which he now goeth, is an <hi>Open Gate</hi> to all vanity or Licentiouſneſſe, and deſpair; and there muſt a ſevere accompt belong to ſuch, <hi>introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> men into deſpair and vanity.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57415:3"/>
5. I deſire he may be adviſed; that he might become ſeeing, that he may at length <hi>acknowledge,</hi> the friendly Dear heart of JESUS CHRIST; which hath manifeſted it ſelf in our <hi>humanity;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to ſeek and to ſave our poor loſt Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. For this vain frivolous reproach which he venteth againſt his Brother, is <hi>no</hi> Chriſtian way at all; it will not build SION but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, if he will be comprehended under the <hi>ſeaventh</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>ſounding</hi> of <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and be one among the <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> then he muſt goe out from all reproachings, contention, and ſcorning, and ſeek only the heart of brotherly Love; elſe all is <hi>Babel</hi> and a Fiction, even clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Contending, and never coming to the Limit of our Reſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I have a little preſented it before him and other Readers, of my Writings, to conſider of it; ſince I ſee that not only my <hi>Oppoſer,</hi> but alſo <hi>others</hi> for the moſt part Perſons of <hi>high Dignity,</hi> are thus perplexed with this conceit about the <hi>Predeſtination or Election</hi> of God, to try, whether this moſt difficult errour might be brought out of the Minds of many of them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But I am entended to write an <note n="†" place="margin">The Book of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion written 1623.</note> 
               <hi>Entire Book</hi> thereof, if I could but perceive that Men would not ſo ſpitefully oppoſe me; <hi>without</hi> knowledge what ſpirits Child I am; this I offer to you as <hi>learned</hi> and experienced Men to conſider of, and entreat you, to ponder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>whence</hi> my apprehenſion and ſkill might come.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For you ſee and know, that I have not learned it, much leſſe <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed</hi> or underſtood it aforehand, as the manner of ſimple Ideots or <hi>Layicks</hi> is, neither have I ſought it, or underſtood any the leaſt part of it but it is given me of the Grace of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> in that I have ſought his Love-Heart, to hide my ſelf therein, from the Horrible Anger of God, and the Hatred or <hi>Enmity</hi> of the Devill.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Therefore I exhort and beſeech you in the Love of Chriſt, to think of it, and rightly hold cloſe to <hi>the Holy Scripture</hi> of the Spirit, and keep it rightly to the proof or Touchſtone, with a true Chriſtian Mind, and then your Eyes will be <hi>opened,</hi> that you will ſee and know it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Though I doe not at all doubt concerning your Perſon Sir, for I look upon you to be a very <hi>honeſt</hi> Lover of God and of the Truth; and I alſo hope, that my Mind which is ſo very exceedingly inclined towards you, will <hi>not</hi> deceive me.</p>
            <p n="12">12. For I ſtedfaſtly hope, and doe preſent it in my Prayers to God, that Sir, the Fair <hi>Garland</hi> or Crown of <hi>Divine Honour</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Wiſdome, may be ſet upon you, that you might <hi>not need</hi> to uſe either <hi>Mine</hi> or <hi>others</hi> writings to the knowledge of God: but Sir you know in your ſelf, as it hath alſo happened to me, out of what ſpirit I write, and uſe nothing elſe about it; for it is written, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 6. 45.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall be all Taught of God:</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Why will Men reproach then, when <hi>God</hi> powreth out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon ſuch a ſimple Man; ſo that he muſt write above the Reaſon of All Men; and higher than the Ground of <hi>this</hi> World is.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Deare Sir, it is done out of Gods Love towards you; that you may ſee the Ground and <hi>roote</hi> of your <hi>School-Contention;</hi> for many have ſought but not at the right Limit or Place, <hi>whence</hi> contention is ariſen to them, which hath filled the World, and hath <hi>almoſt</hi> quite deſtroyed all brotherly Love.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Therefore, God calleth you, with a <hi>higher</hi> voyce, that you might yet ſee, whence all Evill and Good Originateth, and proceedeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhould <hi>ceaſe</hi> from Contention and Strife, and moſt highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that which from the Times of this World hath been <hi>hitherto hidden,</hi> and is <hi>only</hi> manifeſted or revealed to the Children of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="16">16. But ſeeing it is ſhewed to me how your heart Sir is inclined to wiſdome, therefore I ſpeak <hi>ſublimely</hi> towards you, and do hope, you will accept it in true Love, and <hi>underſtand</hi> it rightly as it is entend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I would I could give you <hi>halfe</hi> the Spirit of my knowledge: and then you would need no Writings; although, I eſteeme you wiſe, yet I will once brotherly ſalute you with <hi>this</hi> Writing, before the rough Winter of Calamity Come, which is <hi>upon the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. If your Honour Love my Writings, I pray you to reade them <hi>diligently,</hi> and above all eſpecially to lay them to the <hi>Center</hi> of All things or Subſtances; and then the <hi>Three Principles</hi> will be very <note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> eaſie.</p>
            <p n="18">18. I know and am aſſured, that if you apprehend the <hi>Center</hi> in the Spirit, that you will have ſuch joy in it, as <hi>excelleth</hi> all the Worlds joy, for the Noble STONE of the wiſe Men, lyeth therein, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>certainty</hi> in ALL things, and releaſeth Man from all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and perplexity, in the Strife and Contentions about <hi>Religion,</hi> and openeth to him the higheſt ſecret Myſtery which lyeth IN himſelf: he bringeth his work which he is choſen to by Nature, to the higheſt PERFECTION; and can ſee all things into the Heart: muſt not that be a <hi>Jewel</hi> above all the precious things of this World?</p>
            <p n="19">19. If you ſhould meete with any thing in my Writings that were unintelligible and <hi>too</hi> high, I entreat you to Obſerve it, and ſend it me in Writing, and I will render it in a <hi>Childiſh</hi> manner.</p>
            <p n="20">20. But ſince I obſerve you have a very <hi>ſublime</hi> underſtanding, therefore I exhort and entreat you, in a right entention, as it is ſet before God; that Men would enter into ſuch a Life, and Live and

the Becoming Man or Incarnation of Chriſt, and in his <hi>former</hi> Paſquil or Libellous Pamphlet [againſt the <hi>Avrora]</hi> that the poor confuſed Man, runs on ſo ſenſleſly, and raveth againſt it, and yet hath no Ground or underſtanding in him at all, ſo that: I <hi>lament</hi> his great want of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and muſt have a great ſumpathy or fellow-feeling with him, and doe wiſh from my heart, that God would once open his heart, that he might firſt ſee and <hi>underſtand</hi> e're he Judgeth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For, the poor blinde Man, rejecteth many a <hi>thing</hi> in my Book, and ſets even <hi>ſuch</hi> a thing in the place thereof, as my meaning is, in the knowledge of it, which makes me wonder, how he is ſuch a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Saul,</hi> and is zealous for the Law of God, and yet hath <hi>no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> of it at all in the Light of God: I wiſh heartily that the Light to <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> might ſhine round about him, that he might become a <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeing he is ſo zealous, then might his zeale, be profitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the furthering the Salvation of Man.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But ſo long as he is in ſuch a way, as to blaſpheme reproach and perſecute, and ſo to rage in blindneſſe as <hi>Saul</hi> did, he will effect nothing, but only rave againſt God to his greateſt <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and will but confound thoſe whom he thinketh to teach, and lead them <hi>deeper</hi> into darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For he hath conceived ſuch an Opinion in his Reaſon, which it were much <hi>better</hi> he had never ſet it down in Paper: Alſo I am very much afraid, that <hi>Satan</hi> hath Caſt his own ſelf-Reaſon, without Divine Light, into ſuch a Priſon, and Captivated him with ſuch a Snare, out of which it will be <hi>hard</hi> to break forth, and <hi>without</hi> the Divine Light cannot at all be done.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But now ſeeing it is apparent, that not only he but others alſo are encumbred and perplexed with the purpoſe or <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God, and doe <hi>thus</hi> repreſent the Omnipotence of God after ſuch a manner, wherein they goe on in ignorance very <hi>confuſedly,</hi> and underſtand Nothing of Gods Will to Good and Evill, much leſſe doe they know what God is, from whence horrible Opinions are concluded of, and yet this Man in ſuch confuſed Reaſon ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly entendeth to diſgrace and ſuppreſſe my Writings which yet have a far deeper Ground, <hi>then he ever underſtood;</hi> therefore it ſhall be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſignified to him, to <hi>try</hi> whether he or another will thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſeeing in God.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Not</hi> with entent to contemne but to <hi>inſtruct</hi> out of my Talent which is given to me of God: For men know very well that I am <hi>no</hi> Doctor from the Schoole of this World, if it were not given to me I ſhould <hi>not</hi> underſtand it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And though I did not ſo highly ſeek, yet it hath been <hi>given</hi> to me without my knowledge: I ſought only the fountain of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and underſtood Nothing of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> what THAT was; but now it is alſo afforded me as a <hi>Favour,</hi> to ſee the Subſtance of All Subſtances; in which without the Light of God I ſhould <hi>indeed</hi> be Blinde.</p>

13. But ſeeing the Man with his Pamphlet annexed ſo my Writings, underſtandeth <hi>nothing</hi> at all of the Myſtery of the Subſtance of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>much leſſe</hi> the Principles to the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="14">14. Seeing he begins ſo artificially, and <hi>drags</hi> the Scripture by the haire of the Head to it, that it muſt ſerve him as he will have it, let the Ground and <hi>Corner-Stone</hi> be where it will, whether there be ſuch an underſtanding in the alledged Termes or <hi>Texts</hi> or No, only that he may bring Scripture and Letters, and exchange words with words, and thereby cloake his Erroneous meaning with ſuch a ſemblance, ſo he doth but bring <hi>Scripture</hi> for it: and though many times in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings I handle not juſt that very Matter, that he <hi>would anſwer</hi> with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but bring clean another Meaning; and that he <hi>perverts</hi> my ſence to the quite Contrary, and thereby would make it ſuſpected: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will a little ſummarily and briefly anſwer him to his <hi>aſperſed</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; Not in that Manner as to Contend with him; but for thoſe to <hi>conſider of</hi> that read my Writings.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For a true Chriſtian hath no Contention with any Man, about <hi>Religion;</hi> he that contendeth about words, and deſpiſeth his Brother, is blinde, and <note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>hath not</hi> the <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. For FAITH, is not a Hiſtoricall conceit, but a right Life, the Spirit of God muſt be generated in the <hi>Center</hi> through the Principle of the Soul, and ſpring up in the Myſtery of the Minde, and therein Rule and Shine, it muſt be <hi>Mans</hi> Will and Deed, yes, it muſt be his <hi>inward</hi> Life and underſtanding, and Man muſt be reſigned into if, elſe there is no right Faith or <hi>Divine</hi> underſtanding in a Man, but only <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Babel,</hi> Contention and Clamour, to teare and rend, about the Husk and not enjoy the Kernell.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore I ſay now; Is <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> in my ſcorner? why then is he a Scorner and Contender?

               <p n="18">18. O deare Sirs and Brethren, take it into conſideration, and look upon the holy Scriptures <hi>rightly</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, and then ye will finde that a right true Chriſtian hath contention with no man;

               </p>
               <p n="23">23.

               <p n="25">25. But, that he brings forth ſuch a ſad and miſerable meaning, Men ſee, ſufficiently, in that which he writes concerning the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> of God, and ſo thruſts all into <hi>Gods</hi> Predeſtination, and drags the Scripture by the Haire of the Head to it, quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Scripture: Oh that the Confuſed Man might come ſo farre, as <hi>firſt</hi> to learne to underſtand the <hi>Center</hi> of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Nature, and of all things or Subſtances, <hi>before</hi> he ſpeak of the Great Myſtery of all things or Subſtances and reprove thoſe to whom the ſame is revealed or manifeſted from God.</p>

               <p n="44">44. I underſtand with or by the Principles, Not the <hi>Chaos,</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> of the Aether, which dwelleth without Ground or Place in it ſelf, but I underſtand, How the Eye of the Aether Manifeſteth or <hi>Revealeth</hi> it ſelf, through and with the <hi>Principles,</hi> and introduceth it ſelf into Power Might Shining Glance and Glory, <hi>viz;</hi> with <hi>Deſire</hi> and Luſt or Longing Delight; where, in the Deſire the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhutting in, is effected, which is a Darkneſſe, where the Deſire is the firſt <hi>Center</hi> to Nature, which introduceth it ſelf into the ſource or quality, into the perceptibility and perception, even into the Fire, <hi>viz:</hi> into the fourth Form, as is ſufficiently Deſcribed in our Books, <hi>viz:</hi> of the <hi>Three Principles,</hi> alſo of the <hi>Threefold Life,</hi> alſo in the <hi>Second Booke</hi> of the Becoming Man or <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Chriſt, concerning Chriſts Suffering and Dying, and yet higher in the <hi>Six Poynts:</hi> to which Books I refer the Reader, and ſo in this Part, which the blind Man oppoſeth, it is not here expreſſed at Large.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Now if Gods Fire, which generateth the Glance or <hi>Luſtre</hi> of the Majeſty, be the firſt Principle; and yet in the Darkneſſe, the ſource quality or Torment and Pain, and moreover the <hi>ſterne</hi> Life, is <hi>generated,</hi> and alſo the Fire it ſelf Originateth out of the Darkneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the <hi>ſharpneſſe,</hi> with the aſpect or appearance of the Liberty in the Luſt or Longing out of the <hi>Chaos;</hi> then tell me now my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, whether the Dark World be a <hi>Principle,</hi> or whether He or I be blind in the <hi>Myſtery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46. I know alſo very well that the Fire is a ſource or quality of Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life, but I ſay that the <hi>Root</hi> of the Fire is <hi>Dark;</hi> and that the Dark world is not called God, for it is an Enimicitious quality in it ſelf; a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Nature.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Indeed it is Gods, and God who manifeſteth himſelf, through the Dark World with the Fire, in the Light of the Majeſty, is <hi>its Lord,</hi> for it becometh generated in the Deſire of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> out of the Abyſſe in the Nothing, and in the Deſire <hi>introduced</hi> into Darkneſſe, but the Luſt or Longing Delight, of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> to the Revelation, taketh only thus its Sharpneſſe and Fires Might to it ſelf, and yet bringeth it ſelf againe through the Dying in the Fire, wherein the Darkneſſe <hi>dyeth,</hi> underſtand the Darkneſſes ſubſtantrality, forth through the Fire into the Light, and maketh another or <hi>Second Principle,</hi> of another ſource or <hi>quality,</hi> viz: Joy Meekneſſe and Love-Deſire.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Thus the Dark-ſource or quality-Spirit, remaineth to be in it ſelf an anguiſh and <hi>Paine,</hi> and is called Gods Anger and fierce wrath, and the kindled Fire in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Form at the Center, is called a <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire,</hi> whence God calleth himſelf an angry, Zealous or Jealous, fierce wrathfull, God.</p>

               <p n="50">50. As we ſee a Similitude of this, in Fire and Light, where the <hi>Dark</hi> Matter in the Fire, <hi>Dyeth,</hi> and the <hi>Light ſhineth</hi> out of that which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and dwelleth in the Fire, and the Fire comprehendeth it NOT.</p>
