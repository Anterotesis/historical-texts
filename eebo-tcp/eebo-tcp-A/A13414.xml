            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST REVER END FATHER IN GOD WILLIAM by Divine providence LORD ARCH-BISHOP OF CANTERBURY His Grace, Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> and Metropolitane. CHANCELLOUR of the University of OXFORD, and one of his MAIESTIES most Honourable Privy Councell.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My most Honourable good LORD.</salute>
               <salute>May it please your GRACE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was obedience to my <hi>Superiour</hi> that ingaged me upon this last Anniversary commemoration of the great Goodnesse of God Almighty to our King and Country in the discouery of the most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="tcp:18762:3"/>
               <hi>Powder-Treason.</hi> It was a blessing which no tongue could expresse, much lesse mine, which had scarce learn'd to speake, at least, was most unfit to speake in the Schooles, of the Prophets. <hi>Delicata autem est illa obedientia que <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> quaerit.</hi> It had beene no good argument of my obedience to have disputed the inconvenience of my person, and the unaptnesse of my parts for such an imployment I knew God, out of the mouth of Infants, could acquire his praise, and if my heart were actually as <hi>Votive</hi> as my tongue should have beene, it might bee one of Gods <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to perfect his owne praise out of the weaknesse and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Organ. So as I was able, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to performe it, having my obedience ever ready for my excuse to men, and my willingnesse to performe my duty, for the assoylment of my selfe before God; part of which I hope was accepted, and I have no reason to thinke, that the other was not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
            <p>When I first thought of the Barbarisme
<pb facs="tcp:18762:3"/>
of this Treason, I wondred not so much at the thing it selfe as by what meanes it was possible for the Divell to gaine so strong a party in mens resolutions, as to move them to undertake a businesse so abhorring from Christianity, so evidently full of extreame danger to their lives, and so certainly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the highest wrath of God Almighty. My thoughts were thus rude at first; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a strict inquisition I fond it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as a businesse (perhaps full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their bodies, but) advantagious to their soules, consonant to the obligation of all Christians, and meritorious of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weight of Glory, for now it was come to passe which our dear Master foretold, <hi>men should kill us, and thinke they did God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in it.</hi> I could not thinke this to be a part of any mans religion, nor doe I yet believe it. For it is so apparently destructive of our deare Master his Royall lawes of <hi>Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Obedience,</hi> that I must not be so uncharitable as to thinke they speake their owne minde truly, when they professe their beliefe of
<pb facs="tcp:18762:4"/>
the lawfullnesse and necessity in some cases of rebelling against their lawfull Prince, and using all meanes to throw him from his kingdome, though it be by taking of his life. But it is but iust that they who breake the bonds of duty to their Prince, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forfeit the lawes of charity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and if they say not true, yet to bee more uncharitable to their owne persons, then I durst be, though I had their own war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Briefly (Most R. Father) I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them of the Roman party such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing opinions, as could not consist with loyalty to their Prince, in case hee were not the Popes subiects, and these so generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and somewhere obtruded under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of their soules, that I could not but point at these dangerous rocks, at which I doubt not, but the loyalty of many hath suffered shipwrack, and of thousands more might, if a higher <hi>Starre</hi> had not guided them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then their owne Pilots.</p>
            <p>I could not therefore but thinke it very likely that this Treason might spring from
<pb facs="tcp:18762:4"/>
the same Fountaine, and I had concluded so in my first meditations, but that I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to consider, whether or no it might not bee that these men were rather exasperated then perswaded, and whether it were not that the severity of our lawes against them might rather provoke their intemperate zeal, then religion thus move their setled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It was a materiall consideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they ever did and still doe fill the world with outcries against our lawes for making a rape upon their consciences, have printed Catalogues of their English Martyrs, drawn Schemes of most strange tortures imposed on their Priests, such as were unimaginable, by <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> or any of the worst and cruellest enemies of Christianity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring thus to make us partly guilty of our owne ruine, and so washing their hands in token of their owne innocency, even then when they were dipping them in the blood Royall, and would have emptyed the best veynes in the whole Kingdome to fill their <hi>Lavatory.</hi> But I found all these to be
<pb facs="tcp:18762:5"/>
but Calumnies, strong accusations upon weake presumptions, and that the cause did rest where I had begun, I meane, upon the pretence of the <hi>Catholique cause,</hi> and that the imagin'd iniquity of the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> could not be made a vaile to cover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their intentions, for our Lawes were just, Honourable, and Religious.</p>
            <p>Concerning these and some other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices to the businesse of the day, I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some part of my thoughts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause happily they were but a just truth, and this truth not unseasonable for these last times, in which (as S. Paul prophecyed) <hi>men would be fierce, Traytors, heady, and high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, creeping into houses, leading filly women captive,</hi> it pleased some who had power to command me, to wish me to a publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these my short and sudden meditations, that (if it were possible) even this way I might expresse my duty to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus farre encouraged, I resolved to goe something further, even to the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a dedication to your <hi>Grace,</hi> that since
<pb facs="tcp:18762:5"/>
I had no merit of my own to move me to the confidence of a publike view, yet I might dare to venture under the protection of your <hi>Graces</hi> favour. But since my boldnesse doth as much neede a defence, as my Sermon a Patronage, I humbly crave leave to say, that though it be boldnesse, even to presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet my addresse to your <hi>Grace</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unreasonable.</p>
            <p>For since all know that your <hi>Grace</hi> thinks not your life your owne, but when it spends it selfe in the service of your <hi>King,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your great endeavours against the ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of both sides who labour the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church and State, I could not think it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to present to your <hi>Grace</hi> this short discovery of the Kings enemies, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and proper to your <hi>Grace</hi> who is so true, so zealous a lover of your Prince and Country. It was likewise appointed to be the publike voice of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for your <hi>Vniverfity</hi> (though she never spake weaker then by so meane an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and therefore is accountable to your
<pb facs="tcp:18762:6"/>
               <hi>Grace</hi> to whom under God and the King we owe the Blessing and Prosperity of all our Studies. Nor yet can I choose but hope, that my Great Obligations to your <hi>Grace's</hi> Favour may plead my pardon, (since it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that my Gratitude should be bold, then my diffidence ingratefull) but that this is so farre from expressing the least part of them, that it layes a greater bond upon me, either for a debt of delinquency in presenting it, or of thankfulnesse, if your <hi>Grace</hi> may please to pardon it.</p>
            <p>I humbly crave your <hi>Grace's Benediction,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and acceptance of the humblest duty and observance of</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LUK. 9. Cap. vers. 54.</bibl>
               <q>But when <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come from Heaven and consume them even as <hi>Elias</hi> did?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shall not need to strain much to bring my Text and the day together, Here is fire in the text, consuming fire, like that whose <hi>Antevorta</hi> we doe this day commemorate. This fire called for by the Disciples of Christ: so was ours too; by Christs Disciples at least, and some of them intitled to our Great Master by the compellation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name of IESUS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:18762:7"/>I would say the paralell holds thus farre, but that the persons of my Text, however <hi>Boanerges,</hi> sonnes of thunder and of a reproveable spirit, yet are no way considerable in the proportion of malice with the persons of the day. For if I consider the cause that mov'd <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to so inconsiderate a wrath, it beares a fair excuse: The men of <hi>Samaria</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 53.</note> turn'd their Lord and Master out of doores, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give a nights lodging to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. It would have disturbed an excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to see him, whom but iust before they beheld transfigured, and in a glorious Epiphany upon the Mount, to be so neglected by a company of hated <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as to be forc'd to keep his vigils where nothing but the welkin should have been his roofe, not any thing to shelter his precious head from the descending dew of heaven. — <q>Quis talia fando Temperet?</q> It had been the greater wonder if they had not been angry. But now if we should levell our progresse by the same line and guesse that in the present affaire there was an equall cause, because a greater fire was intended, wee shall too much betray the ingenuity of apparent truth, and the blessing of this <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi> They had not halfe such a case for an excuse to a farre greater malice; it will prove they had none at all, and therefore their malice was somuch the more malicious because causelesse and totally inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</p>
            <p>However, I shall endeavour to joyne their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18762:7"/>
in as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a paralell as I can; which if it be not exact (as certainly it cannot, where we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discovered so much difference in degrees of malice,) yet by laying them together we may better take their estimate, though it be only by seeing their disproportion.</p>
            <p>The words as they lay in their own order, point out, 1. The persons that ask't the question. 2. The cause that mov'd them. 3. The person to whom they propounded it; 4. The Question it selfe. 5. And the precedent they urg'd to move a grant, drawn from a very fallible Topick, a singular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in a speciall and different case. The persons here were Christs Disciples; and so they are in our case, design'd to us by that glorious Sir-name of <hi>Christianity:</hi> they will be called Catholiques, but if our discovery perhaps rise higher, and that the See Apostolique prove sometimes guilty of so reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a spirit, then we are very neer to a paralell of the persons, for they were Disciples of Christ, &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. 2. The cause was the denying of toleration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode upon the grudge of an old schisme, Religion was made the instrument. That which should have taught the Apostles to be charitable, and the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> hospitable, was made a pretence to justify the unhospitablenesse of the one and the uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other. Thus farre we are right, for the malice of this present Treason, stood upon the same base. 3. Although neither Side much doubted of the lawfulnesse of their proceedings; yet S. <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18762:8"/>
and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> were so discreet as not to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves infallible, therefore they ask'd their Lord: so did the persons of the day, aske the question too, but not of Christ, for he was not in all their thoughts; but yet they ask'd of Christs Delegates, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should have given their answer <hi>eodem tripode,</hi> from the same spirit. They were the Fathers <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> who were ask'd. 4. The question is of both sides concerning a consumptive sacrifice, the destruction of a Towne there, of a whole Kingdome here, but differing in the circumstance of place whence they would fetch their fire. The Apostles would have had it from Heaven, but these men's conversation was not there. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, things from beneath, from an artificiall hell, but breath'd from the naturall and proper, were in all their thoughts. 5. The example, which is the last particular, I feare I must leave quite out, and when you have considered all, perhaps you will look for no example.</p>
            <p>First of the persons; they were Disciples of Christ and Apostles. [<hi>But when</hi> Iames <hi>and</hi> Iohn <hi>saw this,</hi>] When first I considered they were Apostles, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered they should be so intemperatly angry; but when I perceived they were so angry, I wondred not that they sinned. Not the priviledge of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall spirit, not the nature of Angels, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of immortality can guard from the danger of sinne, but if we be overrul'd by passion, we almost subject our selves to its necessity. It was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without reason altogether, that the Stoicks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18762:8"/>
wisemen to be void of passions, for sure I am, the inordination of any passion is the first step to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And although of them, as of waters of a muddy residence wee may make good use, and quench our thirst, if wee doe not trouble them, yet upon any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle disturbance we drinke down mud in stead of a cleere streame, and the issues of sinne and sorrow, certaine consequents of temerarious or inordinate anger. And therefore when the Apostle had given us leave to <hi>be angry,</hi> as knowing the condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, hee quickly enters a <hi>Caveat</hi> that <hi>we sinne not;</hi> hee knew sinne was very likely to be hand-maid where <hi>Anger</hi> did domineer, and this was the reason why <hi>S. Iames</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> are the men here pointed at, for the Scripture notes them for <hi>Boanerges,</hi> sonnes of thunder, men of an angry temper, <hi>&amp; quid mirum est filios tonitrui fulgurâsse voluisse?</hi> said S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> But there was more in it then thus. Their spirits of themselves hot enough, yet met with their education under the Law, (whose first tradition was in fire and thunder, whose precepts were just but not so mercifull;) and this inflam'd their distemper to the height of a revenge.

been against them, and all to acquit the Fathers of the Society from these scandalous opinions; as if these laborious devices could make what they have said and done, to be unspoken and undone, or could change their opinions from what indeed they are, whereas they never went <hi>ex animo</hi> to refute these Theorems, never spake against them in the reall and serious dialect of an adversary, never condemned them as hereticall, but what they have done they have been sham'd to, or forc'd upon, as <hi>Pere Coton</hi> by the King of France, and <hi>Servin</hi> to a confutation of <hi>Mariana,</hi> (from which he desir'd to be excused, and after the Kings death, writ his declaratory letter to no purpose;) the <hi>Apologists</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes of Christendome against them; and when it is done, done so coldly in their reprehensions with a greater readinesse to excuse all, then condemne any, I say these things to a considering man doe increase the suspicion if at least that may be called suspicion for which we have had so plain testimonies of their own.</p>

            <p>More yet; for when the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had feiz'd upon the English Merchants goods which were at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the Pope took the occasion, instigated the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to aid <hi>the pious attempts</hi> of those who conspir'd against the Queen: they are the words of <hi>Gabatius.</hi> This rebellion was intended to be; under<note place="margin">Efflagitabat ab Rege ut Anglorum in Elizabetham pie conspiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium studia soveret.</note> the conduct of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk, Viro Catholico,</hi> a Roman Catholique, <hi>Gabutius</hi> notes it, for fear some Heretik might be suspected of the designe, and so the Catholiques loofe the glory of the action. However <hi>Pius quintus intended to use the utmost and most extreme remedies to cure her heresy, &amp; all means to increase and strengthen the rebellion.</hi> I durst not have thought so much of his <hi>Halinesse,</hi> if his own had not said it; but if this be not worse then the fiery spirit which our blessed Saviour reproved in <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> I know not what is.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to doe to specify the spirit of <hi>Paulus quintus</hi> in the <hi>Venetian</hi> cause; this only, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> propounded the example of <hi>Gregory the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hildebrand.</note> to him, of which how farre short he came, the world is witnesse. Our own businesse calls to mind the <hi>Bulls</hi> of Pope <hi>Clemont</hi> the eight, in which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques in England were commanded to see that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18762:15"/>
however the right of succession did intitle any man to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> yet if he were not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, they should have none of him, but with all their power they should hinder his coming in. This Bull <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth extreamly magnify, and indeed<note place="margin">Apol. adv. R.

For when <hi>Garnet</hi> would willingly have known the Popes minde in the businesse, <hi>Catesby</hi> eased him of the trouble of sending to <hi>Rome,</hi> since the Popes<note place="margin">Proced agt.

I doubt not (said <hi>Catesby</hi>) at all of the Popes mind, but that he, who commanded our endeavours to hinder his coming in, is willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough we should throw him out. It was but a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable collection.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to instance in the effects which this Bull produc'd; the Treason of <hi>Watson</hi> &amp; <hi>Cleark;</hi> two English <hi>Seminaries</hi> are sufficiently known, it was as a <hi>Praeludium</hi> or warning peice to the great <hi>Fougade,</hi> the discharge of the Powder Treason; Briefly, the case was so, that after the Publication of the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius quintus,</hi> these Catholiques in England durst not be good Subjects till <hi>F. Parsons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> got a dispensation that they might for a while doe it, and <hi>rebus sic stantibus</hi> with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science professe a generall obedience in causes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: and after the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> a great many of them were not good subjects, and if the rest had not taken to themselves the Priviledge which the Pope<note place="margin">Innoc.

to doe as the Pope bid them, or to pretend a reason why they would not:</hi> we may say as <hi>Creswell</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note place="margin">Philop pag. 212, n. 306.</note> of <hi>Cardinall Allen; certainly we might have had more bloudy tragedies in England, if the moderation of some more discreetly temperd had not been interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> However it is no thank to his <hi>Holinesse,</hi> his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit blew high enough.</p>
            <p>But I will open this secret no farther, if I may have but leave to instance once more. If I mistake<note place="margin">Scp. 11, 1589</note> not, it was <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> who sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a speech in full <hi>Consistory,</hi> in which hee compares the assasinat of <hi>Iaques Clement</hi> upon <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to the exploits of <hi>Eleazar</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudith,</hi> where after having aggravated the faults of the murdred King, concluded him to have diedimpenitent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him the solemnities of <hi>Masse, Dirge</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem,</hi> for his soule, at last he ends with a prayer, <hi>that God would finish what in this (bloudy) manner had been begun.</hi> I will not aggravate the foulenesse of the thing by any circumstances (though I cannot but wonder that his <hi>Holinesse</hi> should say a prayer of so much abhomination.) it is of it selfe too bad.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18762:18"/>
               <hi>Bull</hi> against the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> without the Kings leave, and on the Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for the like offence. Thus farre our Lawes are innocent.</p>
            <p>But when this Statute did not take the good effect for which it was intended, neither keeping them in their ancient Communion nor obedience, but for all this, <hi>Mayne, Campian,</hi> and many others, came as the Popes Emissaries for execution of the Bull, the State proceeded to a farther severity, making Lawes against Recusancy, against Seditious and Trayterous Bookes, and against the residence of Romish Priests in <hi>England,</hi> making the first fineable with a pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mulct, the two later, Capitall, as being made of a Treasonable nature. Of these in order.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The mulct which was imposed for Recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was not soul mony, or paid for Religion; and that for these reasons. 1. Because it is plaine Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not make them absent themselves from our Churches, unlesse they had changed their Religion since the Bull came over. For if Religion could consist with their Communion with us before the Bull (as it's plain it did) then why not after the Bull, unlesse it be part of their Religion to obey the Pope, rather then to obey God commanding us to obey our Prince? 2. Their Recusancy was an apparent mischiefeto our Kingdome, and it was the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diversion of this that was the only or speciall end of these Lawes.</p>
            <p>The mischiefe is apparent these two waies. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18762:18"/>
by their Recusancy they gave attestation that they held the Bull to be valid; for else why should they after the Bull deny their Communion, which before they did not? Either they must think the Queen for a just cause, and by a just power excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or why did they separate from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Now if the Queen by vertue of the Bull was excommunicate, why should they stop here? She was by the same deposed, they absolved from all Allegeance to her, and commanded to take arms against her. I confesse it is no good argument of it selfe, to say, The Pope might excommunicate the Queen, therefore depose her from her Kingdome; But this concludes with them sufficiently, with whom excommunication not only drives from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, but deprives of Temporalls, and is not to mend our lives but to take them away; I speak how it is in the case of Princes, (and I shall anon prove it) for they being publike persons from whose Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more may be gotten, are like to suffer more, <hi>ut ex tunc ipse (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p n="2">2 It is plaine that Recusancy and disobedience came actually hand in hand; I say not that one was the issue of the other, but that they were coetaneous,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18762:19"/>
for the same persons that moved them to Recusancy by vertue of the Bull, moved them to the execution of it <hi>per omnia.</hi> Now see whither this would tend! They by Recusancy were better able to judge of their forces in <hi>England,</hi> and what party they were able to make for execution of the Bull, whilest by that as by a discriminative cognisance they were pointed at, as Abettors of the Catholike cause.</p>
            <p>Thus farre they suffered not for their Religion or conscience, unlesse it were against their conscience to be good subjects, and then it was not Religion, at least not Christian, that was inconsistent with their Loyalty, &amp; so hitherto inrespect of us, their machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was altogether causelesse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the second (of which sometimes they accuse our laws) I mean the writing &amp; publishing of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; Trayterous Books, I shall not need to say any<note place="margin">Apud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> involves more, by vertue of the same Canon: I mean, not only the seditious Libellers but impugners of the Kings Regalties, as also the Bringers, Publishers, and Executioners of the Bull; as is to be seene in the constitution of Arch-bishop <hi>Stephen,</hi> in a Coar cell held at <hi>Oxford.</hi> But secondly, whether they were or were not, it matters nothing; this I suppose was no part of their Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this might be made Treason, and yet their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18762:19"/>
and peace of conscience undistarbed. 3. But the next is the main outcry of all, the very <hi>Concla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum est</hi> of the <hi>Catholique</hi> cause, if suffered; it was made Treason to be a Priest, or at least if any of their Priests should be found in England he should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Traytor, and these Lawes were not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, but then in execution.</p>
            <p>When certaine Sycophants told <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that some of his discontented Subjects called him Tyrant, his answer was, <hi>Rudes sunt Macedones, &amp; scapham vocant scapham.</hi> I wish these men who object this, had the same ingenuity, and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the rudenesle of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth is no apparent calumny. And truly, as the case then stood, it was no worse. For consider that the statute against Priests was not made till sixteen years after the Bull of <hi>Pius quintus,</hi> and after much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both by the confession of some Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and divers Lay-persons, that at least, many of them came into England with this errand, that they might instigate the Queenes liege people to the Execution of it. This is very plaine in the case of <hi>Mayne</hi> the lesuit, and <hi>M. Tregion</hi> who were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">1577.</note> at <hi>Launston</hi> for the same businesse.</p>
            <p>The state could not certainly know what would be the issue, but yet could not but think it likely to produce more and worse consequences for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Tacitus lib. 3. Annal.</note> 
               <hi>Leges aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> justa in factaconstituuntur quiafu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura in incerto sunt.</hi> The Queen then providing for her safety banished these Priests out of her domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18762:20"/>
This was all, and this done with so much lenity and moderation as if of purpose to render good for their evill; such was her innocence, and yet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for her safety, such was her prudence. She gave them forty daies time of preparation for their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, impos'd no penalty for their longer stay incase that any of them were lesse healthfull, or that the winds were crosse, or that the wether serv'd not: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that during their stay, they gave security for their due obedience to her laws, and that they should attempt nothing against her person or government, for this was all she aim'd at; but if they obeyed not the Proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, having no just cause to the contrary, such as were expressed in the Act, then it should be adjudged their errand was not right, &amp; therefore (not their Religion, but) their disobedience Treasonable.</p>
            <p>This was the highest <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the severity of this state against them, now first I shall briefly shew that this proscription which was the highest penalty, was for just cause as the case then stood, and deserved on their part. 2. It was but reasonable, in case they obeyed not the proscription, their stay should be made Treason. 1. Because the Priests did general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach the Popes power either directly over tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, or else in order to spiritualls, of which the Pope being judge it would come to the same issue, and this was dangerous to the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and intrenched too much upon the Regalty. In particular, the case of bringing from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and publishing of Bulls, was by the Lords of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18762:20"/>
the Parliament in the sixteenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, judg'd to be [<hi>cleerely in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Kings Crown and of his Regalty, as it is well known and hath been of a long time known,</hi>] and therefore they protested [<hi>together and every one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by himselfe, that they would be with the same Crown and Regalty inthese cases specially, and in all other cases which shall be attempted against the same Crown and Regalty in all points with all their power,</hi>] I hope then if the State in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> having farre greater reason then ever, shall judge that these Bulles, the publishing of them, the Preaching of their validity, and reconciling by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them her Subjects to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> be dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to her Crown and Regalty, I see no reason She should be frighted from her just defence with the bugbear of pretended Religion, for if it was not against Religion then, why is it now? I confesse there is a reason for it, to wit, because now the Popes power is an Article of Faith (as I shall shew anon) but then it was not with them, any more then now it is with us: but whether this will convince any man of reason I leave it to himselfe to consider.</p>
            <p>But one thing is observeable in that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, I meane this clause [<hi>as it is well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> been of a long time knowne.</hi>] The Popes incroachments upon the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had been an old sore, and by its eld almost ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate; but yet it grieved them neverthelesse, nor was the lesse a fever for being hecticall: but so it is that I am confident upon very good grounds, it may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18762:21"/>
be made as apparent as the noon Sunne, for these 600 years and upwards, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have exercised so extream and continuall Tyranny and exactions in this Kingdome, that our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was under him worse then the State of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> under their thirty Tyrants, or then our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are now under their <hi>Belgick</hi> Tributes. So many greivances of the people, expilations of the Church, abuses to the State, intrenchments upon the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Crown were continued, that it was a great blessing of Almighty God, our Kingdome was delivered from them upon so easy termes, which <hi>Grosthead</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> thought would never be done, but in <hi>Ore gladii cruentandi:</hi> and now to have all these mischiefes returne <hi>with more strength</hi> upon us by the attempts of these Priests, had been the highest point of indiscretion and sleepinesse. I said [<hi>with more strength</hi>] because what anciently at the highest was thought but a priviledge of the Church began now to be an Article of Faith, and therefore if admitted would have bound stronger and without all possibility of redresse.</p>
            <p>And now if after all this any man should doubt of the justice of these Lawes against the Priests obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the State the Popes power, I only referre him to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> where let him hold his Plea against those great Sages of the Law, for their just censures upon <hi>Florentinus Iacobus, Thomas</hi>
               <note place="margin">1561.</note> 
               <hi>Blanzius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Tanquerell,</hi> who were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a solemne honorary penance and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18762:21"/>
to the State, and not without extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty escaped death, for the same cause. But this is hot all. I adde.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Pope had his Agent in <hi>England</hi> to stirre up the Subjects to rebell against the Queene, as I proved before by the testimonies of <hi>Catena</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> It is not then imaginable that he should so poorely intend his own designes, to imploy one on purpose, and he but a Merchant, and that the Priests who were the men, if any, most likely to doe the businesse, should be un-imployed. I speak not of the argument from matter of fact, (for it is apparent that they were imployed, as I shewed but now,) but it is plain also that they must have been imployed, if we had had no other argument but a presumption of the Popes ordinary discretion.</p>
            <p>Things then remaining in this condition what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity could the Queen or State have without the absence of those men who must be the instruments of their mischiefe? Thirdly, there was great reason those men might be banished who might from their own principles plead immunity from all Lawes, and subordination to the Prince. But that so these Priests might, I only bring two witnesses, leading men of their own Side. Thus <hi>Bellarmine: The Pope hath exempted all Clerks from subiection to Princes.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, it was but reasonable, in case they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not the proscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their disobedience should be made Capitall.

               </hi> against the command of <hi>Valentius.</hi> Such was the case of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18762:22"/>
Priests, whom for just cause (as I have proved) and too apparent proofe of seditious practices the Queen banished. Now if the Queen was their lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, then were they bound to obey her Decree of exile, though it had been unjust as was the case of <hi>Eusebius;</hi> or if they did not obey, not to think the Lawes unjust for punishing their disobedience. I say again, their Disobedience, not their Religion: for that it was not their Religion that was struck at by the justice of these Lawes, but the security of the Queen and State only aim'd at, (besides what I have already said,) is apparent to the evidence of sence. For when <hi>Hart,</hi> and <hi>Bosgrave, Iesuits</hi> both, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England against the Law, they were apprehended and imprison'd: (for the Lawes without just Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were of no force for the Queenes safety;) but when these men had acknowledg'd the Queenes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate power, and put in their security for their due obedience, they obtain'd their pardon and their liberty. The same proceedings were in the case of <hi>Horton</hi> and <hi>Rishton,</hi> all which I hope were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from their Order or Religion, but so they must have been or not have escap'd death, in case that their Religion had been made Capitall. Lastly, this Statute extended only to such Priests who were made Priests since <hi>Primo</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; were born in <hi>England.</hi> It was not Treason for a French Priest to be in England, but yet so it must have been if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had been the thing they aim'd at. But 'tis so foule a Calumny, I am asham'd to stand longer to efute it. The proceedings of the Church and State
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18762:23"/>
of <hi>England</hi> were just, honourable and religious, full of mercy and discretion, and unlesse it were that as <hi>C. Fimbria</hi> complain'd of <hi>Q. Scaevola,</hi> we did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our breasts wide enough to receive the danger, there is no cause imaginable, I mean on our parts, to move them to so damned a conspiracy, or indeed to any just complaint.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if these were not the causes (as they would faine abuse the world into a perswasion that they were,) what was? I shall tell you, if you will give me leave <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>First, I guesse that the Traitors were encouraged and primarily mov'd to this Treason from the preuailing opinion which is most generally receiv'd on that side of the lawfulnesse of deposing Princes that are Hereticall. I say generally receiv'd, and I shall make my words good, or else the blame shall lay on themselves for deceiving me when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their own mindes.

            <p n="3">3 He that saith Subjects may and are bound to depose their Princes, and to drive them from all rule over Christians, if they be able, meanes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more: For what if the Prince resist still he is bound to depose him if he be able. How if the Prince make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he may wage a warre with his Prince, I doubt not but thinks he may kill him; and if the fortune of the warre lights so upon him, the subject cannot be blamed, for doing of his duty.</p>
            <p>It is plain that killing a Prince is a certain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of deposing him, unlesse the Prince be bound
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18762:27"/>
in conscience to think himselfe a Heretick, when the Pope declares him so, and be likewise bound not to resist, and besides all this will performe these his obligations, and as certainly think himselfe hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and as really give over his Kingdome quietly, as he is bound. For in case any of these should faile, there can be but very sleder assurance of his life. I would be loth to obtrude upon men the odious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of their opinions, or to make any thing worse which is capable of a fairer construction; but I crave pardon in this particular, the life of Princes is sacred, and is not to be violated so much as in thought, or by the most remote consequence of a publike doctrine: But here indeed it is so immediate and naturall a consequent of the former that it must not be dissembled. But what shall we think if even this blasphemy be taught <hi>in terminis?</hi> See this too.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1407. when the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been slaine by <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the fact noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beyond a possibility of conccalement, he thought it his best way to imploy his Chaplaine to justify the act, pretending that <hi>Orleans</hi> was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. This stood him in small stead; for by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of <hi>Gerson,</hi> it was decreed in the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> that Tyranny was no sufficient cause for a man to kill a Prince. But yet I finde that even this decree will not stand Princes in much stead. First, because the decree runnes [<hi>ut nemo privatâ Authoritate &amp;c.</hi>] but if the Pope commands it, then it is <hi>Iudicium publicum,</hi> and so they are never the

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18762:28"/>

            <p>For these reasons I think it is true enough that the constituting the Pope the judge of Princes in the matter of deposition, is of more danger then the thing it selfe. The summe is this. However schisme or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy may be pretended, yet it is but during the Popes pleasure that Kings or subjects shall remain firme in their mutuall necessitude. For if our Prince bee but excommunicate or declar'd heretick, then to be a good subject will be accounted no better then irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and <hi>Anti-Catholicisme.</hi> If the conclusion be too hard and intolerable then so are the Premises, and yet they passe for good Catholike doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves.</p>
            <p>But if truly and <hi>ex animo</hi> they are otherwise affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they should doe well to unsay what hath been said, and declare themselves by publique authority against such doctrines. And say whether or no their determinations shall be <hi>de fide?</hi> If they be, then all those famous Catholique Doctors, <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Bellarmine, Creswell, Mariana, Emanuel Sà, &amp;c.</hi> are heretiques, and their Canons teach heresy, and Many of their Popes to be condemn'd as hereticall, for practising and teaching deposition of Princes by an authority usurp't against, and in prejudice of the Christian faith. But if their answers be not <hi>de fide,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:18762:34"/>
then they had as good say nothing, for the danger is not at all decreased, because if there be Doctors on both sides by their own <note n="*" place="margin">Charity maintained by Cath. cap. 7.</note> assertion they may without sinne follow either, but yet more safely if they follow the most received and the most autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, and whether this rule will lead them, I will be judg'd by any man that hath considered the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Briefly either this thing must remain in the same state it is, and our Princes still expos'd to so extream hazards, or else let his <hi>Holinesse</hi> seat himselfe in his chaire, condemne these doctrines, vow against their future practise, limit his <hi>ordo ad spiritualia,</hi> containe himselfe within the limits of causes directly and meerely Ecclesiasticall, disclaime all power, so much as indirect over Princes temporalls, and all this with an intent to oblige all Christendome. Which when I see done, I shall be most ready to believe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Popery, doth either directly or by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence destroy Loyalty to our lawfull Prince, but not till then, having so much evidence to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thus much was occasion'd by consideration of the cause of the Disciples <hi>Quaere</hi> which was when they saw this, that their L. and M. for his difference in Religion was turned forth of doores, which when they saw,</p>

            <p>It is the proper cognisance of Mahumetanisme, by fire and sword to maintain their cause, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Religion, by ruine of Princes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering their Kingdomes.

In the fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> which was assembled when the usurping and Tyrannizing Goths did domineere in Europe, the most whereof were Tyrants, Vsurpers, or Arrians; the Councell decreed that if any man did violate the life or person of his King, <hi>aut potestate Regni exuerit,</hi> kill him or depose him, <hi>Anathema sit &amp;c.</hi> He should be accursed in the sight of God and his Holy Angels, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withall the companions of his iniquity, hee should be separated from the Catholique Church.

as a thing not subjicible to their penitentiall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, because it was a fact not repented of, but then in agitation, and resolved upon for the future. How then could this be a confession, whose institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must certainly be in order to absolution, and how could this be in any such order, when it was a businesse of which they could not expect to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved unlesse they hop'd to sinne with a pardon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks; and on condition God would be mercifull to them in its remission, would come and professe that they were resolved to anger him? In reason this could be no act of repentance, neither could it, by confession of their own side. It is the doctrine of <hi>Hostiensis:</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">Cap Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos. 3. q. n. 116.</note> 
               <hi>Navarre,</hi> and<note n="c" place="margin">In lucubrat: ad Barrolum. in L. ut Vim. n. 22 ff. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftitia &amp; iure</note> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Alban</hi> confesse it to be most commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It was not only not repented of, but by them reputed to be a good action, and so could not be a matter of confession. I appeal to any of their own <hi>Manuals</hi> and penitentiary bookes. It is culpable say they. I am sure it is ridiculous in any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and shrive himselfe of a good action, and that this was such in their opinion, it's plaine, by that impious answer of <hi>Garnet,</hi> affirming it a businesse<note place="margin">See proceed. against late Traitors.</note> greatly meritorious, if any good might thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Catholique cause.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By this their pretended confession they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to acquire new complices, as is evident <hi>in the proceedings against the Traitors.</hi> They were therefore bound to reveale it, for it neither was nor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18762:40"/>
could be a proper and formall confession. That this is the common opinion of their own Schooles, see it affirmed by <hi>Aegidius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first particular then is plain. Here neither was the forme of confession, nor yet could this thing be a matter of confession, therefore supposing the seale of confession to be sacredly inviolable in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet they were highly blameable for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement in the present.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But the truth of the second particular is more to be inquired of. That is, that though these things had been only revealed in confession, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession had been formall and direct, yet they were bound in the present case to reveale it, because the seale of confession is not so inviolable, as that in no case it is to be broken up, and if in any, especially it may be opened in the case of treason.</p>
            <p>I never knew any thing cryed up with so generall avoyce upon so little ground, as is the <hi>Over hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> seale of confession.</p>
            <p>True it is that an ordinary secret committed to a friend in civill commerce is not to be revealed upon every cause, nor upon many, (but upon some it may as they all confesse.) If thus, then much rather is this to be observed in the revelation of the secrets of our consciences, not only from the ordinary tye to secrecy, but likewise least sinnes should grow more frequent, if so great a remedy of them be made so odious, as to expose us to a publike infancy or danger of the law. The Councell therefore that first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18762:41"/>
this obligation was very prudent and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pleads a thousand yeares prescription, and relies upon good conveniences. This is all that ever could be prov'd of it (as may appeare anon) but these are too weak a base, to build so great a structure on it, as to make it sacriledge, or any sinne at all, to reveale confessions in some cases.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For first, if because it is delivered as a secret, and such a secret, it is the more closely and religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be kept; it is true, but concludes no more, but that it must be a greater cause that must authorize a publication of this, then of the secrets of ordinary commerce between friend and friend.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If the licensing of publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of confession be a way to make confession odious, and therefore that it may not be publish'd, I say if this concludes, then on the contrary it concludes farre more strongly, that therefore in some cases it may be published, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing can make a thing more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, then if it be made a cover for grand impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so as to engage a true subject, quietly &amp; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to see his Prince murdred.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If it be discouragement to the practise of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that some sinnes revealed in it must be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished though with perill to the delinquents same &amp; life, then it will be a farre greater discouragement to the sinne, when that it shall by an universall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be so detested, that its concealement may not be permitted, though it be with the hazard of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Holy duty of confession: and when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18762:41"/>
the being guilty of such a sinne, shall reduce men into such streights, that either they shall want the benefit of absolution, or submit themselves to a publike sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and so even in this particular the benefit is farre greater then the imaginary inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The conveniences of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Of the first. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the seale of confession as sacredly as reason or religion it selfe can possibly permit, yet forbids not disclosure in case of Murder or Treason, but in these particulars leaves us intire in our obedience to<note place="margin">Can. 113. A. D. 1604.</note> the common lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and these command it.</p>
            <p>That the Church of England gives leave in some cases to reveale confessions, is argument enough to prove that the Seale is not founded upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18762:42"/>
of the present <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> For it is no more a begging of the Question (nor apparently so much) to say, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a part of the Catholike Church, and therefore her consent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a thing universall, then to say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the whole <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> therefore her consent is sufficient to make a thing Catholike. But I shall not need to proceed this way. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is apparent that of their own side <hi>Altisidio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensis</hi> largely and professedly proves the lawfulnesse of publication in some cases as is to be seen. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Summae tract.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 7. and <hi>Garnet</hi> himselfe, the man who if any had most need to stand in defence of the <hi>Seale</hi> that the pretence of it might have defended him, yet confessed of his own accord, <hi>Leges quae ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare</hi>

If two, nay if one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, it is enough to destroy a consent. But see far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>There are many cases, generally confessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, in which the seale of formall and (as they love to speak) <hi>Sacramentall</hi> confession may be broken open. I instance but in two or three.</p>
            <p>First, confession may be reveal'd to clear a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case of marriage. It is the opinion of many great<note place="margin">Practic. crim. Ecclesiast. cap. 109.</note> 
               <hi>Canonists,</hi> as you may see them quoted by <hi>Suarez de

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and the case of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
               <note place="margin">Resol. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimon.</note> who married a Virgin that was both his sister and daughter: and that at <hi>Rome</hi> under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third almost to like purpose, were long disputed on both sides, whether they were to be revealed or not, so that at most, it is but a doubtfull matter in such cases, whether the tye of secrecy doth oblige. Now if for the proofe of marriage the seale may be broken up, that man and wife might live contentedly and as they ought, strange it should be unlawfull to reveale confessions in case of Treason, for the safety of a Prince or State!</p>
            <p n="2">2 In case of herely the seale binds not, by their own generall confession. It is a rule amongst them, <q>Haeresis est crimen quod non confessio celat.</q> Now I would fain learn why Treason is not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeable as Heresy? Is heresy dangerous to soules? Then surely, so is Treason, unlesse it be none, or a very small crime. May heresy infect others? So may Treason, as it did in the present. It may then as well be revealed as heresy. Now that it may something rather, I have these reasons. 1. Because it is not so certaine that such an opinion is heresy as that such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is Treason. 2. Because although both Treason and reall heresy be damnable and dangerous to soules, yet heresy killes no Kings as treason doth. I confesse that heresy may, and doth teach it, but then it degenerates into Treason. Now if some he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy may be Treason, then that Treason is heresy, &amp; so a case of Treason may occurre, in which from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18762:43"/>
their own confession, treason is revealeable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By the most generall voice of their own side any man may licence his confessor to reveale his confession. It is the doctrine of <hi>Scotus, Durandus, Almain, Navarre, Medina,</hi> and generally of all the <hi>Thomists.</hi> I inferre, if a private man may licence his <hi>Consessor</hi> to reveale his consession, then the seale of confession is not founded upon any divine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, for if it were, the penitent could not give the Priest license to break it. But if the penitent may give his <hi>Confessor</hi> leave, because the tye of secrecy is a bond in which the Priest stands bound to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; he giving him leave, remits of his own right, then much rather may a whole State authorise this publication, for what ever personall right a private<note place="margin">L. quod Maior ff. ad Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalem.</note> man hath, that the whole State hath much rather, for he is included in it as a part of the whole, and in such cases as concerne the whole commonwealth (as this of treason doth most especially) the rule of the Law holds without exception, <hi>Refertur ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I adde, that in the case of Treason this is much rather true, for here the delinquent looseth all his right whatsoever, praediall, personall, and of priviledge, &amp; therefore the Commonwealth can the better license the publication, and the breach of the bond of secrecy, in which the <hi>Confessor</hi> stood tyed to the penitent by vertue of implicit stipulation.</p>

then a whole assembly. Thus it was in the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> both Law and Custome. But now if we look into the <hi>Latine Church</hi> wee shall find that it was taken up from example of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and some while practis'd, that some particular sinnes should be published in the Church before the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Cap. 10. &amp; 21.</note> as it is confessed in the Councell of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and inserted by <hi>Burchard</hi> into his <hi>Decree.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I say no more, the Doctrine and practise of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is sufficiently evident, and that there is nothing lesse then an <hi>Vniversall tradition</hi> for the seale of confession to be observed in all cases, even of sins of the highest malignity.</p>
            <p>Thus these Fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> are made totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable by concealing a Treason which was not revealed to them in a formall confession, and had been likewise culpable though it had, there being as I have showne, no such sacrednesse of the <hi>Seale</hi> as to be inviolable in all cases whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the severall considerations of the persons to whom the Question was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they were the Fathers <hi>Confessors</hi> in the day, but it was Christ the Lord in my text. The Question it selfe followes.</p>

               <q>Shall we command fire to come from heaven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Question was concerning the fate of a whole Towne of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in our case it was more; of the Fate of a whole Kingdome. It had been well if such a Question had been silenc'd by a direct negative or (as the Iudges of the Areopage used to doe) put off <hi>ad diem longissimum,</hi> that they might have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the answer three ages after.</p>

               </gap>King and Kingdome should have &amp; been made a solemn sacrifice to appease their solemn deliberate malice. I said deliberate, for they were loth to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious without good advice, and therefore they askt their question, worthy of an Oracle, even no lesse then <hi>Delphick,</hi> where an evill spirit was the <hi>Numen,</hi> and a Witch the Prophet. For the Question was such of which a Christian could not doubt though he had been fearefully scrupulous in his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For whoever question'd the unlawfulnesse of murder, of murdering innocents, of murdering them who were confessed righteous? for such was their proposall, being rather willing that <hi>Catholiks</hi> should perish with those whom they thought, hereticks, then that their should be no blood spilt. But to the question: it was fire they called for. The most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of all the Elements. No possibility of relenting when once kindled and had its object. It was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test instrument for mercilesse men, men of no bowels whose malice like their instrument did <hi>agere ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum suarnm virium,</hi> worke to the highest of its possibility. Secondly, It was fire indeed they called for, but not like that in my text, not fire from heaven, They might have called as long and as loud as those Priests did, who contested with <hi>Elisha,</hi> no fire would have come from heaven to have consum'd what they had intended for a sacrifice.

            <p>Lastly, it was a fire so strange, that it had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Apostles indeed pleaded a mistaken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for the reasonablenesse of their demand, they desir'd leave to doe but <hi>even as Elias did.</hi> [The <hi>Greekes</hi> only retaine this clause, it is not in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the church of <hi>Rome</hi>] and really these <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no-barbari</hi> could never pretend to any precedent for an act so barbarous as theirs. <hi>Adrimelech</hi> indeed kil'd a King, but he spar'd the people, <hi>Haman</hi> would have killed the people, but spared the King, but that both King and people, Princes and Iudges, branch, and rush and root should dye at once (as if <hi>Caligula's</hi> were actuated and all England upon one head) was never known till now, that all the malice in the world met in this as in a center.
