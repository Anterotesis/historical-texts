         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Honourable
THE
COUNTESS
OF
KINNOVL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was the pressing Desire of
Your Pious Heart, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
me with a Will to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
your Christian Enquiry
what true Devotion was, and to
write this Piece. A laudable Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to dress up Your Soul in
<pb facs="tcp:35990:3"/>
such a manner, as it might look
Beautifully in the Eye of Heaven,
made You strain towards th' At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of It; but Your acute
Understanding did not so easily
find out its certain <hi>Idea,</hi> nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
clearly what was it's proper
Nature. You were too Wise, to
think it consisted in Light Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries;
and those Affections which
were built up from Solid Truths,
were apt to seem too Learned,
and too Rigid for that flexible and
Soul-melting Disposition. Manly
Thoughts appear'd too Stiff, Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
ones too Weak to compound
it; and it bred in Your Ladyship
no small Difficulty, to hit the
Golden Mean between flying Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb facs="tcp:35990:3"/>
and low Dulness. Nay,
You scarce knew Her when she
was high in Your Self; and were
loath, out of a Humble Errour,
to think the prompt Flights of
Your Spirit could consist with the
Heaviness or Distractedness of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>Your Ladyship might have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
Her nearer hand, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exprest than I can do it here,
in the Exemplary Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of the Earl of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi>
Your every-way most Worthy
Husband. What Virtue was there
which, when occasion presented,
he did not readily Execute? What
Duty, either to God or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb facs="tcp:35990:4"/>
which through the whole
Course of his Life he was known
to neglect? His Piety was stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and fervent; his Deportment
Noble and Affable; his calm Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
fixt by Christian Principles,
was never shaken or mov'd from
it's just Level, by the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds
of Passion, which toss the
Generality, and shipwrack such
vast Multitudes. His Disregard
of the World was Admirable; or
rather, (to speak more properly
for one of his Rank) his <hi>just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
of it; esteeming it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himself as if he esteem'd
it, to be what truly it is, a Stage
so to act our respective Parts on,
as to please the Great King of
<pb facs="tcp:35990:4"/>
Heaven, and his Glorious Court,
our Spectators. None of it's gay
Follies affected him; no Bribe,
either of Honour, Profit, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
had ever the Power to warp
him. Nor had Dulness the least
share in this unmoved Temper of
his Mind: His Wit was piercing,
and wanted nothing but the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Part of it, which shoots
Bolts at Rovers. Nor was his
Judgment less solid: though he
had not the Vanity to blaze either,
or discover them without precise
Necessity; and, I can speak by
Experience, not very many, even
of those who make a Profession
of Knowledge, understood better
either the Grounds of our Faith,
<pb facs="tcp:35990:5"/>
or the Reasons why we ought to
be Virtuous; I mean, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the Means has to the End,
Grace to Glory, or a well-led Life
here, to the Attainment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Bliss hereafter. No wonder
then, he clos'd so Pious a Race
with so Happy an End, and look't
upon Death as the Treshold to
Heaven. May we not say, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
That the Remembrance of
his Life and Death, as from some
Luminary plac't in a Higher
Sphere, sends down their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon Your Self; prompting
You powerfully with like Steps,
to follow such a Leader. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
considers the strictest severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Your Widdow-state, the
<pb facs="tcp:35990:5"/>
total Application of Your Mind
to Devotion, and Your earnest
straining towards Heaven with
all the Powers of Your Soul, will
discern You proceed as if You
made account the Better Half of
Your Self were there already.
But, I must remember Madam,
You are yet alive, and, in that
Circumstance, just Praises are liable
to be esteem'd Flattery. The rest I
ow'd to the Memory of Your dear
Lord; and to my own Duty, not
to let so great an Example of
exactest Virtue, in a Person of so
high a Rank, especially clouded
by his own sober Modesty, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Humility, be lost to us for want
of proposing it to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35990:6"/>
To return then to my Matter:
Your Ladyship might, I say, have
found a Living Character of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
nearer hand, and have
sav'd me all this Labour; and
you already saw all was Virtuous,
all was Saintly throughout the
whole Course of his Life. But
it was the exact Knowledge of
what <hi>Devotion</hi> was, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish't
from the Common Natures
of Virtue and Goodness, which
You aim'd at: For, You had
observ'd, that many were held
<hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Persons, who
were not esteem'd <hi>Devout;</hi> and
that this Word <hi>Devotion</hi> had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it's Notion particularly
Excellent, not found in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="tcp:35990:6"/>
This Excellency Your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship
aspir'd to; and therefore,
You wisely desir'd in the first
place, to gain a clear Discernment
of what it was, and in what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
as singled from other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Considerations, belonging
to Goodness, which often run mixt
with it.</p>
            <p>Hence, I became oblig'd both
to decypher <hi>Devotion,</hi> and dissect
Her; and not only so to delineate
Her Nature that it might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
known, but, by dividing
her into her several kinds, and
treating at large of her Chief
Act, <hi>Prayer,</hi> to acquaint You
more perfectly with her Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
<pb facs="tcp:35990:7"/>
In a word, You have here
at once my Obedience, and Your
own Duty; and that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
Your Soul towards it's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in Knowing Virtue,
shall be the daily Prayer of,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
               <signed>Your Ladyship's most Devoted,

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THough this Treatise bears the
Title <hi>(Of Devotion),</hi> yet I
hope, it will not be expected,
it should be either made up of <hi>Set-Forms</hi>
of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or be as <hi>easy</hi> as
<hi>Prayers</hi> use and ought to be: I have
already declar'd, that the Intention
of writing it, was to <hi>settle</hi> exactly
the <hi>Nature</hi> and Notion of <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
which kind of Discourses, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for their Subject the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of the Matter they treat of,
cannot possibly ly so open to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
View, as those that concern the
Superstructures, built upon them.
Yet, I hope, there will be little found
<pb facs="tcp:35990:8"/>
here, which may not be easily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Intelligible to any attentive
<hi>Reader,</hi> who will think those Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which advance his Soul, worth
the pains of a serious Endeavour to
purchase them: I am sure, none of
it is disproportion'd to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that <hi>Noble Personage,</hi>
for whom, as a private Paper, I first
writ it: If all <hi>Readers</hi> be not such,
I heartily wish they were; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as well as I can, they should
be so, by yeilding to the Sollicitation
of Friends, to expose this Treatise to be
Printed. No small Kindness from
me, considering the Common Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
that a Resolution is already
taken and fixt by some, to find fault
with all I have writ, or shall write:
I beseech God, to send them more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and me Patience!</p>
            <p>It may be ask't, Why such high Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
should be writ in <hi>English?</hi> I
answer, Because very many who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not <hi>Latin,</hi> may be capable
<pb facs="tcp:35990:8"/>
of comprehending good Sense, and
concern'd, too, to receive thorow-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in such Subjects. Nor do
I think any thing here unintelligible
by the Generality, were there the
same Application of mind us'd to
improve Spirituality, as is employ'd in
acquiring Temporal Things. I could
also avail my self, of the Example of
a Neighbouring Nation, which puts
even those Authors that treat deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Points (Fathers amongst the rest)
into the common Language of the
Country.</p>
            <p>As for the Manner I observe in
handling my Matter, I guide my self
much by the Experience I have of
what is needful for the Tempers of
divers Spirits: I observe some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Scrupulous they are not
Devout; and yet, they not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,</hi>
but strain with all their Powers
to be so. Lest such well-meaning
Souls, conscious to themselves they
do their utmost; and yet, fearing
<pb facs="tcp:35990:9"/>
they fall short of the Duty they aim
at, should (as there is danger) lose
their Hope; I endeavour to up-hold
it, by showing them, that an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
firmly bent to God's Service,
cannot fail of rendering them truly
Devout. Others, conceit they want
Knowledge requisit to attain it;
wherefore, to humble the Pride of
Humane Wit, and comfort their
honest Simplicity, I show how their
frequent Application to pious Duties,
joyn'd with a sincere Well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
goes beyond all the high Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the acutest Understandings,
if the Will be never so little less
Perfect. Others, are to seek in the
Means to attain Devotion; which,
therefore, I propose sutably to every
ones respective Pitch. Lastly, I
have observed many either neglecting
totally, or less using Prayer; and
that too, but faintly, out of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
grounded on an Ill-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
Humility, that they deserve
<pb facs="tcp:35990:9"/>
not to be heard; and so, all they
do in that kind, is in vain; as
was once S. <hi>Teresa</hi>'s Case, which she
afterwards so feelingly bewail'd in
her self, and of which she so Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
fore-warn'd others. Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
therefore, I strive to encourage,
by laying open the Excellency and
Utility of Prayer; and how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
Prayer for our true Good,
<hi>Virtue,</hi> is the immediate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to attain it; and so, is the
very thing that renders us worthy
to be heard. At once letting them
see, that no Address to our infinitly
bountiful Lord, can be put up in
vain: and also, thence exhorting
them to that Devout Importunity
and struggling with Heaven, so much
recommended by our Saviour; which
by the constant and ordinary Course
of Supernatural Causes, lay'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
cannot fail of obtaining the
Blessing pray'd for. And is so far
from injuring Faith, or abating its
<pb facs="tcp:35990:10"/>
Efficacy, that it exceedingly comforts
and strengthens it, by letting us see how
certainly God, unchang'd in Himself,
performs his Promises to those who use
the Means he has laid, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be us'd, to Effect those happy
Changes in Us.</p>
            <p>Hence, 'tis very easy to remark,
that in this Treatise, I meddle not
with the Efficaciousness of Prayer for
others, nor with other stranger Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it, (nay, somtimes, even mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Ones) which, by means of a
firm Faith, and Relyance on God, are
brought to pass. Nor, lastly, do I
Treat of <hi>Prayer</hi> (or <hi>Devotion</hi>) as
they depend on God'<hi>s</hi> Grace, or the
secret Workings of the Holy-Ghost,
(as I hint also in the <hi>Treatise</hi> it
self, <hi>p. 60.</hi>); which I from my
Heart acknowledge to give us A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to begin, continue, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
both Prayer, and every good Act
that is Supernatural: Though an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd
Adversary of mine, will needs
<pb facs="tcp:35990:10"/>
throw that Scandal upon me, to deny
it. What I concern my self with, is
that part of our Christian Actions,
or that Co-operation of ours with
God's Grace, that stands under our
Endeavours, which I strive through
the Whole, to encourage; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in discoursing of Prayer, I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
only with those Effects of it,
which are the ordinary and necessary
Consequents of a fervent and constant
Address to God for our Soul's true
Good, <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, There are many and
various Tempers of Spirits in Gods
Church; amongst which, my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
as well as Reason tells me,
there are not a few so Naturally
Speculative, and given to look into
the Reasons and Grounds of Things,
that they find most comfort, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in these Discourses that
go to the Bottom, and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Them from their Principles.
To such Persons as those, I hope, I
<pb facs="tcp:35990:11"/>
may, when call'd upon, write, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to their Genius and Pitch; not
blaming, but heartily applauding those
pious Men, who accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to others. For, as it is a
great Weakness to imagin or expect
that <hi>every</hi> manner of handling a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
will sute with <hi>every</hi> Capacity;
so, it is no less to conceit, that <hi>any</hi>
kind of Discoursing, so it be True,
and agree with Christian Principles,
can be such as sutes with <hi>None.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Nature of Devotion
in Common.</head>
               <p>DEvotion is a word trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
from the Latin,
and derived from the
primitive <hi>Vovere,</hi> to Vow. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
among the Heathens, a steady
and fixt Resolution, or rather Ty,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35990:12"/>
obligatory, but yet voluntary; and
that of unusual strength; such as
carried them to the most difficult
actions. It keeps the same notion
among Christians, the Object only
or Motive of the resolution changed.
For, whereas false Glory was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
the most dazling, and most
prized end of the actions of the
Heathens, and nothing was thought
more glorious than to dy for their
Country; they were said Devoted
who voluntarily, in circumstances
particularly remarkable, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for its sake, upon a certain
death. So <hi>Codrus</hi> among the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
<hi>Curtius</hi> and the <hi>Decij</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Romans, are remembred
for Devoted to the service of their
several Countries; perhaps their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
having been confirm'd by
some solemn Vow to their Idols.
But, since we came to be Instructed
in the notion, and inclin'd to the
pursuit of true Glory and true
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35990:12"/>
Good, Devotion has got another
Object: and, keeping the same
Steadiness, and Promptness and
Strength in its notion as heretofore,
is apply'd only to the Service of
God. It signifies, then, a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or addiction to the Service of
God; but strong and prompt:
such as sets all the Powers of man
efficaciously a work in all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that occur. It is not confin'd to
any one kind: For, we say, a man
gives Almes, Fasts, visits the Sick
or Afflicted, goes on Pilgrimage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
out of Devotion; that is, exercises
Devotion in all these Actions. But
Prayer being the most ordinary and
most frequent Act, by which men
use to serve God, Devotion is most
ordinarily understood of Prayer:
and when we hear of a Devout
man, we generally apprehend a
man who prayes <hi>frequently,</hi> and
<hi>well.</hi> For, these two qualities enter
too into the Notion of Devotion;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35990:13"/>
we not thinking him devout who
prays but seldome, or carelesly.</p>
               <p>§. 2. By what has been said,
the Nature of Devotion may be
understood; and we may perceive
it is a Quality, or Disposition in
Man, strong and always efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
which moves all his powers
to act in the service of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according
to their several natures,
both with frequency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Hence may be gather'd,
First, that Devotion is a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Will. For, since no
Power acts but as 'tis apply'd, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
whose Nature 'tis to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
both the Understanding and all
other Powers to Christian Action,
must needs belong properly to
that Power which in man is the
Principle of Action, that is to the
Will.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Secondly, that this state
of Devotion, being a constant bent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35990:13"/>
and readiness to perform the best
actions on the best manner, is by
consequence the <hi>best State</hi> the Will
can possibly have in this World; and
next to the necessary and continual
Conformity to the Divine Will,
which the Blessed have in Heaven.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Thirdly, that this Prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to put both the Understanding
in act as to Prayer, and the other
Powers as to Acts of Virtue, as it
is a Disposition of the will, so it
is to be lookt for in the Will <hi>alone;</hi>
and not in the Acts either of the
Understanding it self (much less of
the Fancy) or of any other of those
Powers which Devotion is to set a
work. Whence follows cleerly that,
though there happen never so much
difficulty to elevate the mind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
or rather sensibly, to God;
never so many Impediments, nay
even Incapacity to act feelingly,
or tenderly; yet, as long as the
Will on her part preserves her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35990:14"/>
self prompt to do all these, and can
truly say with King David, <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
cor meum Deus, paratum cor
meum, My Heart is ready, O my God,
my heart is ready,</hi> there happens no
loss, nor so much as Diminution,
of interiour solid Devotion. The
Fancy (without whose co-operation
the understanding in this state can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act) may be restiff and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
the inferiour Faculties lame
and clogg'd, whether through Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
or ill Circumstances: But,
a pious Soul ought not in the least
be discouraged at these Accidents;
(to which, in the dependence the
Soul has now upon the Body, we
were not Men if we were not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;)
nor think her self a jot worse:
For, Devotion (as was said) is only
in the Will; and the Will is not
at all the worse dispos'd, because
the Faculties, with which she would
work, are indispos'd, and cannot
obey her; no more than the Hand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35990:14"/>
is lame, because the Pen is bad, and
will not write.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Fourthly, That a Soul,
which has a ready Will to pray, can
never fail (though the Fancy be
never so dull, or out of order) to
please God by praying, or (which
is all one) to have the Merit of
Prayer. For, all Merit, or Actions
that please God, proceed properly
from the Will; whence a devout,
that is, a hearty and ready <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is the best Act of the
Will, must needs be, in a high
and special manner, <hi>Meritorious</hi> or
Rewardable. Nay more, a devout
Soul, intending and endeavouring
to pray, and standing bent that
way; that is, keeping that Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unalter'd, and prosecuting her
Endeavours as well as she can,
actually is in prayer, or truly prays
interiorly; though, for want of the
Complyance of the Fancy, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Part of the Soul, (which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35990:15"/>
in Acts of Prayer is sensible) she
does not experience it even while
she has it; but, rather suspects the
contrary; unless reflex Thoughts,
and rais'd above matter, preserves
her from being mistaken. Yet,
the thing is clear, both by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and (when by reflexion we
observe what passes) Experience
too. For, Prayer is nothing but an
Elevation or Application of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to God; and, there can
need no more to apply the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
interiorly to Objects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
within her, but the Will to
do so. Now supposing, as the case
does, the Will applying as far as
she can the Understanding, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
the Understanding must be
apply'd interiorly; that is, Prayer
is actually exercis'd. Again, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
outward Objects striking the
Senses, or inward Fancies irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
stirr'd up and fluttering in a
perpetual motion, cause in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35990:15"/>
continual Distractions; yet,
we may observe the Soul, when by
reflexion it comes to perceive them,
rejects those Distractions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applies
it self (after that seeming
dull manner, which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
un-assisted with service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fancies, can practise) to what
it was employ'd about before.
Nay, there would be no such
thing as <hi>Distraction</hi> in Prayer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for those Words to signifie,
in case the Understanding had not
been acting about some other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
before, and attending to it:
The being diverted from which,
and attending to a new Object we
call <hi>Distraction:</hi> and this former
Object can be nothing, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Prayer, <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. A parallel instance to this
case is that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking
of praying in an unknown Tongue.
<hi>Nam si orem linguâ, spiritus meus
orat, mens autem mea sine fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35990:16"/>
For, if I pray with my Tongue,
my Spirit prayeth, but my Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is without Fruit;</hi> that is, he
reaps not the Benefit of stirring up
the Mind by new Motives or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which those Prayers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
and perfectly understood
and penetrated, were apt to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest:
Yet still his <hi>Spirit,</hi> or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Part of the Soul, is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and confusedly elevated to
God, still <hi>Spiritus or at,</hi> the Spirit
truly prayes. So, in our case, in
this dull state of praying, when the
Fancy playes not, nor co-operates
as is fit, the Understanding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
not in gaining those sights,
which by Extension of former
Knowledges into new Conclusions,
through attentive discoursing of its
Object, it might have attain'd: But
still the superior part of the Soul,
is by the Will fixt to something,
which is not Temporal: (all such
Thoughts suggested by the dis-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35990:16"/>
of the Fancy, being held Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions).
She is then truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to her Eternal Good, and
truly praying all the while; till,
Intention altering all, she frankly
and unconcernedly, relinquishes the
Circumstances proper for Prayer,
and applyes her self to new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
without scruple or strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any longer to keep out the
Thoughts of them; which before
she avoyded or repin'd at as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions;
but, now admits and
pursues voluntarily, as her Business,
Duty, or End.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Sloth.</head>
               <p>§. 1. I Hope the Nature of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
in common may
sufficiently be understood, by what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35990:17"/>
has been already said: But yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Contraries help exceedingly
to illustrate one another, I will
make some short Reflexions upon
its opposit, <hi>Sloth.</hi> This Vice is a
certain lumpishness, and unweildi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Soul, through which
she yeilds her self to be sway'd
down-wards by the weight of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Sin, inclining her to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Objects; and so rendering her
un-active and unable, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
to apply and raise her self
to such Thoughts and Actions, as
dispose her for Heaven. I say, <hi>In
the Soul:</hi> for in her alone, <hi>Vertue</hi>
and <hi>Vice,</hi> properly taken, and as they
import Merit and Demerit, are
lodged: The indisposition and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of the Fancy, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Powers, belong to the Body;
and are not <hi>Vice,</hi> though they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and incline to it; and, if care
be not taken, will cause it. Again,
by these Words [<hi>In the Soul</hi>] I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35990:17"/>
mean, in that Power which we call
<hi>Will,</hi> or in the Soul, as she is <hi>Will.</hi>
For, Philosophy, (which indeed is
nothing but true deliberate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
Reason) teaches, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
belong still to the same
Subject; and therefore, <hi>Devotion</hi>
being an Affection of the Will, <hi>Sloth</hi>
must needs be so too. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
'tis evident that all Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Vices are defects of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding-Power,
that is, Error
or Ignorance; as, on the contrary,
all its Perfections are Knowledges
of Truths. But, there is no kind of
shew, that <hi>Sloth</hi> should formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Devotion</hi>
in <hi>Knowledge;</hi> since they who have
much Knowledge, may withall be
very Slothful; and those who have
very little, may be very Devout,
very ready, and very constant in
the performance of all Christian
Duties to their Power.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Hence follows, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35990:18"/>
of the former Doctrine,
that, as long as the Intention to pray
persevers sincere, there can be no
sin of Sloth, nor ground of scruple
of not having pray'd as one ought:
For, so long the Will is not faulty,
and so there is no moral defect nor
sin at all in a Prayer no better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
but all the imperfection
in it springs either from Nature, or
circumstances indisposing the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
or perhaps, from want of skill
or information in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
- Power, how to go about one's
Prayer; which is so far a fault as
there is negligence in the will to
use due means to attain so requisit
a Knowledg. Wherfore in case any
one doubts, whether he have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
himself negligently, careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or distractedly in his prayer, he
must consider well whether he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
that carelesness, or those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions:
For, if he did not, 'tis
evident it happen'd besides his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35990:18"/>
and so was no moral fault.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But yet this word <hi>Intention</hi>
is equivoral, and may be mistaken.
There are who think they do great
matters, if, for Example, they
make, as they call it, an Intention
in the morning, of spending the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
day in vertue and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; when perhaps they
never think of God or vertue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This is but deceipt: and
'twould be no better, to use the
formality of making an act, fancy'd
to be an Intention of praying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Prayer; and then spend the
time of Prayer in a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checkt
entertainment of distractive
suggestions.</p>
               <p>§. 4. To understand the business,
we must remember that every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has a Finall, as well as an Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or Material and Formal cause;
and that a man can no more act
without a <hi>Why</hi> then a <hi>What.</hi> This
End, when we know what we do,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35990:19"/>
is foreseen, and the Actor means
or <hi>intends</hi> it: So that the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is woven into the Action, and
a kind of part of it: as, if I go
down, or up stairs, I intend to be
at the bottom, or top; nor can it
happen otherwise, if the action be
rational, and accompany'd with
Knowledg. And, if any action be
done otherwise, (as, when people
walk, or do other things in their
Sleep or with a perfect Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence)
it is not counted a <hi>Human
Action.</hi> In this sence, as no Action
can be without an Intention, no
more then without an End, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Intention be without
the Action. For 'tis, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
a kind of part of it; and
we should laugh at him who would
perswade us he had an Actual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of being at the bottom of
the stairs, yet voluntarily stay'd
at the top. But, as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
sees things to come, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35990:19"/>
well as past and present; it may
see what is like to follow from an
Action before the Action it self,
and from that sight resolve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it: and may resolve for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as well as present time, and
so intend before she acts. And,
in this sence, Intention may be both
before and without Action, which,
before it come to be executed, the
Intention may possibly change. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is taken in this notion, by
those who amuse themselves with
making artificial Intentions before
hand. For plainly, they intend for
the future; and, when the time
comes, do nothing often-times of
what they intended, and remain
deluded. Now I understand Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the former sence; that is
for such an Intention as accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Action, and needs no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
endeavours on our part to make
it: Since nature will joyn it to the
Action, though we should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35990:20"/>
never so much the contrary:
For, it is altogether as idle to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
he, who knows what he does, can
have a not-Intention to go down
Stairs, who actually goes down,
as that he has one, (I mean, for
the present) who stays above.
Wherfore, since this kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
cannot be sever'd from the
Action, 'tis cleer that who thus
intends to pray, truly prays, though
never so many distractive thoughts
interrupt and confound his Action.
Neither are they, unless he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
admit and mean to think of
such things, properly Actions of
his, but rather Passions or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
For, as the Eye cannot chuse
but see what is represented to it,
nor hinder it self from transmitting
to the soul what it sees, nor the soul
from perceiving what is transmitted:
so neither can the soul hinder her
self from receiving the impressions
made by the inward stroaks of flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35990:20"/>
Fancies, nor those impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from having their Effect, but
is in both cases more <hi>passive</hi> than
<hi>active;</hi> and doth not so much <hi>do</hi>
any thing, as hath somthing <hi>done</hi>
upon her.</p>

               <head type="sub">Remedies against Sloth.</head>
               <p>§. 1. TO return to the matter in
hand, All that can be said
of this dryness, and disgustfulness in
Prayer, caused by the not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the inferior part of the Soul
with the superior, is this, that 'tis a
Disposition, and indeed Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to the sin of <hi>Sloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. By that Tediousness, It first
tires, then discourages, and after
frights us; till at last it gains so much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35990:21"/>
upon us, as to make us yeild our
selves over to a neglect, sometimes
omission, of customary, decent, or
ohligatory Prayers: and the same
may be said in some proportion, of
our yeilding to those Difficulties
which oppose our exercising other
devout Acts. Here then it is that
a devout Christian soul must faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
fight Gods Battel; and never
consent, for want of gust, or for
feeling disgust, to omit her Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>§. 3. One of the best weapons she
has to defend her self is (upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of what has been, and,
more, what will be said) to settle a
firm judgment, that this state of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
is no ways faulty. This judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be made, not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
of Prayer (for then 'tis to be
put in practise and the Prayer exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by it, and so is needful to be had
already, not then to be gotten);
but at some fit season before hand
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35990:21"/>
when the Fancies are most calm'
and the soul can act with most cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and force. And, when 'tis once
made, let the soul be sure to act
steadily according to it and pray
on, how strongly soever Disgust, or
Dryness, or whatever Engin the
Devil chuses to imploy, may tempt
her to the contrary. A little Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
will compass this, assisted with
the Reflexion how unreasonable it
is to alter a course directed by our
best and clearest Reason, for the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of disorderd fancies. But
if once those temptations can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a soul into these erroneous
conceits, first, that all her Prayer
is <hi>fruitless,</hi> and then <hi>harmful,</hi> as being
in her apprehension a kind of <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fault,</hi> and such as she cannot
mend (for she finds by experience
she can do no better with all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
she can use); she is in danger
to leave it quite off, and think it
better not to pray at all, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35990:22"/>
to do ill. And this I take to
be one of the most dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World: both because it
comes mask't in the Vizard of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and so is apt to take with well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
Souls, which are not aware
of it: as also, because Devotion
being the best disposition of the soul
to practise all Christian Duties, and
particularly Prayer, which includes
in it self the exercise of Faith, Hope,
and Charity; it follows, that a soul
which thus abandons her self to Sloth
must needs languish away into a
spiritual Consumption, and piningly
decay in those Christian Virtues,
which give life to all the rest, and
without which the outward practise
of others are but false appearances,
springing from material habits, and
as it were the Ghosts of true Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Another Weapon, of great
use in this kind of Fight, is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
That we may be certain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35990:22"/>
we merit in the sight of God or serve
and please him by continuing our
Prayer when we are seized with this
Dryness and Dulness, and assaulted
with Distractions; whereas we
cannot be so certain of this when
our Prayer is accompany'd with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and delight. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
taken in sensible feeling is so
inbred and, in a manner, essential
to a Soul, according to her Inferior
part, or as she is the Form of the
Body; and this natural propension
to all manner of delights so height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
in us by Original Corruption,
which still draws us from Spirituality
to Sense; that we are apt to adhere
and cling to whatever is thus agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and this even in prayer it self.
Whence it comes to pass, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nature so subtly seeks its own
satisfaction, 'tis very hard, when
this sensible pleasingness accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
our prayer, to discern whether
we are not serving our selves when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35990:23"/>
we should be serving God: at least
it often happens, in this case of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
delight, that our easiness and
promptness to apply our selves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to Acts of Prayer springs,
in part, from our love of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
which is a great alloy to
the spirituality of Devotion, and
to some degree taints the purity of
our intentions. Whence, all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Masters use to take great care,
that those souls who find sweetness
in their prayer, be not attacht to it,
lest they fall into spiritual Gluttony,
and depress the mind to sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by those very means which
should raise it above them.</p>
               <p>§. 5 Now all this danger is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
avoyded when our Prayers
are disgustful: For, however they
seem to us sapless and dry, yet we
are sure the desire of pleasing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
part, or complying with our
corrupt inclinations, has not any the
least share in what we do; but that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35990:23"/>
the Prayer and Intention (which, as
was said, necessarily goes along with
it in the superiour part which only is
Spiritual,) remains altogether pure
and untainted. Let then the Soul,
which finds litle gust in Prayer,
continue in the posture and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of praying, especially if
the prayer be Obligatory; and in
the material exercise of it, at least
vocally, if she can do no more.
Two comforts will ensue hence;
one, that the merit of such prayer is
secure; every Act of bearing up
against this dryness, and the sloth
to which it tempts, being manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an adhesion or clinging to God
with the superior part of the Soul.
The other is, that the gain made
by such continuance, though it
seem <hi>small,</hi> comes in <hi>clear;</hi> there
being nothing to be defalkt from its
purity by the mixture of any motive
sprung from <hi>matter</hi> or Body; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
generally in good actions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35990:24"/>
by the middle sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
there goes so much out to the
inferior part, that is, to Fancy and
Appetite, that when the Chaff comes
to be winnowed from the pure Corn,
there remains not so many grains of
<hi>Spirit</hi> as some apprehend. 'Tis
very well if they escape with the
Abatement of half. And, after all,
the harvest of the former sort does
but only <hi>seem</hi> small, for in truth
'tis otherwise: since of necessity
the Habit of adhering to God, must
be got by a frequent repetition of
Acts; so that the soul, which faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
continues to struggle against
the difficulties of Prayer, cannot
fail at last to come to a facility of it;
so much the more to be valued and
endeavour'd, by how much it is free
from all suspicion of alloy from the
inferior part; being manifestly
wrought out by the strength and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of the Superior.</p>
               <p>§. 6. There is yet another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35990:24"/>
in this constancy and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is, that the not deserting
our devotions for want of sensible
content, but going steadily on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we feel, is an evident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or argument to the soul that
she is as she ought to be. For, since
she cannot act this to please <hi>Nature,</hi>
to whose grain it lies so cross, it must
of necessity proceed from a motive
<hi>above Nature,</hi> that is, a firm will
and hearty desire to please God.
The knowledg of which must needs
increase <hi>Hope;</hi> and, if it be well
laid to heart, will, in despite of the
Dryness, and the Scruples apt to
ensue upon it, produce that fruit of
the Holy Ghost, which is called <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Ioy,</hi> and such a solid <hi>Peace</hi>
of mind as the World cannot
give.</p>
               <p>§. 7. A Soul which needs more
helps in this kind, may make use of
some Preparation to Prayer; such
as may be most efficacious to fix
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35990:25"/>
her attention, and keep her Fancy
from wandring, To which purpose
she may a litle reflect upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of it; and remember,
That Happiness or Misery, and
this for all Eternity, depends upon
the disposition which she carries with
her out of this life; and that dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
on Prayer, which is the means
to procure it: That so much time is
allotted to every one to work out
his Salvation, as every one lives, and
no more; And that this time mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
can never be recalled: That
the rest of our life is only to fit us
to pray well; and, if the time of
Prayer be fruitless, our whole life
is fruitless and irrecoverably Lost:
That we cannot be disposed for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without Time, and the time of
Prayer is that wherein alone it can
be expected this disposition should
be wrought; wherefore, if this
time be lost, at what other time
can we hope to do that, which if it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35990:25"/>
be not done, we are miserable, and
yet cannot be done but at some time,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and the like reflexions,
such as we find most apt to work
upon us, may contribute much to the
well performance of Prayer.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Freedome of Spirit is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great help in this case; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractedness
for the most part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from worldly matters, which
our too great concern in them
is perpetually suggesting to our
thoughts. He that can contrive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into circumstances, which free
him from having any thing to do
with the World, more then to make
use of the means it affords him to
gain Heaven, is in the happiest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and likely to find least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in Prayer. He that cannot
free himself from business, let him
free himself from all unnecessary
concerns for it; and settle this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
firmly in his Soul, That reason
permits him not to be farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35990:26"/>
cern'd for worldly affairs, let their
importance be what it will, than as
they depend on him. That success
is out of his power, and depends
not on him but Providence, to
which he should contentedly resign
it, and must whether he be content
or no: That his part, and all the
share he has in any Action, is to use
his endeavours according to the best
of his skill. That when he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
the time which is necessary
for this, and imploy'd it as well as
he can, he has done all he has to
do or can do in these matters; and
ought to be concern'd no farther;
but is now at liberty to employ the
time allotted for Prayer in the Best
manner. Likewise, That there is no
business which takes up so much time
as not to leave sufficient for Prayer,
if negligence, more than business,
do not hinder, and the like. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, let him still remember that
whatever other business he have or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35990:26"/>
can have (and I do not except any;
not love to Parents, care of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the strongest and most rational
tyes to the nearest and most dearest
Relations; nay the pursuit of things
most necessary, even of Livelyhood,
of Cloths and Meat) is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in comparison of this: If
this succeed not he is undone, and
that Eternally, however he thrive
in others; And if this succeed, no
miscarriage in any or all the rest can
hinder him from being Eternally
Happy. He that lives gloriously,
and with full Satisfaction of all his
desires, is wretched, if he go at
last into Hell; and, after his short
dream of Happiness, wake into a
horrid and never ending real misery:
And he who lives despised and
scorn'd, and dyes starved with cold
or hunger, is happy if he go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and find his short and now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
suffrings swallowed up in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Bliss. So that, in truth, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35990:27"/>
amuse our selves with what happens
in this life, to the prejudice of what
is to come hereafter, is a folly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly
more senceless, then what we
can fancy most ridiculous.</p>
               <p>§. 9. This Freedom of Spirit is a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
so highly conducive to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it ought to be preserv'd even
in the immediate means to it, I mean
in our Prayers and reading devout
Books; in case they be not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
or that, after a deliberate
consideration, with the assistance
and advice of our Spiritual Director,
it appears not that we have already
made choice of the best, and see
that others are improper or less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial.
For there are many good
Souls so strangely fixt by a habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Custome of saying such and such
Prayers, that they fall into Scruples
if upon occasion they hap to omit
or change them; and yet let them
examin their own thoughts to the
bottom, they can discover no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35990:27"/>
or ground of such a Scruple, but
the aukwardness of breaking a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inur'd
Custom. And to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
it seems very advisable in my
judgment, that they omit them in
very good occasions or with good
advice change them; that so, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves thus from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
slavery of Custome and the
biggottery of irrational fears, they
may inure themselves still to follow
Right Reason in what they do, and
no other motives of which they can
give no account; which is indeed
to assert and preserve the just Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Spirit, due by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Grace, where no contrary
Duty or Obligation does restrain
it.</p>
               <p>§. 10. There are divers reasons why
we should not always use the same
Prayers, and run still in one track.
One is, because a perpetual custom
hinders our attention to the sense
and due penetration of the words,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35990:28"/>
in which chiefly consists the <hi>Fruit,</hi>
or spiritual <hi>advance</hi> by Prayer. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the irrational scruple (as was
said) of leaving off what meer
Custom has addicted one to, which
is a fault or imperfection, and so
ought to be amended. A third, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not to be expected, in this
state, that our Spirit should be always
in one humour or disposition; and
'tis best that every thing be wrought
upon according as it is dispos'd to
have the Effect produc't in it. A
fourth, and principal reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our Soul every day grows or
should grow in spirituality, at least
at every competent distance, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or stage of our Lifes Race, she
must needs, by the very practise of
a vertuous Christian Life, have
gain'd a considerable advance, though
perhaps she discern it not, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
while 'tis growing; and 'tis as
irrational to think the same thoughts
are apt to fit her in all states, as to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35990:28"/>
think that our Bodies ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be fed with Milk, because we
eat nothing else when we were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
I for my part know no one
Devotion suting all sorts, all states,
all times and every pitch, but that
which was made by the Wisdom of
the Eternal Father, who fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
them all; I mean the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. But, the best help of all,
is a good Director. For as, in the
Body, the same diseases proceed
somtimes from different causes, and
require different ways of cure; so
it is in the Mind too. It may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that the same indisposition,
which in some proceed from the
Impersection of Nature, may be
caused by the Perfection of Nature in
others. A Soul fitted for higher
Operations than these in which she
is imploy'd, and straining at them by
a natural propension, and yet not
reaching them for want of Instruction
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35990:29"/>
may fall into the same unsatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
condition, which happens to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Souls from other causes. A
good Director is as necessary in
such cases, as a good Doctor where
diseases spring from not usual and
not easily perceived causes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
our conduct is sure to be so
much the wiser, as he has more
Wisdom than our selves. In this
particular, there are but two things
to be observed: to chuse one who
is truly fit, and then to treat freely
with him. They are both of great
importance, but need not be farther
dilated.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:35990:29"/>
               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the two chief kinds
of Devotion.</head>
               <p>§. 1. BEcause Devotion is a stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
bent of the Will to
Spiritual Operations, and there be
two ways by which the Will may
come to this disposition, those two
different Methods make two sorts
or Kinds of Devotion. For the
Will may be wrought to this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
either by a Habit got, as other
Habits are, meerly by a frequent
Repetition of her own Acts; or
by the interposition of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
which, clearly seeing that
such or such things are to be done,
presses and prevails upon the Will
to be always ready to do them.
These ways are both efficacious,
but the later the more Natural and
less changeable. For, the will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35990:30"/>
to the designe of nature, is to be
led by the Understanding, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in some sence, cannot be led o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
there being some co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Understanding to that
first Act of the Will, the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which, afterwards, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Habit. For, unless the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had first been thought fit to be
done, it would not have been done
at all. But, if the Understanding
contributed but litle, 'tis more
chance and luck than Reason, that
the Action haps to be good: which
is not connatural, our nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a <hi>rational</hi> proceeding in
all things. Again, it is also less
lasting: for, as <hi>Use</hi> produces, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use</hi>
will lose it; and, should the
Understanding (as, not being first
settled it self, it well may,) come
to cross the operations of the Will
by contrary judgments or even
doubts, the Will would waver, and
act faintly first, and after perhaps
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35990:30"/>
not at all. But, a Will produced
by the Understanding, cleerly see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and conceiting practically what
is to be done; and out of that sight
moving, and indeed becoming the
Will to do it, cannot be changed
till the Understanding change.
And, if the Understanding be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
by Truth, and that Truth
clearly seen; the Understanding
cannot change, because Truth can
never turn into not-Truth: I say
clearly seen; For Passion dims or
blinds, and so comes in Sin.</p>
               <p>§. 2. We shall find that, in one
way, the Soul works upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
in the other, the Body works
upon the Soul. Where the Habit
is produced by repeated Acts, it is
caused in the Soul by the influence
of the Body; whose Spirits and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
being fitted by constant use,
and readily concurring to such
Actions, carry the soul along with
them. In the other way, the Action
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35990:31"/>
begins from the Soul; by whose
predominance over the Body those
Spirits and Organs are fitted, and
concur with readiness and ease to
her Directions, yet both arrive at
the same End a fitting disposition
both of Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Notwithstanding, since Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
must needs partake the nature
of their Causes, though true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be an effect of both ways, yet this
Effect cannot but have Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Operations, as different as
the Causes are which produce it.
The Devotion caus'd by Knowledg
is proper for more refined Souls,
such as are able to penetrate into,
and judg of the nature of things,
and guide their Actions by their
judgments: The other, for tempers
less rational, and who, not able to
go alone, require to be led: The
former can only be lost by a wilful
neglect of cultivating those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which caus'd it; and which are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35990:31"/>
not soon nor easily pluckt up, where
once they have taken deep root:
The other perishes, both sooner
and more easily, by bare dis-use
of the material actions by which
it was produc'd: And, indeed,
they who have only custom from
whence they can derive their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
generally run great hazard
of a total decay in virtue, upon any
considerable neglect of their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Exercises.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Yet in some respects, this
Material Way is less subject to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
distraction in Prayer,
than the other; because this way of
Prayer, being, in a manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and an Elevation of the Mind
to God in common, as it were,
without distinct application of the
soul to particular Motives, which
should advance her to new degrees
of fervency; it costs her, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
little labour, and obliges
her not, out of weariness, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35990:32"/>
to new Objects. Again, this
kind of Prayer, having little or no
height of Spirituality, but being
sutable to Fancy, finds in the
Brain Proper <hi>Species,</hi> agreeable to
the thoughts he has who Prays;
whereas the other, straining after
Objects purely spiritual, of which
we have no proper <hi>Species,</hi> has
by consequence less ground in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to fix the Attention.</p>
               <p>§. 5. In some respects too, the
Spiritual Way has the advantage in
this point of Distraction. For, the
distinct considerations to which the
soul applyes her self are apt, from
their being <hi>Distinct,</hi> to fix the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
because they afford her a
particular Entertainment to which
she may attend. As for Weariness,
when she finds that prevail and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her unfit to continue her Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
longer, she leavs it off for the
present, to resume it when she is
better dispos'd: And, when some
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35990:32"/>
use has provided her of Spirits fit
for her purpose, she will seldom
have cause to break off for weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but may Pray with ease
as long as is necessary or use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Hitherto we have discourst
of these two kinds of Devotion as
they are in their own nature. If
we upon look them as they are
in the Subject, we shall find those
of the material way generally great
valuers of External Acts: They
place all Spiritual Goodness in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
them; think them Saints
who are addicted to long Prayers,
and assiduously repairing to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Sacraments; proceeding
too often to censure those as little
less than voyd of all goodness,
whom they observe not to be still
as their Beads or the like. And
this proceeds not from defect in
Devotion, (on the contrary, it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happens but where it is strong
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35990:33"/>
and much valu'd), but from the
weakness of the person who has it;
and who, being neither us'd (nor
able) to judge of the nature of
things, comprehends not how he
can be Devout, who does not do
those Actions continually, which by
Experience he finds useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Devotion in himself.
Those of the other Way, place all
their Treasure in Interiour Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
and, for Outward Actions,
chuse them by Judgment; and
practice so many and such as they
find useful to the Inward Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They think persons more or
less Saints, as their Souls possess
more or less of those true Spiritual
Riches: and hence value and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
so to improve their minds
in the Knowledg of Spiritual things,
as being the connatural means to
produce good Affections; which
the others fancy not, but rather
condemn as a hinderance to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35990:33"/>
because they perceive no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
nor fruit of it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The former, placing much
of their Devotion in performance
of the External Act, as going often
to Confession, Communion, &amp;c. are
not generally altogether so solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of due Preparation, or at least
aim not by their preparation to
work their souls into a disposition
fit to advance in true Vertue and
perfection of the Interior by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
efficacy of the Action upon
such a disposition; but, following
Faith unexplicated by true Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
expect the fruit from a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
operation of Grace, beyond
their comprehension fixt to, and
accompanying the Action. The
later, apprehending the benefit to
be expected from those Actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
after a connatural way, upon
the disposition with which they are
done, are as much solicitous about
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35990:34"/>
the Disposition as the Action; and
labour more to perform them <hi>well</hi>
than <hi>often,</hi> (unless their spiritual
Director judg them fit for both):
but always with a Preparation, suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Reverence due to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
so Sacred and Divine. Those,
being altogether affected to <hi>many,</hi>
and those the most Customary
Prayers, often slubber them over;
sometimes with so litle application
of the mind; that there is not so
much as a becoming Reverence in
the posture of the Body. They
litle heed the sence as they go along,
and consider not how or how far
it affects their souls; and, wanting
that which is the proper Rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their choice, if chance dispose
not otherwise, generally make use
of such as they see us'd by others:
apprehending some great matter in
the very words; and, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
chusing somtimes Latin Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
though they understand not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35990:34"/>
one word of the Language. And
yet, by the proportion this way has
to their Pitch of Soul, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of some great thing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
concurrs so well with their
right-set intentions, that they pray
very well, &amp; better than where they
understand more and conceipt less.
The other sort, being knowingly
devout, or <hi>Spirituall,</hi> (who, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Omnia dijudicant,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
or distinguish all things) and,
holding themselves at liberty, where
God or his Church has layd no
command, take for their Rule the
Good of their Souls, and believe
this Good to consist in a Right Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
They therfore chuse such
Prayers and Books, as they find
by experience most useful to this
purpose, and contain such Motives
as are most Efficacious to raise their
Souls to Heaven. They are no
ways affected to what they do not
understand; and comprehend not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35990:35"/>
how Ignorance, one of the chief
curses of Original Sin, should ever
be the Mother of Devotion. They
are more for the <hi>few</hi> and <hi>well,</hi> than
the <hi>many</hi> and <hi>often</hi> at a venture.
They are always careful to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
their Prayers with a grave
and reverent gesture, and an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
piercing into (as far as they
are able) and distinctly penetrating
the force of the Words; which
they expect should contain such an
Affective sence, as is apt to wing
their Souls for Heaven.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The former too are more
addicted to <hi>Corporal,</hi> the later to
<hi>Spiritual Works of Mercy:</hi> and, as
those fancy no great matter in the
advancing of <hi>Truth,</hi> supposing we
have once <hi>Faith;</hi> so these see no
advantage to the world, in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any necessity incident to the
Body, comparable to that of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
mens Souls, which they see
will follow from the advancing of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35990:35"/>
Truth: Solid Goodness being the
genuin Off-spring of Solid Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Lastly, the difference of
these two Spirits is great in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to comportment and human
conversation. They whose study it
is to guide themselvs by Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the true Nature which God
has given us, apply it to all their
Actions; whence their carriage is
even, their Friendship steady, their
Judgment stay'd and just, their
thoughts Charitable: They hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to proposals with calmness and
indifference, and believe, without
good grounds, slowly: The others are
more apt to be humorous; stifly
addicted to any opinion taken up
of course; inconstant in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and friendships; partial in
their Verdicts; credulous even of
Toyes, and of which no solid
ground appears, if they suit their
Fancy; unwilling to hear any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35990:36"/>
son, which Crosses the conceit they
have once espous'd; And, for
want of duly weighing the nature
and reason of things, Rash Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
Censorious of every thing
that runs not just in the track of
their thoughts; and fierce Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henders
of what they think amiss.
And yet these imperfections, when
they happen, hinder not a good
meaning, and right-set intention.
All this while they may heartily
wish and love what's agreeable to
Gods will, and hate whatever is
contrary; only, by the shortness
of their Reason, or untoward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
they are preoccupated
with a wrong conceit of their own
way, and see not what is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and what contrary to the Will
of God; And so afford those of
the other sort a fair Occasion of
Exercising a double Charity, in
bearing with their Imperfections,
and, by sweet ways, instructing
their Ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:35990:36"/>
§. 10. But, we must not think
that these two sorts of Devout
people are found in the World, fixt
in an indivisible point, as they
seem here described. I fear there
are not very many perfectly of the
one kind, and hope there are not
very many just of the other. I
only intended to describe the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards
of these two Spirits: which
are participated with a thousand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
degrees, now of the one,
now of the other sort, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with a variety almost infinit,
according as natural Genius, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have allotted their proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Let be it our task <hi>oemulari
charismata meliora,</hi> with a true
Christian Ambition, to aim at
what's best and highest; but yet
remember too, that what's best in
it self is not always best for every
particular: and resolve, upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35990:37"/>
advise than our own, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the <hi>Unum necessarium,</hi> that
way which is most expedient for
our Souls. The truth is, these
Methods, as different as they are,
may both be needful almost for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one. Few or no understandings
are so sublime, as not to admit,
and even need, the assistance of
frequenting outward Acts, which
beget Habits: And few so low,
as may not be improv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
and that considerably, to
the benefit of the material way, if
good Instruction be not wanting.
Wherefore, neither should the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Devote neglect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use of outward Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
nor the Material one, to
improve his outward exercises, by
joyning as much Understanding to
them as he can.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:35990:37"/>
               <head>SECT. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the means to attain
Devotion.</head>
               <p>THe means of attaining both
sorts of Devotion are already
toucht in Common; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
deserves to be treated more
particularly. In the Material way,
because the effect is wrought in the
Soul by impressions first made on
the Body, that which imports is,
that these Impressions be as strong
as may be, and as many; for, a
weak cause often apply'd, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the effect of a strong one.
Such exercises therefore are to be
preferr'd, as strike the inward sense
and fancy most strongly: but, what
ever they are, they will become
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35990:38"/>
Efficacious, if they be often enough
repeated. Those therefore for
whom this way is proper should
be exhorted to be assiduous in the
outward exercises of Devotion,
whatever they be; yet with this
caution, that the Frequency pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
not their Efficacy: For, if
they become so customary as to be
done meerly out of custome, they
will loose much of their force.
Particular care is to be taken in
this point, about those Exercises
which require an extraordinary
Reverence, and, by the design of
the Divine Institutor, carry with
them an awe and respect; as the
Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Maxim, <hi>Consueta viles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,
Customary things grow vile,</hi>
our too frequent use of them,
bring us to a careless indifference in
performing them, and take off our
conceit of them; they will become
little beneficial, and perhaps harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:35990:38"/>
§. 2. But, these inconveniences
avoyded, these Devotes are to be
advised to pray as often and as long
as they can, and such prayers as
they please; To frequent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
the oftner the better,
so it be with serious preparations,
and such as may preserve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
due to them; To be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at all Solemnities of the Church,
and there where things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with most Majesty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingness;
If any Extraordinary
Occasion of Devotion happen, as in
Jubilees and the like, by all means
to lay hold of it; Often to read
good Books, of which the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
are more for their purpose
than the Instructive; and, in a
word, to omit nothing proper to
strengthen and increase the Habit
of Devotion. In general, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
they frame in common and
confusedly, of the Benefit of these
things, should be kept up at the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35990:39"/>
height, and Increas'd if it may be:
and, for particulars, because they
penetrate not into the nature of
things, nor consider which way they
work, it matters not much what
they be, so they be good, and apt
to move them. For this Reason,
and because they are through their
weakness easily scandaliz'd; peo,
ple should in charity be wary of
maintaining and even discovering
contrary sentiments before them:
For, these ways, whatever they
be in themselves, the best or no,
are best for them, and will make
them Saints, if they pursue them
sincerely and faithfully: and we
must beware, <hi>Nè pereat in scientiâ
tuâ infirmus frater, Lest a weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perish by thy Knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. The way of <hi>Knowledg</hi>
must needs be pursu'd by such
means as improve Knowledg; and
he advances in it best, who most
deeply penetrates into Christian
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35990:39"/>
Duties, and most clearly sees their
agreeableness to right Reason. I
do not mean with such a sight as
is meerly speculative; nor such a
sight as can pierce into the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
themselves, and look upon
them with that kind of Evidence
which we have of other Truths,
whose terms we see connected:
For this would take away Faith,
and is impossible here; and only to
be hoped in the Country of Bliss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
light, where we shall see Face
to Face. But I mean such a sight
as presupposes Faith, and renders
it lively or operative; which if
once we can attain, it is impossible
not to be Devout: For, <hi>knowledg</hi> of
any Good, when 'tis express and
lively, becomes a Principle of <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for it, or to obtain it; that is,
<hi>Will:</hi> as by reflexion we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover in the whole course of
our lives, and experience of our
daily Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:35990:40"/>
§. 4. Now, this Knowledge is
renderd <hi>express,</hi> and Faith by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<hi>lively,</hi> two manner of
ways: By Supernatural, and by
Natural means. Supernatural
means, are either apt to affect all
Mankind; or some <hi>few</hi> chosen by
God's providence, and design'd
and fitted for great ends. Of the
first sort are Miracles in general:
For the common course of Nature
is practically evident to all; and
so, what ever evidently crosses it,
must needs be conceiv'd to spring
from the Author of Nature,
who can control it as he pleases.
Wherefore, as, on the one side,
this evidence makes it stick firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the soul, that God has a hand
in it; so, on the other side, the
Astonishment, by reason of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usualness
of the effect, makes it
sink deep; and both together ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Faith, as to the point it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies,
exceeding lively and prompt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35990:40"/>
to Action. Of the other sort are
the rushing Wind, the fiery
Tongues, and other concomitant
causes, which produc't that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
liveliness of Faith and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
height of ardent Devotion in
the first Planters of the Church:
by which they were renderd so
strongly and readily dispos'd for
those duties which Christ had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them, that they cheerfully
embrac'd all Inconveniencies, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nay Death it self, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them. These causes were not
apt to affect all Mankind, as they
did those few, particularly fitted
by long conversation with Christ
himself, and expectation of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Promise he made them
at his departure; which was still
working in their minds, and raising
them to look for some strange Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
effect of it. These are the
two manners of External and more
ordinary supernatural means: for,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35990:41"/>
of the Inward workings of God's
Spirit, <hi>which blows where it lists;</hi>
and whose Operation, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it, depend upon a
<hi>Series</hi> of causes unknowable by
us, 'tis not my Intention to speak
in this Discourse.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Natural and Ordinary
means, to make this Knowledge
express, and Faith lively, are also
two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> penetrating well, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Grounds on which Faith is
built, that is, the Certainty of the
Authority which recommends it;
or else, the Agreeableness of the
things to be believed and of the
Actions to be practis'd, to the
Maxims of true Reason. It is the
proper business of Controversy to
teach the one, and Scholastick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
the other; and 'tis by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and attentively considering the
discourses made by Masters in both
kinds, that we may attain the
Knowledge we desire in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35990:41"/>
Only let us provide the
Author, we chuse, be truly Solid
(for every one who writes is not
so); and that the Point we
chuse be to our purpose. It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
necessary always, nor conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that every one who is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Knowledge, should read all
the Controversies that concern each
point of Faith; even though they
be good and solid: much less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
himself with solving all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
rais'd, and raisable without
end, by Adversaries. It will be
sufficient to peruse and understand
one or two good Books, which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
treat, and firmly establish the
Grounds of Faith; or, if leasure
and opportunity serve, to hear some
Oral discourses of that subject: In
fine, by any way we can, to weigh
attentively the Nature of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on which Faith is built, and
what perfect Certainty the same,
and less Authority begets in us on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35990:42"/>
other Occasions. This done with
that care and concern which the thing
requires, it will naturally breed in a
Soul, these and the like reflexions.</p>
               <p>§. 6. I believe, and that with a
most firm assurance, that there was
a King <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. a <hi>William the
Conqueror,</hi> a <hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> and
many Actions perform'd by them,
as altering Religion in <hi>England,</hi>
Conquering this Nation, gaining
many Victories, and the like. The
same I believe of less men, and less
universally-known Actions; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they were sufficiently notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to great Multitudes, and by
these multitudes openly and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
attested, and without any
imaginable ground of suspicion of
Fear or Hope, or any Interest which
might move them to ly in the case.
I find this writ in my heart in such
characters, that I can as well doubt
whither I am, as whither such
things were. I find all Mankind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35990:42"/>
judge the same; and I can no more
think it possible, that Humor or
Interest should beget this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them, than in my self;
which I am sure it does not. 'Tis
evident then, that Right Nature,
or true Reason, obliges both them
and me to assent that such things
are true; and therefore that such
an Authority, attesting such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, cannot deceive us.
Wherefore, by the same and far
better Reason, I am to believe this
vast Authority of the Church attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me, that such and such Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins
were taught by Christ and his
Apostles.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Farther, considering the
circumstances in which this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
perswasion of Mankind that
this doctrine is Divine was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't,
I find the Effect absolutely
impossible to Nature. The men,
who first began to work it, were
inconsiderable in all respects of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35990:43"/>
which the world takes notice: Of
mean Birth, of mean Callings,
Fisher-men, of no Power, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
natural Endowments;
and, where there was a Primitive
Christian, as there were many, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for Parts or Quality, he must
first be wrought upon by men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to himself in all such kind
of respects. This was at a time
when the whole world was possest
with Idolatry, that is, utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Christianity, excepting one
poor Corner of it, <hi>Judea,</hi> where
the Change began; and where those
who remained unchanged were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enemies to the business than the
Heathens themselves. The temper
of the World at this time, was so
far from simple or foolish, that
Wit was rather at the highest
pitch; all the Learning of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
and <hi>Greece</hi> being transfer'd
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and there improv'd
and heighten'd. Yet <hi>this World,</hi> by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35990:43"/>
                  <hi>these men,</hi> in <hi>such circumstances,</hi>
was prevail'd with, to cast off all
their long-settled perswasions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
and; instead of them, to
entertain, and that with a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakable
firmness, the belief of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
<hi>inconceivable;</hi> such at which
nature could not chuse but boggle
extreamly, and not admit without
absolute Conviction. For, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
could move them; all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
of Honour, or Trust,
or Profit, were in the Hands of
those who Opposed this New Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
and to Embrace it, was to
Forfeit whatever they Possest or
hoped in this kind; nay, to change
it for Poverty, and Contempt, and
Torments, and Death. <hi>Force</hi> there
neither was, nor could be: For,
all Power was in those who were
against Christianity; and was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
and strain'd to suppress it.
In Learning and Wit, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and all Natural Parts,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35990:44"/>
they had the Advantage; and the
things proposed to their Belief, a
Trinity, a God made Man, and
living in Obscurity, and dying in
Torments and Infamy, a Virgin-Mother,
&amp;c. were Inconceivable,
and to nature Unsolvable Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
               <p>§. 8. He that shall consider these
things, and the rest of what may
occur, as they deserve, will be
convinc'd that the Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Perswasion of such Multitudes of
Men, so qualify'd, to believe such
strange things, so strongly that no
Hopes or Fears could hinder them
from standing firmly to them, even
to Death, could not be compast
by <hi>Natural Causes;</hi> and thence
conclude with absolute certainty,
the Doctrine could be no other than
Divine, dictated by God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Nature, and, by his Power
over it, introduc't and settled in
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:35990:44"/>
§. 9. Again, amongst other
Supernatural means Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, which the Christian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unanimously pretend to have
been done by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:
'Tis impossible had they
been false they should not have
been discover'd, and the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Actors manifestly shown
to be a company of Cheats, unless
there wanted Wit, or Power, or
Will in the Opposit Party to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
and detect them; For, that
which we <hi>know how</hi> to do, and <hi>can,</hi>
aud <hi>will do,</hi> manifestly <hi>is done.</hi> Wit
to detect them there was in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
the world being then both
acute, and withall Sceptical; a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
too, which hindered them from
believing rashly. <hi>Will</hi> there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not: The Honor and Interest
of all Overseers of Religion, or
Priests, both Jews and Gentiles,
engaging them against it; and the
Civill Policy being highly concern'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35990:45"/>
to look to Innovations, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins
contrary to the Religion in
vogue, and Establisht among them.
Besides, 'tis plain they had a <hi>Will
to do</hi> what they <hi>did,</hi> and they <hi>did</hi>
make all the Opposition they could.
Neither was there any want of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;</hi>
which, till <hi>Constantin's</hi> time,
three hundred years after Christ,
was all, (whether Secular or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,)
in the hands of the Enemies
of Christianity; and often fruitles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imploy'd to the uttermost, both
by Policy and Persecution, to root
it out. There was no possibility
of over-bearing them by Noise (for
that is one kind of Power) and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
those who cry'd down the
Miracles, by the louder Clamours
of greater multitudes who cry'd
them up. For, though Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had made a considerable progress
in the world during the times of
persecution, yet, in comparison of
Heathens, Christians were but few,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35990:45"/>
and very unable to contend with
them in noise. It remains then,
that the pretended Miracles were
<hi>true</hi> Miracles, and too evidently such
for any Wit or Power of man to
show them otherwise: And that those
and the other means, used in the
conversion of the world, were truly
<hi>above Nature;</hi> since they overcame
all Human and Natural means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
and bent to oppose them.
And, had they not been such, the
perswasion, nay steadfast belief, of
such incomprehensible Mysteries,
and standing fast against such a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Torrent, nay turning the
stream so strangely, and prevailing
on such vast Portions of the World
to embrace Christianity, would be
an Effect without a Cause, or
(which is all one) without a <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable</hi>
Cause, or a Cause able to
produce it. Wherefore, as Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as it is, that no Effect can be
produc't without a Cause, and that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35990:46"/>
a Proportionable cause, or a Cause
<hi>able to produce it,</hi> (and that is so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that to deny it, is to affirm
manifest Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>a thing can do what it cannot do;</hi>)
so sure it is, that this first-taught
Doctrin was both truly Divine,
and rightly deriv'd from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times to us. Therefore I
am as sure as I live my Faith is
<hi>True,</hi> and the Doctrin I believe,
Reveal'd to Mankind by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Hence a rationally-pious
Soul will discourse on this or the
like manner: When I certainly
know any thing that really and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerns me, for example, that
such a precipice, if I leap into it,
will certainly kill me, such an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will certainly ruin my estate, such
another will secure it, and settle
me in Plenty, &amp; Content, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
'tis plain Madness not to act
according to this Knowledg, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35990:46"/>
beware of that precipice, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
one Action, and do the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But it is infinitly <hi>greater</hi>
madness not to avoyd such things
as my Faith, with much greater
certainty, assures me will bring
upon me infinitly greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs;
and not lay hold of such
things as it likewise assures me will
put me into possession of infinitly
greater Goods, no less than true,
and perfect, and never Ending Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
I will therfore endeavour
by the best, and all means I possibly
can, to avoyd Sin, correct my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Inordinate Love of this
World, strengthen and advance
my Reason, elevate my mind to
God, and strain with the utmost
force of my Soul after this state
of Bliss, which is alone Desirable,
alone Considerable, &amp;c. And this
with a steady and devout pursuit;
keeping ever awake in my mind,
when it grows drowsy, the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35990:47"/>
Certainty of what my Faith,
propos'd and attested to me by the
Church, delivers to me. Thus we
see how <hi>Faith is the Argument of
things not yet seen,</hi> to wit, by the
clearness of its Principles or
Grounds; Likewise, how 'tis the
<hi>Substance of things to be hoped,</hi> by
the Firmness of its own Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Lastly, how it is the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of all Devotion, because the
consideration of its Truth, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
express to our thoughts, makes
Faith it self very lively and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that is, our Judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, very <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
and <hi>Ready for Christian Action;</hi>
in which, that disposition of the
Soul, which we call Devotion,
formally consists. To proceed thus
far, and settle their Judgments in
these Truths with the steadiest
firmness and clearest sight they can,
is advisable for those Souls, whose
pitch of Reason makes them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35990:47"/>
into the Grounds of things,
and capable to comprehend them;
for such persons will receive much
comfort and profit by such kind
of satisfactions. It imports not
which way they take to this end;
whether they work it out by their
own meditations, or use the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Books, or publick or
private and Familiar Discourses:
So the business be done, it matters
not how.</p>
               <p>§. 11. If any particular diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
which strikes at the very
Ground of their Beleef comes cross
their thoughts, and hazards in the
least to shock their Judgment, it
may be worth their pains somtimes
to see through that too: But, to
amuse themselves with every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and not to be quiet till
they themselves can answer every
thing which is or may be oppos'd,
I take to be a very unprofitable,
and very unsatisfiable curiosity. The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35990:48"/>
difficulty may somtimes be such as
cannot be solved, without a deep
in-sight into many Sciences, such as
they neither have, nor can hope to
have for want of leasure or parts.
Again, Objections are endless, and
should we not be satisfi'd of a
Truth, till all that can be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it were answer'd, we should
never be satisfy'd of any Truth
at all, but onely of the very first
Principles. Should all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet ever thought of from the
beginning of the World, be ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd
to day; as many more might
be invented to morrow. For Wit
and Fancy have no bounds; and
'tis from the fertility of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
that Objecting proceeds.
And, after all, 'tis not the proper
business of Devotes; it belongs to
Controvertists to answer Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the only thing which imports
Devout people of this pitch, is to
understand well, that the Grounds
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35990:48"/>
on which they proceed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their Lives, are firm and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid:
and such as they ought se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,
and without fear of deceit,
rely on. Which done, they must
be true to themselves, and act with
a vigour proportionable to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of cleerness with which their
Speculativeness discerns them to be
true, joyn'd with such a Concern
as Faith tells us the matter deserves.
Nor need they distrust Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this, which has furnisht his
Church with means suitable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
capacity.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Again, when upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Grounds they have given Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to a Truth, they should
stand to it, and trouble themselves
no more: For nothing in the
World is or can be more certain
than that if this be <hi>True,</hi> what
ever is or can be said against it is
<hi>not True,</hi> whether I be able to
make so much out or no. And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35990:49"/>
upon this they may securely rest.
In truth this wavering Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
this quivering Irresolution,
which keeps us from owning hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
what we do see, for fear of
what we do not see, is a blamable
weakness; loses the time, in which
we should work out our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon Doubts and Scruples,
and puts us into the condition,
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> reprehends in the
women of his time, <hi>Semper discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
&amp; nunquam ad scientiam verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
pervenientes. Always Learning, &amp;
never coming to the knowledge of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. Since then, a knowing
devout soul seeks only, or only should
seek, so much knowledg, as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the perfection of Devotion;
let her if she be able, faithfully, and
severely pursue her inquiry, till she
arrive at such a certainty of those
Truths which concern her; I mean
such as will give solid Ground for
Virtuous Christian Life: and, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35990:49"/>
the rest, remain satisfy'd with this,
that there must of necessity be
some deceit in whatever is said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Truth. Let her a God's
Name first discover that to be
Truth which she embraces, as
Truth; to which 'tis sufficient to
judge upon good Grounds, the
Church is Infallible. But after this,
it is lost time if she spend any in
the discovery of the deceit. It is
enough she knows it is Deceit, and
needs not know what kind of one
it is. In our particular Case, she
may reflect, that the Testimony of
the Church or <hi>Tradition,</hi> being
the ground on which we build
the certainty of Faith, as 'tis
Christian (which onely in a
manner amongst us is called in
question) they who deny the force of
Tradition, must by consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the certainty of any matter of
Fact done before our Days: And,
because Nature assures us, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35990:50"/>
this is Irrational, it assures us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that who object on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
go against nature, and so all
they can say, is no other than witty
talk, handsom flourishes, and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
quibbling, without real force
or solid ground. And, indeed, they
plainly discover themselves irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and led by passion, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
oppose Tradition; because
they maintain an evident Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
For, on the one side they
affirm that Faith is truly certain;
and on the other, deny Faith has
any Grounds truly Certain: And
this (since nothing can be said cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but in vertue of the Proofs
of Grounds by which the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is made out) is to say, that Faith
is and is not truly Certain. To
this they are forc't by the heat of
Opposition; For they will not
grant Tradition has the vertue to
make a thing truly certain, because
they are aware it is against them:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35990:50"/>
And, by denying it, they leave
no truly certain Grounds for Faith
at all. For, as all proof of matters
of Fact past long ago must at last
depend on Testimony, or Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if Tradition it self be not
secure, nothing can be so which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on it. And so there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but they must speak out at last,
and say plainly, as they do, that all
grounds of Faith, and consequently
Faith it self, may possibly be false.</p>
               <p>§. 14. I would not be mistaken
here to advise any they should not
beleeve till they have this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Grounds of Faith; but
I presuppose them already Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and intend only to comfort their
Faith by looking into it's Grounds:
Every one that is convinc't, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon solid or sleightest Grounds,
God has said a thing, is bound to
beleeve it, else he sins mortally in
disbelieving God who is Essential
Truth. Much less do I absolutely
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35990:51"/>
require this of them; but, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that their own speculative
and acute <hi>Genius</hi> makes themselves
require it, I exhort them to it as
to that which is to such Souls a
means to increase their Devotion,
and can no way shock them if they
be not passionate and precipitate.
Least of all do I tell them that in
looking into their Grounds they
ought to go to work like Doubters
or Seekers; but, quite contrary,
supposing them firm in Faith by
their relying on the sure Rock of
the Church, and strengthen'd in
that reliance by the Practical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that the Virtues she exhorts
us to are agreeable to Right Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Reason or Conscience, and
that the means she proposes and
enjoyns to attain them are Effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
towards that End, I bid
them rest secure, that if God,
together with an earnest desire to
advance in Devotion, have also
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35990:51"/>
given them a piercing Eye to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
Truth (as he has to many
many thousands in the vast Extent
of the Church) God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has provided such Grounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd,
and penetrable by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Capacity, and theirs amongst
the rest, as will, if look't into, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Faith more lively, and
their Devotion more fervent and
Solid. But, who is of this pitch,
and so to make use of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
lest the over-weening of
their own private and perhaps par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Fancies should make them strain
beyond their force, is left to the
judgment of Spiritual Directers,
whom we are to suppose fitted by
Education, as well as design'd by
Office to be the proper Discerners of
Spirits, and knowing when to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Milk and solid
Food according to the capacity of
the Souls they are to nourish us
in Devotion. For those <hi>perfecti</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:35990:52"/>
were already Faithful: the reason
then of his discoursing <hi>wisely</hi> with
them, was (their pitch bearing it)
to make their Faith lively, and
their Vertue more solid; and to
enable them also to convert others
to Faith, and advance them in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or Devotion.</p>
               <p>§. 15. The bottom-ground of
all Devotion being thus layd in
the Establishment of Faith, many
other Comfortable Lights will
break out, and cherish and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the liveliness of it in such
persons as we have spoken of, and
to a great degree in others also.
Such are the considerations, What
wise Orders for a World the <hi>Ten
Commandements</hi> are; What Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Mischiefs would succeed if
any of them were omitted; and
how the well-being of Mankind,
both as to <hi>this</hi> life and the <hi>next,</hi>
is pithily compriz'd in these few
Heads: which as it argues an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly-wise
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35990:52"/>
Contriver, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
and providing for the
Necessities of Human Nature, so
it likewise becomes an Infinit
Goodness, commanding his poor and
indigent Creatures nothing but
what is their own true Good, and
tends to bring them to compleat
Happiness.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Next, the Consideration
how conformable the more eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Points of Faith are to Right
Reason, exceedingly comforts an
Understanding captivating it self
to the Obedience of Faith. For,
as on the one side, nothing is
more rational, than that those high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Truths, which Elevate us to
Heaven, should be placed above
the pitch and endeavours of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and so not to be knowable
by Principles purely Natural: So
likewise Truths, by being Truths,
and proceeding all from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Truth, must needs be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35990:53"/>
one to another, and bear some
resemblance and proportion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
those <hi>above Nature</hi> and
<hi>Reason,</hi> to those discoverable this
way; although they cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them, but depend on Gods
Authority revealing and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
proposing them. These things
are found in the books of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;</hi>
of which such would be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
as serve best to perform the
duty of Divines, and shew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Religion to Reason
most clearly. For, those which,
with great shew of Wit and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
only dispute matters plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
on both sides, are not proper
for this purpose. Who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not Latin, or, though he
do, is perhaps to seek in those
Terms in which Schoolmen usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express themselves, should make
use of some good Divine; who
may select such points as are most
proper for the Person with whom
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35990:53"/>
he deals, and deliver them in
terms which may be intelligible to
him.</p>
               <p>§. 17. Besides these Books &amp; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which increase Dovotion
in intelligent Souls by enlightning
their Understanding, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which work immediately on
the Will, of them as well as of
others, by the way of Affections
without the help of Reason. And,
though these are perhaps more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the <hi>other</hi> way of Devotion,
yet no assistance should be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and they are very compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with this, and no less, if not
more, Efficacious. For, being
made up of Expressions coming
from a mind full of, and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Devout Thoughts, they
are apt to transsuse, as it were Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
into the Soul of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
And, if that Reader be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
satisfi'd in the Principles
which ground those Affections, he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35990:54"/>
is excellently disposed to receive
them. Those Principles then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
habitually possest by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
they will experience their
Wills inflam'd by the ardent Love,
which those Expressions breath;
in the same manner as Lively Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of any Passion beget the
<hi>same</hi> passion in another, especially
if possest with the same Concern
which was to both the Ground
of those Passions. Hence they find
such Books full of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and as it
were of <hi>Sap,</hi> connaturally nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dilating their Souls; which
others, not throughly satisfi'd of
those Principles, coucht under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
as their Foundation, find
sapless and disrelishing: Though
yet, sometimes it happens other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and that without any fault or
defect.</p>
               <p>§. 18. But generally such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are like meat already chaw'd,
and needing nothing to become
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35990:54"/>
presently nutritive, but a heart dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by Affections of the same
kind to receive it; as new drops
of water, without more ado cling
together, and increase the bulk.
Of these, some are us'd for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
directly, others for Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Mind with devout
reading; but both work by the
way of Affective Impressions. The
best without all comparison are
the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David:</hi> which some
find relish more, when they are
taken asunder, and then peec't of
verses taken one here, another
there, as seems most proper; and
those obscure parts which darken
the sence left out. Divers devout
persons have laboured in this
kind; and who would labour for
himself perhaps would find it no
unuseful employment. Besides these,
I would commend <hi>St. Austins Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
some piece of St. Bernard,
and S. Bonaventure: The Imitation of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35990:55"/>
Christ; The Love of God by St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Sales; St. Teresa's Works and
ejaculatory Prayers, The Sermons of
of St. Thomas de villa nova, &amp;c.</hi>
But, the best books of Devotion
are those of <hi>Prayer;</hi> and Prayer
being an Elevation of the Mind to
God; and the Mind consisting of
Understanding and Will; those
Prayers are the best which work
on <hi>both,</hi> and at once <hi>instruct</hi> and
<hi>enlighten</hi> the <hi>Understanding</hi> and
<hi>inflame</hi> the <hi>Will.</hi> I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advise to chuse such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
solid Christian Doctrin, and
express it both rationally and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively.
Of this kind of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
the number is not great; few
being fitly qualifi'd to compose
them. For, there is requisit in
the Author, both skill in true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
to make the conformity of
Christian Doctrin to Reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and ardent Devotion; he
being very unlikely to warm ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35990:55"/>
who is cold himself; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a great mastery in Language,
to chuse expressions clear and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
and both easy. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
for this purpose, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> and the
<hi>Devotions</hi> of our learned, Pious
and judicious County-Man,
Mr. <hi>John Austen</hi> in the way of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>§. 19. The Lives of Saints also
are of great efficacy to stir up De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
by way of Imitation and
Example. But they would be well
writ, that is, with more care to
relate their Heroick Vertues, which
made them Saints and estimable
and imitable by us, then to hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
multitude of Miraculous, and,
if but flightly attested, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
actions; which neither were
the causes of their Sanctity, nor
are imitable. They affect the
Vulgar indeed with Admiration
and Esteem; But work not so much
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35990:56"/>
upon the wiser sort, who only
seek their own Improvement, and
how they may come to Vertue
themselves; of which these things
were no Cause, though they may
be Signs. Yet, when they are duly
attested, and accompany'd with the
Saints Vertuous Life, they become
a kind of Testimony to the
Church, of God's particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to those who give themselves
up to his Service; and an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
for others to serve so
good a Master, who thus honours
those that honours him. But, as I
said, they ought to be well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
lest the credulity of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
embracing so many uncertain
stories for assured Truths, and the
easiness of some Pastors in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them without distinction
to be Printed, do not as much or
more harm to those without the
Church, as good to those within
her. The best way is to chuse such
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35990:56"/>
Lives as were written by Authors,
who were also Saints themselves;
and withal Learned and Prudent,
and so less apt to be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by false Relations, or byast by
Interest or Affection. Such as is
the <hi>Life of</hi> St. <hi>Francis, by</hi> St. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure;
of</hi> St. <hi>Hilarion and</hi>
St. <hi>Paul the Hermite, by</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom;

               <p>THE First or Principal Act
of Devotion being <hi>Prayer,</hi>
it seems proper, that, in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of <hi>Devotion,</hi> I should say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35990:57"/>
more particularly of it's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and excellencies than I have
done hitherto; and thence enkindle
in the Hearts of my Readers a great
desire to frequent it. All which
I cannot do without hinting at the
same time the <hi>best</hi> Manner how to
perform it: though it ought not to
be expected, in so short a discourse
as I intend, I should much enlarge
my self, or descend to every <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
manner of it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Prayer</hi> then, as was said,
is defin'd an <hi>Elevation or raising of
the mind to God:</hi> which being a kind
of Action; and every Action, (as
Philosophy tells us,) having two
Terms or Ends, the one that <hi>from</hi>
which the Action <hi>goes;</hi> the other
that <hi>to</hi> which <hi>it tends;</hi> (as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the Action of <hi>Heating,</hi> goes
from Coldness, and tends to Heat)
it follows that the benefit of Prayer
must be rated from both these. It
raises us to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35990:58"/>
it lifts us from <hi>Earth,</hi> its opposit
or Antartick: That is, it sets us
above that from whence our misery
springs, and approaches us to that
where all our Happiness is treasur'd
up.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Some ancient Heathens,
such as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> seem'd to have
attain'd the former, without the
Help of Prayer; and to be great
Contemners of the World. But,
alas, they did but <hi>seem</hi> so, for
all their mock-holy-day pretences:
For, had they been indeed and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rais'd <hi>above Earth,</hi> they must
of force have been rais'd <hi>towards
Heaven;</hi> that is, they must have
been addicted to address themselves
by Prayer to the true God; of
which kind of Devotion their Earth-clogg'd
minds were utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
They were not then rais'd
above their affections to Earth,
but their whole pursuit was still the
<hi>World,</hi> though under a different
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35990:58"/>
consideration: They were above
it, as it was able to give them
Riches and Honorable Titles; but
still deeply plung'd in it, as it gave
them Esteem. Nay, far more
deeply, even for this regard, that
for this Esteem's sake, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
the other: For they thought
it more Honorable to seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
Riches and Dignities, then
to seek them; and therefore aym'd
at a greater worldly honour by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
that which in their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
was a less. So that, the
Progress of their vain and proud
Souls was not an advance from Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
to Heavenliness; but a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
leaving Earthly Riches and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
to acquire an aiery and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a more empty Earthly Esteem
and Admiration. Nay, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
the other <hi>comparatively</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, would have lov'd it,
and perhaps heartily too, but that
they doted more upon <hi>this:</hi> As
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35990:59"/>
the forenam'd Cynick trampled on
<hi>Plato's</hi> Pride (as he call'd his gay
cloths) with a greater Pride per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
than <hi>Plato</hi> wore them. Of
which kind of Contemners of the
World, we have too many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in <hi>England,</hi> amongst our dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
Fanaticks: With this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that their Pride is more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
that is, <hi>worse;</hi> nay being
a corruption of right Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>worst</hi> of all that can
be.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Prayer then being the best
means to elevate the mind from
Earth to Heaven, or rather this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Elevation it self; and the best
or readiest way to effect this, or
raise our selves upwards, being Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
it follows, that if we pursue
the Metaphor, we must say the
Soul has <hi>wings,</hi> by which she is
enabl'd to take this <hi>flight,</hi> that is,
her Thoughts and Affections: which
how swift they are, and how far
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35990:59"/>
they reach at one View and Effort of
the Soul, a litle Reflexion will teach
us. Moreover, she must move
and stir these Wings, that is, <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>
and <hi>consider;</hi> whence we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that those who are given
to run over their private Prayers
without considering what they say,
are sluggishly indeed moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven; for they cannot but
think of it at times sleightly, and
still intend well; but they seldom
advance by it to any high pitch.
They climb a little upward, by
the help of Characters and Sounds;
and the lame Activity of Fancy
lifts them into the Air; where they
see after a duskish manner far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
glances of Heaven; but scarce
one constant Ray of true Light
dawns, to allure and affect them
strongly. Lastly, there must be
a calm and clear <hi>medium</hi> to fly
thorow, (such as is our Air in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Flights) not disturb'd with ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35990:60"/>
Passions, or clogg'd with
clouds of Sorrow and worldly Cares.
If such Whirl-winds and Tempests
turmoil this <hi>medium,</hi> it will hazard
to take the Soul off the Wing, and
throw her head-long to the Earth.
Wherefore, if we intend a Progress
towards Heaven by Prayer, we
must first prepare a cheerful and
unpassionate disposition of the mind;
<hi>Ubi pax, ibi Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> Where
there is Peace, the Gift of the Holy-Ghost,
the Divine Giver himself is
not far absent. At least there must
be a steadiness in the Soul's superior
part, or a full Intention to get rid
of all these Passions. For, this
laid first, Prayer it self will do the
rest, as shall be seen hereafter.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Another Excellency of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and consequently an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to pursue it, is that it includes
in it self at once all Virtues; not
after a sluggish manner, as they ly
dormant as it were <hi>habitually</hi> in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35990:60"/>
the Soul, but as they are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in their <hi>most actuall</hi> and <hi>best</hi>
state: Which is as much as to say,
that Prayer is the actual exercise of
all virtues at once: For, it is
known that those virtues we call
morall, are not at all <hi>meritorious,</hi>
and consequently not at all <hi>virtues,</hi>
but as they partake of that Queen
of virtues, <hi>Charity.</hi> Whosoever
therfore has <hi>Charity,</hi> (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the two other Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
virtues, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi>) has all
the rest; whence it is said in the
Scripture, that, <hi>Love is the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. But, that we may come
to particulars. While we pray, we
make use of the virtue of <hi>Faith</hi> in-many
regards; for we at once Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
our Belief, that God is the
Soveraign Giver of all Good, and
Lord of all things; that He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
Wise to see the bottom of
our hearts laid open then before
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35990:61"/>
him; Infinitly Powerfull to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
all we can possibly wish;
Infinitly Good, to admit us into
his presence; nay, to exhort and
even command us to come to him;
as also to bestow on us all that
our condition and disposition can
render us capable of; Infinitly
Merciful to forgive all our sins as
soon as ever we heartily repent,
and humbly ask pardon. Again, by
our profound Reverence, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and exercise the belief
of his incomparable Greatness and
Majesty; By our Submission, and
Resignation, of his wise Providence
and Conduct of the World: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by our asking of him with due
Humility, that he is our Great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,
we his poor indigent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and meer Nothings of our
selvs: also, that he is our most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and bounteous Benefactor, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
Rich to supply, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowingly
Communicative of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35990:61"/>
to relieve all our Necessities,
so we ask as we ought.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Again, when we pray, we
exercise our <hi>Hope</hi> that He will hear
our Prayers, and grant all we ask,
if we ask wisely and humbly; that
he will keep the promise he has made
us to that purpose; that he will
Mercifully Pardon our sins, Protect
us from dangers; and in a word,
(as we use to phrase it,) that he
will <hi>hear all our Prayers,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wise Government of
the World, ought to be seconded
with Performance.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Lastly, while we pray, we
exercise the Virtue of Charity, as
it signifies <hi>Love of God,</hi> by calling
upon him and looking on him as a
Father and the Fountain of all good;
as endow'd with all those ravishing
qualities which amongst us use to
beget Love, such as are, Bounty,
Kindness, Mercy, tender Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Fidelity of word, Friendli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35990:62"/>
Pure Intellectual Light, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
Beautifulness to the eye of the
mind: And, most of all, as he is
our Chief and final, our Infinit and
Eternal Good, and our onely Bliss;
in whom our Soul must either for
ever repose after all the fond
toyes of the World we so dote on
leave us, or else remain Eternally
Miserable. Let us lay all this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and then reflect how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
an Excellency is found in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
which at once exercises and
interiourly Executes in the sight of
God, all Virtues at once.</p>

               <p>WHen the young man in the
Gospel askt our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
what he should do to have
Eternal Life, his answer was, <hi>keep
the Commandments:</hi> Now, if
Prayer be (supposing it made as it
ought) the keeping all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
nay, an actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
them all at once; then we
may be bold to vary the Phrase of

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35990:63"/>
thou wilt have Eternal Life, apply
thy self to Prayer.</hi> And this is
another Excellency of Prayer, and
a great one too, that every time
we exercise it, we are exercising
the fulfilling all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at once.</p>
               <p>§. 2. To understand which we must
consider, that no External Act is
Meritorious or Demeritorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, but as it springs from
Deliberate Will or <hi>Intention:</hi> and,
though the Execution of God's
Commands do exteriously increase
Merit too, yet it is because the
Intention it self is better'd or
strengthen'd habitually to some
degree by the outward Exercise;
or because, there being some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
perhaps to be overcome in
the performing the outward action:
hence the Intention to do this, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
resolutely to an actuall Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is better then else it would
have been, by the very conquering
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35990:63"/>
the difficulty; in the same sence a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
we may say, an intention to do a
thing <hi>notwithstanding any difficulty
occurring,</hi> is better than an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>simply</hi> to do it. Again, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
action increases our Merit, be-because
it begets a greater satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Hope in us, that our
inward Intention was not a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
one; for, the being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our selves of having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
many such good Deeds,
(especially if not done in the world's
Eye, and therefore not for its sake,
but for God's) will stand us in good
stead at our last hour, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our Souls with <hi>Hope</hi> (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
with <hi>Love</hi> which always
goes proportion'd to it) when we
are to appear before our great Judg.
But, abstracting from these cases,
and speaking of outward Actions,
without any regard or rapport to
the Soul, they are purely <hi>Local
motions,</hi> or meerly <hi>Natural</hi> not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35990:64"/>
                  <hi>Moral</hi> ones, and so have nothing
to do with Merit or Demerit:
Wherefore, putting an Intention
to do any good, as resolutely bent
to do it, and to overcome all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
that may occur, and to that
degree of perfection as the other
gains by extending it self to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
lastly, such as by reason of its
heartiness and honest sincerity, with
other circumstances, gains the same
comfort to the Soul, as if it had
been executed outwardly, 'tis equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Meritorious as the other. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that whosoever firmly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
intends any good, so that
nothing needs but an opportunity
actually to put it in execution, does
already execute it in his heart; and
tis the same before God, as if
he had perform'd it exteriourly,
As is evident from our B. Saviours
saying, that the poor Widow, when
she gave a mite, gave more than all
the Rich Vaunters: For, though
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35990:64"/>
in the Eye of the World it was
not so much, yet is was full as
much in the Eye of God; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it as such, because He saw
her hearty good Intention was
such, that, could she have done it,
she would have given more than
they all did.</p>
               <p>§. 3. This being once settled,
'tis easily seen, that Prayer exercis'd
as it ought, is in true Theology
a keeping at once all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and consequently the
Commandments of the Church
too, which are all involv'd in the
Fourth. For who sees not that
the First Commandment is nothing
but an injunction to Faith, Hope,
and Charity; as this last signifies
<hi>Love of God above all things:</hi> As
also to Soveraign Honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
Reverence, as they are
peculiarly due to God. Likewise,
that the Second is but an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of the Reverence due
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35990:65"/>
to Himself, to his <hi>Name;</hi> or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in Words and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Esteem we ought to bear
him in our Minds: And the
Third, a Determination of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of Prayer, to which he
that is given to Prayer must needs
be easily conformable. And what
cares he who is Exercising actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Virtues, we show'd before
were all found in rightly made Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
and especially Love of Heaven
above all things, what cares he, I
say, for pretending to worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
greater than others, for resen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
injuries, or for gaining world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures or profit, in which
consist all those of the Second
Table; whereas, if he be in Prayer,
that is, if his mind be <hi>Elevated to
God,</hi> and this frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,
he must needs despise in
his Heart, nay be Habituated to
despise all these sublunary trifles. <hi>In
his Heart</hi> I say, or Superior part
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35990:65"/>
of his Soul, or (which is all one)
as soon as he recurs to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which dwell and govern
there; however the <hi>Inferiour,</hi> which
feels some trouble, will have some
natural grudgings and repinings.
But these are little or nothing to
God's Commandements, but, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
an advantage to virtue, or an
occasion of merit; so the Superior
Part, by strength of Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and Supernatural Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Motives, keeps them from
growing <hi>Moral</hi> ones, that is, keeps
those <hi>Natural</hi> Considerations from
settling into <hi>Intentions:</hi> which
is the true Touch-stone, how far
these or such Motions belong to
<hi>Nature,</hi> and how far they relate to
<hi>Morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. But you will say, we do
not Experience while we pray,
that we practise distinctly any one
of these Virtues, now spoken of,
nor so much as think of any of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35990:66"/>
those Commandments; nay, many
of them seem most Exceedingly
remote from our thoughts when we
are in Prayer, and a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kind of Object. 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
there are two ways by
which divers things may be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in another. The one is call'd
<hi>Formally</hi> or being <hi>Formally</hi> there,
so that every one of these things
retains it's own form and nature,
as <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> are included in
the Fabrick of a House; <hi>Ink</hi> and
<hi>Paper</hi> are included in writing;
where each preserves it's own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
distinct from the other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Concurrence in
a common subject. The other is
call'd <hi>Eminential,</hi> which happens,
when all are there indeed, not <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
as in themselves, or as remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet in their own different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but as contain'd in some <hi>Third</hi>
or Common Excellency, which
has in it the Virtue of all, and yet
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35990:66"/>
is singly no one. Thus the Sun-Beams
include Light and Heat;
thus Reason includes in it self,
(though in an inferiour degree to
Prayer) all Imaginable Acts of
Virtue. Thus the force of each
Body in Nature is included, as in
a kind of Center, in the Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Being and Operativeness of a
Spirit. Thus, lastly, all Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Virtues are compriz'd in
the most simple and most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Essence of the Divinity;
in which, Justice, Mercy, Power,
and the rest are not found in their
several Distinct Natures singled
out a part, but in <hi>one</hi> most perfect
formality call'd <hi>God's Essence;</hi> whose
Incomparable Excellency compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
Eminently both all these and
infinit others, which our low pitch
of knowledge cannot reach or even
think of without diffecting it piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal,
as it were, by our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and considering each little mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
a part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:35990:67"/>
§. 5. Now, this manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
others, is by far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than the former; and 'tis <hi>thus</hi>
that Prayer comprehends all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and the several distinct Acts
of fullfilling each of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p>§. 6. For, Prayer being an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Soul to God, and
this not after a meer speculative
way, as an Heathen or an <hi>Aristotle</hi>
would think and discourse drily of
the first Being, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concern than as it is a kind
of curiosity beyond the ordinary
reach; but, after an Affective way,
endeavouring and aiming, by the
Affections (which are the wings of
the Soul) and by such thoughts
as we are already possest of, to
raise our selves to a higher degree
of Divine Love, and, by it, of Union
with our dear God; Hence it comes
to pass, that Prayer is, in its best
and most essential Part, an <hi>Actual
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35990:67"/>
Exercise of the Love of God,</hi> built
up in us on the best Foundations
and Principles that can possibly be
imagin'd, <hi>viz.</hi> on those Motives
which Faith proposes, and actually
rais'd by the best and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Disposition imaginable,
<hi>viz, Hope:</hi> Daily experience tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us, that nothing moves us so
Effectually to pursue any thing
which we conceit to be an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Good, as the Hope we have
to arrive at it; as on the other
side, that, let the thing be never
so excellent and alluring an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in it self, unless we have <hi>Hope</hi>
it will, or at least may, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by us, we may perhaps gaze
at it in our thoughts as a fine
thing, but never desire it, or
work for it, that is, never Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Love it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Prayer then being the <hi>best
Exercise of the Love of God;</hi> and
this Love including in it self Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentially
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35990:68"/>
all <hi>Virtues,</hi> and being,
(as the Scripture tells us) the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of all the Commandments;</hi>
it follows, first, that Prayer is such
likewise, as including in it self
that soveraign quality, actually and
in the best manner exercis'd, which
comprehends eminentially all the
rest. It follows next, that, this
manner of including them <hi>eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
being (as appears by the instance,
we brought before of God's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
including all perfections,)
by far more sublime than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Prayer is even in this regard,
of a most Incomparable Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the best Manner imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as indeed 'tis fit that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be, which is of it's own
nature, an Approach to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

Prayer, in uniting us
to God Intellectually.</head>
               <p>BUt we have not yet taken so
neer a view of Prayer as we
might: much of our former
Discourse, especially at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
runs upon the Metaphor, as
our low dull pitch of knowledge
oftentimes obliges us, when the
thing we intend to explicate is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Spiritual and very Sublime. We
now come to closer Discoveries of
its Nature, by looking with a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consideration into it's Proper
Effects which immediately and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
spring from it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That great Man <hi>Aristotle</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:35990:69"/>
(whom St. <hi>Thomas of Aquin</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
both in this and most other
points of his Doctrin, as fittest
by reason of their Truth to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Christian Faith) assures us,
that the Soul, when it <hi>knows</hi> any
thing, has the <hi>very Nature</hi> of the
<hi>thing known</hi> in it self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>as knowing</hi> it, becomes that
<hi>very thing</hi> intellectually. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
our assent to so strang a Point,
which looks at first sight like a
kind of Mystery of Faith, we may
reflect that, when we discourse or
think of the nature of any thing,
(let it be <hi>fire,</hi> a <hi>stone,</hi> or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing you will,) this Discourse or
Thought passes wholly <hi>within</hi> our
mind; and, when 'tis done, the
Effect of it remains <hi>there,</hi> and not
in things that are <hi>without</hi> us, as it
does in other kinds of Actions;
as Writing, Cutting, or such like,
which leave their impressions, <hi>out
of</hi> our minds, in the things we
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35990:69"/>
work on: Wherefore also the
Object, on which that inward
Thought or Discourse, works,
must as necessarily be <hi>in</hi> the Soul,
too, as Objects of the other sorts
of Actions, <hi>Fire,</hi> for Example, or
a <hi>Stone,</hi> exist <hi>out of us,</hi> when we
work upon them; that is, when we
blow the fire or hew the stone:
But, this Object of our discourse,
or thought, is suppos'd to be the
<hi>very Nature of the thing,</hi> (for 'tis
<hi>that</hi> we are discoursing about, and
not about some lame <hi>resemblance</hi>
of it;) wherefore the <hi>very Nature
of the</hi> thing is <hi>in</hi> our Soul, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists
there, though after a different
manner than it does <hi>out of</hi> the
Soul.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Then, to clear how this can
possibly be, that the <hi>very same</hi>
thing can have <hi>two</hi> different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>being,</hi> we may reflect how
the Frame of a House, or a new
invented Figure or Draught, is in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35990:70"/>
the mind of the Artificer, while
yet it has no being <hi>out of it:</hi> or,
how the Essences or Natures of
all things were <hi>in God</hi> from all
Eternity, when as yet they were
<hi>not in themselves,</hi> or according to
their own manner of Being. If
then, (as 'twas now made Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
the Soul can <hi>have</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of things <hi>in its Knowledg,</hi> it
can <hi>be</hi> those things <hi>intellectually;</hi>
since what has the nature of any
thing in it; 'tis (as it has that nature
in it) <hi>that very thing:</hi> for, what
is it to be that very thing, but
onely to have the nature of that
thing in it? The Soul then, as <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
any thing, becomes that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing intellectually which it
knows.</p>
               <p>§. 4. To apply this to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose: As the Blessed in
Heaven, seeing intellectually Gods
very Essence, have the Divine
Nature in their knowing Power,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35990:70"/>
and so are, God by Participation
and intellectually, which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

see God, and <hi>think</hi> on him as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to us by <hi>Faith,</hi> are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the inferior pitch of
Knowledge we have of God in
this state, to some degree Deify'd
too. And, though these imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
resemblances of God, which
we borrow from Creatures, do not
reach the Divine Nature in it self;
yet in case those who pray be
instructed (as they ought) that
though the Object of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
does not properly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
to <hi>God,</hi> yet, since the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their judgment accepts to stand
for him is not competible to any
Created Nature, they truly have
God in their thought, though after
an imperfect manner, and so are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35990:71"/>
him intellectually. Prayer then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper Exercise of <hi>thinking</hi>
of God, or <hi>having</hi> him, as held out
to us by Faith, <hi>in us</hi> intellectually,
that is of <hi>being him</hi> in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
(for the Conceptions Faith
gives of God, though imperfect
ones, yet are true ones, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
belong to him;) it follows,
that we <hi>are</hi> truly <hi>him</hi> in some
sort, when by the Exercise of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
we attend to the thought of
Him, or address to Him. And
thus much is common to all Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
that have Faith: And, were
there no more but thus much, 'tis
enough to ground this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of St. <hi>Leo. Agnosce, O Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiane,
dignitatem tuam, et Divinae
consors factus naturae noli in vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
vilitatem degeneri conversatione
redire: Acknowledge, O Christian,
thy own dignity, and being made
partaker of the Divine nature, do
not debase thy self by degenerate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35990:71"/>
into thy former Vileness.</hi> But
<hi>Prayer</hi> adds an incomparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the common Advantage
of Faith. For, the same Reason
which proves that we partake the
Divine Nature by thinking on it,
or conceiving it, concludes also
that the more perfect our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God is, the more perfectly we
become Him, &amp; approach to Glory;
which is the reason why some pure
and Elevated Souls by cultivating
Faith through continual Prayer,
come to gain so sublime an <hi>Idea</hi> of
the Divine Nature, that they fall
into Transports of Admiration;
and, when they return to their
customary way of thinking, the
memory of it is so precious to
them, that they look upon that
ravishing state as on a kind of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Heaven, and seem to have
been so happy that they could wish
no more. Now, 'tis only Prayer
that gives the Soul this high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35990:72"/>
For, by often applying the
mind to God, we discover more of
the Divine Excellencies; which
gains to the Soul a <hi>purer</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi>
manner of Understanding <hi>how</hi>
and <hi>what</hi> he is in himself. And the
like may be said of all the other
mysteries of our Faith, according
to the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> as 'tis render'd
by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> c. 7. v. 9. <hi>Nisi
credideritis non intelligetis: Unless
you will beleeve, you will never Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</hi>
So that meer Belief
must go before to give us Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Objects; and then
from a firm Belief, cultivated as it
ought, follows a more <hi>penetrative
Knowledge,</hi> call'd a <hi>Lively Faith,</hi>
to which we are wrought up by
Prayer; which is a studious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Mind to those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that depure the <hi>Idea</hi> of God
from all Dross of Imperfection,
and render it far more Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
Empyreal, and ravishingly
Glorious.</p>

               <head type="sub">A fourth Excellency of
Prayer, in Uniting us
to God Affectively.</head>
               <p>FRom this more penetrative
Knowledge of the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
immediately and necessarily
follows that disposition of the Will
call'd <hi>Divine Love;</hi> or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>Love</hi> of God or Creatures is
nothing but a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their
Goodness render'd express in our
thoughts; either imprinted strongly
by solid and well built-Judgments
of their Agreeableness to us, or else
by frequently-repeated thoughts, as
by so many dints, beat out into an
expresness. For we experience in
our selves, both in loving Creatures,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35990:73"/>
and in loving Heaven, that if we
more fully and lively <hi>conceit</hi> the
good in one (Creatures for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
than the good in the other,
(that is, in Heaven) we still chuse
and pursue Creatures, even though
we speculatively judg that Heaven
is incomparably more Excellent.
And the reason is, because a more
lively <hi>Conceit, hîc et nunc,</hi> or in
these present circumstances, that
the former is more agreeable to us,
taking us as we are thus dispos'd,
renders the Soul more Operative
for it; which Active Disposition
of the Mind to pursue any thing it
judges agreeable or <hi>Good,</hi> we use to
call <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. Whence again are seen two
considerable advantages in Prayer,
in which also the sum of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life is contain'd; <hi>viz.</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a fervent and hearty Love of
God in our hearts, and to enable
us to over-come all Temptations;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35990:73"/>
both which are perform'd by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the Goods of
the other Life very <hi>Lively,</hi> and, as
it were, <hi>Bright</hi> in our minds: for,
this done, they will be sure to work
Love of Heaven above all things
in our Hearts, if they be not that
very Love it self; which will efface,
or at least dim with their far more
resplendent Lustre, the gay appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of false and transitory goods,
and so preserve the Soul from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deluded by her three spiritual
Enemies. For which Reason
they that are in Temptations are
as much bound in Conscience to
apply themselves to Prayer, as a
man in danger to lose his Life by
a distemper he feels growing upon
him, is bound to make use of such
helps as Physick assists us with;
nay rather much more, according
as the greater concern of the
thing, and the greater Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the success and Cure, are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35990:74"/>
more powerful motives to make
them act and endeavour to seek a
remedy.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Now the Love of Heaven
being thus wrought in our minds
by Prayer, and Love being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Soul to the Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
according to the common
saying dictated by our natural
thoughts, that, <hi>if two love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they are all one,</hi> 'tis farther
discover'd how incomparably Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dignifies and ennobles the Soul;
&amp; this to a great degree beyond what
meer knowledg, that is, knowledge
staying in speculation, and not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
efficacious by considerative
Prayer could have effected. If then
every Power receives a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Nobleness in proportion
to the Object it is employ'd about;
Nay, if in our case it becomes <hi>It</hi>
intellectually, and be in a more
intimate manner united to it by
Love, and the Object of the Soul,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35990:74"/>
while in Prayer, is Gods own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Essence, it follows that,
Prayer, which being at once <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious</hi>
and <hi>Affective,</hi> performs both
these, advances a Soul to so high a
Pitch of Dignity, that not all the
Potentates of the Earth, and
Learning of the Wise, nor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of both the Indies conspiring
together, no not the whole innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Host of Angelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
joining all their force, can
raise her to that heighth of
Dignity, that Vicinity to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature as Prayer can do.
Who then that loves true Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the solid Perfection of
his Soul, but will apply himself
to the means of gaining so high
Preferment? And how strangely
is the indevout part of the World
Frantick, who look upon Prayer
as an idle Bigottery and Fruitless
Entertainment of our mind in
aiery conceits, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35990:75"/>
Effect or Benefit?</p>
               <p>§. 4. For the same Reason a
Soul unimploy'd in Prayer, and
so unconcern'd to frame lively
<hi>Idea's</hi> of the goodness of Heaven's
blissful State, that is, how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
and ennobling an Object
Gods Essence is, but makes some
Creature the study of its Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
Thoughts, and first Love of
its Will, becomes that Creature,
though never so base, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and never advances high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
She is Married as it were, to
that mean Object by her giving it
her Love, and is debased or rais'd
to that degree of Vileness or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as is found in the thing to
which she is Espous'd; if it be <hi>Earth,</hi>
she is <hi>Earthy;</hi> if it be <hi>Flesh,</hi> she is
<hi>Carnal;</hi> if <hi>Money,</hi> she is no more
worth than <hi>shining dirt</hi> is; if <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
she is <hi>Empty</hi> and <hi>Aiery.</hi>
And justly too, since she had the
means to advance her self by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35990:75"/>
and rather chose to ly grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the ground, and wallow in
the dirt, than raise her head by it
to the Glorious Fountain of all
true Excellency.</p>
               <p>§. 5. From what is said, may be
collected also, What advantage
accrues to Souls by their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Angels and Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
First, they that intend to
benefit themselves by this way,
ought to frame in their thoughts
a most exact <hi>Idea</hi> of the holy and
happy state the Blessed enjoy;
how full of Conformity to Gods
Will, and thence how not only
Inclinable, but unchangeably fixt
to follow Right Reason, and act
according to Highest Virtue in all
things; how boundlessly their
Souls are enlarg'd by Charity to
embrace all the World, and wish
them from their Hearts, and unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiously
all the goods they see
they can possibly be capable of,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35990:76"/>
even though they see it will be
greater than their own; How their
Understanding Power is replenish'd,
with a most Incomparable Glory,
or surrounded with Rays of most
pure and most bright Light of
Knowledge, and, their Wills most
indissolubly united with, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merst
most intimately in the
boundless Ocean of all Goodness.
By which means those happy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
become Deify'd or rais'd to
such a Dignity that all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the World put together
are empty beggery and worthless
trash in comparison of that noble
and close Relation to the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or (which is more) Union with
it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Particularly of the Saints, it
is fit devout persons first chuse those
whose state here was agreeable to
their own, to some degree; then,
attentively read their Lives, sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
writ; regarding more their solid
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35990:76"/>
virtues proposed there to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
than the <hi>Esclat</hi> of their
Miracles, which are but the likely
signes of true goodness, and need
an eminent and constantly practised
Virtue, accompanying them, to make
them such; since the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miracles, Prophesying and the
like, has been granted even to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
on some occasions, as St.
<hi>Hierom</hi> and the Fathers inform us.
Having thus gain'd a lively Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the particular Spirit that
such a Saint has, if we cultivate it
in our minds with a high Esteem
of it, and of the Saint as endow'd
with such and such Virtues, and so
let it sink into our Wills, and grow
a desire to attain it, and all this be
heighten'd and made more lively
and more Efficacious by applying
to the Saint himself by Prayer, or
invoking him to obtain of God's
Goodness that portion of his virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spirit, which he sees fitting
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35990:77"/>
for us, we shall at length be wrought
up (an endeavour to imitate him
going along) into the very <hi>genius</hi>
of that Saint, and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>him,</hi> and make <hi>his</hi> Merits <hi>ours:</hi>
not by Extrinsecal Imputation, as
if because we daily ask't Virtue
for the Saints sake, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
disposition on our part, they
are shar'd out to us, and as it were
extrinsecally apply'd to our Wills,
and so better our interiour; Let
none flatter themselves with such
Hopes, for Catholick Faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no Extrinsecal Imputation of
Christ's Merits, much less of those
of the Saints: But, this is perform'd
by proposing their Virtuous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as an Object, which by being
penetrated lively, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
heartily, makes us become
like the Saint himself, that is <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi>
And this, because 'tis the
very Nature of the Soul to become
that thing by her Understanding
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35990:77"/>
and Will which it studiously knows
and affectionately loves; and in
that very regard too, and to that
degree in which we apply our selves
considerately to know it and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to love it. But this will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be understood by what follows
after.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Hence also is seen the true
use of <hi>Pictures,</hi> keeping Holidays
of Saints, and such other Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
All which renewing in our
minds the thoughts of such a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
person must needs be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial;
since they purify our mind
by familiarizing it to such holy and
Elevated Objects, and by helping
it to make the Character of the
Saints virtuous life, and of it's
particular agreeableness to us, more
express; till at length, by Will and
Affection as well as by meer Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
we become in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>It.</hi> But especially these helps
are necessary to those who arrive
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35990:78"/>
not at the Love of spiritual Goods,
by strength of Judgment or clear
Evidence of Reason, but by often
reiterated impressions of Objects
upon the knowing Power by
means of the Senses. I meddle not
here with other more wonderful
Effects done by our Application to
Saints and their Intercession for us
when the Faith of him that prays
requires it; the Principles of which
are to be laid so deep, and are
withal so remote from our present
purpose, that it would be too long
a digression to attempt here their
Explication.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">

               <p>THe Impetrative Part of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or the virtue it has of
obtaining from God infallibly what
ever we ask for our selves, that
we can be sure is our true Good,
is perhaps as great an incentive to
exercise it as any of the rest.
This seems to be a Doctrine no
less comfortable than strange.
We ought then to unriddle it, and
make it out. And, first, we must
remark, that we can never be sure
that any External thing is good
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35990:79"/>
for us; be it Riches, Honour,
Pleasure, Health, Friends, &amp;c.
For, to many, all these have been
the occasion of their Damnation,
as they have of Salvation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Nay, some are of that
<hi>Genius</hi> and so circumstanc't, that
nothing but Extream Misery in this
World can keep them from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
others again are so temper'd,
that they grow desperate by great
and continual crosses, and fall into
a stupidity or disregard of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
if prest heavily by afflictions:
Nay more, speaking of <hi>Interiour</hi>
perfections, which have a greater
vicinity to Virtue, even <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
has made some <hi>solidly Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
others <hi>vainly Proud.</hi> Nothing
therfore, but that perfection of the
mind call'd <hi>Virtue,</hi> is securely good
for us. Since then 'tis directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Reason to wish pressingly and
absolutely those things which we
know not whether they will do us
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35990:79"/>
good or harm; Reason tells us we
are not to beg of God <hi>absolutely</hi>
any thing but <hi>Virtue:</hi> The rest
only <hi>Conditionally,</hi> or with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
<hi>in case our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
judges we have need of them,
or, in case he sees them convenient
for us.</hi> And 'tis of <hi>this</hi> I affirm,
that if it be askt of God by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
it will be <hi>always Granted,</hi> and
that too to the <hi>very same</hi> degree as
is our fervency in asking it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. To understand how this
is effected, we must reflect that,
to <hi>Pray</hi> for any Virtue, is earnestly
to <hi>wish</hi> it; as also that Prayer, if
perform'd attentively and as it
ought, is the most Serious action of
our whole life, being a Treaty
or Communication with God; the
seer of our Hearts, with whom 'tis
the most irreverent folly that may
be not to be in earnest, when we
profess it outwardly. Prayer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for Virtue is the <hi>most serious</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:35990:80"/>
and <hi>most effectual</hi> act of the <hi>Will</hi>
imaginable, strongly set and bent
towards the attainment of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
we pray for; that is, 'tis a
frequent and hearty wish of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And what is Virtue, but a
confirm'd Disposition of the <hi>Will</hi>
to do our Duties to God and Man?
or an <hi>habitual will</hi> to act according
to Right Reason and Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?
And how are <hi>Habits</hi> got,
but by oft repeated or very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>Acts?</hi> since then, when ever
we pray for Virtue as we ought,
<hi>both these</hi> are found in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of that Prayer (for, we both
<hi>repeat often</hi> our Wishes, which are
<hi>Acts</hi> of our <hi>Will,</hi> and withall
they are the <hi>most serious, most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
and <hi>most Elevated</hi> Acts that
can be, and thence very <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>):
it follows, that the <hi>Praying</hi>
for Virtue is the very <hi>gaining</hi> it;
in the same manner as warming
continued and advanc't begetts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35990:80"/>
Heat; and Heat, a Flame.</p>
               <p>§. 3. You will say, all this
gives no great account of any
Particularity in Prayer, towards
the attainment of Virtue; since,
according to this Doctrin, the
frequent considering with our
selves, and pondering well the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Virtue may beget
<hi>Wishes</hi> of it, and consequently
Virtue in us; and this in as high
a manner, if well followed, as
Prayer does. I answer first, the
case is impossible; for, except,
when we wish to get Virtue, we
aim at Heaven by thus wishing it;
'tis not true Virtue we wish, but
some Apish resemblance of it, to
make us esteem'd by the world,
or for some other Temporal End:
And, if, in setting our selvs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it's Goodness and Excellency
(which consists in this, that it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
us for Heaven) and thence
wishing it, we aim'd at the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35990:81"/>
of Heaven, or the Blissful Sight
of God by it, we were in prayer
all the while we wisht it, after some
manner; though perhaps there went
not along with it the Addressive
part to God by way of Petition;
which yet, 'tis very hard should be
wanting in those who habitually
know by Faith, and by Christian
Language and Practice are inur'd
to acknowledge, that all Goods,
especially Supernatural ones, come
from God.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Next I answer, that there
is no doubt, but a true <hi>Sight</hi> of
the excellency and utility of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
improv'd by our consideration,
may cause some degrees of Wishes
or Desires of it, and so beget Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
at first, or advance it something:
But, that all those means are dry
and inefficacious without Prayer,
will appear by the Advantages
found in Prayer. As First, that
while our thoughts are set upon him
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35990:81"/>
who is our last End, we take our
aim more steadily at the means by
which we are to attain him. 2ly. Faith,
which we suppose to go before
Prayer, telling us all comes from
him, it heightens our Soul, and
consequently Fancy, far above
that pitch to which Natural and
Unelevated thoughts could have
rais'd them. 3ly. Faith telling us
also he is the Fountain of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
the very Approach to him by
Prayer and begging it of him is
the <hi>drawing</hi> it into our selvs, from
his Inexhaustible Treasures of all
Good. 4ly. Faith, telling us he has
promis'd to hear our prayers which
are made according to his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will, and that prayers for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
are such, makes us firmly <hi>hope,</hi>
out petition will be granted: and
a Hope thus rais'd, renders our wish
of it far more efficacious; as we
experience passes in our selvs in
other matters, when we are assur'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35990:82"/>
of getting them, and, as it were
just upon the point of attaining
them. This Hope also fixes and
comforts our Thoughts in confidence
of having <hi>already</hi> gain'd <hi>some,</hi> and
of attaining yet <hi>more;</hi> by which
means they are kept up and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in the pursuit of what we ask
for, and relapse not into a stupid
want of expectation. 5ly, While
out minds are more rais'd by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to an ardent <hi>Love of God,</hi> our
Will is proportionably rais'd to a
more fervent <hi>wish of Virtue,</hi> which
is already known to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means to attain him; In the
same manner as one, who knows
certainly a Treasure is hid in such
a place, and is his if he will go
for it, is very prompt to <hi>wish,</hi> nay
resolute to <hi>get</hi> and use <hi>means</hi> to
obtain it: Whereas on the other
side, that is, when our thoughts
are not made lively by Prayer,
the thoughts of Heaven being so
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35990:82"/>
distant and hard to be represented
by fancy, it seems but a kind of
dry speculation, and dull in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.
6ly, Since, as was said, the
nature of our soul is such, that,
to know any thing what ever, is
to have that very thing in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and that, Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
this Knowledg to a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
or expresness, it becomes
Active to obtain it, or which is all
one, it becomes Will; it follows
that, by much and lively think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conceiting the Goodness
of Virtue, we arrive to have it in
our Will: I mean, we have in
our Will <hi>a Disposition to Act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to right Reason inform'd by
Faith,</hi> that is indeed, we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<hi>Virtue;</hi> this being its very
Nature and Definition. Lastly,
since, as was shown before, by
Prayer the Soul is to some degree (<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi>
indeed, but yet <hi>truly</hi>) Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
or made one with God, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35990:83"/>
is, with him who <hi>includes</hi> Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
all Virtues, or rather <hi>is</hi>
those very Virtues <hi>Essentially:</hi> it
follows necessarily, that the soul
addicted to <hi>Prayer,</hi> especially
when she Prays <hi>knowingly,</hi> and
thence raises her self to <hi>Love,</hi>
must have <hi>all Virtues</hi> in her; nay,
<hi>be</hi> those very Virtues, according
as her pitch of Love of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
her, and her present state
in this life will permit her.</p>
               <p>§. 10. From this Doctrine we
may draw these Consequences:
First, that, though we ought to pray
for Temporal Goods always with
resignation and conditionally, there
is no need of adding either of
these cautions when we pray for
<hi>Virtue,</hi> but we may wish it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
without any measure or
stint; since we are sure 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of it self agreeable to
Gods Will, and our own true
Good; in asking <hi>or</hi> desiring which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35990:83"/>
God's Goodness has limited no
Man.—You'l say then, one may
wish as high a Pitch of Virtue,
as the greatest Saints had; nay,
that of our Blessed <hi>Lady</hi> her self.
'Tis answer'd; Since the <hi>means</hi>
to arrive at so high a Degree of
Virtue as others, is to wish it <hi>with</hi>
as pure an Intention, and as <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently</hi>
as they do? none is to
wish the <hi>End,</hi> without the proper
<hi>means</hi> to it; but to labour all
they can to put the <hi>means;</hi> that
is, to gain a <hi>fervent</hi> desire of it
from God (by <hi>Prayer,</hi> qualify'd
according to all the Particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-said)
as that of those Saints
was; and then, they may be sure
'tis absolutely God's Will, both as
Author of Nature and Super-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,
that Effects should spring out
of Proper Causes, and Immediate
Dispositions. Nay, we know this
with a greater Assurance, than that
any Effect of Nature will succeed:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35990:84"/>
For example, Fire burn, or Rain
wet: For, it becomes God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sometimes, to alter the Course
of Nature miraculously for higher
Ends, even when Natural Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are ready, and require to
produce Natural Effects; but, it
can never consist with his sweetest
Goodness, to hinder those from
having Virtue, who are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispos'd for it. Whether those
that pray, shall attain an Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Disposition to so high a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
as those had, is another Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
But, it is certain, God has
laid no Commands upon any, to
deterr him from doing his best to
attain it; but has propos'd Saints
to our imitation <hi>absolutely,</hi> and
not <hi>to a Degree</hi> only: For, as the
saying is, He that aims at the
Sun, though he be sure he shall
never his his Mark, yet he will
shoot higher than he that aims on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at a Bush. But, how high Steps
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35990:84"/>
every particular Soul ought to take
at once, belongs to Super-natural
Prudence, and Discretion of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
and therefore, 'tis the proper
Office of a Wise <hi>Ghostly-Father,</hi>
to determin it: And his only Care
must be, to be sure the Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
still by Immediate Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for otherwise, the taking
great Leaps at once in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Progress, generally strains
the Connaturality of <hi>Devotion,</hi>
and ends in <hi>Indevotion</hi> or <hi>Sloth.</hi>
In a word, Let him that prayes,
be only attentive to ask Virtue of
God, with as much Fervency as
he will; and then, leave the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to Him who is a Faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser,
and a full Rewarder.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is so great, let him that
Prayes ask his true and certain
Good, <hi>Virtue,</hi> without any <hi>wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
or <hi>doubting;</hi> but with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Confidence in God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35990:85"/>
or Mercy: For, can we be
surer of any thing, than that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
shall not hinder the Effect,
if we put the Immediate Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to it by Prayer? And this
Security we have of attaining Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
if we pray for it fervently, and
as we ought.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The same Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is of the Effect, if one
Prays for the Forgiveness of his
Sins: For, Prayer being a hearty
Wish of what we pray for, made
Fervent by those Advantages we
have above enumerated; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that it moulds (as it were)
and frames the Soul into an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and resolute Will of forsaking
Sin, and warms it with Affection
to her true Good. But, great
Care must be had of praying God
to pardon our Sins, while yet our
Wills are ty'd fast to the sinful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
For, that were to require
of Him to do more than Miracle:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35990:85"/>
Love of God alone finally, or the
Holy-Ghost in their Hearts, being
the only <hi>Remission</hi> of Sins; and
the Love of any Creature, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than in order to that Love,
being the proper Notion of <hi>Sin:</hi>
So that, as impossible as it is, that
we should Love God alone finally,
and a Creature above, or not in
order to him, both at once, (which
is no less than a direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction);
so impossible it is, that
Sin should be pardon'd, till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Affection be taken from
the Objects of it.</p>
               <p>13. But, what shall those poor
Sinners do, who have not a Will
to leave Sin; or at least, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Will; as was St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s
Case before his Conversion, which
he so complainingly descants upon
in his <hi>Confessions?</hi> I answer, They
must still take the same Method;
that is, strive by continual Prayer,
(made after that weak manner, at
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35990:86"/>
least, as they are able) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
those Imperfect Wills, into
Perfect Ones; and, groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Slavery they now fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
at once sigh and tremble
before their justly offended God:
Which kind of Exercise in this
case, is more profitable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for them to use, than Love
of God; of which their Hearts,
yet full of Filth, are at present
uncapable. Yet, their utmost In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
must be imploy'd, by Faith
and some Degree of Hope, (which
are here the only Acters) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and advance these good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Graces of the Holy-Ghost,
not yet <hi>within</hi> them, but
only <hi>moving</hi> them to towards that
Grace, by which the same Holy-Ghost
enters into their Heart, and
<hi>inhabits</hi> there. The hardest strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
is at first, till the Scales begin
to turn; which done, all is easie
to us, if we pursue our Victory.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35990:86"/>
But, for those who are in this State,
it were very fit that Mortification
went along with Prayer; to wean,
deterr, and divert the Soul from the
noxious Gust she took in sinful
Objects.</p>
               <p>14. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We may hence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Wise Methods, and
Matchless Bounty of our good God,
in alluring us by so many Motives
to apply to him by Prayer, that
so we may arrive at true Happiness;
and giving us, by the very asking,
(that is, as soon as ever we ask)
all that is our certain and true
Good, or all we can, according
to right Reason, heartily beg of
him. You'l say, It will follow
hence, that if one immediately ask
Heaven, he shall have it. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That this were the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of fond Petition, but far more
highly unreasonable, as to ask the
Virtue of our Lady or the Apostles,
without thinking of putting first
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35990:87"/>
the Immediate Disposition to have
it: which is to press God to do a
Miracle for our sakes; a thing true
Humility &amp; Reverence, the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
to a rightly made Prayer, will
scarce allow. And, so, still our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principle remains firm to us, that
we shall be sure to obtain what
we pray for, when we ask for our
true Good, so we ask as we ought.
Now, the Immediate Disposition
to Heaven being <hi>Love of God,</hi> if
we pray for the Means, we shall
be sure both to obtain This, and
Heaven too, which is our End, by
it: Which secures to us the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of our Prayer, or the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of our Wishes; though
it come not to us after our own
foolish manner, but according to
the Method our infinitly Wise
God has appointed; that is, that
all things even in Super-naturals,
(except in some few Cases) be
carryed forwards from Connatural
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35990:87"/>
Causes or Dispositions to proper
Effects. Which Consequence of
the Effects out of their proper
Causes, is the true meaning of the
Word <hi>Merit</hi> (so misrepresented
by our Adversaries); only super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding,
That God has <hi>promis'd</hi> this
certain Effect shall follow, and
that the Generality of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Work out of that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or out of a Relyance on
God's <hi>Promises,</hi> without knowing
(perhaps) <hi>how</hi> this Promise is
brought about, or <hi>perform'd</hi> to us:
Which, yet, when known by those
who are capable of understanding
it, must needs add a strange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Comfort, and an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Courage to employ themselves
in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Whence may be easily Collected,
that I only concern my self with
that kind of Impetrative Virtue,
by which rightly made Prayer
obtains certainly of God our true
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35990:88"/>
Spiritual Good; that by shewing
the <hi>Connatural Efficacy</hi> of it, and
with how necessary a Consequence
the Attainment of Virtue springs
from it: I may excite my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
to pursue that best Duty;
and withal, by the way, instruct
them how to perform it. What
other Virtue Prayer has, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
many things of God for
our selves, and our Neighbour,
by obliging his infinit Goodness
and Wisdom in his Government of
the World, so to contrive and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Things, that not one Prayer
of the Just be left unavailable,
as far as can possibly consist with
the common Good of the Universe;
nay, even so far as, if the Prayer
be made with a perfect Faith,
Confidence and firm Relyance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, to alter the Course of
Nature by Miracle, for such a
Prayer's sake: Of these, I say, it
is not my purpose to treat at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35990:88"/>
it being out of my Road,
as depending on Principles, which
ly very remote from my present
Design; as was said formerly, in
a like Case, concerning Prayer to
Saints, at the End of the <hi>Fourth
Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall end this Discourse with
those most expressive Words of
St. <hi>James: If any one wants Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
let him ask of God, who gives
to all abundantly, and without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and it shall be given him.
But, let him ask in Faith, nothing
doubting: For, he that doubts is
like a Wave of the Sea, which is
mov'd and tost about by the Wind.
Let not, then, such a Man think,
that he shall obtain any thing of
our Lord.</hi> Where we are to note,
first, that by <hi>Wisdom</hi> is not meant
Speculative Knowledge; but that
Wisdom, which is our certain and
true <hi>Spiritual</hi> Good; and of which,
the <hi>Fear</hi> of God is the <hi>Beginning,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:35990:89"/>
as the <hi>Love of God</hi> is its Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
or <hi>Perfection.</hi> Next, he
assures us, <hi>It shall be given,</hi> and
that without <hi>grudging,</hi> or upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any, that they have receiv'd
enough already; but <hi>abundantly,</hi>
without stint, so they dispose
themselves by Prayer to receive it.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> He puts the Disposition
to receive it, to be a firm Hope,
<hi>Faith,</hi> or Confidence in God's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-flowing
Goodness; which is
strengthen'd by knowing that what
we ask, is agreeable to his Holy
Will. <hi>Lastly,</hi> He declares, that
the want of this Confidence in
asking, renders our whole Prayer
<hi>ineffectual:</hi> For, the Wish cannot
be strong and efficacious, to work
the Soul into a hearty and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Love of God, if it be held
before-hand (as it ought), that it
cannot be had without God's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and the Asker thinks that,
let him ask Virtue how he will,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35990:89"/>
it is yet an obscure kind of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
lying in God's Breast, and
depending on his meer Will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will please to give him any
Virtue or no; and that, let him
pray for it how he will, there are
yet no determinate or certain Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
laid in the Course of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Providence to attain it;
and thence comes to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he shall ever obtain any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
or none at all, which is very
uncomfortable. Whereas, were it
known, and well penetrated, that
God's Will is already, as to that
Point, determined by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
governing and promoting
Souls by Prayer to Virtue, and
by Virtue to Heaven, as by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Dispositions to those Effects
(according to that Saying of the
Psalmist: <hi>They shall rise from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to Virtue, till they see the God
of Gods in</hi> Sion): Also, were it
known and consider'd, that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wavering
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35990:90"/>
(and, thence, efficacious)
Prayer or Wish, strengthen'd by
directing it to God, is the proper
Disposition or Means effectually,
and necessarily (as we may say)
to gain Virtue: It will become
impossible, to want Courage to
ask it heartily, and absolutely; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
to waver or want Assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in our asking it; impossible, our
Wishes of it should not become an
Efficacious Means to obtain it:
Lastly, impossible, we should not
obtain what we ask.</p>
