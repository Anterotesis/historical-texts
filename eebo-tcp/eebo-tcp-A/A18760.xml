            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S custome and continuaunce of tyme, bredes a lawe in Nature, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uertes mannes mynde to many a laudable excercise, so moste honourable, the good will of men is neuer vnoccupied, if either honest labour, or stdious diligence, maie please those greate personages, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and duetie commaundes vs to honor. And as it hath bin (through tyme out of mynde) an auncient maner in the beginnyng of a newe yere, to present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to freendes (and sutche as we beste fauour) some signe of freendshipp by waie of newe yeres giftes: so I trust the maner so mutche commended emong the wise, and so long vsed with all sortes of people, (for the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng of good liking) shall excuse my ouer greate bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and make my simple gifte accepted. For as I vnderstande, and my betters farre haue reported, it is not the valewe of the presentes, nor the ritchnesse
<pb facs="tcp:5305:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Iewels that makes our giftes welcome, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the giuer in the good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worthies in this worlde: but it is the vertuous intent of the minde, that maketh free passage to that whiche is presented, and causeth as well little trifles to bee estemed, as greate treasure to bee made of. If otherwise the worthinesse of thynges were to be iudged, my triflyng booke might blushe in my behalfe: and the vaine verses therein would rather argue my disgrace, then further my good fame. And therefore my good Lorde, since euery mans gift is receiued &amp; waied, accordyng to the good will of the giuer: I haue this present new yeres daie, presented vnto your good Lordshipp good Chaunce, and so with this good Chaunce salutyng your honor, (with all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisable dueties,) I honor your Lordshipps vertues, &amp; procede to the purpose of my matter. The people of this worlde (whose sondrie wittes and iudgementes, lookes deepely into the deuises of the writers in our age) if thei would straitly and narrowly beholde, how busie I haue bin in settyng out bookes (and printyng of pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fletts) might paraduenture make a wonder of my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risome woorkes, for that many woordes hath bin spent to little profite, either of my Countrey, or commoditie to my self, because my small learnyng and capacitie, could neuer reche to any greate knowledge, nor searche out the ground of any profounde seeret or science. But
<pb facs="tcp:5305:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how so euer my woorkes maie bee construed, my penne hath kept me from slothe and Idelnesse, and little hath bin loste by my studie and labors. For freendes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourars hath bin gotten through diligence: and tyme hath bin entertained in muche contentation of minde. And though it was my Chaunce to light on a pleasant disposition in making of verses: (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others happened by Fortunes election on a multitude of benifites,) yet blessed is the Chaunce that breedeth merrie thoughtes, and vnlodes the harte and hedde of a nomber of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie cogitations. For though small abilitie &amp; simple cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, bryngeth no greate reputation and credite: yet it sitteth free from the bitter blaste of Fortunes tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes. VVhen the mindes of the mightie are shocked, and shaken with the blusteryng stormes of worldes vnsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse. And though my Chaunce was to trauaill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade to seeke after Fortune, whiles others at home found themselues happie: yet beyng so smally prefarred by Chaunce euery where, I am neither troubled with her mutabilitie, nor driuen to giue her thankes, for any good tourne she hath doen me. And yet my Chaunce is indifferent, that bothe in warres and peace (possessyng my little portion) I haue seen thousandes depart from this worlde, and sodainly taken from their abondance. My chance is to be in court well knowen, and mutche made of, though smally considered or aduaunced. My
<pb facs="tcp:5305:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chaunce is to liue awhile and write Epitaphes, Sonets and sedules on many a worthie personage: whiles my life and footesteps, drawes the bodie to his long home, and leades the restlesse daies to the quiet graue. And so as Chance hath fallen out, and alotted me by a bond of causes (through the originall &amp; ground of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) the pleasure of penne and the pain of studie, euen so in like maner I gladly plaie out my part on the stage in this toilesome, and tragicall pilgrimage, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng easeth our labours so mutche, as the sweete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of minde. But to what purpose trouble I your honourable iudgement and grauitie, with the rehersall of trifles, or why doeth rashenesse in so bolde a maner, dedicate sutche a woorke (scarce worthie the looking on) to sutche a worthie Magistrate, whose wisedome maie disdaine the reading of so simple a discourse. The trothe is my right good Lorde, this present is offered as a peece of a meane, to passe awaie the tyme, amid great affaires, and weightie causes, whiche with light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters findes recreation, &amp; by the inuention of pretie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised sportes: the studie and care of commonweale, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth lesse tedius and troublesome. For the minde wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ouer long labours, and sadde motions of the spirite (that through continuaunce, maie dull the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) is sharpened and made better at commaundement, when chaunge of pastymes, with some pleasaunt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
<pb facs="tcp:5305:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath eased the bodie, and refreshed the memorie: My verses God wot, are voide of sutche deuine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And I wantyng the grace of Mercurie, or Pipe of Appollo, presumeth to farre to please the eares of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua, with the rashe sounde of rusticall Musicke. But though the harmonie be not so sweete and delicate, as is to be wished, the desire to doe well, is the instrument onely, that maie bryng suche delite, whiche maie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer purchace good acceptation. And for that to the art of Musicke and harmonie, belongeth seuerall sortes of partes, to make good concordance, I haue tuned all my notes and songes worthie the hearyng, into one kind of voice and order. Meanyng that where many a peece of descant is to bee seen (and some iarres maie happen by misliking of discordes) yet a nomber of partes soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng together, maie couer the faultes and imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of an ignoraunt Musition. And because in the sweete soile of Salop (in whiche parties your Lordshippe was nourished) whiche seate I honour of nature, and toke some sauor and taste of Science in, the gladder are my muses to reuerence with verses, a speciall sparke and spectacle of the countrey I was borne in, either with Musicall melodie, or Poeticall pastymes and passages, delated for pleasure and delite, and dedicated where I desire my duetifull good will maie be embraced. The matters I treate of, are written of sutche sondrie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb facs="tcp:5305:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and subiectes, that thei are more to be redd for the varietie of woordes, then for the goodnesse of the verses: and the cause why and wherefore I dedicate sutche a matter to your Lordship, is for that I would be sorie that my daies and yeres should bee spent, with the losse of tyme, and that my labour and studie well ment, should be forgotten and caste in a corner, for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the printing. The strange motions and maner of the writyng showes nothyng but the nature of mans fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that neuer continueth in one kinds of consait. The occasions of so many seuerall discourses, rose but on the innumerable deuises of the hed, that euer in one pointe or other, by imagination is occupied. And the whole somme and substance of that whiche is written, is but to publish to the worlde, that ill is better to be meanely exercised in honest pastymes, then basely bent and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to barraine slothe and Idelnesse. Thus trustyng your good Lordship will take in good part, a part of the portion that from the heauens is giuen me: I presente vnto your handes this newe yere, some of mine old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors &amp; studies, Printed al bound in one newe volume, for sutche as pleases to buye them. And so as beste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth me (and duetie commaundes) I remaine a well willer to your honour duryng my life, moste willyngly at commaundemente.</p>

               <l>to waile the want at full:</l>
               <l>My witts are weake, my words but bare</l>
               <l>my penne but base and dull.</l>
               <l>To frame in forme and stately stile,</l>
               <l>the lines I ought to write:</l>
               <l>I finde my muse orecome with cares,</l>
               <l>my reason banishe quite.</l>
               <l>My hedde so fraught with cold conceits, of newes I knowe full well:</l>
               <l>That I had rather crie and rore, and shrillie houle and yell.</l>
               <l>Then treate of dreadfull deaths despite, who daiely doeth deuoure:</l>
               <l>The noblest fruits of Natures mould, and pluckes the purest flowre.</l>
               <l>Death neither looks on mens renowne, nor who maie best be spard:</l>
               <l>But like a Theef stealls life awaie, and striks without regard.</l>
               <l>Not takyng those that vertue wants, and fills the worlde with vice:</l>
               <l>But snapps vp suche that people praise, &amp; worlde holds moste in price.</l>
               <l>As loe of late to well was seen, when <hi>Paulet</hi> left his life:</l>
               <l>Forsooke his freends, desired the graue, and went from worthy wife:</l>
               <l>To liue and lodge in loftie Skies, where blessed angells are:</l>
               <l>And good mens souls doe suretie finde, and rest from worldly care.</l>
               <l>No maruell though our troubled sprits, doe make a swete exchange:</l>
               <l>And leaues this sowre and bitter soile (and will some cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge.)</l>
               <l>To goe where Gods in glorie sitts, and where our home must bee:</l>
               <l>Yet in my mynde suche partyng is, a wonder greate to see.</l>
               <l>When men by toile and labour long, haue purchast suche a praise:</l>
               <l>Attainde to wealth and honour bothe (through seruice sondrie waies.)</l>
               <l>And on the suddaine leaue these pomps, and pleasures here possest:</l>
               <l>As did this knight of whom I spake, who bore about in brest.</l>
               <l>A noble harte a constant mynde, a iollie courage greate:</l>
               <l>A warme good will to common wealth, that neuer wanted heate.</l>
               <l>Brought vp in armes and Marciall feats, a maister of that arte:</l>
               <l>Whiche oft in feeld and countreis cause, did plaie a manly parte.</l>
               <l>As birth was good and noble sure, so all he went about:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5305:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Was good and worthie eurie waie, and noble still throughout.</l>
               <l>In office oft, and by his Prince, to credite called still:</l>
               <l>In matters graue and thyngs of weight, of deepe foresight and skill.</l>
               <l>No talker of good Fortune won, nor boster for vaine bruite:</l>
               <l>A tree that seldome blossomde showd, &amp; yet brought forth good fruite</l>
               <l>As calme and milde as Sommer winds, that neuer water moues:</l>
               <l>And yet as stout to cruell Rites, as gentill with the Doues.</l>
               <l>A bodie apte to beare the brunt, of paines and labour long:</l>
               <l>A hedde that could conceiue the beste, and sone could put vp wrong.</l>
               <l>A freende that vsde no fained phrase, and surely one of those:</l>
               <l>That dealt with parfite plainnesse so, he neuer purchaste fose.</l>
               <l>A settled rocke a staied trothe, that no deuice could staine:</l>
               <l>A <hi>Paulet</hi> yea a piller too, where <hi>Paulet</hi> did remaine.</l>
               <l>An aide to sutche as wanted helpe, a father free and franke:</l>
               <l>To those that onely for good tourns, but barely yeelded thanke.</l>
               <l>What resteth more in any man, then was in hym I saie:</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Paulet</hi> wan a noble brute, and bore the same awaie.</l>
               <l>Where vertue at the dreadfull howre, when trompet sounds a loude:</l>
               <l>(Emong the cheef and chosen Lambes,) shall sit in sacred cloude.</l>

               <l>It were but labour loste, yet how should people saile,</l>
               <l>Or ride to any coste, when hope of Gods doe faile:</l>
               <l>First proue a courage bolde, and goe to féeld and fright,</l>
               <l>If <hi>Mars</hi> his loue waxe cold, ye shalbe conquerd streight.</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Venus</hi> frounes make loue, and see what lucke ye finde,</l>
               <l>If <hi>Oelus</hi> liste not moue, in vaine ye looke for winde:</l>
               <l>So many thyngs by name, are rulde through Gods in aire,</l>
               <l>And Gods good lucke doe frame, in weather foule or faire.</l>
               <l>But Gods doe dwell so hye, and I so lowe remaine,</l>
               <l>I knowe not where to crie, nor yet to whom complaine:</l>
               <l>A greater greef I feele, a fortune somwhat strange,</l>
               <l>So swift tourns Fortunes wheele, that still the winde doeth change.</l>
               <l>When I to shipp would goe, no soner tourne I backe,</l>
               <l>But streight a gale doeth blowe, where I the winde did <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <l>In hope before I goe, the winde mill bloweth at Weste:</l>
               <l>Till then my penne shall walke, where I doe finde good will,</l>

               <head>Of one that for vertues sake honored a freend.</head>
               <l>AS freendship is a league of Loue,</l>
               <l>and showes the harte within,</l>
               <l>So some affection is the ground, wheron it doth begin</l>
               <l>And reason offreth causes why,</l>
               <l>sutche freendship breeds in thought,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:5305:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus reason is the kindly cause, that all these things hath wrought.</l>
               <l>Some hold opinion fancie works, by secret motions sweete,</l>
               <l>A meane to make the honest minde, and faithfull frendship meete:</l>
               <l>Deserts dare claime no place hereof, for where good turns haue past</l>
               <l>Small fauour comes, and world forgetts, the plain good will at last.</l>
               <l>Then reason from affection brought, must nedes the cause perswade,</l>
               <l>Wherewith the fancie workes the webbe, and so is freendship made:</l>
               <l>When man and woman is in frame, and shapt as I haue saied,</l>
               <l>Their hartes prepars a perfite place, where frendship maie be staied.</l>
               <l>Wée see eare pleasures are possest, or any profite rise,</l>
               <l>A choice or likyng knitts the knot, of freendship with the wise:</l>
               <l>The iudgement doeth election make, when all affects are blinde,</l>
               <l>And freendship triumphes in no where, but in a noble minde.</l>
               <l>It scornes to dwell with daintie freaks, that flickers here and there,</l>
               <l>And flitts as feathers doe with winde, and restes no certaine where:</l>
               <l>The worthie wights that wisely waies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weight of méere good wil,</l>
               <l>Are chéefest mansion house and seate, for worthy fréendship still.</l>
               <l>But loe a question now doeth rise, I doe demaunde to knowe,</l>
               <l>Of fréendships rule or reasons lore, whiche maie the furthest goe:</l>
               <l>First fréendship marcheth formost man, and leau's behinde the rest,</l>
               <l>Then reason comes in second rancke, and seeks to doe his best.</l>
               <l>Yet freendship is not greater sure, then reason in degree,</l>
               <l>For freendship is but very bare, where reason wants you see:</l>
               <l>When witte hath well conceiu'd a cause, by rule and reasons greate,</l>
               <l>Then frendship showes this force at full, as fire by flame shoes heate</l>
               <l>I knowe not well whiche ruleth moste, the reason that I haue,</l>
               <l>Or els the frendship that I beare, where faithe doeth frendship craue:</l>
               <l>Good reason leads my fancie forthe, affection yeelds thereto,</l>
               <l>And freendship followes on as faste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as freendship ought to doe.</l>
               <l>Thus loe my reason and my sence, in frendships league is bound:</l>
