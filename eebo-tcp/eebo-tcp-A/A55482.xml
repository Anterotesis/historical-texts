            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HER Royal Highness THE DUTCHES.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not without Fear, that I approach your Throne; esteeming it a more difficult task, to write an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Dedicatory, than to make a Play: lest, on the one hand, I should fall into the Crime of Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or on the other, slip into that, of Flattery. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, if not Impudence, seems to be intail'd on Poets; and Ambition, or rather greediness, of vain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
<pb facs="tcp:61135:3"/>
by which they would mount above others, carries them often, beyond the Limits of all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and makes them rudely press, into the presence of Greatness, and Majesty. On this Rock, I may now seem to run, and to have left my self no excuse, for daring to set your Great Name before my Poem. But, Madam, 'tis to your Goodness I must fly; and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable protection, which you afford those who want it, must shield me from the envenom'd Darts, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Detractors. They will have Veneration for your Name, and stand in awe, when they shall know you have seen, and approv'd this Play, that you have taken it into your Protection, and that it is not without your permission, I offer it to your Highness; which I do, with all the Humility I ought to have, and with all the submission, and respect I can express. There is some necessity for me, to gain so powerful a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, considering the smalness of my Merits, and the niceness of this Critical Age, in which the greatest Wits pass not without Censure, nor the most perfect pieces of humane Invention, without being carp'd at. What would have been currant Coyn, in the Ages past, will now be look'd on as debas'd Metal; and that Wit, which is esteem'd but mean, and ordinary now, would have been then accounted great, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Wit is refined, and Ingenuity made bright, not only by the Industry of Poets, and endeavours of the Learned, but by the example, of the Court, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Princes, who diffuse it like Light to all that know them; among whom your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as a Star of the first Magnitude, shines, with the
<pb facs="tcp:61135:3"/>
splendor of your Mind, and enlightens the Souls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I need not fear to be accus'd of Flattery, since you are a Theme too high, all we can say, is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, and there can be no such Figure as Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole in your description. When I consider all your excellencies, I approach you, with admiration, and am swallow'd up in the Sea of your perfections. Your Beauty, your Extraction, your Wit, Ingenuity, and acquired parts; your Goodness, Piety, Wisdom, and Generosity, with all your other Virtues, and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments; deserve each a particular Panegyric, and are large Themes, on which the greatest Wits, may exercise their Pens. But Madam, these are things too great for my undertakings, and it is now my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness only, to crave your acceptance of this Poem, which may serve for a diversion when wearied with more serious Thoughts. I have sav'd the Persian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses from the Cruelty of <hi>Roxana,</hi> but 'tis you only, Madam, that can protect them, from the greater Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Criticks, such as make it their business to find fault, with what they cannot mend, who turn the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sence into Ridicule, and Burlesque even the Vertues, and the Graces themselves. <hi>Statira</hi> flings her self at the feet of your Royal Highness, and hopes you will give her a favourable Reception, since you have extended your Favour to <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and shew'd a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kindness to that Tragedy, which has hitherto pass'd under the Name of another, whilst I was out of the Land: but, Madam, since there is so much Glory in it, to have pleas'd your Highness, and to have given satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to many Persons in the Royal Circle, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb facs="tcp:61135:4"/>
to own it, that your Royal Highness may be the more easily induc'd, to smile on this, which, with my self, I prostrate at your Feet, begging your pardon for the presumption of assuming the Title of MADAM,</p>

            <l>A rough hewn Satyr, enters first, the Stage.</l>

                     <l>'Tis by their Deaths, and by their Deaths alone,</l>
                     <l>I must preserve my life, and fix my Throne.</l>

                     <l>Is rather the effect of Hate, than fear.</l>
                     <l>You hate <hi>Statira,</hi> and would her remove,</l>
                     <l>Because she is a Rival, in your love:</l>
                     <l>She dead, your dying hopes, would then revive,</l>
                     <l>But that destroys my hopes, which makes yours thrive.</l>
                     <l>Should I do all you ask, I soon shall see,</l>
                     <l>

                     <l>This last effect then of your Duty show,</l>

            <l>And spite, of all her Cruelty, and rage,</l>
            <l>I Live, am Queen, and Triumph, on the Stage.</l>
            <l>The God-like Poet, Mortal Actors too,</l>
            <l>Strive thus, with various Skill, to pleasure you,</l>
            <l>They punish, they reward, they kill, they save,</l>
            <l>And all to find out, what 'tis you would have,</l>
            <l>For You —like Gods, like Goddesses you—sit,</l>
            <l>To Iudg our Actions, and the Poets wit,</l>
            <l>And 'tis but just, all should to you submit,</l>
            <l>Poets your Drudges, for you form a Play,</l>
            <l>They shape, with artful Words; the senseless Clay,</l>
            <l>And to the Image, a dead form they give,</l>
            <l>But tis from you, it must its Life receive,</l>
            <l>You make both Poets, Plays, and Players, Live.</l>
