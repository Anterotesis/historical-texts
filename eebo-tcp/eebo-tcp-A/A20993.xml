            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>For as a little water powred on a great sire, the more enlightens and inflames it, and if wee throw too much thereon, doth wholly dead and extinguish it: so the frequency and excesse of these <hi>Iests,</hi> lose their <hi>dignitie</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> in him who makes it a continuall profession to vse them: whereas, if they bee scattered and disperced iudiciously, they reinflame, and giue them the more <hi>lustre, vigour,</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> for to say truly, we should vse them as sauce or prouocation to appetite, and not as meate, for feare lest in thinking to giue some relish to affaires, and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, they chance procure distast, if not a surfet.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 The manner of this <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (as of all other matters) hath both its <hi>Medium</hi> and <hi>Extreames,</hi> in so much as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the <hi>Mediocritie,</hi> it is necessary wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the consideration of the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, person, place, time, matter, and cause: why and wherein this phrase of speech is more sit for great, small, or equall persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; or when there is no farther neede, then to testifie a simple and small good will; or contrariwise when wee ought expresse and dilate a deeper respect and obligation.</p>
                        <p>But aboue all we must be carefull, not so much to affect lofty words, as that wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our selues in any impertinent or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propper termes, or in any vnfit or farre fetcht replies, but to our familiars; we must vse common phrases, and not those that are affected or strained: in a word, heere our tongue and our <hi>Iudgement</hi> must march hand in hand, as equals; and we must still accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our discourse with gestures, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and other exteriour behauiour which may expresse the like affection and desire; briefly making known the causes and reasons that induce vs to loue or honour any one, or that we feele our selues oblig'd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:86:23"/>
Among which, we must make choice of those <hi>Complements,</hi> that are more fit and proper for the purpose, and that are more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and knowne of him to whom we will performe them.</p>
                        <p>And if we haue formerly receiued any testimonie of his affection: either in that he hath perform'd vs some friendly office, or that hee hath testified, or expressed so much in his speeches: we must often remember it to him, and attribute it to his kinde <hi>Nature,</hi> full of affection and courtesie, the which he will the sooner beleeue; because euery one being deceiued with the loue of himselfe, very easily perswades himselfe thereof, and reioiceth that another beleeues, hee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth those perfections and qualities, that may make him pleasing, esteem'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of all men.</p>
                        <p>And this meanes being practised with <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Discretion,</hi> hath a certaine secret, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den power, to moue and dispose our <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings</hi> to beleeue those who make vse thereof.</p>
                        <p>I say <hi>discretion,</hi> because we meet with some <hi>Natures</hi> (although they are rare in <hi>Court)</hi> who are so farre from this common <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:86:24"/>
3 Wherefore with these we must auoid all degrees of affectation, and not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such like complements: but in those <hi>Iest</hi> &amp; <hi>replies</hi> whose custome makes them necessary; or when we are enforc'd thereunto by the consequence or dependance, of a discourse, or businesse, that may testifie in vs, rather a habit, and firme resolution of our <hi>Will,</hi> then the impetuositie of any violent or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affection, that may bee suspected to bee performed, either out of inconstancie, immitation, or of set purpose and designe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 In the answers wee returne to these <hi>complements:</hi> wee must behaue our selues in the same manner and temper; but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to meete and answer the good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reported and acknowledged to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs: and albeit we ought to extenuate them, yet not to diminish them more then is requisite and fit, as some vsually doe.</p>
                        <p>Sith in diminishing them too much, or by affirming it a matter we would performe for any other, we thereby accuse him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and applaude those our good offices done him: and who thinkes to inioy therein an extraordinary testimonie of our affection and good will; the which we our selues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish in deminishing it, so as we thereby dis-esteeme and vnderualew his worth, who thought he had been obliged to vs as a friend in comparison of those who are not.</p>

                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:86:24"/>
In which regard although our <hi>dutie</hi> hath sometimes led vs to performe a good office; yet we must make shew that it is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affection that induced vs thereunto; and this neuerthelesse must be perform'd without any signe or demonstration of vanitie.</p>
                        <p>So much in generall may be said of these degrees of friendly offices, which practised discreetly, may much auaile to purchase vs reputation and credit; where contrariwise, if they are not accompanied with <hi>Wisedome,</hi> they will in the ende proue rediculous, and so it being omitted and neglected, may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend those who expect to receiue them from vs.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eadinesse</hi> to performe a pleasure (or good office) is one of the chiefest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites that should be in a <hi>Courtier,</hi> at least, in him who desires to bee scene, and bid welcome in good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it containes the principall effects of good will and friendship: that is to say, to pleasure others, and to acknowledge it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued the like of others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Good offices</hi> wee performe, are the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane societie, and the fetters and manacles (saies an <hi>Antient)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we may inchaine and captiuate others, especially at <hi>Court,</hi> where the interest and performance thereof is the twist, or coard, that conioines and combines so many people one to another: yea, although for the most part, they are drawne thereunto with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and contrarie affections.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 But the chiefest consideration we must haue and retaine in performing a <hi>good office,</hi> or pleasure, is to performe it in that manner that it may be agreeable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him that receiues it of vs: there being many occasions wherein thinking to please, we displease; and this fals out through our owne default, in not knowing the desire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:86:25"/>
and inclination of him to whom we would doe good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Another consideration, is the manner how to performe a <hi>good office:</hi> for there are diuers sorts and degrees of them; some are <hi>Honourable</hi> to those who receiue them, and indeed, these should be done, before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like eye of the world, to the end their <hi>honour</hi> be the greater and more apparant.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Others are profitable; such are those when wee assist and releeue the pouertie, weaknesse, shame, or necessitie of him who receiues them; and these indeed must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed secretly, and apart.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 But both the one and the other should be done willingly, and cheerefully, not repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, by constraint, or importunat solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or request: for, that which we depart from, or distribute in this manner, we giue not, but rather sell it at a deere rate; sith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and praiers are alwaies accompanied with submission and bashfulnesse.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 They must also be done speedily, and willingly, for the lingering &amp; delaying here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is a signe either of doubt or of no great good will or affection for soone to refuse, or late to giue, is almost one and the same thing.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 According to <hi>Philosophie,</hi> good offices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formd, shold neither be <hi>mercinary,</hi> or performd in hope to receiue the like: but in <hi>Court</hi> there are none perform'd or giuen otherwise;

three of these: this diuersitie, as some report, comming from the temper of the heart; but according to others (whom indeed I follow) from that of the braine.</p>

then old people: and after their mornings sleepe, haue it farre fresher then at night, the reason consists in this; sleepe moistneth the braine, and watching dries it vp.</p>
                        <p>Among these sorts of <hi>Wits,</hi> we shall not finde much lesse <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Ostentation</hi> then in the <hi>Imaginatiue:</hi> neuerthelesse, wanting more pondering and deliberation, they are easier carried away, by authoritie, reputation, and president, then the others.</p>
                        <p>But as temper consists not in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar quality, but in the combination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of all foure: so although in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Wit,</hi> we know one of the three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties domineer in some persons; yet to make it capable and compleat, we must haue the other two: and if not in the like degree and measure, yet with some power and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to direct it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Vnderstanding &amp; Memory,</hi> can in no sort conioine and sympathize in the same degree; because dry and moist can in nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or imagine with the like power and efficacie: from whence wee may conclude, that he who hath a good <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> hath but a bad <hi>Memorie:</hi> and contrariwise, he that hath a good <hi>Memorie,</hi> hath but a bad <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise, where moisture abounds, there can be no great heat; because, in the end heat consumes moisture: and consequently,

                        <p>These sort of people likewise, haue no great <hi>Vnderstanding:</hi> for although this heat produce and engender drinesse in the braine; neuerthelesse, because it is an enforced and constrain'd drinesse, which dries vp the most delicate parts of the braine, and leaues no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the grosse and earthly; it cannot produce the effects of the <hi>Understanding,</hi> as <hi>Naturall</hi> drinesse doth.</p>

                        <p n="4">4 For this promptitude and viuacitie, that heat engenders in these sorts of <hi>Wits,</hi> and which for a time makes them admired; is not only contrarie to the operations of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> that requires time and leasure, but also is a great propension and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to folly.</p>

                        <p>Such people are commonly cholerike, and swart, and therefore variable and inconstant in their humours and resolutions; now heate,

1 Neuerthelesse, for the vse, and to draw some profit hence, we must passe on to the Knowledge of these motions: the vse whereof chiefly consists in seeking out the meanes, either to incite and stirre them vp in others, or to moderate them not only in others, but also in our selues: or else by pleasing and humouring them, to dispose and accommodate our selues to others, if it bee requisite and necessary to follow them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To stirre vp these motions in others, the knowledge of three things is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to wit, the dependance of these motions in engendring one the other: of the most vniuersall causes which stirres vp euery motion, or at least the chiefest, whereon the rest depend, or mens dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in more bending or enclining to one of these affections, then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Lightning is driuen away with the wind of a Hat, as also the fortune of great men in a small moment of time, one turne of a wheele makes that which was aboue, beneath; and very often from whence we expect our ruin, proceedes our securitie and preseruation.</p>

                        <p n="11">11 The third fault is greater then the two former, when we perswade our selues, that an obiect is profitable and <hi>Good,</hi> which is <hi>Euill</hi> and noysome, and that euill and pernitious which is not.</p>
                        <p>This errour comes to passe, sith all things as we haue already said, haue two handels or hold-fasts, and except we be cautious and carefull, wee onely take hold of the first that comes to our hand.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 Wherefore before wee iudge of the qualitie of an obiect, we must first know the profits and preiudices, weigh and consider the consequences of both, and compare them one with another, and if the profits exceede the preiudices; not onely in number, but in

weight, qualitie, dependance, or importance, we may then tearme them <hi>Good</hi> and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or if the contrary, we must reiect them as <hi>Euill.</hi>

                        <p>As for <hi>Example:</hi> euery one holds reuenge to be <hi>Good,</hi> and as a pleasing and agreeable thing is desired of all men, because of the content it brings with it, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is far lesse then distaste, and angers, who torment and trouble vs in seeking the meanes to accomplish and perpetrate our designes.</p>
                        <p>This thought of reuenge, is a worme that frets and eates out our hearts, prouokes vs by day, torments vs by night, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in vaine; and whilest we thus afflict our selues, our enemy laughes and liues ioc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund and merry: and when wee are on the point to execute our reuenge, thinking to put out one of his eyes, wee commonly lose both our owne; for the feare of <hi>Iustice</hi> and punishment surpriseth vs, and driues vs to this extremitie, either to hide our selues, or to flie.</p>
                        <p>If then wee ballance all this with a little <hi>Content,</hi> which for the most part lasteth not long, and sometime is but meerely imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we shall then find, that it doth not match or counterpoyse these our angers and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so likewise it is in many other matters.</p>

                        <p>It is to bee too ingenious to torment and afflict himselfe, to seeke that he desires not to find; and it is to haue a bad stomack, ill to digest good Viands.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 And it is according to this similitude, that we terme this power and vertue <hi>Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> to performe a businesse; by meanes whereof we conuerse and treate fortunately, making that which is difficult, easie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and representing and receiuing it without gall or bitternesse.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Contrariwise, there are some so vnfit and vnapt for this purpose, that they make small things great and those which are easie, difficult; yea, they make that sower, that was scarce sharpe, being not capable to manage a businesse; but in an vndecent and disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, making it to be defectiue and imperfect yea, and sometimes impossible: like vnskilfull <hi>Chirurgeous,</hi> who in lieu of healing a wound, make it incurable; and in stead of sowing it vp, doe rend and teare it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Opposite to whom are those who are wise and <hi>Iuditious,</hi> who sweeten the wound with lenitiue and coole oyntments; so as if they must cut off any thing from him, they first so allure and prouoke the <hi>Patient</hi> to sleepe, as hee feeles no paine; in whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and example those who are <hi>Wise</hi>

and <hi>Iuditious,</hi> represent angry and distastefull matters, by softly insinuating into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and iudgements of those to whom they speake, without violence or trouble; and so by little and little dispose them to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the consideration of their reasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by chiefely seruing themselues towards them, who being of a sharpe and harsh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or for some passion or interest, shew them to bee insupportable, speaking arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly and proudly; yea, in such sort, as they seeme rather to challenge vs to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, then in amiable and amicable manner to treate with vs; because from this their violent and impetious assault, they almost like inraged Bulls, without <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Feare,</hi> not onely rush, but runne furiously to ouerthrow vs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And it is not as some esteeme, a seruile or base act for a <hi>Wise man</hi> to answere thus pleasantly, or not to be cholerick with those, who are either in choller, or speake with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but it is a point worthy of a temperate spirit and full of <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Discretion;</hi> and againe farre fitter for greater men, then for those of any other condition, who must not the lesse inforce themselues, to become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of their owne proper affections.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 In this <hi>Dexteritie</hi> then, wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Tennis Players, who to commit no fault in their play, not onely looke to take
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:86:103"/>
the Ball fully, but also with their best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour and skill, watch to bee sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him handsomly, and to returne him to that place, that shall make most for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Also in conuersing or treating, we must obserue the same consideration, being verie carefull and circumspect, that we commit no fault in the matter wherof we treat, bringing those words with vs, which are pertinent and proper, and receiuing those from him that speakes to vs in the best manner the sense thereof will safely permit.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 With this skill wee may sometimes dissemble, or conseale some truth very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly; yea, and make shew not to know or vnderstand some thing that is of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance in the businesse wee haue in hand, to the end that wee may gaine time to answere, and not bee surprised, or taken vnprouided.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 And the resolutions from whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, we may take assurance and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie must bee so conceiude, that which way soeuer they turne, wee may still subsist and stand, and find (as the saying is) a Posterne doore open to saue our selues; according to the example of <hi>Mucianus,</hi> his answere to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniuns Prumus,</hi> who asked him his aduice, if whilest he staid for <hi>Vespasian,</hi> he should assault <hi>Rome.</hi>

                           <pb n="176" facs="tcp:86:104"/>
10 It will bee also a point of <hi>Dexteritie</hi> to yeeld in those things, wherin we haue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand so farre forth, that another way we be sure to obtaine a greater aduantage.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 It is likewise <hi>Wisedome</hi> to be flexible and tractable in a businesse, and a <hi>Vice</hi> to bee too partiall and iealous of his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wee must sometimes be lofty and fast girt, and then againe wee must abate our pride, and vnloose that which wee haue so straightly bound.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 But aboue all, we must auoide the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to breake friendship with any man, and rather excuse and shift our selues from those, who are tedious and importunate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the haste and necessity of their businesse, referring them to another time, or shewing them the qualitie of other businesse, is not fit to be treated of in this time or place; or if this will not suffice, then to shew them the impossibilitie thereof.</p>
                        <p>For it is one of the most difficult and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish points in our conuersation, absolutely to refuse a man; the reason thereof is, because euery one flatters and perswades himselfe, that his demand is iust.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 In which respect some do consent and promise all; yea, they cannot, and which is worse, they will not any longer stand off, hoping that before the time of the execution, many accidents will fal out, which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:86:104"/>
and frustrate the effect of their promise, and so free them from that whereunto they are obligd and tyed, or else that they will find out some excuses and euasions, hauing in the <hi>Interim,</hi> neuertheles, giuen content to the demander; and as said <hi>Aulus Sempre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="14">14 But these manner of proceedings are good to be practisud but once, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out and knowne, they soone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and deserie him that vseth them often; as also they descrie themselues, which to content their vanitie, and to bee cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and followed, make vse of these hopes.</p>
                        <p>But the best and surest way, is neither to yeeld nor promise any thing but that which we can, we ought, and wee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
                        <p n="15">15 And if that which is demanded of vs, participate of neither of these three, we must then vnder colour of diuers other pretexts, deferre the answer thereof as long as we can; or else make those who presse vs thereunto, alter their designes and purposes; in prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in stead of their demands, some o ther thing, wherin we may aide &amp; assist the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or to make them know, and be sensible of our good will and affection towards them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

the issue thereof answere not their desires, or else to contriue our promise in such generall tearmes, that it do not precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bind and oblige vs.</p>
                        <p n="16">16 This last forme of proceeding, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remoted far off from freenesse, but the iniustice of the demaunds makes it excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, es<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ecially if our refusall proceede rather from our insufficiency, then from any defect or fault of our good will the effects whereof we will assuredly demonstrate, and testifie in any other subiect and occasion, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of vs towards those wee refuse; and in this sort reuiuing their courage and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the hope they receiue, that the doore of our affection is not altogether shut, for them to obtaine some other request and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, wee not onely sweeten the bitternes of this refusall, but also by the most mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and temperate sort of people, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall will bee interpreted and taken for <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Fauour.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O which purpose it greatly behooues vs to consider the <hi>Prince</hi> his humour, differing not much from other mens; if not that, as <hi>Princes</hi> are more powerfull in all other things: so they are more weake to moderate their owne passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and humors, as being for the most part more violent, and lesse restrained by reason.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 So then he will quickly enter into <hi>chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and in all his actions be proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: desiring that all things may stoope to his commands: an enemy of the least disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, impatient in the execution of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, headstrong in his counsells, and little regarding to be counselled of others, if it be not, to find out one that will conioyne with his; and so vndertake the execution of his will and desire. Iniurious, quicke to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but ready to returne to himselfe: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that we make no semblance of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the offence he hath done vs; otherwise he will then become inexorable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable, and so from thence perpetually hate him whom he hath offended.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Neere such a humour, a <hi>Courtier</hi> must alwayes haue his eye and eare open; and (as we say) one of his feet aboue ground, to

see, vnderstand, speake, and doe all which his <hi>Prince</hi> desireth; without reply, delay, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, for feare least we make our Master beleeue we are wiser then himselfe; yea wee must be humble and obedient to all degrees of his commands, although they be inferiour to our qualitie and dignitie: we must be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to digest all iniuries, readie to forget them, still redoubling his seruice and our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience after he hath been displeased or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, neuer remembring our seruices for feare of being seene to vaunt and insult thereof, but rather to continue them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to incite and stirre vp gratefulnesse and acknowledgement in our <hi>Prince</hi> his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; he must flye all extreamitie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of <hi>choller,</hi> for then all things displease, and then those who are most beloued, can neither speake nor doe any thing, agreeable to him that is in choller: The <hi>Princes</hi> of this humour repute and attribute all familiaritie to disdaine, in such sort that although they tempt &amp; allure vs to be familiar with them: wee notwithstanding must not ingage our selues therein; but still beare our selues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with much respect and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For though first they seeme to bee tame <hi>Lyons,</hi> yet in the end they deuoure those, who vainely and ambitiously presum'd, they had the <hi>Art</hi> to know how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them.</p>

4 The <hi>Prince</hi> of a sanguine complexion, is still of a ioyfull nature and disposition, louing mirth, pleasure, and pastimes, an enemy to sorrow and melancholinesse; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all matters that are intricate or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and all quarrells, debates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; much desirous of ease and peace, remitting willingly the disposing of his affayres to those who are vnder him, and wholly relying on their care, louing those who ease him of that burthen, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him any cause of complaints; the which hee vnderstands with much vnwillingnesse: hee is courteous, gratious, and very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly drawne to offend any; or if hee doe it is rather in wordes then otherwise; and doth as willingly forget those offered him, as those he commits himselfe, hee delights to pleasure any man, and is generally very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 With those sorts of <hi>Princes,</hi> wee must bee as seldome graue as wee may, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuerthelesse the respect and dutie wee owe them; and as for those, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his greatest and most important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, they must not come into his presence, except they are called, or if they bee not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that they find them not playing, or recreating themselues: for besides that, hee interrupts the <hi>Prince</hi> in the pastime hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth; the <hi>Prince</hi> is also ashamed, that such
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:86:142"/>
as they are should surprise him in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, knowing that in their hearts they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them not.</p>

                        <p>As those then haue a great aduantage in the managing and conduction of his affaires, their <hi>Prince</hi> wholly relying on them; so they haue also a great disaduantage and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6 But those who are of a <hi>Ioueall</hi> humor, and withall capable to manage and dispatch businesse, oftentimes attaine to preferment and aduancement neere these <hi>Princes:</hi> Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that being out of their sight, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that grauitie which is beseeming and answerable to their place and dignitie; whereas fayling thereof, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues despised and contemn'd; and from this contempt is ingendred and produced the boldnesse (vnder borrowed and feigned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts) to complaine; and those complaints being heard and knowne of the <hi>Prince,</hi> are of such power and efficacie, that many times
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:86:142"/>
to appease them, hee resolues to discard and put away the author thereof.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 A melancholy <hi>Prince</hi> is heauy and slow in his resolutions, still pensiue, mistrustfull, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, ingenious, and most commonly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, but of few words, the which for the most part he casts forth, to sound those who approach him, framing his speeches doubtful and of a double sense; yea, in more graue and dangerous affaires (as we haue said <hi>Tiberius</hi> did); he is both secret, and a dissembler, an enemy of mirth and familiaritie, alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and louing solitarines, not desiring to bee frequented or conuersed with, affecting very few, and those coldly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> subiect to hate for a small, or no cause, in respect of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and suspition which still followes him; he is extreamely couetous, and feares the whole <hi>Earth</hi> cannot suffice him; as great an enemie to those he hath offended, as to these who haue offended him; he is reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and irreconciliable, and we must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose much confidence in his fauour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 With <hi>Princes</hi> of this humour, wee must beare our selues carefully and softly, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were with the bridle in our hand; we must retire our thoughts, poyse all that wee speake, speake nothing but that which may serue, and which we iudge fittest to bee receiued, and the surest way is not to vaunt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:86:143"/>
or boast too much, nor to speake except wee are demanded: in all our behauior and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we must be very circumspect and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eschew contradictions, and not presse this humour too much in our <hi>Prince</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions; for feare least malancholinesse being inflam'd, it turne into choller, and choller into hatred; we must be carefull and tautious how we importune him in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests especially in those wherein we doubt we shal be refus'd. For besides that, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to accustome a <hi>Prince</hi> to refuse vs; he that is <hi>Melancholy</hi> being speculatiue, holdes his refuse for an offence offered you &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues that you hold your selfe iustly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and are therefore become his enemv: so we must afterwards perform Miracles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and withdraw him from this opinion: for as lie forgets not iniuries, so hee also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues that you haue nor forgotten the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall he gaue you.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 Briefly, this humour is the dullest and heauiest of all others, for the varietie and strangenes of the obiects it ingendreth, and produceth in vs; and also because it is the more difficult for vs to conduct and beare our selues with <hi>Princes</hi> subiect hereunto.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 He that is <hi>Flegmaticke,</hi> participates of the heauines and slownesse of the <hi>Melancholy:</hi> but hee hath neither the opinion, malice, or distlust of euill, for the coldnes that freezeth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:86:143"/>
his heart, rather makes him distrustfull of himselfe, then of others; if hee vndertake any thing, he is fearefull that he shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it; which commonly proceeds from being ignorant of the meanes to worke the same; he hath irresolution in his counsells, timiditie and feare in their execution and stupiditie, or dulnesse in his conceits; still hatingwithout much bitternes and violence, &amp; louing without much zeale and feruency.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 Neere such <hi>Princes,</hi> those of actiue, couragious, and inuentiue wits, are sit to heate this cold humour of theirs. For a <hi>Prince</hi> knowing his owne defect by the difficulties and crosses that arise in his vnderstanding; the which he himselfe may resolue and cleer: if he find any who wil giue him the means to accomplish and effect that, which he thought impossible, and such a one he loues, admires, and beleeues hee is necessary for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; so is this his fauor grounded on neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, is more perdurable and permanent then any other; the which a <hi>Courtier</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he must with his best endeanours striue to accomplish those things the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> iudgeth most possible, and preuent if he can, that one more ingenious and subtle then himselfe be not admitted to vndertake it; in which respect he must not be far from <hi>Court;</hi> for when another is knowne to be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in the discharge of a Charge, then our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:86:144"/>
selues; we are then reputed lesse necessary; and when they are for a time inured and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to passe without vs, it often falls out, that they will then wholly abandon and forsake vs.</p>
                        <p>This needes no great inducement and perswasion, for it is one of the most common and frequent subtilties of the <hi>Court,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by those who are imployed in <hi>Estate</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, to call and select none but those who as well in ranke as <hi>Capacitie,</hi> are by far their inferiours, to the end thereby to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the more lustte, and to auoyde the danger of being casheeid, if the <hi>Prince</hi> find another more pleasing and agreeable to his fancy. Adde withall, that these men are more capable to performe a bad office, or to couer some corruption, according to the intent and desire of those who aduance them; which one of a more <hi>Noble</hi> and Eminent condition would not doe.</p>
                        <p>Of these foure humours (as wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said), aswell <hi>Princes</hi> as other men are composde, and some way or other are addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inclined to one, or more of those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, according to the degree of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour it selfe, that most predominats in them.</p>

                        <p n="5">5 There are other <hi>Princes</hi> who more vmbragious and iealous of their <hi>Estate,</hi> and <hi>Greatnesse,</hi> conferre the whole authoritie of their affaires to one or two, authorizing them in all the functions of their Offices, and yet without giuing them any great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse or familiaritie; yea, for the most part, they will neither see nor heare them, except it be to discouer or resolue the matters of their charge and Office, not permitting them to imploy others, for feare that the subordinate power and authoritie which they giue them, take foote, and make so many seruants vnder them; that if it chance they commit any fault, hauing such support, they cannot easily chastice and be rid of them, it being one of the chiefest points and reasons, that such <hi>Princes</hi> desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine those in feare who serue them, thereby to make them beleeue, that with a wincke, and in a moment, they can ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine those whom they haue been many yeares aduancing.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Towards these <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Great men,</hi> there is much care and difficultie how to

beare and behaue our selues; for seeking their good will, it cannot much steed or serue vs: Contrariwise, the <hi>Prince</hi> most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuseth vs, if he know wee seeke them: and againe, not seeking them, it is very hard and difficult for vs to be inducted or admitted to any imployments, whereby we are exposed, and subiect to many crosses and accidents which they may occasion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Wherefore we must herein beare our selues very discreetly, vsing much respect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and if occasion present to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and testific them our affection by seruices and secret offices, vnknowne to the world, and not withstanding seeke fauour and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance other where, that may be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and agreeable to the <hi>Prince,</hi> thereby to procure our enterance and admittance neere him.</p>

                        <p n="7">7 Callumnies are commonly grounded either vpon some defect pretended to bee in

rest doubtfull, especially when the Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator vehemently affirmes and assures it, what disposition soeuer hee haue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and if it ariue to the vnderstanding of the Prince, to whom by flatterers, reports are secretly and insensibly carried, then is suspition and distrust engendred, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth him any farther to enquire out the truth thereof from whence it comes, that it degenerates into strangenesse, and after into enmitie and hatred.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 He then who is absent, must chiefely and necessarily be prouided of one (or rather of more who may performe him the office of a true friend, to defend him against all fals &amp; scandalous reports, and to make choyce of such as are of reputation, and may haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into those places, where they may assist their friend in this degree of charitie.
