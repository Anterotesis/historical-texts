         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVouchſafe (moſt gracious Soueraigne) a fauourable and pitifull eare, vnto the humble petition, of many
your diſtreſſed ſubiects. Preachers of the goſpell, now called vpon in your Maieſties name, to approue by
ſubſcription and practiſe, fiue ſeuerall bookes, with certayne Ceremonies therein preſcribed. If any thinge were
commaunded vs by your Maieſtie, which we might doe, without offence to the higheſt Maieſtie, there is not
a man amonge vs, that would not willingly obey the ſame, though it were to the loſſe of all he hath, yea, of his
very life. But being perſwaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the ſaide ceremonies, and many thinges elſe in thoſe bookes, are repugnant
to the word of God, we moſt humbly beſeech your Highnes: to ſpare our conſciences in the ſame, eſpecially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hetherto, neither our exceptions (a view wherof we haue to ſhew) haue bin anſwered, nor any one ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon giuen, according to your Maieſties proclamation, to proue the lawfulnes of the thinges impoſed, we
haue heard and doe beleeue, that your Maieſtie hath often ſaide, that if any can ſhew the things required to be
vnlawfull, your Highnes will not haue them vrged. And except we be able, by the evidence of holy ſcripture,
to proue the ſame, we will preſently yeld to conformitie requyred. In the meane tyme, it might pleaſe your
Maieſtie in your princly wiſdome to conſider, that howſoeuer theſe thinges haue not heeretofore, bin by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye
remooued, yet haue they neuer had quyet poſſeſſion in this Church vnder the goſpell, ſince the firſt

almoſt all the painfull &amp; reſiant miniſters of the land, is againſt them: that they haue bin long diſvſed in many

               </gap>cate, as hath appeared in many parliaments of former
tymes, and alſo in this laſt. In regard whereof, we humbly beſeech your Highnes, to take this burthen from
our conſciences, and to vouchſaue the continuance of our miniſtry, at the leaſt, vntill the ignorant and ſcando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Miniſters be remoued, non-reſidentes reformed, and all the Churches of this kingdome, be prouided of
able, godly, and reſident preachers, that popery and Atheiſme gett not the head amonge vs, to the ruyne of
this famous Church and common wealth. And this we verily hope, your Maieſtie will not deny vs, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that we are the ſeruantes of your God, Preachers of that faith, whereof your Highnes is both profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
and defendor: we haue alwayes ſyncerely, fauoured and to our power furthered, your iuſt and lawfull
clayme vnto this kingdome: we are aduerſaryes to them, that are aduerſaryes to your ſoule and body, ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
Crowne, and Kingdomes. We haue bin brought vp, and taken degrees in the vniuerſities: we are many
of vs become greay headed in the ſeruice of God, and of his Church, hauyng preached the goſpell, ſome of vs
ten yeares, ſome twenty, ſome thyrty, and ſome more, and diuers of vs in this Cittye adventured our lyues
by preachinge, in the tyme of the late infection: neither are we ſo fewe, as is pretended: to ſay nothing of our
brethren, which yeeld with much greife and ſorrow of harte: we haue wyues and children, kinſfolkes &amp; frend
depending on vs, who are all vndone, if we be diſplaced. God forbid, that euer it ſhould be ſayd or written, in
ſucceeding ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the dayes of ſo religyous, and learned a Kinge, ſo many learned and paynfull paſtors and
preachers, were caſt out, as vnſauery ſalt: and that for refuſynge ſuch a ſubſcription, as in no age of the Church,
was euer vrged, and is more then the law of the land requireth, and for not vſinge ſuch ceremonies, as are prof<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

to none, Prince or ſubiect, and (to ſpeake the leaſt) haue bin and continue, to be polluted with Idolatry:
and in the meane tyme, ſo many dumbe Miniſters, ſo many ſcandolous Miniſters and non-reſydents (the ſhame
and bane of the Church of God) keept in, and that ſo many learned, godly, and (many of them) aged men,
were expoſed to ſuch reproach and miſery, as nether the dumbe and ſcandolous miniſters with theirs of late,
nor Monkes, Fryers and Nunnes, in former tymes haue bine. Oh that your Maieſtie did knowe, the reproach
that is already fallen vppon vs, yea vpon the goſpell which we haue preached, the inſulting of Papiſtes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
perſons, the diſcouraging of younge ſtudents, the pitifull cryes of many thowſandes moſt faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
throughout the land, and cheifely in your Highnes chamber, and famous Citie of London. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
did but heare and ſee, theſe wofull effectes, your royall and compaſſionate harte (we are perſwaded)
would not be able to indure the ſame. But your Maieſtie is, as an Angell of God, to diſcerne more than is
meete for vs to ſpeake. And therfore forbeareyng to proceed further heerein, we humbly caſt our ſelues, at
your Maieſties feete, for the continuance of our miniſtrye, to the glory of God: and ſaluation of his people,
thorough Ieſus Chriſt, whom we dayly beſeech to bleſſe your Maieſtie, and poſteritie foreuer.</p>
