            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LIFE

ERASMUS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ERasmus,</hi> so deservedly famous
for his admirable <hi>Writings,</hi>
the vast extent of his <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
his great Candor and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for being one of the chief
<hi>Restorers</hi> of the Purity of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
Tongue on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi>
was Born at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> on the
28th of <hi>October</hi> in the Year 1467.
Indeed the anonymous Author of his
Life, commonly Printed at the end of
his Colloquies (of the <hi>London</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
is pleased to tell us, that <hi>de


<pb facs="tcp:63271:3"/>
anno, quo natus est apud Batavos,
non constat,</hi> and if himself writ
the Life, which we find before the
<hi>Elzevir</hi> Edition, and is there said to
be <hi>Erasmo Autore,</hi> he does not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
mention the Year in which
he was Born, but places it <hi>circa an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
67 supra millesimum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringentesimum.</hi>
Another <hi>Latin</hi> Life
which is prefixed to the abovemention'd
<hi>London</hi> Edition in <hi>Octavo,</hi> fixes it in
the Year 1465, as likewise does his
Epitaph at <hi>Basil.</hi> But as the Inscription
of his Statue at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> the Place
of his Nativity, may reasonably be
supposed to be the most Authentic Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
we have here thought fit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that.</p>
            <p>His Mother's Name was <hi>Margaret,</hi>
Daughter to one <hi>Peter</hi> a Physician,
Born at <hi>Sevenbergen</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi>
his Father's Name <hi>Gerard,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a private Correspondence with
Her upon promise of Marriage, and


<pb facs="tcp:63271:3"/>
was actually contracted to her, as the
life which carries <hi>Ersumus</hi>'s Name
before, it, seems to insinuate by these
words, <hi>sunt qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessisse
verba di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">'Tis not to be denied but that <hi>Erasmus</hi> was a Bastard, but his Enemies have published some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious circumstances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Birth, that are false; as for instance, that his Father was Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Tergou</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got him. <hi>Pontus Heuterus</hi> calls him by the same error <hi>fils de prêtre.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theophile Raynaud</hi> has this pleasant passage. <hi>If,</hi> says he, <hi>one may be allow'd to droll upon a Man, that droll'd upon all the World,</hi> Erasmus <hi>though he was not the Son of a King, yet he was the Son of a crown'd Head,</hi> meaning a Priest; but 'tis plain his Father was not in Orders at that time.</note>His Father
was the youngest of
Ten Brothers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one Sister coming
ing between, for which
reason, the Old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
according to the
Superstition of those
times, design'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
him to the
Church, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
liked the motion
well enough, because, as the Church-men
then govern'd all, they hoped, if he thrived
upon his Profession, to have a sure Friend
where they might Eat, and Drink, and make
merry upon occasion; but no importunities
whatever cou'd prevail upon <hi>Gerard</hi> to
turn Ecclesiastic. Thus finding himself per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually


<pb facs="tcp:63271:4"/>
press'd upon so ungrateful an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and not able any longer to bear it,
he was forced in his own defence to shift
his Quarters and fly for it; leaving a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for his Friends upon the Road, wherein
he acquainted them with the reason of his
departure, and concluded that he would
never trouble them any more. Thus
he left his Spouse that was to be, big
with Child, and made the best of his
way to <hi>Rome.</hi> In this City he
maintain'd himself very handsomely by
his Pen, at which he was an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Master, transcribing most Authors
of note (for Printing was not then
known,<note n="*" place="margin">So says the Life with <hi>Erasmo Auctore</hi> before it, but 'tis most certainly a mistake, for Printing was found out in the Year 1442. which was at least 24 Years before this, but perhaps he means, that tho' the invention was known it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used.</note>

for some time lived
at large, as young
Fellows use to do,
but afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to his Studies, made a great


<pb facs="tcp:63271:4"/>
progress in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
as likewise in the Civil Law;
which he had the better opportunity of
doing, because <hi>Rome</hi> at that time
was full of Learned Men, and because
as has been intimated before, his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
obliged him to transcribe Books
for his Livelyhood, and consequently
must impress them strongly in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
When his Friends knew that
he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> they sent him word
that the Young Gentlewoman, whom he
Courted for a Wife, was dead, which
he believing to be true, in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
fit took Orders, and wholly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Thoughts to the Study of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
When he returned to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, he found to his grief
that he had been imposed upon, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it was too late then to think of
Marriage; so he dropt all farther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to his Mistress, neither would
she after this unlucky adventure be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Marry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63271:5"/>
His Son from him took the Name
of <hi>Gerard,</hi> which in the <hi>German</hi>
Language signifies <hi>Amiable,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fashion of the Learned Men
of that Age, who affected to give their
Names either a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> turn,
(as for instance <hi>Oecolampadius, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus,
Melancthon, Pontanus, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrenius,
Pelargus,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>he</hi> turn'd it
into <hi>Desiderius (Didier)</hi> which in
<hi>Latin,</hi> and into <hi>Erasmus,</hi> which in
<hi>Greek</hi> has the same force and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He was Chorister of the Cathedral
Church of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> till he was Nine
Years Old, after which he was sent to
<hi>Deventer,</hi> to be instructed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Alexander Hegius,</hi> a <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalian,</hi>

who from him had learn'd the

<note n="*" place="margin">There is an ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Tradition in <hi>Holland,</hi> that <hi>Erasmus</hi> was a dull Boy and slow to Learn, which if it were true would be no dishonour to him, no more than it is to <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> or <hi>Suarez,</hi> of whom the same thing is reported, but Monsieur <hi>Bale</hi> has shown the vanity of this Story. <hi>Vie d' Erasme.</hi>
               </note>Proficient,
and 'tis remarkable
that he had so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
a Memory,
that he was able to
say all <hi>Terence</hi> and
<hi>Horace</hi> by heart. All
this while he was
under the watchful
Eye of his Mother, who died of the
Plague then raging at <hi>Deventer,</hi> he
being then about Thirteen Years Old,
which cruel Contagion daily increasing,
and having swept away the Family
where he boarded, he was obliged to
return home. His Father <hi>Gerard</hi> was
so concerned at her Death, that he grew
Melancholy upon it and died soon after,
neither of his Parents being much above
40 when they deceased. <hi>Erasmus</hi> had three
Guardians assign'd him, the chief of whom
was <hi>Peter Winkel,</hi> School-master of
<hi>Goude,</hi> and the Fortune that was left


<pb facs="tcp:63271:6"/>
him might have supported him hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
enough, if the Executors had
faithfully discharged their trust. By them
he was removed to <hi>Boisledue,</hi> though
he was at that time fit for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
but the Trustees were utterly
averse to send him thither, because
they design'd him for a Monastic Life.
Here, as he himself owns, he lost ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near Three Years, Living in a
<hi>Franciscan Convent,</hi> where one <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold</hi>
taught Humanity, who was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
taken with the pregnant Parts
of the Boy, and daily importun'd him
to take the Habit upon him, and make
one of their number. The Boy alledged
the rawness of his Age as a sufficient
excuse; and upon the spreading of the Plague
into these Parts, after he had strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a long while with a Quartan
Ague, he returned to his Guardians, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by this time arrived to an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
good Style, by his daily reading
of the best Classick Authors. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd


<pb facs="tcp:63271:6"/>
raging Distemper had
carried off one of his Guardians; and the
other two having managed his Fortune
with none of the greatest care, began
to consider how to fix him in some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.
<hi>Erasmus,</hi> who was not as
yet fully recover'd from his Ague, had
no great inclinations for the Cloister,
not that he had the least disrelish to
the severities of a pious Life, but he
could not easily reconcile himself to the
Monastic Profession, for which reason he
he desired some farther time to consider
better of the matter.</p>
            <p>All this while his Guardians employed
the People about him to use all manner
of arguments to bring him over, who
sometimes threatned him with the fatal
consequences he must Expect in case of
a denyal, and sometimes alter'd their
language and endeavoured to effect their
designs by flattery and fair Speeches.
In this interim they found out a


<pb facs="tcp:63271:7"/>
place for him in
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Moreri</hi> in his Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pretends that he took the habit of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Regular of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in this Monastery; but 'tis a mistake. <hi>Guy Patin</hi> fell into a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry errour, when he said that he never was a Monk for <hi>Erasmus;</hi> ownt it not only in his Life Written by himsef, but likewise in a Letter to <hi>Lambert Grunnius.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Sion,</hi> a College of
Canons Regulars, and
the principal House
belonging to that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not far from <hi>Delft,</hi>
When the Day came in
which he was to give
his final answer, the
young Man fairly told them, that he
neither knew what the World was, nor
what a Monastery was, nor yet what
himself was, and therefore humbly
conceived it to be more adviseable to pass
a few years more at School, till he
was better acquainted with himself.
When <hi>Winkel</hi> his Guardian found him
not to be moved from this resolution, he told
him, that he had spent his time, to a fine
purpose, in making of friends and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
all his Interest to procure this
preferment for an obstinate Boy, that
knew not what was convenient for him.
But, continues he, since I find you


<pb facs="tcp:63271:7"/>
are possess'd with a Spirit of obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
e'en take what follows for your
pains, I throw up my Guardian-ship from
this moment, and now you may maintain
yourself. Young <hi>Erasmus</hi> immediately
replied that he took him at his word,
since he was old enough now to look out
for himself. When the other found that
threatning signified nothing, he under-hand
employed his Brother, who was the other
a Guardian, to see what he coud
do by fair means. Thus he was surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by them and their Agents on all
hands, his Ague still kept close to him,
yet for all this a Monastic Life woud
not goe down with him. At last by meer
accident he went to visit a Religious House
belonging to the same Order in <hi>Emaus,</hi>
or <hi>Steyn</hi> near <hi>Goude,</hi> where it was his
fortune to meet with one <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who
had been his Chamber-fellow at <hi>Deven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Since that time he had travell'd
into <hi>Italy,</hi> but without making any
great improvements in his Learning, and


<pb facs="tcp:63271:8"/>
tho' he had not then taken the Sacred Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
upon him, yet with all the Eloquence he
was Master of, he was perpetually preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the mighty advantages of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Life, such as the convenience of
noble Libraries, the helps of learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
the retiring from the Noise
and Folly of the world, and the like.
At, the same time others were employed
to talk the same Language to him; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his old Persecutor the Ague continued
to torment him, and thus at last he was
induced to pitch upon this Convent. Upon
his admission they fed him with great
Promises to engage him to take the Holy
Cloath; but tho' he found every thing
almost fell vastly short of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
here, yet partly his Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
joyn'd with his Modesty, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ill Usage he was threatn'd with,
in Case he abandon'd their Order, obliged
him after his Year of Probation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd,
to profess himself a Member of
their Fraternity. Not long after this he


<pb facs="tcp:63271:8"/>
had the Honour to be known to Henry à
<hi>Bergis</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> who having
some hopes of obtaining a Cardinal's Hat, in
which Design he had certainly succeeded,
had not his Money, the never-failing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commender
to the Sacred Purple, been
deficient, wanted one that was a Master
of the Latin Tongue, to sollicit this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
for him. For this Reason he was
taken into the Bishop's Family, where he
wore the Habit of his Order, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Patron, who was disappointed
of the Promotion he expected at <hi>Rome,</hi>
fickle and wavering in his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he prevailed with him to send him
to <hi>Paris,</hi> to prosecute his Studies in that
famous University, with the Promise of
an annual Allowance, which however was
never pay'd him, after the Mode of great
Persons, who think their Quality excuses
them from being Vassals to their word.
He was admitted into <hi>Montague Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi>
where by ill Diet, and a damp


<pb facs="tcp:63271:9"/>
Chamber he contracted an Indisposition,
which obliged him to return to the Bishop,
by whom he was very Courteously and
Honourably entertain'd. He no sooner
found himself re-established in his Health,
but he made a Iourney into <hi>Holland,</hi>
intending to settle there, but he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
at the instance of his Friends to
go a second time to <hi>Paris,</hi> where having
no Patron to support him, he rather
made a shift to live (if I may use his
own Expression) than cou'd be said
to study. After this he visited <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in Company with a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a Pupil of his, but who to use
his own Expression, was rather his Friend
than his Patron. Here he was received
with universal Respect, and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by several of his Letters, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
it next to the place of
his<note n="a" place="margin">Epist. 19. l 2.</note> Nativity. In one of
them addressed to<note n="b" place="margin">Epist. 10. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drelinus,</hi>
he invites him to
come into <hi>England,</hi> if it were only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb facs="tcp:63271:9"/>
the Score of the charming Beauties
with which that Island abounded He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
describes to him the innocent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Complaisance of the English
Ladies. When you come into a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
house, says he, you are allow'd
the Favour to salute them, and you do
the same when you take your Leave.
Upon this Subject he Talks very feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but without making any injust refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon the Vertue of our Women,
as several Foreigners, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the French Writers, have impudently
done. It appears that Learning flourish'd
exceedingly in <hi>England</hi>
when <hi>Erasmus</hi> was here<note n="c" place="margin">Epist. 10. l. 16.</note>
               <hi>Apud Anglos triumphant
bonae literae, recta studia.</hi>
Nay he does not doubt in<note n="d" place="margin">Epist. 12. l: 16.</note>
another Letter, to put it in
the same Scale with Italy
it self,<note n="e" place="margin">Epist. 26. l. 6.</note> and particularly
commends the English Nobility for their
great Application to all useful Learning,


<pb facs="tcp:63271:10"/>
and entertaining themselves at their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
with learned Discourses; whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Ribbaldry and Prophaneness
made up the Table-talk of the Church-men.
He tells us himself in his own
Life, that he won the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of all<note n="*" place="margin">He was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acquainted with Sir <hi>Tho. Mors. Colet</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls; Grocinus, Linscar, Laeimer,</hi> &amp;c. and pass'd some years in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </note> good
Men in our Island during
his Residence here, and
particularly for an Act of
Generosity, which cannot
be enough commended. As he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>France,</hi> it was his ill Fortune
at <hi>Dover</hi> to be stript of all he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, however he was so far from
revenging this Injury, by reflecting upon
our Nation, which that haughty Censurer
<hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> afterwards did upon no
Provocation in a most brutal manner;
that he immediately Published a Book in
praise of the King and Nation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
not meeting the Preferment which
he expected, he made a Voyage to <hi>Italy,</hi>
which Countrey at that time cou'd boast of


<pb facs="tcp:63271:10"/>
a Set of learned Men, and a vein of
Learning little inferior to that of the
<hi>Augustan</hi> Age. He took his Doctor
of Divinity's Degree in the University of
<hi>Turin,</hi> tarried above a Year in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lognia,</hi>
and afterwards went to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
where he Published his Book of
<hi>Adagies</hi> in the famous <hi>Aldus</hi>'s Printing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.
From thence he removed to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi>
and last of all came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where his great Merits had made his
Presence expected long before his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
He soon gain'd the Esteem and
Friendship of all the considerable Persons
of that City, either for their Quality or
their Learning, and cou'd not have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of making his Fortune there, if his
Friends in <hi>England</hi> upon the coming of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIIIth.</hi> to the Crown had
not by their great Promises prevail'd
with him to leave <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>England.</hi>
Here he intended to have setled for the
remainder of his Life, had these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
been as good as their words to him,


<pb facs="tcp:63271:11"/>
but whether <hi>Erasmus</hi> was wanting to
make his Court aright to <hi>Wolsey</hi> who
carried all before him, or whether that
Cardinal looked with a jealous Eye upon
him, because <hi>Warham</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> between whom and <hi>VVol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
there was perpetual clashing, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him into his Favour, as appeared by
his bestowing the Living of <hi>Aldington</hi>
in <hi>Kent</hi> upon him; 'tis certain that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Disappointment he went to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
where by the Interest of the
Chancellor <hi>Sylvagius,</hi> he was made
Counsellor to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> who
was afterwards so well known in the
World, by the Name of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
Emperour of <hi>Germany.</hi> He resided se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Years at <hi>Basil,</hi> chiefly for the sake
of <hi>Frobenius,</hi> a Learned and Eminent
Printer, to whose Son he Dedicated his
Book of Colloquies, and Published several
Books there; but so soon as the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
had abolished the Mass in that City,
he left it, and retired to <hi>Friburg,</hi> a Town


<pb facs="tcp:63271:11"/>
of <hi>Alsace,</hi> where he lived seven Years in
great Esteem and Reputation, not only with
all Persons of any Note in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
but with the chief Magistrates
of the Place, and all the Citizens in
general. He was at last obliged to
leave this City upon the account of his
Health, and returned to <hi>Basil.</hi> His
Distemper was the Gout, which after a
tedious Persecution left him; but he was
soon seized by a new Enemy, the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentery,
under which having laboured ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near a whole Month,
he<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Author of</hi> Les delices d'Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, <hi>speaking of</hi> Rotterdam, <hi>says, that</hi> Erasmusy nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit l'an 1467, &amp; mourut à Fribourg en Alsace, <hi>which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is false; for 'tis certain he died in</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.</note> died on the 12th of
<hi>July</hi> 1536, about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
in the House of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome

to <hi>John</hi> the Famous
Printer, above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
having by his Will
appointed <hi>Amberbachius</hi> an eminent

his Landlord <hi>Frobenius,</hi> his Executors,
and order'd what he left behind him, to be


<pb facs="tcp:63271:12"/>
laid out, in Relieving of the Aged and
Impotent, in giving Portions to Poor
young Maidens, in Maintaining of hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Students at the University, and the
like Charitable Uses. He was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Interred, and the City of <hi>Basil</hi> still
pays him that Respect which is due to
the Memory of so Excellent a Person;
for not only one of the Colleges there
goes by his Name, but they show all
Strangers the House where he Died,
with as much Veneration, as the People
of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> do the House where he
was Born.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly run over the
most material Passages of his Life, I come
now to consider him in his Character and
Writings. He was the most Facetious
Man of his Age, and the most Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Critick, which are two Talents
that as seldom meet together in the same
Person, as Pedantry and good Manners.
He carried on a Reformation in Learning,
at the same time as he advanced that of
Religion, and promoted a Purity and


<pb facs="tcp:63271:12"/>
Simplicity of Stile as well as of Worship.
This drew upon him the Hatred of the
Ecclesiastics, who were no less Bigotted
to their Barbarisms in Language and
Philosophy, than they were to their
injust innovations in the Church.
They Murdered him over and over in
their dull Treatises, Libell'd him in
their wretched Sermons, and what was the
last and highest Effort of their Maliee,
practis'd a piece of <hi>Mezentius</hi>'s Cruelty
upon him, and joyn'd some of their own
dead execrable Stuff to his Compositions; of
which barbarous Usage he himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
in an Epistle Address'd to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of <hi>Lovain.</hi> He exposed with
great Freedom the Vices and Corruptions
of his own Church, yet for all that cou'd
never be induced to leave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in which he was Bred, which
may be imputed to his great Candor and
Moderation, or else to the ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and furious Proceedings of the
first Reformers in <hi>Germany,</hi> which


<pb facs="tcp:63271:13"/>
cannot be defended: Thus by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fate of all Peace-makers, while
he honestly and Charitably intended to do
all good Offices to both Parties, he
was most undeservedly Worried and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by both. Perhaps no Man has
obliged the Publick with a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of useful Volumes than our Author,
not like his Country-men, the Modern
<hi>Dutch</hi> Writers, who visit <hi>Frankfort</hi>
Fair once a Year, with two or three
Stupid Mum-begotten Dissertations, that
die of themselves, before they can be said
to have ever lived. Every thing that
comes from him instructs and pleases,
and may as easily be known by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly
Strokes, as his Friend <hi>Hans
Holben</hi>'s Pieces by the boldness of the
Paint, and the freshness of the Colours.
However he was supposed to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of several Books he never Writ,
which has been the case of a hundred
Writers, both before and after him, as
the <hi>Captivitas Babylonica, Eubulus,


<pb facs="tcp:63271:13"/>
Lamentationes Petri,</hi> a Satyr of <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus,</hi>
call'd <hi>Nemo, Febris,</hi> Sir T.
<hi>More</hi>'s <hi>Utopia,</hi> and several others. It
has been commonly believed in <hi>England,</hi>
that the <hi>Epistolae obscurorum Viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
were of his Writing, but the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Monsieur <hi>Bale</hi> assures us of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
who says, that the Reading of it
put him into such a Fit of Laughter,
that it broke an Impostume, which was
ready to be cut. I will not here pretend
to give a Catalogue of all his Genuine
Pieces, which they shew at <hi>Basil,</hi> but
shall confine my self to his Book
of <hi>Colloquies,</hi> which together with
his <hi>Moriae Encomium</hi> has seen more
Editions than any other of his Works.
<hi>Moreri</hi> tells us that a Book-seller of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who it seems throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Mystery of his Trade, sold
Twenty Four Thousand of them at
one Impression, by a Trick which
has since been frequently Practis'd
by those of his Profession; for he
got it whispered to his Customers


<pb facs="tcp:63271:14"/>
that the Book was Prohibited, and
wou'd suddenly be call'd in, and
this helpt to give it so prodigious a
Run.</p>
            <p>2. The Dialogue way of Writing,
in which <hi>Erasmus</hi> has succeeded so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
owes its Birth to the <hi>Drama.
Plato</hi> took it from the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and
if I may be allow'd the Expression,
Consecrated it to the Service of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
but with all due Respect to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Memory be it said, tho' his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
is extremely Fine and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
yet his Diction is too Poetical,
and his Metaphors are too bold and
rampant. The Language of Dialogue
ought to sit loose and free, the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought to be Easie and Natural;
whereas <hi>Plato</hi>'s Expression comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to that of Poetry, than Comedy it self.
<hi>Tully</hi> who has treated several Subjects
in this way, cannot indeed be charged
with any such Tumour of Stile, yet he
wants that which is the Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit


<pb facs="tcp:63271:14"/>
of Dialogue, I mean a beautiful
turn, and quickness of Conversation.
But the greatest Genius of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to this manner of Writing, is
<hi>Lucian,</hi> whose Language is easie and
negligent but pure; his Repartees are
lively and agreeable, and to say the
truth, every one that hopes to manage
this Province well, ought to propose to
himself <hi>Lucian</hi> for a Copy to Write
after. If what some <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
Writers have reported of him be true,
that he Apostatized from the <hi>Christian</hi>
Religion, he made it some amends
however by his admirable Dialogues;
for 'tis a plain Case that the Primitive
Fathers batter'd the <hi>Pagan</hi> Theology
with Artillery drawn out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines,
and entered the Garrison
through the Breaches which he had
made to their Hands. He Raillies with
the Air and Gayety of a Gentleman,
and at the same time Writes with all
the Iustice of a Philosopher, whenever


<pb facs="tcp:63271:15"/>
his Argument requires it, and this happy
mixture of Serious and Ridicule, makes
him so eternally entertaining, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
still rises from him with a Gust.
Far be it from me to defend him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Particular; but this Testimony is due
to him even from an Enemy, and if I
have dwelt so long upon him, 'tis to be
considered that <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who Translated
part of him into <hi>Latin,</hi> made him his
Pattern, and indeed has Copied his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with such Success, that 'tis difficult
to say which of the two is the Original.</p>
            <p>3. Both of them had an equal Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Sullen, Austere, designing Knaves,
of what Complexion, Magnitude, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
soever: Both of them were Men of
Wit and Satyr, and employ'd it as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
as the old Heroes did their Arms,
in beating down the crying Grievances of
their Times, in Deposing Superstition
the worst of Tyrants, and disarming Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
the basest of Vices. But the
<hi>Hollander,</hi> according to the Genius of


<pb facs="tcp:63271:15"/>
his Country, had more of the Humourist
in him than the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and in all
Parts of Learning was infinitely his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.
It was <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Fate to live
in an Age, when Fiction and Fable had
Usurp'd the Name of Religion, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
was Debauched by a set of sowr
Scoundrils, Men of Beard and Grimace,
but scandalously Lewd and Ignorant, who
yet had the Impudence to Preach up Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and Stile themselves <hi>Philosophers;</hi>
perpetually clashing with one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Precedence of their several
Founders, the Merits of their different
Sects, and if 'tis possible about Trifles of
less Importance; yet all agreeing in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
way to dupe and amuse the poor
People, by the Fantastick Singularity of
their Habits, the Unintelligible Iargon
of their Schools, and their Pretensions to
a severe and mortified Life. This mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Herd of Iuglers, <hi>Lucian</hi> in a great
Measure helpt to Chase out of the World,
by exposing them in their proper Colours;


<pb facs="tcp:63271:16"/>
but in a few Ages after him a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
sprung up in the World, well
known by the Name of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi>
differing from the former in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Garb, and a few other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but in the main the same individual
Impostors; the same everlasting Cobweb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spinners,
as to their nonsensical Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
the same abandon'd Rakehells as
to their Morals, but as for the mysterious
Arts of heaping up Wealth, and picking
the Peoples Pockets, as much Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to their Predecessors the <hi>Pagan
Philosophers,</hi> as an overgrown Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
that cheats a whole Kingdom is to
a common Malefactor. These were the
Sanctified Cheats, whose Follies and Vices
<hi>Erasmus</hi> has so effectually lashed, that
some Countries have intirely turn'd these
Drones out of their Cells, and in other
places where they are still kept up, they
are Contemptible to the highest Degree,
and obliged to be always upon their
Guard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63271:16"/>
4. Before I dismiss this Parallel, it
may not be amiss to observe that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus</hi>
has so Religiously imitated <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
that perhaps he has carried it
to Excess, and Copied his Master e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Fault: I mean in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use of old Adagies, most of
which, tho' Poinant enough in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
Time, have lost all manner of Relish
with us, and therefore I have wholly
omitted them in my Translation, or
Substituted others that are better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in their room. This I know
will be call'd false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
by a modern<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s Preface to his Answer to Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> p. 87.</note> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,
who pretends that
a Man may cite them in
his Works, without being guilty of the
Sin of Pedantry, and justifies his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Examples of <hi>Cato, Tully, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
and <hi>Lucian.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, those
worthy Gentlemen frequently use them,
and were no Pedunts for doing so,
but with the Doctor's leave I will


<pb facs="tcp:63271:17"/>
make bold to affirm, that what they
might commendably use, who lived upon
the spot where these proverbial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
grew, and cou'd tell the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of them without the help of a
<hi>German</hi> Commentator, wou'd be rank
lowsie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pedantry for us to follow them
in, who either know nothing of the
true occasion, or if we do, live
at too great a distance of time to be
much affected with the Wit of them.
The Ruff and Farthingale of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Memory, were no doubt on't
a very laudable Dress, when they
were the common Fashion of the Town,
but should any Lady at this time of
day, out of her singular Respect to
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> wear them in the
Mall, or the side Box, I am afraid
she wou'd be soon laught out of this
Ridiculous Affectation of Antiquity. I
own that true Wit will be eternally
so to the end of the World; but the
Garniture and Trimming of it, under


<pb facs="tcp:63271:17"/>
which Class we may reckon Proverbial
Allusions, and the Similies in our Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
depend much on the Humour of the
Times, and the Genius of the Country,
and still vary with the Age; so that
what passes for a Iest in <hi>France</hi> or
<hi>Holland,</hi> we see is received but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
with us in <hi>England,</hi> who don't
understand the true Rise of it, nay what
pleases us now, I dare engage will not
find that welcome twenty Years hence.
But it has been the constant Fault of the
Grammarians in all Countries of the
World, that in order to force a Trade,
they must affect to Write so Learnedly, that
is so obscurely, that they want another
Grammarian to explain them to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of their Readers, and the Reason
of it is plain, because they Write not to
Instruct, but to make a Pompous, tho im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
show of their own Learning.</p>
            <p>I have already observed that <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
drew abundance of Enemies upon
himself by his Writings, some of whom


<pb facs="tcp:63271:18"/>
Attacked him, because he touched them
in their most sensible Part, their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
Others out of Vanity, that it might
be said they had enter'd the Lists with a
Person of his Reputation. And lastly,
some out of down-right Malice and Envy.
The <hi>Monks,</hi> who had Bellies one wou'd
have thought large enough to have some
Bowels in them, cou'd never forgive
him for exposing their Luxury and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
their pretended Visions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
with the rest of their pious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.
The <hi>Lutherans</hi> had a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to him, because he was not one of
their Party, and perhaps <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
who spared the Follies of neither side,
might disgust them, by making bold now
and then with their great Patriarch of
<hi>Wittemberg.</hi> I remember I have
some where Read, that when <hi>Erasmus</hi>
was told that <hi>Luther,</hi> out of his great
desire for an Armful of Consecrated Flesh,
had Married, and got the Famous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine
Bora</hi> with Child; he shou'd in


<pb facs="tcp:63271:18"/>
a jesting manner say, that if according to
the popular Tradition, <hi>Antichrist</hi> was
to be begotten between a Monk and a Nun,
the World was in a fair way now to have
a Litter of <hi>Antichrists.</hi> Such innocent
Freedoms as these, which might fall
from a Man of Wit without any Malice,
I doubt not but Incensed those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
who like the rest of the World
were apt to put the worst Construction upon
every thing that seem'd to Reflect upon
them: But none of his Enemies fell upon
him with that unpresidented Rancour and
Spleen, as the Prince of Pedants <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
the Father. I know I shall incur
the Displeasure of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s Preface, p. 101.</note>Grammarian,
for giving this Character
to a Man, of whom he has said so many
magnificent things, but before I have
concluded this Paragraph, I hope to
convince him that his Heroe deserves it.
The occasion of the Quarrel, in short,
was as follows. <hi>Erasmus</hi> had been so


<pb facs="tcp:63271:19"/>
ill-advised, as to expose the Superstition
of the <hi>Ciceronians,</hi> a set of Rhetorical
Sir <hi>Formal Trifles,</hi> who, (as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Bale</hi> pleasantly expresses himself)
thought there was no Salvation for poor
<hi>Latin</hi> out of the Pale of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Works.
Upon this <hi>Scaliger</hi> declared War against
<hi>Erasmus,</hi> Rails at him in an Oration
composed for that purpose, with the same
Vehemence and Fierceness, as if he had
design'd nothing less than the Extirpation
of all good Learning, and was actually
marching at the Head of a Hundred
Thousand <hi>Goths,</hi> to destroy all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
in <hi>Christendom.</hi> He calls
him Sot and Drunkard, and says, that
when he was Corrector to <hi>Aldus</hi>'s Press,
a thousand Faults escaped him, merely
upon the account of his Drunkenness. In
a Letter not Published, but for the
Scurrility of it Suppressed by his Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
he calls him Son of a Whore. I
appeal now to the Reader, whether any
thing can excuse such insufferable Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,


<pb facs="tcp:63271:19"/>
and ill-manners; or whether if this
be the effect of Learning, a Man has not
good Reason to say with <hi>Nero, Quam vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
me nescire literas.</hi> If the <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geriana</hi>
are the Genuine Sayings of the
Person, whose Name they bear, this
Quarrel is accounted for otherwise; for
<hi>Scaliger</hi> there tells us that his Father
had Written an Oration against <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
which the latter cou'd not believe
was of his Father's Writing, <hi>quià
miles erat,</hi> because he was of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Profession; that his Father Resented
this so heinously, that it drew a second
Oration from him, which <hi>Erasmus</hi> got
his Friends to buy up, and burnt them all;
so that now 'tis no where to be had. And
indeed if <hi>Erasmus</hi> had any <hi>Foible,</hi> he
shew'd it perhaps in his being too sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
touched at the Libells that were
Written against him, as it
appears by the<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 3. l. 21.</note> Complaints
he makes of the Printers of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, 'tis our Comfort that <hi>Erasmus</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:63271:20"/>
is not the only Person, whose Fortune it
was to fall under <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Displeasure.
The same Man has call'd <hi>Horace</hi>'s Latin
in question, condemn'd his Art of Poetry,
and censured <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rules. The
same Man, (for with him like <hi>Zimri</hi> in
<hi>Absolon,</hi> every one is either a God or a
Devil, but generally speaking they are
Devils) has said that all <hi>Ovid</hi>'s slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Stuff<note n="*" place="margin">Lubricitas.</note> is not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that single <hi>Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium</hi>
of <hi>Catullus</hi> upon <hi>Thetis</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and that all <hi>Hesiods</hi> Works ought
not to be put in the same Scale with one
line in the <hi>Georgics.</hi> The same Man has
rogantly Damn'd <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Silius</hi> in a
Breath, who was himself one of the most auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
unnatural Versifiers of his Age, and
pretended to mend <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Poetry, which
he has done to as much purpose as Parson
<hi>Milburn</hi> has mended Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s
Translation of <hi>Virgil.</hi> The same Man
has used <hi>Cardan</hi> worse than the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Insect in Nature, without any


<pb facs="tcp:63271:20"/>
Provocation, in the very same Book, which
he Dedicated to him, tho' the Lord knows
there was no such mighty difference between
them, as to their Philosophy; and has
found Errours in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s and <hi>Gellius</hi>'s
Criticks, who to show the goodness of his
own, preferred the present <hi>Musaeus</hi> to
<hi>Homer.</hi> Lastly, the same Man, (to
give an Instance of his great Sincerity, as
we have given several of his <hi>singular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi>)
pretends that he Writ his <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambic
Hymn</hi> upon <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in less than
two hours, amidst a thousand other Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
that distracted him, which is as
notorious a Truth, as any in Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s
Preface. Yet this is the mighty Man,
whom in Conjunction with <hi>Salmasius,</hi> the
aforesaid Dr. wou'd palm upon us for the
greatest Men of their Age, and what is
very surprizing, for the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of
the Reformation, <hi>who by their Influence
and Example gave such a Spirit
of Learning to it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 102.</note> 
               <hi>as made it
Triumph over its Enemies;</hi> with a
great deal of Rhetorical Fustian to


<pb facs="tcp:63271:21"/>
the same purpose. What great Services
<hi>Scaliger</hi> did to the Reform'd Religion, I
wou'd desire to be informed; and as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mercenary Wretch, 'tis true he play'd
his small Shot at the Popes Primacy, but at
the same time, as far as in him lay, struck
at the whole Episcopal Order, for which I hope
Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> will not thank him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was shamefully bribed to lick up his
own Spittle. But Providence that delights
to humble the Proud, raised up two
Men afterwards to Chaftise this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
pair of Assumers: For <hi>Milton,</hi>
tho' Inferiour to <hi>Salmasius</hi> in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of his Cause, yet with all these
Disadvantages so effectually foiled him
that he broke his Heart; and <hi>Schioppius,</hi>
who was as errant a Grammarian as any
of the Tribe, fell foul upon both the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>'s,
and visited the Iniquities of the
Father upon the Son, who in truth did
not deserve it. This is all I have at
present to say of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> being obliged
to reserve what I have farther to offer
upon this Subject, for the Dissertation I
intend to prefix to the new Translation of
<hi>Lucian</hi>'s Works, done by several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which will be handed to the Press
with all convenient speed.</p>

               <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
               <p>What! wou'd you have had us struck

No, Il gad they were mistaken in their Men, I'll

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ann.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if what you

more on't, but put his Horns in his Pocket.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Every Man of us took his <hi>Cogue</hi> or two of <hi>Nants,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ann.</speaker>
               <p>To see how
we may be deceived now! That such a demure

               <p>Had you seen this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,

               <p>In none of the most <hi>settled</hi> Condition; there are
great Preparations on Foot for <hi>another War;</hi> now
what <hi>Mischief</hi> the <hi>French</hi> may be able to do their
<hi>Neighbours</hi> I don't know, but this I am sure of,
that they are <hi>plagued</hi> at <hi>home</hi> with all the <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
that a Nation can well <hi>suffer.</hi>

               <p>From

wonder.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>From whence do you ask? Why,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63271:25"/>
from the <hi>Ambition</hi> of <hi>Monarchs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>Now, on
the other hand, I shou'd have thought it had
been the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Supreme</hi> Magistrates, by their
Prudence and Authority to <hi>compose</hi> these <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>So one wou'd
have thought, as you say; but under the Rose
your <hi>Princes</hi> extinguish these <hi>Flames,</hi> just for all
the world as <hi>Oyl</hi> puts out <hi>Fire.</hi> They flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they are <hi>God's,</hi> and that the <hi>World</hi> was

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>That's merry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
Now, I was ever such a dull block head as
to believe that <hi>a Prince was made for the People,
and not the People for a Prince.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>What vexes
me most, is that the <hi>Churchmen</hi> lend a <hi>helping</hi> hand
to these <hi>Disorders,</hi> and blow the <hi>Trumpet</hi> to <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
the <hi>cutting</hi> of Throats.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>By my consent
they should be set in the <hi>Front</hi> of the Army,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Why, so say I, and so says all the
world. But a Pox on't, your <hi>Priests</hi> will never
come within harms way; they <hi>love</hi> their <hi>Carcasses</hi>
too well for <hi>that;</hi> tho' they may advise us <hi>Lay-fools</hi>

to a Miracle. I faith I am so charm'd with it,

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63271:26"/>
and an old Quoifure. <hi>I likewise saw a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Glass, whose very bottom, <hi>do ye mind me,</hi>
was very smooth, and very little umbilicate; <hi>but
what pleased me most, was a</hi> young Kitling in an

                  <hi>No, no, I should tire
you but to recite one half of what I observed.</hi>
When a thing is lost, they don't put it in the publick
Prints, <hi>as we doe; but</hi> fix a Printed Paper on the
Wall. Their Streets are lighted even in the Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
Nights. They have Clap Bills too, and set up
by Authority. There are a world of Boats upon the
River, but when a Thaw comes they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being split. They sell Books by Auction,
but have no Bureaus of Ivory. The Pox is the
great Business of the Town. The poor People car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Tin-kettles in the Streets with Small-coal
lighted. Their Roots differ much from ours; they
have no round Turnips, but long ones. Lettice is
the great and universal Sallet, <hi>but it vexed me
to the heart that I cou'd not stay long enough
to see</hi> whether there is more Dust in <hi>Paris</hi> than
in <hi>London. In short their</hi> Fiacres <hi>are easier
than ours; their</hi> Promenades <hi>delicious, their</hi>
Postchoises <hi>very convenient, their</hi> Pavillons <hi>are
Surprizing, the Decorations of their</hi> Treillages
<hi>admirable, their</hi> Couches <hi>finely laid out, and
their</hi> Champignons <hi>and</hi> Moriglios <hi>beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>Your Servant, Sir, I swear I could

               <p>Have a care what you doe, Friend <hi>Martin,
Increase</hi> and <hi>Multiply</hi> was the first Commandment.
You were once of opinion to my knowledge, that
<hi>Propagation was intirely necessary that Mankind
might be like the Stars in the Firmament, or the
Shells and Sand upon the Sea Shore,</hi> and why you that
are a <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> should quarrel with your Maid for
learning a little natural Philosophy, I can't see.
But I find you are in hast, and so farewel.</p>

               <p>They'll tell you,
that to owe <hi>much,</hi> and especially to a <hi>world</hi> of

               <p>True, and so they wou'd if they

               <p>Your Com laint is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason; for certainly 'tis the greatest <hi>Barbarity</hi>
that can be committed; and yet your People of
<hi>Condition</hi> (as they call themselves) make but a <hi>jest</hi>
of it; tho' one wou'd think that it <hi>highly</hi> concern'd
those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that are born to the <hi>highest</hi> Posts
of the <hi>Government,</hi> and are one day to make <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> to take some care
of their <hi>Health;</hi> for let them say, what they will to
the contrary, the <hi>Body</hi> has a great Influence upon
the Operations of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Now this exerable
<hi>Disease</hi> undermines the whole <hi>Fabric,</hi> and at long
run does not leave a Man so much <hi>Brain</hi> as wou'd
fill a <hi>Nut-shell.</hi> And thus it comes about that we
frequently see some <hi>Noble Persons</hi> sitting at the

               <p>In my opinion, your Great

Rank, ought not only to have their <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
clear and strong, and a <hi>healthful</hi> Constitution of
Body, but if it were possible shou'd <hi>excel</hi> other Men
in the <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Gracefulness</hi> of their Persons, as
much as they do in <hi>Quality;</hi> for tho' <hi>Iustice</hi> and
<hi>Wisdom</hi> are the <hi>principal</hi> Ingredients in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and chiefly recommend him to
the <hi>Love</hi> of his People; yet there's <hi>something</hi> too
to be said for his <hi>shape</hi> and outside. If he proves a
<hi>morose</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> Governor, the <hi>deformity</hi> of his
Body helps to make him still more <hi>Odious</hi> to his
Subjects; and if he is <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>Affable,</hi> his
<hi>Vertues</hi> derive some <hi>agreeableness</hi> from the <hi>beauty</hi> of
the Place where they Inhabit.</p>

               <p>Why wou'd you call that
Physician a <hi>Tyrant</hi> that lopps off a Finger or two,
or it may be burns <hi>part</hi> of the Body, to save the
<hi>whole?</hi> For my part I don't think it <hi>Cruelty,</hi> but
the highest Act of <hi>Pity</hi> that can be exerted, and it
were to be <hi>wished</hi> that this <hi>Course</hi> had been taken
when this <hi>Distemper</hi> first <hi>appeared</hi> in the World,
for then the <hi>publick</hi> Welfare of Mankind had been
consulted at the Expence of a <hi>few</hi> Sufferers. Nay,
the <hi>French</hi> History presents as with an Instance of
this Nature.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ga.</speaker>
               <p>And what wou'd you have done to the <hi>Women,</hi>

               <speaker>Pe.</speaker>
               <p>You know <hi>Italy</hi> affords a certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ga.</speaker>
               <p>That is something
indeed, for by this means we shou'd be sure to
have no <hi>Branches</hi> from so blessed a <hi>Stock;</hi> Come,
I will own your Method to be the <hi>gentler</hi> of the
two, provided you'll in Compliment own that


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63271:39"/>
mine is the <hi>safer.</hi> Even those that are <hi>castrated</hi>
have an itching desire upon them, neither is this
Infection propagated by <hi>one</hi> way only, but a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;</hi>
a bare <hi>kiss</hi> or <hi>touch</hi> may do it, nay, it may
be got by <hi>Discoursing</hi> or <hi>Drinking</hi> with the Party <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
Besides, we find that an unaccountable
<hi>Spirit</hi> of doing Mischief is <hi>peculiar</hi> to this Disease;
for those that have it take a <hi>delight</hi> to propagate
the <hi>Contagion,</hi> tho' it does them no good. Now,
if you talk of <hi>parting</hi> them asunder, they may
<hi>scamper</hi> to other Places, and play the <hi>Devil</hi> where
they are not known; but I hope you'll grant me
there can be no danger from the <hi>Dead.</hi>

               <p>And yet we <hi>Christians,</hi> forsooth
truss up a score of <hi>House-breakers</hi> and <hi>Fellons</hi> every

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pe.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but in that case
the Party that did the <hi>Injury,</hi> is fairly <hi>hanged</hi> out
of the way.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And are the others then such
<hi>mighty</hi> Benefactors to the <hi>Publick?</hi> Let us for
once suppose that some may get this Distemper by
no <hi>Fault</hi> of their own, tho' under Favour I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that not one in ten thousand, but <hi>purchased</hi>
it at the Price of his own <hi>Wickedness,</hi> yet the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
will tell you that 'tis Lawful to dispatch the
<hi>Innocent,</hi> if the common Safety of the <hi>Republick</hi>
requires it. For this Reason the <hi>Grecians</hi> after the
Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> put <hi>Astyanax, Hector</hi>'s Son to


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63271:39"/>
the Sword, least he might live to <hi>begin</hi> the War
<hi>afresh.</hi> Nay, some Casuists will not stick to tell you,
that after you have cut a <hi>Tyrant</hi>'s Throat, 'tis no
Sin to kill his innocent <hi>Children.</hi> To carry on this
point yet farther, we fine People, that call our
selves <hi>Christians,</hi> are perpetually at <hi>War</hi> with one
another, tho' we know before hand that the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
share of the <hi>Calamities,</hi> occasion'd by <hi>War,</hi>
must light upon those <hi>poor.</hi> Men that least <hi>deserve</hi>
them. The same thing happens in your <hi>Reprisals,</hi>
or <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Mart,</hi> as they call them. The Party
that did the <hi>Wrong</hi> is as <hi>safe</hi> as a Knave in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,</hi>
or <hi>Excise</hi> Office, but the poor <hi>Merchant,</hi>
who is so far from being <hi>Criminal,</hi> that perhaps he
never <hi>heard</hi> a Syllable of the Matter in his Life, is
fairly <hi>plunder'd</hi> and <hi>stript</hi> of all. Now if we have
recourse to such <hi>bitter</hi> Remedies in things, that are
not of the <hi>last</hi> Consequence, I desire to be inform'd
what course ought to be taken in an Affair which
so <hi>highly</hi> concerns us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pe.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I must knock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Table. Your Arguments are too mighty for
me to cope with.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ga.</speaker>
               <p>Take this with you too.
So soon as the <hi>Plague</hi> breaks out in <hi>Italy,</hi> great care
is taken to <hi>shut</hi> up the Infected <hi>house,</hi> and the <hi>Nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
that look after the <hi>Sick,</hi> are forbidden to appear
<hi>abroad.</hi> Some <hi>Sots</hi> call this <hi>barbarous</hi> Usage;
whereas 'tis the greatest <hi>Humanity</hi> that can be
shown; for by this <hi>prudent</hi> Care the <hi>Pestilence</hi>
sweeps off some half a <hi>dozen</hi> Folks, and then you
hear no <hi>more</hi> of it; now, can any thing show more
<hi>Humanity,</hi> than to save the Lives of many <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi>
at so <hi>cheap</hi> a rate. Others will rail at the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians</hi>
as a brutal inhospitable People, because
when there's but a bare <hi>Report</hi> of a Plague, they
won't suffer a <hi>Stranger</hi> to come within their <hi>Cities</hi>
in the Evening, but force him to lye all Night in


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63271:40"/>
the open Fields. Now, for my part I look upon
it to be Act of Piety, to procure a <hi>publick</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
at so <hi>easie</hi> a Price, as the incommoding of a
<hi>few</hi> Persons. Some <hi>Coxcombs</hi> in the World take
themselves to be very <hi>Stout</hi> and <hi>Complaisant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they dare make a <hi>Visit</hi> to a Man who is
Sick of the <hi>Plague,</hi> tho' they have no manner of
<hi>Business</hi> with him; so when they come <hi>Home,</hi> they
very fairly give the <hi>Infection</hi> to their Wives and
Children, and, in short, to the whole Family.
Nothing can be more <hi>stupid</hi> than this <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardiness,</hi>
more unreasonable than this <hi>Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance?</hi>
To bring the <hi>dearest</hi> Persons one has in the
World in danger of their Lives merely for the sake
of a <hi>foolish</hi> Compliment or so; yet, after all, there's
less to be apprehended from the <hi>Plague</hi> than from
the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Disease: The former seldom <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi>
with the <hi>Old,</hi> and sometimes passes by its next
<hi>Neighbours;</hi> at least, this may be said for it, that
it either <hi>quickly</hi> dispatches a Man out of his Pain,
or restores him to his <hi>Health</hi> much <hi>sounder</hi> than he
was before; whereas the <hi>latter</hi> is nothing but a
perpetual <hi>Death,</hi> or, to speak more properly, a
perpetual <hi>Burying.</hi> They are cover'd from Head
to Foot with <hi>Plaisters</hi> and <hi>Cataplasms,</hi> with <hi>Salves</hi>
and <hi>Vnguents,</hi> and a thousand other <hi>Medicaments</hi>
too nauseous to be mention'd out of an <hi>Hospital.</hi>

               <p>What you say is so true, that with reverence
to our <hi>Betters</hi> be it spoken, the same Care at least
ought to be taken to prevent so <hi>Fatal</hi> an Evil, as
they take to <hi>prevent</hi> the spreading of the <hi>Leprosy;</hi>
or if this should be thought too much, no Man

               <p>In what part of the World I wonder?
Perhaps thou hast been <hi>starv'd</hi> and <hi>bastinado'd</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>There was an <hi>Account</hi> of a long standing to

               <p>So <hi>Slender,</hi>

               <p>A plague on't, there was no want

our most <hi>worthy</hi> Landlord, old <hi>Scrape-all,</hi> to save

<hi>Servants</hi> to steal old <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Stumps</hi> of Trees,
which no one else thought <hi>worth</hi> the while to
grub up but <hi>himself,</hi> and had them brought home
<hi>privately</hi> in the Night. Of these <hi>precious</hi> Stumps
not a quarter <hi>dried</hi> enough, our Fire was made,
which to do it Justice smoaked <hi>plentifully,</hi> but
never <hi>flamed</hi> out; so that tho it did not <hi>warm</hi>
us, we cou'd not say there was no <hi>Fire,</hi> and


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63271:43"/>
that was all our <hi>Landlord</hi> aimed at. One of
these Fires wou'd last us a <hi>whole</hi> day, so <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi>
did these <hi>perverse,</hi> knotty <hi>Loggs</hi> hold it out.</p>

               <p>Why, this was a <hi>cursed</hi> place for a Man to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas so, and yet 'twas

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>How cou'd that be I wonder?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>Because
the House was so damnably <hi>plagued</hi> with Fleas,

for them in the day time, nor no <hi>sleeping</hi> in the
night.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>Few Men I must own, were <hi>Wealthier</hi> than our

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Surely you had no
<hi>Women</hi> in the Family, or else they were heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
lazy <hi>Sluts.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Females</hi> were mew'd
up in an <hi>Apartment</hi> by themselves, and seldom
came among the <hi>Men,</hi> so they did none of those
<hi>Services</hi> which properly belong to that <hi>Sex</hi> in other
Families.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>But how cou'd the <hi>Master</hi> of the
House <hi>endure</hi> all this Filth and Nastiness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>Pshaw! he was <hi>used</hi> to it from his Cradle, and
<hi>minded</hi> nothing in the World but scraping of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
He lov'd to be any where but at <hi>Home,</hi>
and Traded in every thing you can think off;
for <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> you know is a Town of great <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi>
and <hi>Business.</hi> The famous <hi>Painter,</hi> whose
Name is now out of my Head, thought the day
<hi>lost</hi> wherein he did not employ his <hi>Pencil,</hi> and
our <hi>Lanlord</hi> looked upon himself as <hi>undone,</hi> if one
single day pass'd over his Head without some
<hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Advantage;</hi> and if such a <hi>Disaster</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to him, he did not fail to <hi>make</hi> it <hi>out</hi> one
way or other at <hi>Home.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what was his
<hi>Method?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>He had a <hi>Cistern</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> in his
Court-yard, as most of the People of that <hi>City</hi>
have, out of which he <hi>drew</hi> so many Buckets of


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63271:43"/>
                  <hi>Cold Adam,</hi> and flung them into his Hogsheads:
This was a most <hi>certain</hi> profit to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Wine was somewhat of the <hi>strongest</hi> then,
and wanted this <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>Far from that,
it was as <hi>dead</hi> as a Door-nail, for he never
bought any Wine but what was <hi>decay'd</hi> to his Hand,
to have it at an <hi>easier</hi> Rate; and that he might
not <hi>lose</hi> a drop of this <hi>Gut-griping</hi> stuff, he wou'd
jumble and tumble ye the <hi>Grounds</hi> of, at least,
Ten <hi>Years</hi> standing, and set them a <hi>fermenting</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that it might pass for <hi>New Wine</hi> upon the
<hi>Lee;</hi> for, as I told you before, he wou'd not have
lost the least <hi>pint-full</hi> of <hi>Grounds</hi> to save his
<hi>Grandfather</hi>'s Soul.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>If the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s word may
be taken, this sort of Wine never fails to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
a Man with the <hi>Stone</hi> at long run.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>They
are certainly in the <hi>right</hi> on't, and in the most
<hi>healthful</hi> years <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> at least of the <hi>Family</hi>
had their Heels <hi>tript</hi> up with this <hi>Distemper.</hi> But
what was this to <hi>Monsieur le Maigre?</hi> He never
<hi>troubled</hi> his Head about the Business, nor car'd a
farthing how many <hi>Burials</hi> went out of his House,
not he I promise you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis strange, but what
was the reason?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>He made a Penny even of
the <hi>Dead,</hi> and the <hi>Grave</hi> paid a <hi>Tribute</hi> to him.
There was no gain so <hi>contemptible</hi> and <hi>base</hi> but
what he wou'd <hi>catch</hi> at as greedily as a Gudgeon
at a Fly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Under favour, this was downright <hi>Theft</hi>
though.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>Your <hi>Merchants</hi> call it turning an
<hi>honest penny,</hi> or Christen it by the Name of <hi>good
Husbandry.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but what sort of <hi>Liquor</hi>
did the old <hi>Huncks</hi> drink all this while?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>The
very same <hi>Nectar</hi> almost that I told you of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>And did he find no <hi>harm,</hi> no <hi>inconvenience</hi> by it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>You know the old Proverb, <hi>No Carrion will
Kill a Crow.</hi> Besides, he had a <hi>Body</hi> as hard as a


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63271:44"/>
Flint, and cou'd have made a <hi>hearty</hi> Meal upon
<hi>Hay</hi> or chopt <hi>Straw.</hi> Had he been in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar's</hi>
Case, it had been no <hi>Punishment</hi> to have
sent him to <hi>Grass.</hi> The <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> in the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
when he <hi>robb'd</hi> the poor Swine and fed upon
<hi>Husks</hi> was a perfect <hi>Epicure</hi> to him; He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd
himself to this <hi>delicious</hi> Fare from his
<hi>Infancy.</hi> But to return to our Subject. He looked
upon this <hi>Dashing</hi> and <hi>Brewing</hi> of his Wine to be
a most <hi>certain</hi> Profit to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>How so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>You'll <hi>soon</hi> find it out by the help
of a very little <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> If you <hi>reckon</hi> his
Wife, his Sons, his Daughter, his Son-in-law,
his Men servants, and his Maid servants, he had
about <hi>Thirty three</hi> Mouths to provide for in the
Family: Now the more he <hi>Corrected</hi> his Wine
with <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>less</hi> of it was drunk, and the
<hi>longer</hi> it was a drawing off. So then, if you
Compute a <hi>large</hi> Bucket of Water thrown in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>day</hi> of the Week, it will amount to no <hi>despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi>
Summ, let me tell you, at the <hi>Year's</hi> end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Oh! <hi>sordid</hi> Raskal! I never heard of such a

               <p>This was not <hi>all,</hi> he made

               <p>He wou'd

and such as the <hi>meanest</hi> Porter in the City wou'd
<hi>scorn</hi> to buy for his own <hi>Eating.</hi> Now in the first

it so much <hi>Cheaper,</hi> and then he had a <hi>never-failing</hi>

               <p>I long to hear

               <p>There is a sort of <hi>Chalk,</hi> if you
have observ'd it, not altogether unlike to <hi>Corn,</hi>
which you may see <hi>Horses</hi> are <hi>delighted</hi> with, when
they <hi>gnaw</hi> it out of the Walls, and <hi>Drink</hi> more
<hi>freely</hi> than usual of that <hi>Pond water,</hi> where this


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63271:44"/>
                  <hi>Chalk</hi> is to be found. He mixed one <hi>Third</hi> part

               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>I know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that it made the <hi>Mustiness</hi> of the Corn to
be not altogether so <hi>perceivable.</hi> Now tell me,
was not this a <hi>considerable</hi> Profit? Besides, he had
another <hi>Stratagem</hi> in reserve, for he <hi>Baked</hi> his own
Bread at Home, which in the very midst of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
he never did oftner than <hi>twice</hi> a Month.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why surely it must be as <hi>hard</hi> as Marble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>And
<hi>harder</hi> if 'tis possible; but we had a <hi>Remedy</hi> at

               <p>Perhaps <hi>worse</hi> than the

               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>With much tugging

               <p>First let

               <p>It was as bad as <hi>Treason</hi> to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that <hi>Apochryphal</hi> Word, <hi>Breakfast</hi> in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and as for <hi>Dinner,</hi> it was generally deferr'd
till <hi>One</hi> of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>We were obliged, you may think, in
<hi>good Manners</hi> to stay till the <hi>Master</hi> of the Family
came <hi>Home,</hi> and we seldom <hi>Supt</hi> before <hi>Ten.</hi>

               <p>Well but old Friend of mine, how cou'd your
<hi>Stomach</hi> brook to be <hi>post-poned</hi> so? I have known
the time when it was not <hi>endued</hi> with this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Gift of <hi>Christian</hi> Patience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gi.</speaker>
               <p>You shall
<hi>hear.</hi> I called every other Moment upon our
Landlord's Son-in-law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who lay upon the same
Floor with my self; <hi>Ho</hi> I <hi>Monsieur,</hi> said I, <hi>do ye
make no Dining here at</hi> Bourdeaux? <hi>For the Lord's
sake, Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>stay a little, my Father will be


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63271:45"/>
here in a minute.</hi> Finding not the least motion
towards <hi>Dinner,</hi> and my <hi>Guts</hi> very mutinous, <hi>hark
you Friend,</hi> cry'd I, <hi>will you starve us here?</hi> The
courteous <hi>Gentleman</hi> begg'd my pardon once more,
and desired an <hi>Hour</hi> longer, or some such
<hi>trifle.</hi> Being <hi>unable</hi> any longer to bear the <hi>cursed</hi>
Clamor which my <hi>Bowels</hi> made, I bawl'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as loud as my <hi>Lungs</hi> wou'd give me leave,
<hi>the Devil's in this Family I think, what must we be
all famished?</hi> When the <hi>Monsieur</hi> found that he
had no more <hi>Excuses</hi> to make, he went down to
the Servants and <hi>ordered</hi> them to lay the <hi>Cloath;</hi>
all this while no <hi>Master</hi> of the House came, and
<hi>Dinner</hi> seem'd to be as <hi>far off</hi> as ever; so the Son-in-law
<hi>wearied</hi> with the <hi>Complaints</hi> I perpetually
<hi>rattled</hi> in his Ears, went to the <hi>Apartment</hi> where
his Wife, and Mother, and Children were, and
desired them to give Orders for <hi>Dinner.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, now I <hi>expect</hi> to hear how your <hi>Entertainment</hi>
was served in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Pray ben't so <hi>hasty.</hi> At last a
lame ill favoured <hi>Fellow,</hi> such as they paint <hi>Vulcan,</hi>
lay'd the Napkins upon the Table, for that it seems
was his <hi>Province.</hi> This was the <hi>first</hi> step made
towards <hi>Dinner,</hi> and about an <hi>hour</hi> after, two
glass Bottles fill'd with <hi>Water</hi> were brought into
the Room, but not till I had made my self as <hi>hoarse</hi>
as a <hi>More-field Organ</hi> with calling to them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Here's <hi>another</hi> step I see towards <hi>Dinner.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Don't be so <hi>hasty</hi> I tell you. At a considerable <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of time, but not without a world of <hi>knocking,</hi>
and <hi>bawling,</hi> and <hi>quarelling,</hi> a Bottle of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Wine,</hi> but as <hi>thick</hi> as <hi>Dishwater,</hi> was set
upon the side-board.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>That's <hi>well,</hi> however.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>But not a jot of <hi>Bread</hi> came along with it, tho
there was no great danger we shou'd touch it; for
one of</p>

wou'd have <hi>refused</hi> such Stuff. We bawl'd and
<hi>roar'd</hi> again, till we had almost <hi>split</hi> our Wind-pipes,
and at last the <hi>Bread</hi> appeared, but so <hi>rock<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>hard,</hi> that I wou'd defie the <hi>strongest</hi> Bear in
<hi>Muscovy</hi> to break it asunder with his <hi>Iaws.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but now there was no <hi>danger</hi> of starving,
which is a <hi>blessing</hi> you know?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Late in the
afternoon our Worshipful <hi>Landlord</hi> came home,
and generally with this <hi>unlucky</hi> pretence that his
Belly <hi>aked.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why, what the Plague was that

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Only <hi>this much</hi> that
then we went <hi>fasting</hi> to Bed; for who cou'd have
the <hi>Ill Manners</hi> to think of <hi>eating,</hi> when the <hi>Master</hi>
of the House was out of <hi>order.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>But was he

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>So <hi>very</hi> sick, that he wou'd have
devoured ye a <hi>rump</hi> of Beef and a couple of <hi>Capons</hi>
if you wou'd have <hi>Treated</hi> him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Now,
Sir, if you please to let me know your <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Fare.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, there was served in a <hi>little</hi>
Plateful of <hi>Gray-pease,</hi> which the Women there <hi>cry</hi>
about the Streets, and sell to <hi>ordinary</hi> People; and
this <hi>Regale</hi> was for the old <hi>Gentleman's</hi> own eating.
He pretended that this was his Remedy against all
Diseases.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>How many were there of you that
sat down to Table?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes eight or
nine, among whom was Monsieur <hi>Baudin,</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> to whose <hi>Character</hi> I suppose you
are no <hi>stranger,</hi> and our Landlord's eldest <hi>Son.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>And what had they set before them to eat?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>What? why, the same that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>
offer'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had Conquer'd the
<hi>five Kings.</hi> And was not that <hi>enough</hi> in conscience
for any <hi>reasonable</hi> Man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>But had you no
Meat at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but very little, God
knows. I remember that once <hi>nine</hi> of us
sate down to <hi>Dinner,</hi> but may I pass <hi>another</hi> Winter


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63271:46"/>
there, if we had any thing else but <hi>seven</hi> small
<hi>Lettice-leaves,</hi> swimming most daintily in <hi>Vinegar,</hi>
but not a jot of <hi>Oyl</hi> to bear them company.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but did old <hi>Pinch-gut</hi> devour all his <hi>Gray-pease</hi>
by himself?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>You must know, he bought
but a <hi>Farthings</hi> worth of them; however, he did
not absolutely <hi>forbid</hi> those that sat <hi>next</hi> him to
<hi>tast</hi> them; but it looked somewhat <hi>Clownish,</hi> or
worse to rob a <hi>sick</hi> Man of his <hi>Victuals.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>But
were not your Lettice-leaves split with great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
to make the greater show.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Why, truly
no, that I must needs say; and when those that
sate at the <hi>upper</hi> end of the Table had <hi>eaten</hi> these
Leaves, the rest of the <hi>Guests</hi> sopp'd their
<hi>Bread</hi> in the Vinegar, and eat it in their own
<hi>Defence.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>And what I pray came after
these <hi>seven Lettice-leaves.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>A very <hi>merry</hi>
Question Ifaith. <hi>What came after?</hi> Why, what
but the constant <hi>Epilogue</hi> of all <hi>Dinners,</hi> the <hi>Cheese.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Pardon my Curiosity, but was this your <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Fare?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generally</hi> speaking it was, but <hi>now</hi>
and <hi>then</hi> when the old <hi>Gentleman</hi> had the <hi>good</hi>
Luck to <hi>over-reach</hi> any one in the way of <hi>Trade,</hi>
he wou'd be a little more <hi>open hearted.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>I long
to know how he <hi>Entertained</hi> you <hi>then.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Upon
<hi>such</hi> an occasion he wou'd so far play the <hi>Prodigal,</hi>
as to lay ye out a <hi>whole</hi> Penny, with which he
wou'd order <hi>three</hi> fresh Bunches of <hi>Grapes</hi> to be
bought. On such an <hi>extravagant</hi> gaudy Day as
this, the <hi>Family</hi> was like to run out of their <hi>Wits.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>And had but too much <hi>Reason</hi> for't, by what
I perceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>We were <hi>regall'd</hi> in this manner
never but when Grapes were <hi>dog cheap.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>So
then I find he never <hi>treated</hi> you but in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, hang him, he did. You have
<hi>Fishermen</hi> there that take ye a world of <hi>Cockles,</hi>


                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63271:46"/>
and chiefly out of the <hi>Common-Shores,</hi> which they
<hi>Cry</hi> about the Streets. In this precious <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
he wou'd sometimes out of his great <hi>Generosity</hi>
lay out an <hi>Half-penny.</hi> You'd have sworn then
that we had a <hi>Wedding Feast</hi> in the Family: There
was a <hi>Fire</hi> made in the Kitchin, tho' not very
<hi>great,</hi> for these Cockles you must understand are
boyl'd in a <hi>minute.</hi> This rare <hi>Dish</hi> came always

               <p>A most extraordinary <hi>Desert</hi> upon my word.

               <p>At last the Old
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> wearied and overcome with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
I made him, began to be somewhat
more <hi>splendid</hi> in his Eating. Now when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to play the <hi>Epicure</hi> in good earnest, the
Bill of Fare was as follows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>I shall imagine my
self now at <hi>Lockets,</hi> or the <hi>Blew Posts</hi> in the <hi>Hay-Market.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> We had a Dish of <hi>Soop</hi>
season'd with the following <hi>Spices.</hi> They took
you a large Kettle of <hi>Water</hi> and set it over the
Fire; into it they flung several <hi>pieces</hi> of Skimm'd-Milk
<hi>Cheese,</hi> but as hard as <hi>Iron.</hi> In short, there
was no hewing of it without a good Hatchet. At
last these <hi>venerable</hi> Fragments of <hi>Cheese</hi> wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to grow a little <hi>better natured,</hi> by Virtue of
the Fire beneath, and then they <hi>discoloured</hi> the
abovemention'd <hi>Water</hi> so <hi>prettily,</hi> that a Man cou'd
not positively say 'twas meer <hi>Element.</hi> Now, Sir,
this <hi>Soop</hi> was brought in as a <hi>preparative</hi> for the
<hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soop</hi> do ye call it; 'twas only fit
for the <hi>Hogs.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>When <hi>this</hi> was taken away,
we had in the next place a small <hi>dimunitive</hi> Dish
of <hi>Tripe,</hi> that was boyled at least <hi>fifteen</hi> days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Surely then it stunk most <hi>egregiously.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>It did so; but we had a <hi>trick</hi> to help that.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I am <hi>afraid</hi> you'll use

            <sp>

               <p>Ay marry, Sir,
there's great <hi>danger</hi> of that.</p>

               <p>They wou'd put
ye an <hi>Egg</hi> or two into warm <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> them
well together, then they <hi>daubed</hi> the <hi>Tripe</hi> over
with this Liquor. By this means your <hi>Eyes</hi> were
cheated, but 'twas impossible to cheat your <hi>Nose,</hi>
for the <hi>stink,</hi> I warrant ye, wou'd force its way
through a <hi>Stone Wall.</hi> If it happen'd to be a <hi>Fish</hi>
day, we had sometimes three <hi>Whitings,</hi> and
those the <hi>smallest</hi> the Market afforded, tho
there were <hi>seven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> of us at Table.</p>

               <p>Nothing but that confounded <hi>Cheese</hi> I told you of,

               <p>Well, <hi>Monsieur le Maigre</hi> is the

Guests of you, especially since you had no <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi>
to blunt the <hi>edge</hi> of your <hi>Stomachs?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay
Sir, I shall increase your wonder when I tell you
that the <hi>remainders</hi> of our Dinner <hi>fed</hi> the Mother-in-lay,
and the Daughter-in-law, the youngest
Son, a Servant maid, and a <hi>Litter</hi> of Children.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>You have indeed; 'tis now a <hi>greater Riddle</hi> to
me than before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis impossible for me to
<hi>explain</hi> this difficulty to you, until I first <hi>represent</hi>
to you in what <hi>Order</hi> we sat at <hi>Table.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Let
me beg that <hi>favour</hi> of you then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Our <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord</hi>
sat at the upper end, and <hi>my Worship</hi> on the
right hand of him; his Son-in-law <hi>Monsieur Peu</hi>
directly overagainst our <hi>Landlord; Monsieur Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>
sat next to <hi>Monsieur Peu,</hi> and one <hi>Constantine</hi>
a <hi>Grecian</hi> next to him: But I forgot to tell you, that


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63271:47"/>
our <hi>Landlord</hi>'s Eldest <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Heir</hi> apparent of
the <hi>Family,</hi> sat on his <hi>Father</hi>'s left hand. If any
<hi>Stranger</hi> came to Dine with us, he was <hi>placed</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his <hi>Quality.</hi> As for the <hi>Soop,</hi> there
was no great danger of its being <hi>eaten</hi> up; but
you must know that in the Plates of those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who had the honour of being
chiefly in our Landlord's good Graces, a few lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Bits</hi> of the damn'd <hi>Cheese</hi> above-mentioned
<hi>floated</hi> up and down, and looked like the <hi>Maldivy</hi>
Islands in a Map of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> This <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable</hi>
Hog-wash was encompassed with some four
or five <hi>Bottles</hi> that held Wine and Water, which
form'd a sort of a <hi>Barricado,</hi> so that <hi>no body</hi> cou'd
reach his Spoon to it, except the <hi>Three</hi> before
whom the Dish stood, unless he had a mind to be
very <hi>Impudent</hi> indeed, and <hi>Scale</hi> the Walls of the
<hi>Garrison:</hi> However this <hi>Dish</hi> did not stay there
<hi>long,</hi> but was soon <hi>taken away</hi> that something might
be left for the <hi>Family.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>How did the <hi>rest</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselves all this while, I pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Why,
they <hi>regaled</hi> themselves after the old <hi>delicious</hi>
manner; they soak'd their <hi>Bread,</hi> which as I told
you before, was half <hi>Wheat</hi> and half <hi>Chalk,</hi> in
that sowr thick nasty <hi>Wine,</hi> and so fed upon't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Your Dinner certainly used to be over in a
<hi>minute.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>You are mistaken, it held above an

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>I can't imagine how that cou'd be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>After the Servants had taken away the <hi>Soop,</hi> which
you may remember was none of the most <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
fare, the Cheese was set upon the Table,
which run no great risque of being much <hi>demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,</hi>
for it defyed the <hi>sharpest</hi> Knife that ever
appeared at the <hi>keenest</hi> Ordinary. Every Man's
<hi>Portion</hi> of Bread and Wine stood before him still,
and over these <hi>Dantios</hi> we were at leisure to <hi>Chat,</hi>


                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:63271:48"/>
and tell <hi>Stories,</hi> and <hi>divert</hi> our selves; in the mean
time the <hi>Women</hi> Dined.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>But how did the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>They had nothing
in <hi>Common</hi> with us, but Dined and Supt at their
own Hours: But this I must tell you, that take
the <hi>whole</hi> day, they did not spend above <hi>half</hi> an
hour at their Victuals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>I desire once more
to know how they were <hi>served?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>You need
not give me that <hi>trouble,</hi> but may easily <hi>guess.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Your <hi>Germans</hi> now think an <hi>Hour</hi> too little
to <hi>Breakfast</hi> in; they take the same time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
at their <hi>Beaver;</hi> an <hi>hour</hi> and <hi>half</hi> at least
goes at <hi>Dinner,</hi> and at least <hi>two hours</hi> at <hi>Supper;</hi>
Then unless their <hi>Bellies</hi> are well fill'd with the best
<hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> of all sorts, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<hi>discard</hi> their Masters, and run to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>

               <p>Every Nation has its peculiar <hi>Genius</hi>
and way of Living. The <hi>Italians</hi> bestow but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>little</hi> upon their <hi>Bellies;</hi> they wou'd rather
you shou'd give them a piece of <hi>Money</hi> than the

they rather owe to <hi>Nature</hi> than <hi>Custome.</hi>

               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Well, now I don't wonder that you are come
Home so <hi>Lean,</hi> but rather how you cou'd make
a <hi>shift</hi> to keep Body and Soul together <hi>so long,</hi>
since to my <hi>knowledge</hi> you were so <hi>used</hi> to Capons,
and Patridges, and Pigeons, and Pheasants, with
a long <hi>Et Cetera</hi> too tedious to be mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Why Troth I had very fairly <hi>trooped</hi> off, if
I had not <hi>bethought</hi> my self of due <hi>Remedies.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>The World went very <hi>ill</hi> with you for certain,
when you were forced to <hi>Bettress</hi> it with these
<hi>Remedies</hi> as you call them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>I brought matters
about so, that I had the <hi>fourth</hi> part of a boyled
<hi>Pullet</hi> allow'd me every <hi>meal,</hi> to keep up my
<hi>languishing</hi> Spirits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ja.</speaker>
               <p>Ay marry, now you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

to <hi>live.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Not altogether so <hi>well</hi> as you
imagine. Old <hi>Gripe</hi> bought the <hi>Pullets</hi> himself,
but they were the <hi>least</hi> he cou'd lay his Hands on,
to save <hi>Expences.</hi> I dare engage that <hi>six</hi> of them
wou'd not serve a <hi>Polander</hi> of a <hi>tolerable</hi> Stomach
to make his <hi>breakfast</hi> on; and when he had <hi>bought</hi>
them he wou'd not <hi>give</hi> them the least <hi>corn,</hi> because
forsooth he wou'd not put himself to <hi>extraordinary</hi>
Charges. Thus a <hi>Wing</hi> or a <hi>Leg</hi> of the poor <hi>Fowl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
that was half starved before they put it into the
Pot, fell to my share, and the <hi>Liver</hi> always went
to Monsieur <hi>Peu</hi>'s little <hi>Son.</hi> As for the <hi>Broth</hi>
they made of it, the Women perpetually <hi>lapp'd</hi>
it up, and every other minute wou'd put you fresh
<hi>Water</hi> into the Pot, to make this <hi>precious</hi> Pottage
hold out the <hi>longer.</hi> Now when it was perfectly
boil'd to <hi>Rags,</hi> and as dry as a <hi>Chip,</hi> a Leg of it or
so came to your humble Servant. The <hi>Broth</hi> was
nothing in the world but <hi>Water bewitched,</hi> if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
so good a Name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>And yet People
tell me that you have all sorts of <hi>Fowl</hi> there in
great <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> and exceeding <hi>cheap.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis even so, but <hi>Mony</hi> is harder to come by.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>You have done <hi>Pennance</hi> enough one wou'd
think, tho' you have knocked the old <hi>Gentleman</hi>
at the <hi>Vatican</hi> in the Head, or <hi>untruss'd</hi> a Point
upon S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tomb.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>But hear the rest of
the <hi>Farce</hi> out. You know there are <hi>five days</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Week, on which 'tis lawful to eat <hi>Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and what of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>So our <hi>Landlord</hi>
made two <hi>Pullets</hi> last the whole Week; for on
<hi>Thursday</hi> he wou'd pretend that he forgot to go to
<hi>Market,</hi> least he should be obliged to spend a <hi>whole</hi>
Pullet on that day, or least any of it should be <hi>left</hi>
to the Servants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>By what I perceive, your
<hi>Landlord</hi> was ten times a greater <hi>Miser</hi> than <hi>Enelio</hi>


                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:63271:49"/>
in <hi>Plantus.</hi> But on <hi>Fish days</hi> what course did ye
take I wonder to keep your self alive?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
a certain Friend of mine to buy me three
<hi>Eggs</hi> every morning with my own Mony; two for
<hi>Dinner,</hi> and one for <hi>Supper.</hi> But here the <hi>Women</hi>
play'd the <hi>Devil</hi> with me; for instead of <hi>new laid</hi>
Eggs, (and I'm sure I <hi>paid</hi> as if they had been such)
they wou'd give me <hi>rotten</hi> ones, such as were only fit
to be levell'd at a <hi>Pillory:</hi> So that I thought my self
very <hi>kindly</hi> and <hi>courteously</hi> dealt with indeed; if <hi>one</hi>
of my <hi>three</hi> Eggs proved eatable. I likewise
bought me some <hi>Flasks</hi> of good <hi>Wine</hi> for my own
drinking, but those everlasting <hi>Harpyes</hi> the <hi>Women</hi>
broke up my Cellar door, and in a few days did
not <hi>leave</hi> me a <hi>drop;</hi> neither was our most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Landlord</hi> much <hi>displeas'd</hi> at the Matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Take pitty,</hi> say you? No,
they call'd me <hi>Glutton</hi> and <hi>Cormorant,</hi> and rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<hi>Monster</hi> that wou'd certainly bring a <hi>Famine</hi>
into their Country. Upon this Head that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Gentleman, <hi>Monsieur Peu</hi> wou'd frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give me <hi>good</hi> Advice; he <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>gravely</hi>
counselled me to consider the Place where I lived,
and to have some regard to my <hi>Health</hi> in so tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
a <hi>Climate,</hi> giving me the Names of several of
my <hi>Country-men,</hi> who had either died <hi>Martyrs</hi> to
their own <hi>Gluttony,</hi> or contracted very dangerous
<hi>Distempers</hi> by it. When notwithstanding these
<hi>wholsome</hi> Admonitions, which he daily <hi>pour'd</hi> into
my Ears, he found me an <hi>incorrigible</hi> Reprobate
to my <hi>Guts,</hi> and ever now and then propping my
Lean, Sickly, feeble <hi>Carcass</hi> with some foolish
<hi>Trifles</hi> that were to be had at the <hi>Confectioners,</hi>
made of the Kernels of <hi>Pine-apples, Melons,</hi>
and such worthy <hi>Stuff;</hi> when I say he found me


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63271:49"/>
so <hi>intirely</hi> abandon'd to the Interest of my <hi>Belly,</hi>
and so <hi>prodigally</hi> pampering my self, he got a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Physician,</hi> with whom he knew I was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to <hi>perswade</hi> me to a more <hi>Temperate</hi> course
of Life, and be less <hi>indulgent</hi> to my self in <hi>Diet.</hi>
The <hi>Doctor,</hi> to give him his due, performed his
part <hi>notably,</hi> and inculcated these <hi>pious</hi> Precepts
to me every morning. I soon perceiv'd, that he
was <hi>set on</hi> to do it, and suited my <hi>Answers</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
At last finding him <hi>perpetually</hi> to harp
upon this <hi>String,</hi> so that his Company grew <hi>nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>troublesome; Worthy Doctor,</hi> said I to him,
<hi>Pray answer me one civil Question, do ye speak this
in jest or in earnest? Oh in earnest,</hi> replied he, <hi>well
then,</hi> continued I, <hi>what wou'd you have me do? Why,
to leave off Suppers for good and all,</hi> said he, <hi>and to mix
at least one half Water with your Wine.</hi> I cou'd not
forbear <hi>laughing</hi> at this extraordinary <hi>Advice;</hi> so
said I to him, <hi>Doctor, if 'tis your Will and Pleasure
to see me decently laid in a Church-yard, you take an
infallible course to bring it about; for I'm sure it wou'd
be present death to me, in the present Circumstances of
this poor dispirited Body, to leave off Suppers; and I
am so confident of this Truth, that I am loath to make
the Experiment. What do you think wou'd become of
me, if after such scurvy Dinners as we have here, I
shou'd go Supperless to Bed? And then to bid me
mingle Water with such weak instiped Wine, pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
is it not infinitely better to drink clear Water as
it comes from the Fountain, than to debauch it with
such wretched sowr stuff. I don't question but that
Monsieur</hi> Peu <hi>(a Plague take him for't) order'd you
to give me this ghostly Advice; for indeed 'tis fitter
for one of</hi> Glanvill'<hi>s, or Mr.</hi> Aubry'<hi>s Spectres, then
for Flesh and Blood to follow.</hi> At this the <hi>Doctor</hi>
smiled inspite of his affected Gravity, and was


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63271:50"/>
pleased to allow me better Terms than before.
Worthy Sir, cried he, <hi>I did not say this to you with
an intention that you should totally leave off Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
you may eat an Egg and drink a Glass of
Wine, for this is my own manner of living.
I have an Egg boiled me for my Supper, one
half of the Yolk I eat myself, and I give my Son the
other half, then I drink half a Glass of Wine, and
by Virtue of this Refreshment, I make a shift to study
till late in the Night.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>But did not this Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<hi>put the Doctor upon you,</hi> as the saying is? Do
you think this Account he gave of himself was
<hi>true?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, most <hi>certainly.</hi> As I was once
coming home from <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> that bore
me Company, pointing to a certain <hi>House,</hi> told
me the <hi>Doctor</hi> lived there. Upon this I had a <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity</hi>
to visit his Quarters; so I <hi>knocked</hi> at the
Door, and in I came. I remember it was a <hi>Sunday</hi>
of all the Days of the Year, and I surprized the
<hi>Doctor</hi> with his Son, and a Servant at <hi>Dinner.</hi> The
<hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Fare</hi> was a couple of <hi>Eggs,</hi> and the Devil
a <hi>jot</hi> of any thing else.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Why, surely these
People were scarce able to <hi>crawl.</hi> They wou'd
have made most excellent <hi>Ghosts</hi> for a <hi>Play,</hi> I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Far from that, they were both
<hi>plump</hi> and in <hi>good</hi> liking, their <hi>Eyes</hi> brisk and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and their <hi>Cheeks</hi> fresh coloured and ruddy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis wonderful <hi>strange,</hi> I can scarce bring my
self to <hi>believe</hi> it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing is <hi>truer</hi> I can assure
you. The <hi>Doctor</hi> is not the <hi>only</hi> Person that lives
thus, but several <hi>others,</hi> Men of <hi>Bulk</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi>
in the World. Take my word for't, much eating and
much <hi>drinking</hi> is a matter of <hi>Custome</hi> rather than
<hi>Nature.</hi> If a Man uses himself to a <hi>spare</hi> Diet, he
may e'en carry it as <hi>far</hi> as he pleases, and be the
Reverse of <hi>Milo,</hi> who, as History tells us, came


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63271:50"/>

               <speaker>Ia.</speaker>
               <p>Good Heavens! if 'tis <hi>possible</hi> for a
Man to <hi>preserve</hi> his Health with so <hi>little</hi> Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
I can't but think what a <hi>prodigious</hi>
Expence the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi>
and <hi>Polanders</hi> squander away upon their Bellies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt on't but they might <hi>save</hi> half
in half in their <hi>Kitchins,</hi> which now they <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly</hi>
consume to the apparent Prejudice of their

               <p>But
why then Noble Sir, cou'd not you <hi>content</hi> your

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gil.</speaker>
               <p>I had <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed</hi>
my self all along to <hi>several</hi> Dishes, and
it was too <hi>late</hi> to <hi>alter</hi> my way of living
then. Tho' to tell you the truth, I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Scandalized</hi> at the <hi>Quality,</hi> than at the <hi>quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of their Victuals. Two <hi>Eggs</hi> wou'd have

have been <hi>enough</hi> in all conscience, if it had
not been as <hi>thick</hi> as Mustard, and as <hi>sowr</hi> as
Vinegar. To conclude, one quarter of the
<hi>Bread</hi> wou'd have been as much as I cou'd

of <hi>Bread.</hi>

to some purpose?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed I <hi>use</hi> him as
he <hi>deserves.</hi> I suppose he's satisfied that I have
<hi>Lungs</hi> upon occasion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and how does
he <hi>relish</hi> this <hi>Treatment?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>At first he <hi>bounc'd</hi>
and <hi>swagger'd</hi> most Heroically, thinking to <hi>fright</hi>
me with his <hi>Big words</hi> and all that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And did
it never come to <hi>downright Blows</hi> between you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Once, and but once, the <hi>Quarrel</hi> rose so
<hi>high,</hi> that we were within an Ace of <hi>Fifty Cuffs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What's this I hear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>My Spark had a <hi>Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi>
Cudgel in his Hand, which he <hi>lifted</hi> up, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and Cursing like a <hi>Foot Soldier</hi> at an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Country Innkeeper,</hi> and threatning to make
a <hi>severe</hi> example of me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And were you not
<hi>afraid</hi> that he'd be as <hi>good</hi> as his <hi>word?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>To
prevent that, I snatched up a Three-legg'd <hi>Stool,</hi>
and told him that I'de <hi>Comb</hi> his <hi>Head</hi> with it, if
he offer'd to <hi>touch</hi> me with his little <hi>Finger.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>merry</hi> sort of a <hi>Buckler</hi> upon my word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Had he not <hi>sounded</hi> a <hi>Retreat,</hi> he had found to
his <hi>Cost,</hi> I believe, that he had no <hi>Child</hi> to deal
with.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Oh my dear <hi>Xantippe</hi> you do <hi>ill</hi> in
this, I must tell you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Pray in what respect?
For if he does not <hi>use</hi> me as his <hi>Wife,</hi> I don't know
why I shou'd <hi>use</hi> him as my <hi>Husband,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>The


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63271:53"/>
                  <hi>New Testament</hi> will tell you <hi>other</hi> things; St. <hi>Paul</hi>
says that <hi>Wives</hi> ought to be subject to their <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi>
with all Reverence; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> proposes
the example of <hi>Sarah</hi> to us, who call'd her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>This I know full
well; but the <hi>Apostle</hi> you first mention'd, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Teaches,</hi> that <hi>Men</hi> shou'd love their <hi>Wives,</hi>
as <hi>Christ</hi> loved his <hi>Spouse</hi> the <hi>Church:</hi> Let him
put his own Duty in Practice, and I'll not forget
mine I promise you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but when things
are come to such a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that either the <hi>Wife</hi>
or <hi>Husband</hi> must <hi>knock</hi> under the <hi>Table,</hi> I think it
but <hi>reasonable</hi> that the <hi>Woman</hi> shou'd submit to the
<hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Why must I look upon him to be my
<hi>Husband,</hi> who uses me <hi>worse</hi> than a <hi>Kitchin-wench?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But tell me, <hi>Xantippe,</hi> did he never threaten
to beat you after this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, he grew

caught a <hi>Tartar,</hi> I can tell him but that.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why sometimes he pretends to be

<hi>Fiddle,</hi> with no more than three <hi>Strings</hi> to't,
and <hi>scrapes</hi> ye upon the batter'd old <hi>Instrument</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>So much, that I cou'd almost have <hi>tore</hi> him to

               <p>Nay you shall do as <hi>much</hi> with

long <hi>Acquaintance</hi> will warrant, for You and I
have <hi>known</hi> one another from our <hi>Cradles.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>You say <hi>true,</hi> and there's none of my <hi>Play fellows</hi>
I love <hi>better</hi> than your self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Let your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
prove what he will, yet I'de have you still
carry it in your Mind, that it is not in your Power
to <hi>change</hi> him for <hi>another.</hi> Heretofore, indeed,
when things came to an open <hi>Rupture,</hi> and no
<hi>Reconciliation</hi> cou'd be hoped for, a <hi>Divorce</hi> might
set both Parties at <hi>ease,</hi> which is not to be <hi>done</hi> at
this time of day; for now you must bear with him
<hi>for better, for worse</hi> to the <hi>last</hi> breath in your Body:
Try what <hi>Tricks</hi> you please, he will still be your
<hi>Husband,</hi> and you his <hi>Wife.</hi>

               <p>How I cou'd

            <sp>

               <p>Have a care what you say: No <hi>worse</hi> a Manthan

               <p>I can't believe it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But 'tis as I tell you. So then you <hi>Husband</hi> and
<hi>You</hi> have <hi>nothing</hi> left to do, but to <hi>suit</hi> your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Dispositions to one another, and to bear
the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Matrimony</hi> as <hi>contentedly</hi> as you can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>But do you think 'tis possible for me to work
a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and to a her the <hi>Nature</hi> of this insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You must give me leave to tell
you however, that it does not a <hi>little</hi> depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Wife</hi> what sort of a <hi>Man</hi> her <hi>Husband</hi> will
make.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>And do your <hi>Husband</hi> and you live
in <hi>perfect</hi> Amity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Heaven be praised,
all is Easy and Quiet with us <hi>now.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Then I

               <p>Nothing that cou'd properly be

<hi>Perfect</hi> on this side Heaven, a few small <hi>Clouds</hi>

                  <hi>prevent</hi> it by a wise <hi>Conduct.</hi> Every one has his
<hi>peculiar</hi> Humours and Fancies, and if we will <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly</hi>
speak the truth, every one has his Faults
more or less, which in the <hi>Matrimonial</hi> State espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
we ought to <hi>Connive</hi> at, and not to <hi>Hate.</hi>

               <p>Now
it frequently happens that that <hi>good</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Man and his Wife, is <hi>fatally</hi> interrupted,
before they have any <hi>tolerable</hi> knowledge of one
another. And this is the <hi>first</hi> thing that ought to be
<hi>provided</hi> against; for when once the Spirit of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi>
has disunited them, 'tis a <hi>difficult</hi> matter to
make a reconciliation, especially if ever it went
so <hi>high</hi> as to come to <hi>Personal</hi> Reflections. We see
that pieces of Wood which are <hi>glew'd</hi> together, if
they are <hi>rudely</hi> used at <hi>first,</hi> are <hi>easily</hi> broke asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but if you give them <hi>time</hi> to <hi>settle,</hi> and the

a good <hi>Correspondence</hi> be settled between <hi>both</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

by a <hi>mutual</hi> complaisance and <hi>easiness</hi> of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
for Love that has nothing but <hi>Beauty</hi> to

               <p>Pray then oblige me so far as to

            <sp>

               <p>Never question that. I can

               <p>My first and chief care was to <hi>please</hi> my good

what things <hi>pleased,</hi> and on the other hand

Thus we see that the beating of a <hi>Drum</hi> will set a

own Flesh; and thus your <hi>Iockies</hi> have <hi>particular</hi>
Sounds, and Whistles, and Strokes to <hi>flatter</hi> their
<hi>Horses</hi> when they are ill condition'd. How much

means to <hi>fix</hi> our selves in our Husbands <hi>Good Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>

               <p>When, after a <hi>diligent</hi> examination,
I had <hi>found out</hi> his Humour, I <hi>accommodated</hi> mine

him.</p>

               <p>In every thing
relating to the <hi>Family,</hi> which you know is the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi>
Province of the Women, I shew'd my <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi>
dexterity and management; for I not only,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63271:55"/>
                  <hi>provided</hi> that nothing should be omitted and <hi>left
undone,</hi> but likewise that every thing should be
<hi>suitable</hi> to his Temper, even in <hi>Trifles,</hi> and matters
of the <hi>least</hi> consequence. As for Instance, If my
Husband <hi>fancied</hi> such a <hi>Dish</hi> of Meat, and wou'd
have it <hi>dressed</hi> after <hi>sueh</hi> a manner; if he wou'd
have so many <hi>Blankets</hi> on the Bed, or such <hi>Furniture</hi>
in such a Room, 'twas all done to his <hi>Fancy.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>But how cou'd you <hi>humour</hi> a Man that is never at
<hi>Home,</hi> but perpetually Sotting at the <hi>Tavern</hi> and
<hi>Drunk?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, I am coming to that <hi>Point,</hi>
If at any time I saw my Husband <hi>out of sorts</hi> and
melancholy, and not <hi>caring</hi> much to be <hi>talked</hi> to,
I would not for the world <hi>Laugh,</hi> or put on a <hi>gay</hi>
Humour, as some <hi>Women</hi> use to do upon the <hi>like</hi>
occasion, but I my self put on a <hi>grave, demure</hi>
Countenance as well as <hi>he;</hi> for, as a <hi>Looking-glass,</hi>
if it is a <hi>true</hi> one, faithfully <hi>represents</hi> the Face of
him that <hi>looks</hi> in it, so a <hi>Wife</hi> ought to <hi>fashion</hi>
herself to the <hi>Affection</hi> of her <hi>Husband;</hi> not to be
<hi>chearful</hi> when he is <hi>sad,</hi> nor <hi>sad</hi> when he is <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
Now whenever I found him very <hi>Shagreen</hi>
indeed, I either endeavour'd to sooth him with
<hi>fair</hi> words, or else <hi>held</hi> my Tongue, and <hi>waited</hi>
till this <hi>ill</hi> Humour had <hi>spent</hi> it self, and then I took
my opportunity to <hi>clear</hi> all mistakes and to <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
him. The <hi>same</hi> method I <hi>constantly</hi> observed,
when he came Home somewhat <hi>Fuddl'd</hi> or so:
At such a time I gave him all the indulgent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Language</hi> I cou'd think off, and by this means
got him to <hi>Bed.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>blessed</hi> Life this, that we

our Husbands in <hi>every thing</hi> that comes into their
<hi>Noddle</hi> when <hi>Drunk</hi> or <hi>Angry.</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63271:55"/>
However there is a <hi>critical</hi> time when a <hi>Wife</hi> may
take upon her to <hi>advise</hi> her Husband in Matters of
some <hi>Importance;</hi> for I think it much <hi>better</hi> to <hi>wink</hi>
at <hi>small</hi> Faults.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>And how is she to know the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Why, when his Mind is <hi>Serene,</hi>
and nothing <hi>disturbs</hi> him, when he is <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
then you may <hi>admonish,</hi> or rather <hi>intreat</hi> him,
and this always in <hi>private,</hi> as to any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his <hi>Estate,</hi> or his <hi>Health,</hi> or <hi>Reputation</hi> are
concerned. And this very <hi>Advice</hi> is to be <hi>seasoned</hi>
with some <hi>Pleasantries,</hi> that it may look as if it
were not <hi>design'd,</hi> but accidental. Sometimes by
way of <hi>Preface,</hi> I agree with him before hand that
he shan't be <hi>angry,</hi> if being a <hi>foolish</hi> Woman, I
<hi>take</hi> upon me to <hi>interpose</hi> my own <hi>Counsel</hi> in any
thing wherein his <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Health, or Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
are concerned. After I have said as <hi>much</hi> as
I think <hi>proper</hi> at that time, I <hi>turn</hi> the Discourse
to some more <hi>entertaining</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> Subject;
for under the Rose, be it spoken, this is the
<hi>Fault</hi> of us <hi>Women,</hi> that when once we have <hi>begun</hi>
to <hi>tune</hi> our <hi>Pipes,</hi> we don't know <hi>when</hi> to <hi>give over.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why so they say indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>This I always
<hi>Religiously</hi> observed as a Rule, never to <hi>chide</hi> my
Husband before <hi>Company,</hi> nor to <hi>prattle</hi> abroad of
<hi>Miscarriages</hi> at <hi>home.</hi> What passes between <hi>two</hi>
People is much <hi>easier</hi> made up, than when once it
has <hi>taken Air;</hi> now if ever Matters come to
<hi>such</hi> a pass, that the Husband is <hi>incurable,</hi> and no
<hi>longer</hi> to be born with, I think it much the <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
Course for the <hi>Wife</hi> to carry her <hi>Complaints</hi> to
the Parents, or Relations of her <hi>Husband,</hi> than to
<hi>her own</hi> Priends, and besides to <hi>manage</hi> her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
with such <hi>Discretion,</hi> that the World may
see she <hi>only</hi> hates the <hi>Vices,</hi> and not the <hi>Person</hi> of

we <hi>prevail</hi> upon our <hi>Husbands</hi> to return the <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
again.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I can hardly believe it; but
put the case there are, this we ought to take for
<hi>granted,</hi> that let our Husbands <hi>prove</hi> what they
will, we must <hi>bear</hi> their Humours when once we
have chose them, and then I'll <hi>appeal</hi> to you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
'tis not infinitely <hi>better</hi> to soften him by a <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
Temper, or at worst to <hi>bear</hi> with all his <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
than by our <hi>perpetual</hi> Scolding and Railing
at him to <hi>exasperate</hi> and make him ten times <hi>worse.</hi>
I cou'd, if I were so minded, instance in some <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi>
who by the like <hi>Sweetnesses</hi> have alter'd
their <hi>Spouses</hi> much for the <hi>better,</hi> then how much a

in this <hi>manner.</hi>

               <p>If you can <hi>Instance</hi> in such a

               <p>I have the Honour to be <hi>acquainted</hi> with a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
of a very <hi>good</hi> Family, well Read, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and a Person of <hi>great</hi> Address and Dexterity.
He married a <hi>young</hi> Lady of about <hi>seventeen</hi> years
of Age, who had been <hi>Educated</hi> all along in the
Country in her <hi>Father</hi>'s House; for you know
Men of <hi>Quality</hi> love to reside in the <hi>Country</hi> for
the Conveniences of <hi>Hunting</hi> and <hi>Hawking.</hi> He
was resolv'd to have a <hi>raw unexperienc'd</hi> Maid,
that he might have <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>moulding</hi> her to
his own <hi>Fancy.</hi> So he began to give her some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63271:56"/>
into <hi>Books,</hi> and to teach her <hi>Musick,</hi> and
to use her by degrees to <hi>repeat</hi> the Heads of
the <hi>Parson's</hi> Sermon, together with several other
things, which he thought wou'd be of some <hi>use</hi>
and <hi>advantage</hi> to her. Now this being wholly
<hi>new</hi> to the <hi>Girl,</hi> who, as I told you before, had
been bred up at <hi>home</hi> with all the <hi>Tenderness</hi> and
Delicacy that you can <hi>imagine,</hi> amidst the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and Submissions of the <hi>Servants,</hi> she soon
grew <hi>weary</hi> of this Life. She absolutely <hi>refus'd</hi> to
learn any more, and when her Husband <hi>pressed</hi>
her about it, she wou'd <hi>cry</hi> and <hi>roar</hi> as if she
were going to be <hi>Sacrificed.</hi> Sometimes she wou'd
throw her self flat upon the <hi>ground,</hi> and beat her
<hi>Head</hi> against the <hi>Floor,</hi> and wish that <hi>Death</hi> wou'd
come to end her <hi>Affliction;</hi> for alass, <hi>Life,</hi> was a
meer <hi>burden</hi> to her. Her Husband finding that
there was no <hi>end</hi> of this, concealed his <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and invited her to go along with him into
the <hi>Country</hi> to divert themselves there at his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law's</hi>
House. The young <hi>Lady</hi> liked this
Motion well <hi>enough;</hi> so when they came to their
<hi>Iourney's</hi> end, the Gentleman <hi>leaves</hi> his Wife with
her Mother and Sister, and goes a <hi>Hunting</hi> with
his <hi>Father-in-law.</hi> When he had him <hi>alone</hi> in the
Fields, he took his <hi>opportunity</hi> to tell him, that
whereas he was in <hi>good hopes</hi> to have found an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi>
Companion in his <hi>Daughter,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
she was <hi>always</hi> sobbing, and crying, and
fretting her self without <hi>Reason,</hi> and that this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable</hi>
Habit had taken such <hi>deep</hi> rooting in
her, that he <hi>feared</hi> she was <hi>incurable;</hi> however he
<hi>conjured</hi> him to lend him his <hi>helping</hi> hand, to see if
they cou'd between them bring her to a <hi>better</hi>
Temper. His Father-in-law answered, that he
had put his Daughter <hi>for good and all</hi> into his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63271:57"/>
and if she did not <hi>behave</hi> her self as she <hi>ought,</hi>
he was at liberty to use his own <hi>Authority,</hi> and to
Cudgel her into <hi>due</hi> Submission. <hi>I know my own
Power well enough,</hi> replies the other, <hi>but I had
much rather my Wife shou'd be reason'd into her Duty
by you, than to come to these Extremities.</hi> At last the
old Gentleman <hi>promised</hi> to use all his <hi>skill</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her, so after a <hi>day</hi> or two, he takes a <hi>proper</hi>
time and place to <hi>discourse</hi> in private with his
<hi>Daughter,</hi> and looking somewhat <hi>austerely</hi> upon
her, he began to remind her, how indifferent she
was as to her <hi>Beauty,</hi> how disagreeable as to her
<hi>Disposition,</hi> so that he had often feared that he
should never be <hi>able</hi> to get a <hi>Husband</hi> for her. But
<hi>after a long enquiry, and much diligence,</hi> said he,
<hi>I had the good luck to find out one for you that the best
Lady in the Land wou'd have been glad of; and yet
you,</hi> continued he, <hi>like an insensible stupid Creature,
as you are, neither considering what I your Father
have done for you, nor reflecting that your Husband,
unless he was the best natured Man in the World, wou'd
scorn to take you for his Maid, perpetually dispute his
Orders, and Rebel against him.</hi> To make <hi>short</hi> of
my Story, the old Gentleman seemed to be in
<hi>such</hi> a <hi>Passion</hi> by his Discourse, that she <hi>expected</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
minute when he wou'd make her <hi>feel</hi> the
weight of his <hi>Hands;</hi> for you must know he is so
<hi>adroit</hi> and <hi>cunning</hi> a Blade, that he wou'd <hi>Act</hi> ye
any part as well as the best <hi>Comedian</hi> of them all.
The young Lady partly <hi>wrought</hi> upon by her <hi>Fear,</hi>
and partly <hi>convinced</hi> by the <hi>truth</hi> of what was told
her, <hi>threw</hi> her self at her Father's <hi>Feet,</hi> humbly
<hi>beseeching</hi> him to forget <hi>past Faults,</hi> and promising
that she wou'd not be <hi>wanting</hi> in her <hi>Duty</hi> for the
time to come. Her Father freely <hi>forgave</hi> her, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that she shou'd find him the most <hi>indulgent</hi>


                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:63271:57"/>
Father upon Earth, provided she <hi>kept</hi> her <hi>word.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>When
this <hi>Dialogue</hi> was over, the young Lady returned
<hi>directly</hi> to her <hi>Chamber,</hi> where finding her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
all <hi>alone,</hi> she fell down upon her <hi>Marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,</hi>
and addressed her self to him in the following
manner. <hi>Sir,</hi> said she, <hi>Till this very moment I
neither knew you nor my self, but you shall find me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort of a Wife for the future, only I conjure you
to grant me an Act of Oblivion for what is past.</hi>
She had no <hi>sooner</hi> made an end, but her Husband
<hi>took</hi> her up in his <hi>Arms,</hi> and kissed her, promising
to doe <hi>every</hi> thing she cou'd <hi>desire</hi> of him, if she
wou'd but <hi>continue</hi> in that <hi>Resolution.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>And

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ecc.</speaker>
               <p>Even to the
Day of her <hi>Death.</hi> Nothing was so <hi>mean</hi> and
<hi>humble,</hi> but she <hi>readily</hi> went about it, if her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
wou'd <hi>have</hi> it so. In short they were the
<hi>happiest</hi> and most <hi>loving</hi> couple in the <hi>whole</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the young Lady for <hi>several</hi> years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
wou'd <hi>bless</hi> her Stars, that it was her good
<hi>Fortune</hi> to light upon <hi>such</hi> an Husband; for <hi>if I
had not fallen into his Hands, I had been,</hi> she said,
<hi>the most unhappy Woman upon the face of the Earth.</hi>

and Quality, took a <hi>mighty</hi> delight in <hi>Hunting.</hi>
One day in his Country Rambles, he <hi>accidentally</hi>
met with a pretty young <hi>Damsel,</hi> Daughter to a
poor old <hi>Woman</hi> that lived in a <hi>Hutt</hi> facing the
<hi>Common.</hi> He fell <hi>desperately</hi> in Love with this
Creature, as <hi>old Men</hi> you know like Tinder take
<hi>Fire</hi> in an instant, and when they <hi>love,</hi> love to
some <hi>purpose.</hi> For the sake of this young <hi>Girl</hi> he
frequently <hi>lay</hi> from home, and <hi>Hunting</hi> was still
made the <hi>Pretence</hi> for it. His Lady, a Woman of
<hi>admirable</hi> Conduct and Goodness, suspecting
there was more than <hi>ordinary</hi> in the Matter, was
resolved at any rate to find out the <hi>bottom</hi> of it,
and in her <hi>search,</hi> by what <hi>Accident</hi> I have now
forgot, came to the above-mention'd <hi>Cottage,</hi>
where she soon learnt all the <hi>Particulars,</hi> as what
he <hi>drank,</hi> how his <hi>Victuals</hi> were <hi>dressed,</hi> where he
<hi>lay,</hi> and so forth. This <hi>House</hi> was the most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>dog-hole</hi> you cou'd any where see, with not a
jot of <hi>Furniture</hi> to <hi>help</hi> it off. Away goes this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>home,</hi> and returns immediately, bringing a
<hi>handsome</hi> Bed, and other <hi>Conveniencies,</hi> and a Set of
<hi>Plate</hi> to use upon occasion. She likewise <hi>gave</hi> the
poor People some <hi>Mony</hi> at parting, and advised
them by all means that the next time the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
came that way, they should <hi>treat</hi> him with
more <hi>respect,</hi> not letting them know that she was
his <hi>Wife,</hi> but pretending to be his <hi>Sister.</hi> Some
few days after this her <hi>Husband</hi> coming thither,
found the <hi>Furniture</hi> much alter'd for the <hi>better,</hi> and
his <hi>Entertainment</hi> more <hi>splendid</hi> than it used to be.</p>
               <p>Upon this he <hi>enquired</hi> of them how this <hi>sudden</hi>
change of the Scene happen'd, and they <hi>honestly</hi>
told him that a Woman of <hi>Quality,</hi> as she appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be by her <hi>Dress,</hi> brought all those <hi>fine
things</hi> thither, and gave it them it them in charge to <hi>Treat</hi>


                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63271:58"/>
him with more <hi>Respect</hi> for the future. It immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
came into his <hi>Head</hi> that this was of his <hi>Wife's
doing;</hi> so when he came <hi>home,</hi> he asked her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she had been at <hi>such a Place,</hi> and mentioned
it. She told him <hi>she had;</hi> then he desired to <hi>know</hi>
for what <hi>Reason</hi> she had sent all that <hi>rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
thither? <hi>My Dear,</hi> says she, <hi>I found that
your Lodging and Fare there was none of the best, and
as I knew you were used to be better Treated at home,
I thought it my Duty, that since you took a fancy to
the place, to make your Reception more agreeable to
you.</hi>

               <p>The Lady was to <hi>blame</hi> in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Had I been in <hi>her place,</hi> instead of <hi>Bedding</hi>
and all that, I had sent him a <hi>bundle</hi> of <hi>Nettles</hi> and
<hi>Thistles</hi> to have <hi>cooled</hi> his <hi>Concupiscence</hi> for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but hear the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of my Story.
The Gentleman was so surprized at this <hi>unusual</hi>
strain of <hi>good Nature</hi> and Virtue in his Lady, that
he <hi>never</hi> after <hi>violated</hi> her Bed, or <hi>rambled</hi> abroad,
but <hi>solaced</hi> himself with her <hi>at home.</hi> Now I am
upon this Discourse, I suppose you know Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
the <hi>Dutch Merchant.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>I know him very
well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I need not tell you then that he is in
the <hi>prime</hi> of his Age, and that he <hi>Married</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
well stricken <hi>in years.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose
then he was in <hi>Love</hi> with her <hi>Bags,</hi> and not with
her <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>That may be as you say, but to
proceed. This <hi>Spark</hi> soon grew <hi>weary</hi> of his
<hi>Spouse,</hi> and Intrigued with a <hi>Mistress</hi> in a corner,
with whom he <hi>spent</hi> most of his Time. He seldom
<hi>Dined</hi> or <hi>Supt</hi> at home. Now, pray tell me what
you wou'd have <hi>done</hi> in such a Case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Why,
I wou'd have torn his <hi>Strumpet's</hi> Head-cloaths off
where ever I had met her; and as for my <hi>good
Man,</hi> I wou'd have <hi>sprinkled</hi> him from top to toe
with Essence of <hi>Chamberpot,</hi> and in that <hi>dainty


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63271:59"/>
pickle</hi> he shou'd have visited his <hi>Baggage,</hi> if it was so
<hi>rampant</hi> with him</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but how much more
<hi>prudently</hi> did this Gentlewoman carry her self?
She Invited this <hi>Rival</hi> of hers to her own House,
and received her with all the <hi>Civility</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Thus without going to any of your <hi>Raskally
Astrologers</hi> for a <hi>Charm,</hi> she <hi>kept</hi> her Husband at
<hi>home;</hi> but whenever the <hi>Maggot</hi> took him to Sup
with her <hi>abroad,</hi> she wou'd send you a good <hi>Dish</hi>
or two of Meat to her <hi>Lodgings,</hi> and desire them
to <hi>pass</hi> their time with one another as <hi>merrily</hi> as
they cou'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>For my part I shou'd <hi>sooner</hi>
choose to be in my <hi>Grave,</hi> than to be a <hi>Bawd</hi> to
my own <hi>Husband.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But pray <hi>consider</hi> the
Matter soberly and cooly. Was not this <hi>infinitely</hi>
better than if by her Churlishness, and <hi>Ill-temper,</hi>
she had totally <hi>alienated</hi> her Husbands Affections
from her, and <hi>spent</hi> her whole <hi>life</hi> in quarelling
and bawling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>I must <hi>confess</hi> that of the <hi>two
Evils</hi> 'tis the <hi>least,</hi> but I cou'd never have <hi>submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ecc.</speaker>
               <p>I will trouble you but with one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Story, and then I'll have done. This <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
of ours that lives next door to us, is a <hi>right
honest Man,</hi> but somewhat Hasty and <hi>Cholerick.</hi>
One day it fell out that he <hi>beat</hi> his Wife, a Woman
of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Prudence. Upon this she imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<hi>withdrew</hi> into her Apartment, and <hi>there</hi>
crying and sobbing, <hi>endeavoured</hi> to give <hi>vent</hi> to
her Resentments. Soon after upon one occasion
or other her <hi>Husband</hi> came into the Room, where
he found her drown'd in Tears. <hi>Hey day!</hi> says he,
<hi>what means this putting Finger in Eye, and
whimpering like a Child thus?</hi> To which she
calmly answer'd, <hi>Why, is it not better to lament
my mis fortune here, than to bawl out and make a
noise in the Street, as other Women do.</hi> Her Husband
was so intirely <hi>overcome</hi> and <hi>disarm'd</hi> of his


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63271:59"/>
Passion by this <hi>conjugal</hi> Answer, that he gave her
his <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>solemnly</hi> promised that the wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>strike</hi> her as long as he <hi>lived,</hi> and he was as
<hi>good</hi> as his <hi>word</hi> I must tell you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but
Heaven be praised I have <hi>brought off</hi> my Husband
from using me so by a <hi>different</hi> Conduct.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Right, but then there are perpetual Wars between
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what wou'd you have a <hi>Woman</hi>
do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, if your Husband of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
you any <hi>Affront</hi> or <hi>Injury,</hi> take no <hi>notice</hi> of it,
but endeavour to <hi>soften</hi> him to you by all <hi>Offices</hi> of
Gentleness, Meekness, and good Nature. By
this <hi>means</hi> you will either <hi>wholly reclaim</hi> him at
long run, or at <hi>least</hi> you'll find him much <hi>more
tractable and easie</hi> than at present you <hi>find</hi> him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but he's such an <hi>incorrigible</hi> Brute, that
all the <hi>good usage</hi> will not make him one <hi>Farthing</hi>
the better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You must <hi>pardon</hi> me, if I am not of
your <hi>mind.</hi> There is no <hi>Beast</hi> so savage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable
but he may be <hi>tam'd</hi> by good Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Why then shou'd you despair to <hi>effect</hi> it
in a Man. Let me <hi>conjure</hi> you by our long Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
to try this <hi>Experiment</hi> but for two or
three Months, and I'll give you leave to <hi>blame</hi>
me as long as you please, if you <hi>find</hi> that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is of <hi>no benefit</hi> to you. To deal <hi>plainly</hi> with
you, there are certain <hi>Vices,</hi> at which you must
<hi>connive,</hi> otherwise your <hi>Repose</hi> will be but of <hi>short</hi>
continuance; but above all things you ought to
take <hi>special</hi> care never to <hi>begin</hi> any Quarrel, or to
trump up any <hi>angry</hi> Stories with your Husband in
<hi>Bed.</hi> Every thing <hi>there</hi> ought to be <hi>chearful</hi> and
<hi>pleasant,</hi> and indeed when <hi>that place</hi> which is <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi>
to the Cementing of <hi>Love,</hi> to the allaying
of <hi>Marriage-storms;</hi> and to the wiping out of <hi>old
Miscarriages,</hi> comes to be <hi>unhallowed</hi> by Sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63271:60"/>
and <hi>profaned</hi> by ill Language, I think 'tis
<hi>high</hi> time to write <hi>Lord have mercy</hi> upon the
doors; for if the <hi>Fountain</hi> head be poisoned, what
help can be expected from the <hi>Streams?</hi> I know
some Women of such <hi>insatiable</hi> Tongues, and so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperately</hi>
given to <hi>Scolding,</hi> that they cannot
forbear to let their Clacks run <hi>even</hi> while the <hi>Rites</hi>
of Love are <hi>performing,</hi> and by the uneasiness of
their Tempers render <hi>Fruition</hi> it self <hi>disagreeable,</hi>
which uses to be the <hi>Never-failing</hi> Reconciler of
Husband and Wife. By this means they make
that <hi>Cordial,</hi> which ought to <hi>Cure</hi> all the <hi>Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings</hi>
of Matrimony, to be of <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Effect.</p>

to <hi>displease</hi> her Husband, if she can <hi>help</hi> it, upon

               <p>It teaches us this <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Lesson; That a Wife shou'd make it her

to be as <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>engaging</hi> as she can;
for, let your <hi>Grave Persons</hi> say what they will,
the <hi>Affair</hi> we have been talking of is not only
the <hi>chief Preservative</hi> to keep <hi>Love alive</hi> when he

                  <hi>more</hi> you consult your own <hi>particular</hi> advantage.
But the <hi>mischief</hi> on't is, that you only keep your

<hi>choose</hi> her Husband only by her <hi>Eyes,</hi> but take the

               <p>It makes the <hi>Sin</hi> so much <hi>less.</hi> But

               <p>So
much the <hi>better</hi> for you. This <hi>Pledge</hi> of your <hi>first</hi>
Affections will, I make no question on't, <hi>set</hi> you
both at <hi>rights,</hi> if you, my dear Friend, will but
<hi>lend</hi> your helping <hi>Hand</hi> a little to so <hi>good</hi> a Work.
By the by, let me ask you what sort of a <hi>Character</hi>
do your Husband's <hi>Companions</hi> give him? And how
is he <hi>respected</hi> by them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>They all of them
<hi>agree,</hi> that he's as <hi>easie</hi> a Man in Conversation, as

ever lived.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Better and better</hi> still. This gives
me <hi>great</hi> hopes to believe that we shall <hi>manage</hi>
him to your <hi>Heart</hi>'s content.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Here's the

he shows himself <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Do but put
the <hi>Rules</hi> I gave you in <hi>Practice,</hi> and I here freely


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63271:62"/>
give you <hi>leave</hi> to say all the <hi>malicious</hi> things you
can of me, if you don't find him much <hi>alter'd</hi> for
the <hi>better.</hi> Besides, I wou'd have you <hi>consider</hi>
that he's but a <hi>young</hi> Fellow yet; for, as I take it,
he is not above <hi>Twenty Four</hi> Years Old, and does
not <hi>know yet</hi> what it is to be the <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
As for a <hi>Divorce,</hi> I wou'd advise you <hi>never</hi>
to <hi>think</hi> of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>I have had it <hi>frequently</hi> in my

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But when it comes <hi>next</hi> into your
<hi>Head,</hi> pray do your self the <hi>favour</hi> to reflect what
a foolish insignificant <hi>Figure</hi> a Woman <hi>makes</hi> when
she is <hi>parted</hi> from her <hi>Husband.</hi> The principal <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation</hi>
of a <hi>Matron,</hi> is, that she is <hi>Dutiful</hi>
and Obedient to her <hi>Spouse.</hi> This Language <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
dictates to us; this we are <hi>taught</hi> in the
<hi>Bible;</hi> this the universal <hi>Agreement</hi> of all <hi>Ages</hi> and
<hi>Nations</hi> tells us, that a <hi>Woman</hi> shou'd be <hi>subject</hi> to
her <hi>Husband.</hi> Therefore seriously <hi>think</hi> of this
matter, and put the <hi>case</hi> exactly as it <hi>stands.</hi> He
is your <hi>Lawful</hi> Husband, and so long as he <hi>Lives;</hi>
'tis impossible for you to have <hi>another.</hi> Then let the
<hi>Infant</hi> who belongs in <hi>Common</hi> to youboth, be put
in the <hi>Ballance.</hi> Now pray tell me <hi>how</hi> you wou'd
<hi>dispose</hi> of him? If you <hi>carry</hi> him away with you,
you <hi>defraud</hi> your Husband of what is his <hi>own,</hi> and
if you <hi>leave</hi> him with him, you <hi>deprive</hi> your self of
that which <hi>ought</hi> to be as <hi>dear</hi> to you as your <hi>Life.</hi>
In the last place I desire to be <hi>informed</hi> whether any
of your <hi>Relations</hi> wish you <hi>Ill?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <p>I have to
my <hi>Sorrow</hi> a Step mother and a Mother-in-law as
<hi>like</hi> her as may be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And are you not <hi>beloved</hi>
by them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>So far from that, that they'd

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Why then I wou'd <hi>entreat</hi> you to think of <hi>them</hi>
likewise. What more <hi>acceptable</hi> piece of Service
can you <hi>possibly</hi> do them, than to let them see you <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>


                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:63271:62"/>
from your Husband, and become a <hi>Widow</hi>
of your own <hi>making?</hi> What did I say a <hi>Widow?</hi>
Nay, to live ten times more miserably than any
<hi>Widow;</hi> for, one in that <hi>condition</hi> you know is at
<hi>liberty</hi> to Marry whom she <hi>pleases.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I must

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>If
that is all, pray do but <hi>consider</hi> what <hi>pains</hi> you <hi>took</hi>
before you cou'd make that <hi>Parrot</hi> there <hi>talk</hi> and

own <hi>liking,</hi> with whom you must <hi>live</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of your <hi>days?</hi> What a world of <hi>trouble</hi> do your
<hi>Grooms</hi> undergo to <hi>bask</hi> a <hi>Horse</hi> and make him <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,</hi>
and can a <hi>prudent</hi> Woman <hi>grudge</hi> a <hi>little</hi>
application and diligence to see if she can <hi>reduce</hi>
her Husband to a more <hi>agreeable</hi> Temper?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Xan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what wou'd you have me do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I have
<hi>already</hi> told you. Take care that every thing <hi>at
Home</hi> be cleanly and <hi>decent,</hi> so that nothing may
<hi>disgust</hi> him there, and oblige him to ramble <hi>abroad.</hi>
Behave your self <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>free</hi> to him, but at the
same time never <hi>forget</hi> that <hi>respect</hi> which a Wife
<hi>indispensibly</hi> ows to her <hi>Husband.</hi> Let <hi>melancholy</hi>
be <hi>banished</hi> out of your doors, and likewise an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
ill-affected <hi>Gayety;</hi> neither be foolishly
<hi>morose,</hi> nor unseasonably <hi>frolicksome.</hi> Let your
<hi>Table</hi> be well furnished and handsome. You know
your Husband's <hi>Palat</hi> without question, therefore
always <hi>provide</hi> him what he has most a <hi>fancy</hi> to.
This is not all, I wou'd have you show your self
<hi>Affable</hi> and <hi>Courteous</hi> to all his <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> and
frequently <hi>Invite</hi> them to <hi>Dine</hi> with you. When
you Sit down to <hi>Table,</hi> let nothing but <hi>Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
and <hi>Mirth</hi> appear; and if at any <hi>time</hi> your


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63271:63"/>
Husband comes <hi>Home</hi> a little in his <hi>Liquor,</hi> and
falls a Playing on his <hi>Violin,</hi> do you bear your
<hi>part</hi> in the <hi>Consort</hi> and Sing to it. By this <hi>means</hi>
you'll in a little <hi>time</hi> accustom your <hi>Husband</hi> to
keep at <hi>Home,</hi> and lessen his <hi>Expences;</hi> for 'tis <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
to believe that <hi>at last</hi> he'll thus <hi>reason</hi> with
himself. <hi>Why, what a foolish Coxcomb am I to Sot
at the Tavern, and keep Company with a nasty Harlot
abroad, to the apparent prejudice of my Reputation
and Estate, when I have a Wife at home who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more obliging and beautiful, and makes so much

by <hi>winding</hi> and <hi>turning</hi> him, that he
<hi>himself</hi> shall tell me what <hi>Quarrels</hi> have happen'd

off, and I hope to send him <hi>home</hi> to you in a

'Tis no wonder therefore if our Affairs lie at <hi>sixes

<hi>Government,</hi> or <hi>good Order</hi> left among us, and to
say all in a word, if the World ranks us in the

us the Title of <hi>rational</hi> Creatures. Unless we

us in a short time. For my part, I am <hi>afraid</hi> to
utter it, or be the Harbinger of <hi>ill</hi> News.
However, tho' we take no <hi>care</hi> at all of our <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>

Give me leave, Ladies and Gentlewomen, to

in your turn. Neither is this Meeting of ours a

for if my <hi>Chronology</hi> does not fail me,
that most <hi>Accomplished</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Emperor

most <hi>Accomplish'd</hi> and <hi>Excellent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I beseech you,
when History tells us that the Mobb knocked his

<hi>Streets,</hi> and at last <hi>thrown</hi> into the common <hi>Iakes.
Cor.</hi> What! <hi>interrupted</hi> again? But <hi>Neighbour,</hi> if
such an Argument will hold <hi>Water,</hi> it will follow,
that half the Saints in the Kalendar were but <hi>so,
so,</hi> because they came to the <hi>Gallows,</hi> and that
<hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> was a <hi>virtuous</hi> Person, because
he died in his <hi>Bed.</hi> The <hi>worst</hi> thing that was ever
objected to <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> by his greatest Enemies,
was his <hi>flinging</hi> down the idolatrous <hi>Fire,</hi>
which was kept by
the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins, for
which <hi>old Fox</hi> wou'd
have Registred him
among his Protestant
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> and his

                  <hi>hanging</hi> up the Pictures of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>
in his private Chappel, which I hope will
not rise up in <hi>Iudgment</hi> against him in this <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Assembly. Let me inform you <hi>en passant,</hi>
Ladies, that those Villains the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as my
Authors tell me, (and I thought it wou'd not be
amiss to communicate such a nice Observation
to this House) used to call our Saviour <hi>Chrestus,</hi>
and not <hi>Christus,</hi> by way of Contempt and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which is the Opinion of <hi>Agathocles, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>


                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:63271:65"/>
who for his great Skill in the Oriental Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
was Sir-named <hi>Halicarnesseus, Laurenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Valla, Fabius Maximus, Anacharsis</hi> and several
other <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Perswasion. But to
return to the <hi>Argument</hi> in <hi>hand;</hi> for a Woman
ought to make the <hi>most</hi> of her <hi>Argument</hi> in
<hi>Hand,</hi> this most discreet and profound Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<hi>Heliogabalus</hi> issued out a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
to this Effect, that as the <hi>Emperors</hi> used to
convene the <hi>Senators</hi> in the <hi>Senate-house,</hi> and
there to debate of all <hi>Emergencies</hi> relating to the
<hi>State,</hi> so his Mother <hi>Augusta</hi> shou'd Summon
the <hi>Women</hi> from all parts of the City, to Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in a Place by themselves, there to <hi>Regulate</hi>
those Affairs wherein the <hi>Female-sex</hi> was any
ways concern'd. And this <hi>Convention</hi> the Men,
either out of <hi>Drollery,</hi> or for <hi>distinction,</hi> call'd
the <hi>Senatulus,</hi> or <hi>little Senate.</hi> This <hi>noble</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which by the <hi>fatal</hi> Negligence of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
has been intermitted for so many <hi>hundred</hi>
Years, the <hi>present</hi> Situation of our Affairs obliges
us to <hi>revive;</hi> and let none in this Company have
any <hi>Scruple</hi> upon their Gizzard, because the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
forbids Women to talk in that Assembly,
which he calls the <hi>Church;</hi> for it is evident that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> there speaks of Assemblies of <hi>Men,</hi>
whereas ours is an Assemblies of <hi>Women.</hi> Otherwise
if poor Women must always be <hi>silent,</hi> for
what end and purpose did <hi>Providence</hi> bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us this <hi>voluble</hi> Member, call'd a <hi>Tongue,</hi> in
which <hi>Talent</hi> we don't come short of the Men,
and why did it give us a Pipe, no less intelligible
and loud than theirs? Now my Hand is in, I
cannot help saying that ours is all <hi>Harmony</hi> and
<hi>Musick,</hi> whereas they either <hi>grunt</hi> like Hoggs,
or <hi>bray</hi> like Asses. But to proceed, we ought in


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63271:65"/>
the <hi>first</hi> place to manage all our <hi>Debates</hi> with that
<hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Circumspection,</hi> that the Men may
not have the <hi>least</hi> pretence to make them the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their <hi>Coffee-house-raillery,</hi> to which <hi>ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured</hi>
Mirth you know they are but too much
<hi>inclined</hi> of themselves; although I think I may
safely say, that if one wou'd seriously <hi>examin</hi> their
<hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> their <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
we should find more frivolous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<hi>Controversies</hi> in them, that a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Fish-women at <hi>Billingsgate</hi> wou'd be guilty
of. For Example, we still see that <hi>Monarchs</hi>
for so many Ages have <hi>busied</hi> themselves in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but dull <hi>cutting</hi> of Throats, for which <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi>
Services the World stiles them <hi>Heroes</hi> and
<hi>Deliverers.</hi> We find that the <hi>Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
are still at perpetual Daggers-drawing with one
another, that there are as many <hi>Opinions,</hi> as
there are <hi>Noses</hi> in the World, and in all the
whole course of their Proceedings, they show
ten times more <hi>Inconstancy</hi> than we Women ever
discovered. This <hi>City</hi> everlastingly quarrels
with that <hi>City,</hi> and one <hi>Neighbour</hi> treads upon
his next Neighbours <hi>Corns.</hi> If the <hi>Supreme</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
were <hi>intrusted</hi> in our Hands, with all
due <hi>Submission</hi> be it be spoken, I believe the World
wou'd be managed at a much <hi>better</hi> rate than
<hi>now</hi> it is. Perhaps it may not <hi>become</hi> our female
<hi>Modesty</hi> to charge these Noble <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi>
these <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> with <hi>Folly,</hi> but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I may be <hi>safely</hi> allowed to Recite what <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
has Asserted in the thirteenth Chapter of
the <hi>Proverbs, There is always Strife among the Proud,
but they that do every thing with Counsel, are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by Wisdom.</hi> But not to detain you with
too <hi>tedious</hi> a Preamble, to the end that all things


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63271:66"/>
here may be carried on <hi>Decently,</hi> and without
<hi>Confusion,</hi> it will be necessary in the first place to
determin, who shall be <hi>qualified</hi> to sit as <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
in this House; for as <hi>too much</hi> Company
will make it look more like the <hi>Mobb,</hi> or a <hi>Ryot,</hi>
than a grave <hi>Assembly;</hi> so if we take in <hi>too few,</hi>
the World will charge us with setting up a
<hi>Tyrannical</hi> Government. For my part, I
move this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> that no <hi>Virgin</hi> be
capable of <hi>sitting</hi> among us, and my Reason is,
because many <hi>things</hi> may happen to be <hi>debated</hi>
here, which it is not <hi>proper</hi> for them to <hi>hear.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iu.</speaker>
               <p>Well! But how shall we be able to <hi>know</hi>
who are <hi>Virgins,</hi> and who are not. I suppose
you will not allow <hi>all</hi> to be <hi>such,</hi> who take the
<hi>Name</hi> upon them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Corn.</speaker>
               <p>No, but my meaning
is that none but <hi>married</hi> Women be permitted to
Vote among us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iu.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I cou'd name to you
several <hi>married</hi> Women, who thanks to those
impotent <hi>Fumblers</hi> their Husbands, are as good
<hi>Virgins</hi> now, as when they first came into the
World. There's my Lady—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Corn.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, but
in <hi>respect</hi> to the Holy State of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> let us
<hi>charitably</hi> suppose all married <hi>Wives</hi> to be <hi>Women.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iu.</speaker>
               <p>Under Favor, if we exclude none but <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi>
we shall still be <hi>over-run</hi> with Multitudes.
The <hi>Maidens,</hi> let me tell you are scarce one to a
<hi>hundred.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Corn.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, we'll <hi>exclude</hi> those
likewise that have been Married more than
<hi>thrice,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iu.</speaker>
               <p>For what Reason, I beseech you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Corn.</speaker>
               <p>Because they ought to have their <hi>Quietus
est,</hi> as being Superannuated, and so forth. I
think too we ought to pass the <hi>same</hi> Sentence
upon such as are above <hi>Seventy.</hi> But I conceive
it ought to be resolved <hi>Nemine contradicente;</hi> that
no Woman shall <hi>presume</hi> to make too <hi>free</hi> with


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63271:66"/>
her Husband, or to lay open <hi>all</hi> his faults. It may
be allowed her to hint her ill usage in <hi>general</hi>
terms; but then it must be done with <hi>Discretion,
Brevity,</hi> and good <hi>Manners;</hi> and she shall by no
means be allowed to <hi>indulge</hi> her itch of <hi>Pratling.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But pray Madam why should not we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to talk <hi>freely</hi> of the <hi>Men,</hi> since they make
no <hi>scruple</hi> of saying what they <hi>please</hi> of their <hi>Wives.</hi>
You know the Proverb, <hi>What is Sawce for a
Goose, is Sawce for a Gander.</hi> My Lord and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
I <hi>thank</hi> him for't, when ever he has a mind
to <hi>divert</hi> his lewd Companions at the <hi>Tavern,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
them with all the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the Family,
tells 'em every <hi>Word</hi> I said to him, and how <hi>often</hi>
he mounts the <hi>Guard</hi> anights, as he calls it, tho he's
most <hi>plaguyly</hi> given to <hi>lying,</hi> when he's upon the <hi>last</hi>
strain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Corn.</speaker>
               <p>If we must speak the Truth, our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
wholly depends upon that of the Men; so
if we expose them as <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>scandalous,</hi> we must
of course be <hi>so</hi> our selves. 'Tis true, we have
too many <hi>just Complaints</hi> to make against them,
however when all things are <hi>fairly</hi> considered, I
am of the Opinion that our Condition is much
<hi>preferable</hi> to theirs. They cross the <hi>Line</hi> and
double the <hi>Cape,</hi> and, in short, scamper from
<hi>Pole</hi> to <hi>Pole</hi> to maintain their Families; then in
time of <hi>War,</hi> they <hi>lye</hi> upon the bare Ground,
<hi>March</hi> through thick and thin, stand <hi>Buff</hi> to all
sorts of Weather, Eat, and Drink, and Sleep in
<hi>Armour</hi> heavy enough to load a <hi>Camel,</hi> and
<hi>venture</hi> their Lives all hours of the day, while we
sit <hi>snugg</hi> at home, and enjoy our selves <hi>Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
If they happen to be caught <hi>napping</hi> or so,
the Law shows 'em no <hi>favour,</hi> while a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is often <hi>excused</hi> upon the <hi>frailty</hi> of her Sex.
After all, I'll venture to say, that generally


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63271:67"/>
speaking, it lyes in a Woman's power to make
her Husband what sort of a Man she pleases.
But 'tis high time now <hi>Ladies</hi> to adjust all <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
about <hi>Precedence</hi> and taking of <hi>Places,</hi> least
that should happen to us which frequently falls
out at your <hi>Treaties</hi> of Peace, where the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi>
and <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> of Kings and Popes
<hi>squabble</hi> away three months at least in <hi>Punctilio's</hi>
and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> before they can sit down to <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Therefore it is my Opinion, that <hi>Peeresses</hi>
only Sit in the <hi>first</hi> Bench, and they shall take
their Places according to the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of their
Families, or their <hi>Age,</hi> but I think the <hi>latter</hi> will
be <hi>best.</hi> The <hi>next</hi> Bench shall be of the <hi>Commons,</hi>
and those shall sit in the <hi>foremost</hi> Places that
have had <hi>most</hi> Children; between those that have
had the <hi>same</hi> number of Children, <hi>Age</hi> shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the difference. Lastly, <hi>Those</hi> that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>brought</hi> to <hi>Bed</hi> shall sit in the <hi>third</hi> Row. As
for <hi>By-blows,</hi> vulgarly call'd <hi>Bastards,</hi> they shall
take <hi>Place</hi> according to their <hi>Quality,</hi> but shall
sit at the <hi>lowest</hi> end of the Row, which belongs
to them.</p>

               <p>We
will <hi>think</hi> of them some other time. Before we
proceed any further, we ought first to agree how
we shall give our Votes, whether by lifting up
our <hi>Hands,</hi> or by <hi>word</hi> of Mouth, or by the <hi>Noes</hi>
removing from their Seats, or by <hi>Balloting,</hi> and

               <p>I fear me there may be some <hi>trick</hi>
in <hi>Balloting,</hi> and then our Pettycoats draggle
upon the Ground so, that if we must <hi>remove</hi> from
our places, we shall raise such a <hi>dust</hi> I warrant
you, that no body will be able to endure the
Room. Therefore I think it will be the <hi>best</hi> way for

               <p>There will be some

               <p>We'll have so many <hi>Notaries</hi> to take the Votes,

               <p>Let it be <hi>Enacted</hi> that no body
shall <hi>Speak</hi> but in her <hi>turn,</hi> or when she's <hi>asked.</hi>
She that does <hi>otherwise</hi> shall be <hi>expell'd</hi> the House:
And if any one shall be found relling <hi>Tales</hi> out of
<hi>School,</hi> that is to say, <hi>pratling</hi> of any thing which
is transacted within these <hi>Walls,</hi> she shall incur
the Penalty of a three day's Silence.</p>

               <p>Thus
Ladies we have adjusted all <hi>Punctilio's</hi> relating to
this Affair. Let us <hi>next</hi> consider what things we
shall <hi>Debate</hi> about. Every <hi>Member</hi> here, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
will agree with me, that we ought in the
<hi>first</hi> place to have a due regard to our <hi>Honour,</hi> and
<hi>Honour</hi> all the World knows is chiefly supported
by what we call <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Dress.</hi> In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
we have been so shamefully <hi>neglective</hi> and


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63271:68"/>
                  <hi>deficient</hi> for some years last past, that 'tis almost
impossible by the <hi>outside</hi> to know a <hi>Dutchess</hi> from a
<hi>Kitchin Wench,</hi> a <hi>married</hi> Woman or a <hi>Widow</hi> from
a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and a <hi>Matron</hi> from a common <hi>Whore.</hi>
All the <hi>ancient</hi> bounds of <hi>Modesty</hi> have been so
impudently <hi>transgressed</hi> that every one <hi>wears</hi> what
<hi>Apparel</hi> seems <hi>best</hi> in her own <hi>Eyes.</hi> At <hi>Church</hi>
and at <hi>Play-house,</hi> in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> you may
see a <hi>thousand</hi> Women of <hi>indifferent,</hi> if not <hi>sordid</hi>
Extraction, swaggering it abroad in <hi>Silks</hi> and
<hi>Velvets,</hi> in <hi>Damask</hi> and <hi>Brocard,</hi> in <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
in <hi>Ermines</hi> and <hi>Sable-tippets,</hi> while their
<hi>Husbands</hi> perhaps are <hi>stitching</hi> Grubstreet Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
<hi>Copying</hi> Noverint Universi's, or <hi>Cobbling</hi>
of Shooes at home. Their Fingers are loaded
with <hi>Diamonds</hi> and <hi>Rubies,</hi> for <hi>Turkey</hi> Stones are
now a days despised been by <hi>Chimny-sweeper's</hi>
Wives. Not to <hi>tire</hi> my <hi>Lungs</hi> with speaking of
their Pearl or Amber <hi>Necklaces,</hi> the <hi>Gold Watch</hi>
dangling by their Sides, their massy Fringed
<hi>Pettycoats,</hi> the flaunting <hi>Steen-kirk</hi> about their
Necks, their <hi>laced</hi> Shooes, and <hi>Gigantic Commodes.</hi>
It was thought <hi>enough</hi> for your <hi>ordinary</hi> Women
in the <hi>last</hi> Age, that they were <hi>allowed</hi> the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Privilege</hi> to wear a <hi>Silk</hi> Girdle, and to set off
the borders of their Woolen Petticoats with an
edging of <hi>Silk.</hi> But now, and I can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<hi>Weeping</hi> at the thoughts of it, this <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Custom is quite out of doors; upon which
two great <hi>inconveniencies</hi> have arisen; for the
Wives by indulging this <hi>prodigal</hi> Humour have
made their Husbands as <hi>poor</hi> as so many <hi>Church-Mice,</hi>
and that laudable <hi>distinction</hi> which is the
very Soul and Life of <hi>Quality</hi> is totally <hi>abolished.</hi>
If your <hi>Tallow-Chandlers, Vintners,</hi> and other
<hi>Tradesmen's</hi> Wives flaunt it in a <hi>Chariot</hi> and Four,


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63271:68"/>
what shall your <hi>Marchionesses</hi> or <hi>Countesses</hi> do I
wonder? And if a <hi>Country Squire</hi>'s Spouse will
have a <hi>Train</hi> after her Breech full fifteen <hi>Ells</hi>
long, pray what <hi>shift</hi> must a <hi>Princess</hi> make to
distinguish her self? What makes this ten times
<hi>worse</hi> than otherwise it would be, we are never
<hi>constant</hi> to one Dress, but are as <hi>fickle</hi> and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as <hi>Weather Cocks,</hi> or the <hi>Men</hi> that <hi>Preach</hi>
under them. Formerly our <hi>Head-Tire</hi> was
stretcht out upon <hi>Wires,</hi> and mounted like a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
Pole; Women of <hi>Condition</hi> thinking to <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi>
themselves from the <hi>ordinary</hi> sort by <hi>this</hi>
Dress. Nay, to make the <hi>difference</hi> still more
visible, they wore Caps of <hi>Ermin</hi> powder'd, but
they were mistaken in their <hi>Politics,</hi> for the
<hi>Citts</hi> soon got them. Then they <hi>trumpt</hi> up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mode, and <hi>black Quoifs</hi> came into Play:
But the Ladies within <hi>Ludgate</hi> not only <hi>Aped</hi>
them in this Fashion, but <hi>added</hi> thereto a <hi>Gold
Embroidery</hi> and <hi>Iewels.</hi> Formerly the <hi>Court
Dames</hi> took a great deal of <hi>Pains</hi> in <hi>Combing</hi> up
their <hi>Hair</hi> from their Foreheads and Temples to
make a <hi>Tower,</hi> but they were soon <hi>weary</hi> of that,
for it was not <hi>long</hi> before this <hi>Fashion</hi> too was
got into <hi>Cheap-side.</hi> After this they let their
Hair fall <hi>loose</hi> about their <hi>Forehead,</hi> but the <hi>City
Gossips</hi> soon follow'd them in that. Heretofore,
only Women of the <hi>greatest</hi> Figure had their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and <hi>Gentlemen-Vshers,</hi> and out of these last
they chose a pretty Smock-faced young Fellow to
take 'emby the <hi>Hand</hi> when they <hi>arose</hi> from their
Chairs, or to <hi>support</hi> their left Arm when they
<hi>walk'd;</hi> neither was <hi>every one</hi> capable of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but one that was a <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Son, and
well <hi>descended.</hi> But <hi>now,</hi> the more is the <hi>shame,</hi>
Women of <hi>inferiour</hi> Rank not only <hi>take</hi> this upon


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63271:69"/>
'em, but suffer <hi>any</hi> body to do <hi>this</hi> Office, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to carry their Train. These are not all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations</hi>
that have been made; for whereas in the
<hi>primitive</hi> Times, <hi>none</hi> but Persons of high Extraction
Saluted one another with a <hi>Kiss,</hi> now every greasy
<hi>Raskall</hi> of a <hi>Shop-keeper,</hi> tho he <hi>stinks</hi> worse than a
Fat <hi>Tallow Chandler</hi> does in the <hi>Dog-days,</hi> if he's got
ten Miles out of Town, <hi>burlesqued</hi> in a Silver hilted
Sword and a long Periwig, will pretend to Salute
the <hi>best</hi> Lady in the Land. Even in their <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi>
where one wou'd think they should take
more <hi>care,</hi> no <hi>respect</hi> is had to <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Quality.</hi>
Noblemens <hi>Daughters</hi> Marry to Tradesmens <hi>Sons,</hi>
and the <hi>squab Issue</hi> of a <hi>Shop-keeper,</hi> if she has but
store of <hi>Money,</hi> is thought a <hi>Morsel</hi> tempting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for a <hi>Duke</hi>'s Eldest Son to <hi>leap</hi> at. By this
means the <hi>next</hi> Age will be plagu'd with such a
Generation of <hi>Mungrils,</hi> that they must be forced
to knock the <hi>Heralds</hi> in the head, least they should
reproach them with our Ancestors. To proceed
with other <hi>Grievances,</hi> There is never a <hi>Dowdy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town I warrant you, tho begotten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Bulk,</hi> and born in a <hi>Garret,</hi> that, if her <hi>Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
would give her <hi>leave,</hi> would scruple to <hi>Trick</hi>
and <hi>Spruce</hi> her vile <hi>Phyz</hi> with the richest <hi>Paint</hi> that
your Persons of the <hi>highest</hi> Quality use; when <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
Women ought to <hi>thank</hi> God, if the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
where they live will allow 'em to <hi>revive</hi>
the decay'd <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White</hi> in their Cheeks with
<hi>Raddle</hi> and <hi>Chalk,</hi> or some such <hi>cheap</hi> Restorers.
But as for the Countess of <hi>Kent</hi>'s <hi>Cosmetick</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
your fine <hi>Spanish</hi> Washes, and <hi>Italian</hi> Paints,
they ought to be used by <hi>none</hi> but by Ladies of the
<hi>first</hi> Rank. To come now to the <hi>Boxes,</hi> the <hi>Park,</hi>
and public <hi>Entertainments,</hi> Good Lord, what a
horrid Disorder and Confusion is there to be seen?


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63271:69"/>
You shall frequently see an <hi>Alderman's</hi> Wife refuse
to give the place to a <hi>Baronet</hi>'s Lady. Thus 'tis
plain, that the <hi>present</hi> posture of our Affairs <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises</hi>
us to think of putting a <hi>stop</hi> to these <hi>growing</hi>
Disorders; and what may <hi>encourage</hi> us to proceed,
these things <hi>naturally</hi> belong to us, and therefore
will be transacted with the <hi>greatest</hi> ease. Not
but that we have some <hi>Affairs</hi> to setle with the
<hi>Men</hi> too, who <hi>exclude</hi> us from all Offices of the
<hi>State,</hi> and while they treat us no better than <hi>Cooks,</hi>
and <hi>Landresses,</hi> monopolize <hi>all</hi> Employments and
live at <hi>Discretion.</hi> For my part I give them leave
to fill up all <hi>Robust</hi> Employments, and to manage
<hi>Military</hi> Concerns. But I appeal to the whole
World, whither it is not a most <hi>insufferable</hi> thing,
that the <hi>Wife</hi>'s Coat of Arms should be always
Painted on the <hi>left</hi> side of the <hi>Escutcheon,</hi> altho
<hi>her</hi> Family is thrice as <hi>Honourable</hi> as that of her
<hi>Husband?</hi> Then I think there's all the reason in
the World that the <hi>Mother</hi>'s consent should be
asked in the <hi>Putting out</hi> of the <hi>Children.</hi> Perhaps
too we may manage our <hi>Cards</hi> with that <hi>Address</hi>
as to be admitted to a <hi>share</hi> in all <hi>peaceable</hi> Places
of Trust; I mean <hi>those,</hi> that may be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at <hi>Home,</hi> that require no attendance in <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
Countries, or one of the <hi>Military</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
to discharge them. These are some of the
<hi>Chief</hi> Heads, which I suppose <hi>deserve</hi> to be taken
into <hi>Consideration.</hi> Let every <hi>Member</hi> of this
Honourable <hi>Assembly</hi> think of them <hi>seriously,</hi> and
prepare them against our <hi>next</hi> Session; and if any
thing else <hi>worthy</hi> of your <hi>Notice</hi> occurs to you, I
hope you will <hi>Communicate</hi> it to Morrow, for in
my Opinion it will be <hi>necessary</hi> that we meet <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
day, till we have <hi>adjusted</hi> all Affairs. We
ought to have four <hi>Notaries</hi> Chosen out of four


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63271:70"/>
                  <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parson's Wives, to take down in
<hi>Short-hand</hi> all our Speeches; and four <hi>Chairwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of our four <hi>Committees,</hi> who shall give People
leave to <hi>Speak</hi> their Minds, or enjoyn them <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
according as they see <hi>Convenient:</hi> And let
<hi>this</hi> Meeting of ours be a <hi>Sample</hi> of the <hi>following</hi>
ones, and give the World a <hi>tast</hi> what may be
expected <hi>hereafter</hi> from us.</p>
