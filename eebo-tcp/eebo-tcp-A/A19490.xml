            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

makes it manifest, which you haue from the 31. verse
to the end; wherein he drawes all that he had sayd,
into a short summe, conteyning the glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of a Christian, ouer all his enemies: the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
is first set downe generally in the vers. 31. <hi>What
shall we say then to these things: If God be with vs, who
can be against vs?</hi> thereafter hee partes this generall
in two: there is (would he say) but one of two that
are against vs; either sinne, or affliction: as to sinne,
he triumphes against it, verse 33. and 34. <hi>Who will
lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? It is God that
iustifieth, Who shall condemne? It is Christ, who is dead,
or rather who is risen againe, who is also at the right hand
of God, and makes request for vs.</hi> As to Affliction, hee
begins his triumph against it, verse 35. <hi>Who shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thinges we are more then conquerours, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

makes vs to triumph in our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this verse,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2, 14.</note> as <hi>Iacob</hi> gaue his sonnes his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
blessing in the last roome, so the Apostle giueth
to Christians his greatest comfort in the last roome,
wherof this is the Summe: Our af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ictions are so far
from being preiudicial to our saluation, that by the
contrary, through the Lords marueilous working,
they tend to the aduancment thereof, &amp; he enlarges
the comfort: Not only afflictions, but, <hi>all other things
workes for the best together, to them that loue the Lord.</hi>

So also in the worke of Redemption: for by cursed

to Glory: And this same order, the Lord keeps yet

the meanes which he vseth in working, are contrary

hee is an accuser of vs to the iudge; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth,

Then thou, who wouldst be comforted with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance

this mortal life of ours, is a short interiected
poynt of Time betwixt two Eternities (if so I may

worke out their saluation; and so steppes from Gods

the decree of Reprobation, that most iustly they
procure their euerlasting condemnation: So that
euery man is to consider of his euerlasting weale or
woe by his present disposition in this life. Oh that
we had sanctified memories, to remember this so
long as we are heere. If of weakenesse we fall, we
may rise againe: and if we haue not learned well to

               <note place="margin">What comfort wee haue in this, that our saluation is grounded on the Lords vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable purpose.</note> Heere you see then
how the Apostle draweth our <hi>Calling</hi> from the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

certaintie of our Saluation, hee leades vs out of our
selues, vp to the Rocke that is higher then wee; hee
teacheth vs to cast our Anchor within the Vaile, and
to fasten our Soules vpon that vnchangeable <hi>Purpose
of God.</hi> It is most expedient for the children of God,
to marke this, because the manifold changes we find

the which no sacriledge more fearefull can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

in three Circles; they onely being happy who
are within the third. In the outmost Circle are all
those on whom the Lord hath not vouchsafed so
much as an outward calling; and heere standes the
<pb facs="tcp:15080:19"/>
greatest part of the world. In the middlemost Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which is much narrower, are all those which are
partakers of Gods outward calling by the Word &amp;
Sacraments. And in the third Circle, which is of
smallest compasse (in regard of the rest) stands those,
who beside the outward calling of God by his Word,
are called also inwardly and effectually by his Holy
Spirit. These are Christes litle Flocke, the few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
the communion of Saincts, the Lords <hi>third part,</hi>

and they shall say. The Lord is my God.</hi> It is a great step
in deed, that wee are brought from the vttermost
Circle vnto the second, but it is not sufficient to
saluation: yea rather they who stand in the second
Circle, hearing the voyce of God call them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and yet harden their heartes, and will not
follow the Lord, may looke for a more fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation,
then they who are in the vttermost
rancke of all. Waightie are those warninges of our
Sauiour: <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> shall be in an easier
estate in the day of Iudgement, then they to whom
the Lord hath spoken by his word, but they would
not receiue it: and that double stripes are for him
that knowes his Maisters will, and doth it not. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not your selfe therefore with this, that yee are
brought within the compasse of this visible Church,
and made partakers of an outward Calling; that yee
haue been Baptized in the name of Iesus, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

yea perhaps many in the Familie wherein thou

about you, but not vpon your Land, would you not
conceiue in it a sensible cursse of God vpon you?
O Hypocrite, thou that canst discerne the face of the
Skie, and take vp the tokens of Gods anger in the
creature, canst thou not discerne the state of thine
owne soule, nor apprehend this for a sensible cursse,
that 30. or 40. yeares the showers of sauing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
Grace, hath descended vpon many people
round about thee; but neuer vpon thy selfe? thou
possessest thy old sinnes, and keepest still a hard, a

to cut thee off from all hope of Mercy, and so send
thee to despaire; I haue not that in commission: the
Lord hath his owne time of Calling, and can when
he will, of <hi>Saul</hi> a persecutor, make <hi>Paul</hi> a Preacher.
But one thing I can certifie thee of, So long as thou
art in that state, mourne if thou wilt, thou hast much
cause of mourning; for if this effectuall Calling by
Grace, go by thee in time to come, as it hath done is
time bygan, it is an euident declaration, that thou
art a man reserued to wrath, and not ordayned to

he begins at the illumination of the minde: For we
