            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Of how singular use a Treatise of this kind may prove to all sorts of people, may e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sily be conceived, if we do but consider
<pb facs="tcp:57287:3"/>
how hard a matter it is to get any body but to enter into an infected house; the great Charge it is for poor people to pay a Nurse, and how ignorant the most of them are of their business when they are obtained.</p>
            <p>Or do but consider what a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it is, when it happens in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where none hath had the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and a Tender is not to be gotten; whereby the Husband, is constrained to tend the Wife, or she her Husband; or they sometimes three, four or more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sick of this Disease: How Ioyful would they be to know my cheap Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, for preserving some to tend the rest? Or to be assured with what Liquor they may boldly and safely refresh their Darling Husbands, Wives, or scorched thirsty Babes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57287:3"/>Or what would not some pretty Maidens (yea, or young men either) give, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that beauty they have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
            <p>All this have I (by Gods assistance) often performed, far beyond the expectation or belief of most people, and now for the general good of Mankind do freely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate my Experience.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, Let me perswade you, not to give heed to those who (out of Envy, or Self-Interest, <hi>Demetrius</hi> like) tell you that I do not understand the Subject of which I have written, because I cry down cooling Liquors as poyson to Febrile people; for I do assure you that I have not Wrote from bare Conjecture, but from undeniable Experiments; as you will quickly find when you do put my Advice into Practice.</p>

The later did immediately (after the death of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) seek to me, and God so blessed my Endeavours that not one more died, yet one Child or <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> more had the Disease; but, if I forget not, they hardly kept their bed a day for it.</p>
            <p>One great Cause of this Disease being so Mortal in the Country, is because the Infection doth make many Physitians backward to visit such Patients, either for fear of taking the Disease themselves or transferring the infection to others.</p>
            <p>By this means the Tending Nurses do generally assume the sole Authority of Physitians, although that their Experience perhaps is no more, but what they did gather by their being once a sufferer under the like ignorant practicing Nurses.</p>
            <p>And in case the Master of the Family do give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Trouble and Charge of taking Advice and Remedies of some able Physitian, yet this signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for their ignorant Confidence is such, that they will be <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> guided no farther by it than it agrees with their own shallow Brains, and Customary Practice.</p>
            <p>And considering how hard it is to break or alter an Old Custom that hath fully possessed the fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of a multitude of ignorant people; I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57287:5"/>
resolved not to strive against so turbulent a stream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather endeavour to make such (as are not too proud to learn) more able in their Callings, by communicating my Knowledge, grounded on Reason, and confirmed by many Experiments.</p>
            <p>And to begin I will teach an Antidote or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Medicine, which is this;</p>
            <p>Take <hi>flos sulphuris (i. e.</hi>) flowers of Brimstone (which is commonly sold by the Apothecaries) four ounces, of clarified Honey one pound; warm the Honey, and then stir in the powder, and so keep it in a Gally-pot for your use.</p>
            <p>And when you do conceive your self to be in danger of the small Pox, take the quantity of a Nutmeg or more, at Morning and Evening or oftener if you please.</p>
            <p>You may go about your business as at other times, not minding any order of Diet, for it is a very safe harmless Medicine and never the worse for being cheap. I have had very happy success in the using it, as there are several living can bear me <note n="e" place="margin">Hen. Bets<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth <hi>a Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcher in</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</note> Witness; and some of them (I believe) will wonder to see me make it so common, but it is the Real Good of my Neighbour that I do aim at in publishing this Paper, and not Applause.</p>
            <p>Those people that are near a Chymist may do well to get such flowers as have been twice or thrice sublimed; and the last time from <hi>Colcothar</hi>; for an Ounce of such are worth 3 or 4 ounces of those that are commonly sold.</p>
            <p>

               </note> Air; as you may see that a common surfet (as you call it) when the small-pox is Epidemical it often turneth to be the small-pox, which had otherwise proved only a putrid Feaver. But of this I have given a larger account in another Treatise, which I hope short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to publish.</p>
            <p>I will say no more of Vomits in this place, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the aforesaid book shewed almost a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal use of them, and proved it by undeniable Experiments.</p>
            <p>And considering the aversness of many people to this kind of Physick; partly out of a natural Antipathy, but more from observing the bad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of ill prepared Medicines, too frequently made use of by such, whose Idleness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance keeps them from the knowledge of good Chymical Remedies; of which well prepared <hi>Vomits</hi> are (to my knowledge) of most admirable benefit to sick People.</p>
            <p>Well, if you will not be so suddenly rid of your Disease, as you might be by vomiting half a dozen times in two hours space; then I must give a touch again at the order of diet. And here I will tell you again, that if you keep your Patients from strong Beer to satisfie their Thirst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you do thereby exceedingly increase the Disease: And note likewise, that if you perswade them to eat either Flesh or Broth, you do almost as ill; But if you will be feeding them (though far better it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57287:8"/>
were let alone until they Hunger after it) then give them now and then three or four spoonfuls of a plain Sack-Posset, or a piece of White-bread Toast dipped in such strong Liquor as the Patient likes best, whether it be Sack, White-wine, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin, Cyder, March or Mild Beer, or good Ale: and fear not to let him make his Toast swim in his Stomach if he do desire it.</p>
            <p>And for to make you the bolder I will give you Doctor <hi>Thompsons</hi> Opinion herein, in his Book of preserving the Bloud, <hi>pag.</hi> 164, says he, <q>Let none then Haesitate to offer liberally what is potulent or liquid to one that is Thirsty, for 'tis both necessary and consentaneous to Nature so to do: yea, through this omission the good juice or solid parts may suffer a deperdition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the next <hi>page,</hi> having given divers Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for giving strong Beer in Fevers, he breaks out thus, <q>Away then with these Clogging, Dull, Flat, Vapid, Debilitating Decoctions of the Kitchin, with all their crude vegitable Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, most injurious to a febrile Stomach.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Page 166 at Figure 3, he writes thus, <q>As there are a company of Non-sensical Physitians, who are loath to allow the dry soul of one scorched in a Fever a sufficient quantity of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture to allay their Thirst: so are there Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Learned Dogmatists (I am certain Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously Ignorant in this particular) who though they assent their Patients should have good store of Liquor granted them, as properly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the indication of Siccity or drought,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57287:8"/>
yet must it be so qualified, that it ought by no means to contain too many hot particles, least they should seem to act contrary to the definition of a Feaver which is as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it but falsly a preter-natural heat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they strictly enjoyn Posset-drink made with some poor starvling Liquor, Barley-water, wherein cooling or very temperate Herbs are boyled, small Beer, fair Water, Rose-water, with some acid Juice mixed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this they most devoutly keep a weak Wretch, not doubting to mitigate (although they have failed many Million of times) a <hi>Causos</hi> or any burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after he saith, <q>That they will by no means approve of a Cup of Wine, or a draught of strong Beer or Ale (because too hot as 'tis fancied) the Principal Corroborating <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>If they come forth ill or seem too flat (as you call it) then give now and then a Glass of Sack, with a dozen or twenty drops of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> therein; this chears the Vital Spirit

               </gap>rd to obtain; for the more excellent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is; the more are they which do (through ignorance or Avarice) Adulterate the same.</p>

               </gap>refore take this Course, first observe if it be thick as bloud, then it is Rich or strong of the Ingredients, and the fewer drops will serve for a Dose. Secondly, Smell to it, if it be strong of the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fron, that is another Token of its Goodness. Thirdly, Taste a drop on your tongue, for although it be always bitter, yet the less bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the more better; for that is a sign of being well dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sted. But if all these hold, and it hath a harsh Taste on the Tongue, it is not good; as being made with a Menstruum mixed with Oyl of Vitriol or Sulphur; which although I have directed to be given in the Patients Beer, yet in the Elixir it is not to be allowed; because it doth corrode the principal ingredients, <hi>viz.</hi> Myrrh, Aloes, and Saffron.</p>
            <p>Yet for all what I have said, you had better make use of either of them, then to have none; although I have seen some sold, that I would not give one ounce of my own preparing, for four of that; of the reason of which odds, I could easily make any ingenious man sensible, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together.</p>
            <p>In the next place, there is a Medicine sold in many places by the Name of <hi>Mathews</hi>'s <hi>Pill,</hi> but in Truth Doctor <hi>George Starkey</hi> was the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57287:9"/>
first discoverer of that Excellent Remedy. But be the Author who it will, its Vertues doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare his worth; for I never saw any thing used by any Physitian that did ever come near it for giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ase, and rest in any Feaver of what kind soever.</p>
            <p>But I might here make the same complaint as I did about preparing the <hi>Elixir,</hi> but I forbear.</p>
            <p>But I will teach you the right use thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my many years Experience.</p>
            <p>If your Patient be suddenly taken so ill as to desire to go to Bed, you may presently give him two Pills as big as a Pease, and a draught of strong Beer with or after them, and if the party do neither Sleep nor Sweat in an Hour or two, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them again, and Beer as before; and repeat it again, and again too, if need be. But if sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth not compel them to their bed, defer the giving them Pills until bed-time; but do not miss giving two or three at going to bed during the whole time of Cure.</p>
            <p>But do not load them with Clothes (as the common Fashion is) but let them be covered, as may be well-pleasing to the Patient, and of the two it were better they are a little too cold, than to be ever so little too hot.</p>
            <p>Now because this may seem a Paradox to some people, being so diametrically opposite to common practice, I will give my Reason for so doing.</p>

            <p>

            <p>It may here be expected, that I should teach some Excellent Oyntment to prevent the Pits, Marks and Scars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which do commonly succeed this Disease; but I tell you that if the foregoing Instructions have been but indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, there will be no need of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But for their sakes who (through some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or other) have neglected it, I will give a word or two of this also, for I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do somewhat in this kind of Practice; but I would not have my Reader imagine that I do pretend to an absolute deletion by this way;

            <p>Now if any know better (as I doubt not but better is) I should be glad if either out of Christian Charity or Human Pity; he would communicate it to the World for the benefit of poor afflicted Mortals, whose Torment under this Disease cannot be demonstrated by any Pen; I mean when they have them much, and happen

               </gap>ied that defect by way of an Appendix, rather than to leave it defective in so Material a point.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will first shew (to such as have a little insight into <hi>Astrology</hi>) how to Elect a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time for the Administration of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57287:13"/>
and then teach the Nurse how to do her Office.</p>
            <p>First observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what <hi>Sign</hi> the Moon is in; for that is the Basis of your Work.</p>
            <p>For of all the signs in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> those that rese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble such Beasts as do chaw the Cud, are by a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neral Consent of <hi>Physitians</hi> accounted the best. And I do know it to be so by my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ience.</p>
            <p>Now which particular signs I do prefer before o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her, you shall know by my order in placing them; that which I place first, to be first made choice of.</p>
            <p>For I do esteem <hi>Capricorn</hi> (♑) before all the rest; the next, <hi>Taurus</hi> (♉); then <hi>Aries</hi> (♈); after these, <hi>Cancer</hi> (♋); <hi>Pisces</hi> (♓); <hi>Scorpio</hi> (♏) and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> (♐). The Moon being in any of these seven will do indifferent well; but the other five I reject except on very urgent occasion: the worst of the five are <hi>Leo</hi> (♌) and <hi>Aquarius</hi> (♒). I do hardly ever give a <hi>Vomit</hi> when the Moon is in either of them, nor often being in <hi>Libra</hi> (♎), <hi>Gemini</hi> (♊) or <hi>Virgo</hi> (♍), but the last is the best of the last five.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Observe with what Aspect, and from what <hi>Planet</hi> the Moon is beheld, for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she be void of Course, than to be beheld by any <hi>Planet</hi> so that her next Application be good:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57287:13"/>
And I do prefer the ill Aspects of <hi>Iupiter</hi> (♃) or <hi>Venus</hi> (♀), rather than the good Aspects of <hi>Saturn</hi> (♄) or <hi>Mars</hi> (♂). But the Moon being in <hi>Conjunction</hi> (☌) <hi>Quartile</hi> (<g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>) or <hi>Opposition</hi> (☍), with <hi>Saturn</hi> (♄) <hi>Sol</hi> (☉) or <hi>Mars</hi> (♂), beware of giving any purging Medicine. And (☉) and (♄) being so Aspected you ought to forbear likewise.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let one of those seven Signs ascend; and carefully avoid the presence of ♄ or <hi>Mars</hi> therein; neither let them nor the ☉ behold the Degree ascending (partilly) by any bad Aspect, but ☉ corporally in the Ascendant in any of those seven <hi>Signs</hi> is good.</p>
            <p>Much more might be said on this Subject, but I design Brevity, and this is the ground of all; and what I have written, I have proved by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Thousands of Experiments. Now such whose Understandings cannot comprehend this, let them observe when the Moon is in one of those seven <hi>Signs, viz,</hi> ♑, ♉, ♈, ♋, ♓, ♏, ♐, and avoid such days as she changes on, the full and either of her quarters.</p>
            <p>In the next place I must teach the Nurse how to govern the Physick in the time of its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you give any of the Vitriol Vomits, you need not be very curious, do but thus; give a good draught of strong Mild Beer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57287:14"/>
to the Patient, and in a quarter, or half an Hour after give the Physick, being dissolved in a little such Beer, and then some Sugar put into it; which for the most part doth quickly come up again loaded with ill Humors; then presently give the party another draught of the like Beer warm; do thus as often as the Patient doth C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, which will be sometimes two, three, or four times.</p>
            <p>But if you take an Antimonial Vomit, then you had need to be more Circumspect.</p>
            <p>The best that I do know (that is to be had at the Shops) is that which is called <hi>Aqua Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And because I have seen some Country-Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make their Posset-drink very ill, I will tell you how, and likewise how much I do usually make to be imploy'd in the working of one Purge.</p>
            <p>I take most commonly two Quarts of Milk, and when it is ready to boil I do pour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into a quart of strong Beer but not too stale (because that would make the posset have a sowre Taste) and so let it stand over the fire until it be clear.</p>
            <p>For the most part these Vomits are just two Hours in the working. And for my <hi>Emeto Cathar</hi> (or vomiting Purge) you may eat, drink, or sleep as soon as it is over, but commonly they do chuse to lie down on a Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57287:15"/>And that Night I do usually give the <hi>Patient</hi> three of my <hi>Fever Pills</hi> as big as a pease, and a draught of strong Liquor after them, having sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped (either not at all, or) two hours before.</p>
            <p>And in regard many people loath <hi>Posset-drink</hi> (and not to drink good store of some Liquor were like a Laundress washing with Soap and none or little Water) I will tell you what will do as well, and that is strong mild Beer or Ale: But Broath is not good, and Gruel is much worse as I have seen proved.</p>
            <p>There is nothing (as I conceive) material now wanting, if you do but Accept it as kindly, as I have Candidly Communicated the same, not resting on Conjecture, (for there is no Argument beyond Experience) but making a practical Use of it. I doubt not but many Thousands will praise God for putting it into my heart to divulge it so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the World.</p>

            <head>THE POST-SCRIPT To the Indifferent READERS Within the Compass of my Acquaintance.</head>

            </opener>
            <p>I Would not have you Despise the Matter for the Meaness of the Stile, nor the Subject for the plainess of the Authors Coat; for a Man is no more known by his Raiment, than a good Horse by his Trappings, or a good Gun by the Stock. Be not carried away from the Truth with the Gingling Eloquence of such who by Flattery have gained a Repute in the World, but try the matter by your own Reason, and Senses; according to that saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That <hi>we ought to give credit to Reason, if the things
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57287:16"/>
of Reason agree with Experience.</hi> I say Try, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, not what is reported of me, (for Ill-Will and Self-Interest pervert Judgment) therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of those that have been my Patients, of what Cures have been done by me of all kinds; whereof many are such as are generally accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uncurable. But no more of this at present</p>
            <p>But a Word or two of Fevers, in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease it is known far and near that my practice hath been quite contrary to the common Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom; I thinking it no shame to follow Truth, although therefore very few will follow me, the Major Part aiming more at Greatness than Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And as an Ingenuous Man said once, That <hi>although Truth ought to be followed by all, yet he that keeps too close to its heels might chance to have his Teeth dash'd out</hi>; so have I been in danger of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for no other Offence. For I am of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who said, <hi>To follow</hi> Gallen <hi>any farther than he follows Truth is great wickedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it cannot seem strange to any Intelligent Person that I should ever and anon be followed with such cruel Clamors, making all people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (who are ignorant of my practice) that thorow Ignorance and want of good Remedies, I destroy most that I do take in hand; when the Authors themselves know that it is as full of Falsity as the Sun is full of Light. But herein they play the Fox that dispraised those <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Now I will tell you some of their Practices. Never was any poor Mouse more narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Vigilant Cat, than I have been by them, or some of their deluded followers, so that if a Patient Fortune to miscarry under my care, it is presently ascribed to me or my Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of the Female Counsel, and will not <hi>Lead</hi> my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents by Bleeding, Cupping, Blisters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as it were through an Earthly Purgatory) <hi>Alamode</hi> to their Grave, hereby I say if a Patient of mine Dye, they report all the Country over that I kill'd him or her; with most bitter Hyperbolical, false Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, as extream swelling, it never work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as watchful as my Antagonists have been, let them prove to the contrary and I will subscribe a paper of Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if their Evidence be uninterested persons of Credit.</p>
            <p>I must yet come closer, if they be angry I cannot help it, nor care I for it.</p>
            <p>Are not ordinary Feavers the means to carry a great number of people to their Graves yearly? Let them look over their Books and then tell me, if they have not lost out of the like number ten for my one.</p>
            <p>If this soap will not wash off the Dirt with which I have been so unworthily bespattered; I will offer one more scowring Remedy. Let any of them come to matter of Fact, and abide but a fair Trial; and I will lose Five Guinnies, if I do not Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of Febrile Patients two for their one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57287:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>But I suppose they will say, they hardly know any practice that I have had in this kind. I believe so too, but it is because I any Fever (except <hi>Hectick</hi> and <hi>Pestilential)</hi> in few days, if I am called as soon as the patient doth appear to be very ill and then it is looked at as a thing not worth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But you <hi>T's</hi> that cannot Credit my Report without proof, if you are neer <hi>Chichester</hi> pray enquire of Mr. <hi>Iennings</hi> his Daughter, Mistress <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and if any thing thereabout will make against my Discourse I make no doubt but I have a sort of such <hi>Friends</hi> as will discover the business without troubling me to search either my Notes or Memory.</p>
            <p>Besides hers being a putrid Fever, I will tell you somewhat concerning a Malignant Fever. In the year 80 or 81, there were great Numbers of people died of such Fevers, many whereof were taken with Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I had the Good Fortune to cure Eighteen in the Parish of <hi>Alding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> not one dying in that great compass of that Disease; Mr. <hi>Henry Whitington</hi> and his Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of them.</p>
            <p>Now it remains that I give a Reason for this tedious Post-script and so conclude.</p>
            <p>Yet I had overslipt one thing being very proper to be spoken of; and that is that since the whole Treatise is concerning the small pox, to say a word or two of my Experience herein.</p>
            <p>When this Distemper did rage so much in and about <hi>Chichester,</hi> (ten or a dozen years since) it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57287:18"/>
was a great many that fell under my Care, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve sixty at the least and yet I lost but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Disease. Nor was one of my Patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s marked with them, to be seen but half a year after. My success being such that many people thought themselves almost out of danger, if they could but get one of those Nurses into their houses that did use to Tend my Patients.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Reason of this Post-script, I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Study and Labour attained to a far better, safer and speedier way of curing Diseases, than was ever taught by <hi>Galen,</hi> did think my self bound in Conscience to give my Neighbours warning of the danger of their <hi>Botcherly, Butcherly, Cruel</hi> manner of practice, of Bleeding, Blisters, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Cauteries, Actual and Potential Fontinels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby I (like <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus)</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the whole Tribe of the Medicinal Art against me; and this was not unreasonable neither, for if they lose these, the chief profit of their Trade is gone.</p>
            <p>Then do but consider how vain a thing it is, for one single person to stand upon his guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Multitude of mad, resolute, self-will'd opposers. It is but like one going about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish a Heath-fire, when there are above one hundred others as exquisite persons, as industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imploy'd to kindle the said fire in fresh places whilst he is putting it out where it first arose. So for me to make any defence against so violent and numerous, mad, heady kind of people,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57287:19"/>
were but like barking against the Wind; or a <hi>Hare</hi> to undertake to Expostulate with a Pack of Hounds.</p>
            <p>For me to lose a Patient, there is a Clamor presently just like that in a Country Village, when a Dog hath kill'd a Sheep; but for a score of theirs to die, there's no more Notice taken of it than for as many Sheep to lose their Lives in a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Slaughter-House.</p>
            <p>For the Female Jury have always this healing Balsam ready; <hi>Why he did as much as the Art of Man could do, but alas his time was come.</hi> Very true, and so is his time come that is hanged, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps he might have lived much longer had not the Executioner's unlucky Knot prevented him.</p>
