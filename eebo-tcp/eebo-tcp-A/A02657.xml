         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both sicke and fore, as neyther can or may walke abroade for
reliefe and comfort (where in deede most mercy is to be shewed,) And
for that, I (most honorable Lady) being placed as a poore gentleman,
haue kept a house these twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty dyily hath
and doth repayre, not without some reliefe as my poore callinge and
habilitie may and doth extende: I haue of late yeares gathered a great

for they would all saye, if the vpright men should vnderstand thereof,
they should not bee onely greeuously beaten, but put in daunger of
their lyues, by the sayd vpright men. There was a fewe yeares since a
small breefe set foorth of some zelous man to his countrey, of whom
I knowe not, that made a little shewe of their names and vsage, and

as it were in a glasse, that thereby the Iusticers and Shreeues maye in
their circuites be more vigilant to punishe these malefactores, and the
Constables, Baylifes and housholders, setting asyde all feare, slouth, &amp;
pitie, may bee more circumspect in executing the charge gyuen them
by the aforesayd Iusticers. Then will no more this rascall rablement
raunge about the countrey. Then greater reliefe may be shewed to the
pouerty of eche parishe. Then shall wee keepe our horses in our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
vnstolen. Then our lynnen clothes shall and may lye safely on
our hedges vntouched. Then shall wee not haue our clothes and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
hooked out at our windowes, as well by daye as by night Then
shall wee not haue our houses broken vp in the nyght, as of late one of
my neyghbours had and twoo great buckes of clothes stolen out, and
most of the same fyne linnen. Then shall wee safely keepe our pigges
and poultrey from pylfering Then shall wee surely passe by the high
wayes leading to markets and faires vnharmed. Then shall our shops
and bothes be vnpicked and spoiled. Then shall these vncomely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
bee dispersed and set to labour for their lyuing, or hastely hang

sinne and wyckednes so much abounde among vs. Then will gods
wrath be much the more pacified towards vs. Then shall wee not taste
of so many and sundry plagues as now daylye raigneth ouer vs. And
then shall this famous Empyre be in more welth and better floryshe,
to the inestimable ioye and comforte of the Queenes most excellente

Now, me thinketh I see how these peuish, peruerse and pestilent
people begin to freat, fume, sweare, and stare at this my booke, theyr
lyfe beinge layde open and apparantly paynted out, that their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and end draweth on apace: where as in deede if it be well wayed, it
is set forth for theyr singular profyt and commoditie, for the sure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uegard
of their liues here in this world, that thei shorten not the same
before their time, and that by their true laboure and good lyfe, in the
world to come they may saue their soules, that Christe the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Trinitie hath so derely bought with his most precious bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that hereby I shall do them more good then they could haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for themselues. For behold, their life being so manifest wicked, &amp;
so apparantly knowne: the honorable will abhorre them: the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
will reiecte them: the yeoman will sharplye tawnte them:
the husband men vtterly defye them: the labouringe men bluntlye
chyde them: the wemen wyth a loude exclamation wonder at them:
And all children wyth clappynge handes crye out at them. I manye

when they toke their original and beginning, howe longe they haue

with a very olde man that I was well acquainted with, whose witte
and memory is maruelous for his yeares, being about the age of foure
score, what hee knewe when he was yonge of these lousey lewterars.
And he shewed mee that when hee was yonge, he wayted vpon a man
of much worship in Kent, who dyed immediatly after the last Duke
of Buckingham was beheaded, at his buryall there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to their houses, the other wayfaring bold beggers remained all night
in the barn, and the same barne being serched with light in the night
by this old man and then yonge and others, they tolde seuen score
persons of men, euery of them hauing his woman, except it were two
wemen that lay alone togyther for some especiall cause. Thus hauing
their makes to make mery withall: the buriall was tourned to bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and belly cheere, mourning to myrth, fasting to feasting, prayer
to pastyme, and pressing of paps and lamenting to lecherye. So that
it may appeare this vncomly company hath had a long continuance
but then nothinge geuen so much to pylferinge, pyckinge and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and as far as I can learne or vnderstande by the examination of a
number of them, their language which they terme peddelers Frenche
or Canting, began but within these xxx. yeres or litle aboue, and that
the first inuenter thereof was hanged all saue the head, for that is the
finall ende of them al, or elles to dye of some filthy and horrible disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
but much harme is done in the meane space by their continuance
as some x. xii. and xvi. yeares before they be consumed; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them doth dayly renew. I hope their sinne is nowe at the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest,
and that as short and as speedy redresse wilbe for these, as hath
bene of late yeares for the wretched, wyly wandering vagabonds cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and naming them selues Egyptians, deeply dissembling and long
hyding and couering their depe deceiteful practises, feeding the rude
common people wholly addicted and geuen to nouelties, toyes, and
new inuentions, delyting them with the straungenes of the attyre of
their heades, and practising paulmistrye to such as would knowe their
fortunes. And to be short, all theues and hoores (as I may well write)
as some haue had true experience, a number can well witnesse, and a
great sort hath well felte it. And nowe (thankes bee to God) through
wholsome lawes and the due execution thereof, all bee dispersed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and the memory of them cleane extinguished, that when they
bee once named hereafter, our Chyldren will muche marueill what
kind of people they were: and so I trust shall shortly happen of these.
For what thing doth chiefely cause these rowsey rake helles thus to
continew and dayly increase? surely a number of wicked persons that
keepe typling houses in all shiers, where they haue succoure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
and what so euer they bryng, they are sure to receyue money for
the same, for they sel good peny worthes. The byers haue the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:6331:4"/>
gayne, yea yf they haue neither money nor ware, they wylbe trusted,
their credit is much I haue taken a note of a good many of them, and
will send their names and dwelling places to such Iusticers as dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
nere or next vnto them, that they by their good wisedomes may
displace the same, and authorise such as haue honesty. I will not blot
my booke with their names, because they be resident. But as for this
fleeting fellowship, I haue truly set forth the most part of them, that
be doers at this present with their names that they be knowne by.
Also I haue placed in the end therof their leud language, callinge the
same pedlers French or Canting. And now shall I ende my prologue,
making true declaration (right honorable Lady) as they shall fall in
order of their vntemely tryfelinge tyme, leude lyfe, and pernitious
practises, trusting that the same shall neyther trouble or abashe your
most tender, tymerous and pytyfull Nature, to thinke the smal mode
should growe vnto you for such almes so geuen. For God our mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and most louing father, well knoweth your harte and good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
the gyuer neuer wanteth his rewarde, accordinge to the sayinge
of Sainct Augustin: as there is (neyther shalbe) any sinne vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
euen so shall there not be any good deede vnrewarded But how
comfortably speaketh Christ our Sauiour vnto vs in his gospell (giue
ye and it shalbe gyuen you agayne) behold further, good Madam that
for a cup of colde water, Christ hath promised a good rewarde. Nowe
sainct Austine properly declareth why Christ speaketh of cold water,
because the poorest man that is, shall not excuse him selfe from that
charitable work, least he would peraduenture saye that he hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wood, pot nor pan to warme any water with. See further what
God speaketh in the mouth of his prophet Esaye. Break thy bread to
him that is a hungred, he sayth not giue him a whole lofe: for perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentute
the poore man hath it not to gyue, then let him gyue a piece.
This much is sayd because the poore that hath it should not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
now how much more then the riche. Thus you see good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
for your treasure here dispersed, where neede and lacke
is, it shalbe heaped vp aboundantly for you in heauen,
wher neither rust or moth shal corrupt or destroy
the same. Vnto which triumphant place after
many good happy, and fortunat yeres pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously

            <p>I had of late yeares an old man to my tenant, who customablye
a great tyme, went twise in the wéeke to London, eyther with fruit
or with pescodes, when time serued therefore. And as hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
homewarde on blacke heathe, at the ende thereof next to shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hill, he ouertoke two Rufflars, the one manerly waiting on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other, as one had ben the maister, and the other the man or seruant
<pb facs="tcp:6331:6"/>
carying his maister cloke: This olde man was very gladde that hée
might haue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany ouer the bill, bicause that day he had made
a good market, for he had seuen shillings in his purse, and an olde
angell, which this pore man had thought had not bene in his purse,
for he willed his wife ouer night to take out the same Angell, and
lay it vp vntill his comming home againe. And he verely thought
that his wyfe had so done, which in deed forgot to doe it. Thus after
salutations, had this maister rufflar entred into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with
this simple olde man, who ryding softly beside them commoned of
many matters. Thus feding this old man with pleasant talke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they were on the toppe of the hyll where these rufflars myghte
well behold the coaste about them cleare, quickly steppes vnto this
poore man, and taketh holde of his horse brydell, and leadeth him in
to the wode, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he
had in his purse. Now by my troth quoth this old man, you ar a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gentleman, I knowe you meane not to take awaye any thinge
from me, but rather to giue me some if I should aske it of you. By
and by this seruant thiefe casteth the clok that he caried on his arms
about this poore mans face, that he should not marke or vew them,
with sharp words to deliuer quicly that he had and to confesse truly
what was in his purse. This poore man then al abashed yelded and
confessed he had but iust seuen shillinges in his purse and the truth
is be knew of no more. This old angel was falen out of a little purse
into the botome of a great purse. Now this seuen shillings in whyt
money they quickly found, thinkinge in deed that there had bene no
more, yet farther groping and searching, found this old angell. And
with great admiration this gentle man theese began to blesse him,
saying: good Lorde what a worlde is this, howe maye (quoth hee) a

and therewith went their waye, and lesse the olde man in the
wood doing him no more harme. But sorowfull sighinge this olde
man returning home declared his misaduenture, with al the words

the spittle house: at which house I heard a great noyse, and drawing

out they go in a fustian sume into the back syde, where was a great
Axiltry, and there fell to pitching of the bar, being thrée to three: the
Moone did shyne bright, the Constable with his neighboure might
sée and beholde al that was done. And howe the wyfe of the house
was rosting of a Pyg, whyle her gestes were in their match. At the
last they could not agrée vpon a caste and fell at wordes, and from
wordes to blowes. The Constable wyth his fellowe runnes vntoo
them to parte them, and in the parting lyckes a drye blowe or two.
Then the noyse increased, the Constable would haue had them too
the stockes. The wyfe of the house runnes out with hir good man to
intreat the Constable for her grstes, and leaues the Pyg at the fyre
alone. In commeth two or thrée of the next neighboures being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <p>The Constable returning and hearing the lamentable words
of the good wyfe how she had lost both meate and drinke, and sawe
it was so indeed, he laughed in his sleue, and commaunded her to

of these do go without writings, and will go halfe naked, and looke
most pitiously. And if any clothes be giuen them they immediately
sell the same, for weare it they will not, because they would be the
more pitied, and we are filthy clothes on their heads, and neuer goe
without a péece of whyte sope about them, which if they sée cause or

               <p>¶ Uppon Alhallonday in the morning last Anno Domini <hi>1566.</hi> or
my boke was halfe printed, I meane the first impression, there came
earely in the morninge a counterfet Cranke vnder my lodginge at
the whyte Fryers within the cloyster, in a little yard or court wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>abouts
lay two or thre great Ladyes, being without the liberties of
London, wherby he hoped for the greatter gayne: this Cranke there
lamentably lamenting, and pitifully crying to be relieued, declared
to diuers there his paynful and miserable disease. I being rysen and

him name the fallen sicknes, thought assuredlye to my selfe, that hée
was a depe desembler: so comming out at a sodayne, and beholding
his ougly and yrksome attyre, his lothsom and horible cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinance, it
made me in a maruelous perplexity what to think of him, whether
it were fained or trueth for after this maner went he: he was naked
from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wast vpward, sauing he had an old Ierkin of leather, patched
and that was lose about him, that all his bodye lay out bare a filthy
soul cloth he ware on his head, being cut for the purpose, hauing a na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row
place to put out his face, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a bauer made to trusse vp his beard,
and a string that tyed the same down close about his necke, with an
old felt hat which he still caried in his hand, to receyue the charitye
and deuotion of the people, for that would he hold out from him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his face from the eyes downward, all smerd with fresh bloud,
<pb facs="tcp:6331:15"/>
as though he had new fallen, and bin tormented with his paynefull
panges, his ierken being all berayde with durte and myre, and hys
harte and hosen also, as thoughe hée hadde wallowed in the myer:
surely the sight was monstrous and terrible. I called him vnto me
and demaunded of him what he ayled. A good maister, quoth he, I
haue the gréeuous and payneful disease called the falling sickenes:
why, quoth I, how commeth thy ierkin, hose and hat so berayd wyth
durt and myer, and thy skin also? A good maister I fell down on the
backesyde here in a fowle lane harde by the water syde, and there I
laye almost all night, and haue bled all moste all the bloude out in
my body. It raynd that morninge very faste: and whyle I was thus
talking with him, a honest poore woman that dwelt thereby, brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
him a fayre lynnen cloth, and bid hym wype his face therewith,
and there being a tobbe standing full of rayn water, offered to giue
him some in a dishe, that he might make himselfe cleane, he refuseth
the same: why dost thou so quoth I? A syr saith he, if I shoulde washe
my selfe, I should fall to bleding a fresh agayne, and then I shoulde
not stop my selfe: these words made me the more to suspecte hym.</p>
               <p>Then I asked of him where he was born, what his name was, how
long he had this disease, and what time he had ben here about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

into Saincte Georges fieldes, contrary to my expectation: for I had
thought he would haue gonne into Holborne, or to saynt Gylles in
the field: but these boyes with (Argues and Lynces tyes) sette sure
watch vppon him, and the one toke a Boate and followed him, and
the other went back to tell his maister.</p>
               <p>The boy that so folowed him by water, had no money to pay for
his boate hyre, but layd his Penner and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all celeritie had taken a Boate and followed him a pace. Now had
they a syght still of the Cranke, whiche crossed ouer the fieldes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
Newington, and thither the went, &amp; by that time they came
thether, it was very darke. The Printer had there no acquaintance,
neyther any kinde of weapon about him, neyther knewe he howe
farre the Cranke would goe, because hee then suspected that they
dogged him of purpose, hee there stayed him, and called for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
which came foorth diligently, to inquire what the matter
was. This zelous Printer charged this officer with him as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,

and a dissembling vagabond: the Constable woulde haue
layd him all night in the Cage that stode in the streat: nay saith this
pytyfull Printer, I pray you haue him into your house, for this is
lyke to be a cold night and he is naked, you kepe a vittelling house,
let him be well cherished this night, for he is well able to paye for
the same, I knowe well his gaynes hath ben great to day, and your
house is a sufficient pryson for the tyme, and we will there searche
him: the Constable agreed thereunto, they hadde him in and caused
him to washe himself: that done, they demaunded what money hée
had about him, sayth this Cranke, so God helpe me I haue but xij.
pence, and plucked out the same of a little purse. Why haue you no
more quoth they? no sayth this Cranke, as God shall saue my soule
at the day of iudgment. We must sée more quoth they and began to
strip him, then he plucked out another purse wherein was xl. pence.
Tush sayth this Printer I must sée more, this Cranke sayth, I pray
God I be damned both body and soule, if I haue any more: No saith
this Printer, thou false knaue here is my boye that did watch thée al
this day, and sawe when suche men gaue thée péeces of sire pence,

money. When this Cranke heard this, and the boy vowing it to his
face, he relented and plucked out another purse wherein was eight
shillings &amp; od money, so had they in the whole that he had begged y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

and caused the same to be cast about him, because the sight shoulde
not abashe her shamefast maydens, nether loth hir squaimish sight.
Thus he set him downe at the Chemnes end, and called for a pot of
Béere and dranke of a quart at a drafte, and called for another, and
so the third, that one had ben sufficient for any reasonable man: the
drynk was so stronge, that I my self the next morning tasted therof,
but let the reader iudge what, and how much he would haue dronke
if he had bene out of fear. Then when they had thus wrong water

to conceiue that al was forged &amp; nought. I made the more hast home
for wel I wist that he would and must of force passe through the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

homeward, I found them in the towne accordinge to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
wher they where staid, for there was a Palliard associate
<pb facs="tcp:6331:18"/>
with the Dommerar and partaker of his gaynes, which Pallyards
I saw not at Darford. The staiers of them was a gentleman called
Chayne, &amp; a seruant of my Lord Kéepers, called Wostestow, which
was the chief causer of the staying of them, being a Surgien &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

caused one to speake afore that was dome. It was my chaunce to
come at the beginni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the matter. Syr (<abbr>q</abbr> this Surgien) I am bold
here to vtter some part of my cunning, I trust (quoth he) you shall sée
a myracle wrought anon: for I once (quoth he) made a domme man
to speak. Quoth I you are wel met, and somwhat you haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

this towne, for I well knowe their writing is fayned, and they depe
dissemblers. The Surgien made him gape, &amp; we could sée but halfe
a toung. I required the Surgien to put his finger in his mouth, &amp; to
pull out his toung, and so he did, notwithstanding he held strongly
a prety whyle: at the length he pluckt out the same, to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of many that stode by: yet when we sawe his tounge, hée
would neither speake nor yet could heare. Quoth I to the Surgien,
knit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and rubbe the same vp and downe a little whyle, and for my lyfe he
speaketh by and by. Syr quoth this Surgien, I pray let me practise
an other way, I was well contented to sée the same. He had him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a house, and tyed a halter aboute the wrestes of his handes and

                  </gap>oysed him vp ouer a beam, and their did let him hang a good while
at length for very paine he required for gods sake to let him downe.
So he that was both deafe and dume could in short tyme both heare
and speake. Then I tooke that money I could find in his purse, and
distributed the same to the poore people dwelling there, which was
xv. pence halfpeny, being all that wee coulde finde. That done, and
this mery myracle madly made. I sent them with my seruant to the
nect Iusticer, where they preached on the pyllery for want of a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and were well whypped, and none did bewayle them.</p>

declared her misfortune by fyer done in Somershet shyre, walkinge
with a wallet on her shoulders wherin she put the deuotion of such

bread and cheese: and alwayes as the same was full, so was it ready
money to her when the emptyed the same, wher so euer shee traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
This harlot was (as they terme it) snowt fayre, and hadde an

easely perswaded to liking lechery, and as a man mased, mused how

rauisht with his person, and agréed to méete him presently and to
accomplish his fond fancy: to be short and not tedious, a quarter of a

not) and taking leaue of ech other with a curteous kisse, she pleasant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly

could be found, her mystres hearing that, diligent search was made

well then quoth this hosteler, your sonne hath geuen the same mort
that begged here, for the burninge of her house, a whishell, and you
haue giuen her fyue shillings in money, and I haue geuen her ten

Why, what is the matter quoth his mystres? your sonne sayth this
hostler had some chere and pastime for that whishell, for he lay with
her, and I haue ben well beaten and haue had my pursse taken from

she had donne mee so muche good or this, that I were loth nowe to

your pacient bearing of troubles, your honest behauiour among vs
your neighbours, your tender and pitifull harte to the poore of the

of your faithlesse husband doth instigate and styrre vs to deuyse and

I say to you all, vnlesse it be this good wyfe, who is chefely touched

let vs assemble secretly into the place where hée hath appointed
to méete this gyllot that is at your house and lyrke pryuely in some

I hard you say euen now, that you had a watch word, at which word
we will all stepp forth beinge fiue of vs besides you, for you shalbe
none because it is your husband, but get you to bed at your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

               <p>NOw, I think it not vnnecessary to make the Reader vnderstand
how and in what maner they lodge a nights in barnes or back-houses,
and of their vsage there, for asmuch as I haue acquaynted
them with their order and practises a day tymes. The arch and chief
walkers that hath walked a long tyme, whose experience is great,
because of their continuing practise, I meane all Mortes &amp; Doxes,

men neuer trouble themselues with that thing, but takes the same
to be the duty of the wyfe. And she shuffels vp a quantitie of strawe

layeth her wallet or other little pack of ragges, or scryppe vnder hir
head in the strawe, to beare vp the same, and layeth her peticote or
cloke vpon and ouer the strawe, so made lyke a bedde and that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

she spreddeth some large cloutes or rags ouer the same, and maketh
hir ready and layeth her drousely downe. Many will plucke of their
smockes and lay the same vpon them in stéede of their vpper shéete,
and all her other pelte and trashe vpon her also, and many lyeth in
their smockes. And if the rest of her clothes in cold weather bee not

hath his choyse, and créepeth in close by his Dore, the roge hath his
