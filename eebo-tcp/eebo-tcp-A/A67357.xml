            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Vindication of the KING, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Shall not be curious to satisfie the Reason of any prepossest opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet since the Times hath given an open Presse to cleere every
imagination which is not stifled in this Dampe: I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to contract my own Meditations in a narrow roome; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expose them to the censure of the most judicious, then rest satisfied
alone, and admit this cloudy surface to overwhelme so vast a Body.</p>
            <p>I confesse it was no meane part of my happinesse in our dangerous
extreames, to hope for a happy Union by that Soveraign medicine of a
fading State, a Parliament and knowing the admirable affection of our
gracious Soveraign to the peace and quiet of the Kingdome, though it
was His unspeakable misfortune, never to know the misery of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
till their discontents were growne to that head, they became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
(if not altogether uncureable, by those unreasonable Monopolies,
exacted by some ill affected agents, conducing little to his advantage,
but to the furthering of their ambition, who not withstanding, could as
easily desert him in his misery, as before be the ready instruments to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
him to this mischiefe, upon pretence of a Legall Authority,
which who knowes not a Prince, may bee soone mistaken in, since
none can be so silly, as to beleeve him a studied Lawyer: Yet that this
should expose us to so great an adventure, as not only to divest him of
this suspected arbitrary power, but to confer an absolute government to
any whatsoever, renders me no other action then the Poets,
<q>
                  <l>Incidit in Syllam cupiens vitare caribdim.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if you please to take the true State of the businesse, let your Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Judgement confer with your reason, upon these few notorious
truths. What has the King denyed which concern our Liberty, and are
the undoubted securities of our happinesse, under the regiment of a Just
and unquestionable Monarchy?</p>
            <p>Are not our Rights and Properties already establisht this Parliament,
by such acts of Grace, as could never finde presidents from His Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
besides the utter extirpation of Shipmony, Monopolies, upon
what pretence soever, those arbitrary Courts of Justice, High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Star-Chamber, Marshalseas, &amp;c. Has he not importuned the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Religion in his purity, and that there might be a Law, to secure
the tender consciences of those who will not agree the Ceremonies.
Are not the taking away these sufficient ground to desolve our Jealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
if ever we mean to be satisfied. As for their feares, I wish wee
had as little reason to suspect the fomenters, as we have the King, who
is so clearly divested of any power, to make good the least injustice, that
it's too great a hazard on his part to adventure what our consciences
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29675:2"/>
enforce us to make good for Him on our part: and the conservation of
those are so attested by him (in the word of a King) with such unusuall
expressions, that if they came from a stranger, (I suspected not an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell)
I was bound to beleeve in charity, witnesse those serious asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<hi>God so deale with Me and my Children, as I intend to conserve my
Parliament in its Priviledges, the Rights of the Subject, and the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Protestant Religion, God so prosper me in what I take in hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there yet a further way to establish them, whereby they may be so
secure, that a violation may seeme impossible, with out the subversion of
the very letter of the Law: Why is it not proposed if it be no Invasion
of that Just Prerogative was never denyed his Ancestors? and what he
hath deserved of us, that he may not be as far trusted, is as hard to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as easily answered. If then we must needes agree that therebeing
nothing so cleare, why should any subtile pretences, hinder our desired
accommodation, unlesse there be that intend the alteration of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and how inconsistant that may prove to a People already
managed, under the united order of a vertuous King, daily experience
offers it too easie of conjecture. Yet for our better satisfaction, lets
weigh the amends we are like to make our selves, from these few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
amongst the thousands which daily expose themselves
to our view.</p>
            <p>1. The unlimited power of the two Houses have already assumed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own hands, a formall all Ordinance countermanding, suspending,
nay, creating Acts of Parliament, though not in the name of Acts, yet
in the power of Acts, whereby both King and People are obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey;
how to distinguish this Ordinance from an Act of State, I am not
well satisfied; yet I have heard it cald Treason in one of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
for this comparison, though with that cautious provisoe, That it
should be no leading case to future ages for Judges to imitate. Is this
the security of our undoubted Rights we have so long endeavoured:
who carries not now his life in his hand, managed by an exact power of
a bare Vote, which if any contradicts, must suffer under the name of a
malignant party, though of their own Members, and not proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
by the Justice of any president Acts, but condemned by the Votes
of the present Session; and if this be not an absolute subversion of the
Rights of Parliament, and destructive to the fundamentall Laws of our
Kingdome (wherein our liberty consists) I would fain be satisfied what
is, for 'tis most apparant to, whosoever examines their ordinary proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
we have no law left but what serves their turne; and if that bee
defective, to punish those they please to call Delinquents, their Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue
Ordinance can as well supply that defect, as it could make that
obnoxious, which till this Parliament no man could ever call a fault.</p>
            <p>2. This continuing power of the two Houses, which if they had
had a mind should ever be remitted, they would have either expressed
<pb facs="tcp:29675:3"/>
it in their first demand, and limitted it to a certaine time, wherin they
might have compleatly qualified the disquiet countenance of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Estate; or since have endeavoured some Remonstrance for our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in that particular: For I would fain be answered, First, if
they sit while they list, and passe what they list, whether they have not
(during their pleasure) subverted our Monarchy by their democracie
and Invested themselves of a power more Arbitrary, then the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
Government could pretend to, that having his limitations and
Rules of Law, which the Iudges are to answer (if they mistake) or
those that advise the King; their democracy having no bounds, be but
a thing of Yesterday, and which as yet we cannot understand, assuming
to themselves the sole power to Iudge of our dangers, and propose
such remedy, as may answer their pretences.</p>
            <p>2. How every consciencious man can dispence with that sacred
Oath of Allegiance, wherein He cals God to Witnesse for the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Princes Iust Prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Protestation to maintain
an absolute and unlimited power in the two Houses, wrested to those
Ordinances expressely inhibited by His Majesties speciall commands;
in my understanding it is to no other purpose, then to lead us into a
Maze, where when we are lost by our understanding (which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be the principall of our subversion, They will offer us a Clue,
shall either lead us to their premeditated designes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
they will become our Masters, or to an inevitable Ruine, before we
know the reason of our Fears and Iealousies, being the old Rule they
so often enveighed against, First to trouble a State, then to subvert the
Government. Let it not be objected now, that I am against Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for (God knowes) I am for them, and as Zealous for my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as any Man that lives: But in my opinion, the best way to secure
our Liberty had been, That our Members of both Houses might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
subjects still, lyable to the Regiment of those Laws which shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
enacted by them, wherein they will have a care of securing their
own Estates for future, as well as ours, which was certtinly the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our well advised Ancestors, in exposing so great a trust into
their hands, When the Prince called for their advice in matters of
greatest concernment; but by this continued Session, they not onely
are invested of an absolute power, but are able to make themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
at leisure for those monies exhausted out of their Estates, while
we groan under the insupportable burthen of theirs (as they call them)
Legall Taxes: and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns they may well be carelesse what Laws are past,
never intending to be observers, but Lords of what they make.</p>
            <p>3. Who are these pretended reformers of the Common-wealth, but
the very Instruments who were the favourites during our oppression;
I need not name them to any, who has once attended the Epidemicke
trouble of our age, and what unheard of Conversion we can make of
<pb facs="tcp:29675:3"/>
their Lives, whereby such a Confidence should be reposed in them, as
to devest so Religious and Iust a Prince of his unquestionable Rights
and Prerogatives, and confer such an unlimited power so readily upon
them, if we return our former senses, renders me amazed; tis not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
to ruminate some words His Majesty used in his own vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>New-market,</hi> My Lords, lay your hands on your hearts, who
were the Contrivers of these Illegall taxes, wherewith you have so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
my people: to whose advantage were these impositions levied?
are my Exchequers at all larger? or did you not rather conduce to
your peculiar benefit, who were the onely perswaders of them, that
you have now repayd me with condigne thanks. Those Favourites
being content to be the Causers, though not the Companions of their
Princes mis-fortunes: being like Crows upon a Carkase, that have no
sooner bared the bones, but they are flown. Are we not yet sensible the
rules of policy, not of honesty, to secure their lives and fortunes,
not their consciences, exposed you to this politike, not publike service;
and had you not in so exact a course served your turns of these Loyall
pretenders; they had been as lyable to the extremity of Justice, as the
greatest Delinquents that underwent the most heavy censures; and
undoubtedly had had their deserved shares, which would have given a
better Colour to their upright proceedings as they would have you <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

our State is admirably ballanced if that have but his due proportion;
The Parliament consisting of three bodies, the King, the Lords, and
Commons, so that if two should be destructive, and the third remayn
sound during those Laws already in force, there can be no danger to
our Kingdom, but if either of the two can passe at their pleasure what
they will, the third must then of necessity stand for a Cypher, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
or disagreeing is then of equall value, and in my opinion it is a
president of too great an adventure, for suppose the King and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of the Lords should agree an Ordinance or Law, wee should
think extreamly prejudiciall to the Liberty of the Subject, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
should be concluded peremptorily against their Consents: I
heard an act not long since vouched in president that had bin ratified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Consent of the Lords Spirituall, where they declared <hi>nec
possumus nec volumus consentire,</hi> and this so rare wee could not finde a
second. At the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> in 17 <hi>H.</hi> 3. when the Lords were
<pb facs="tcp:29675:4"/>
not there present, they were fain to dissolve the House without passing
one Act, confirming my first proposition. That the consent of two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are not of force to make Us Laws without the third, much lesse
conclude; the King who is not onely the Supream Head, but the very
soul, whose power gives life to their actions, when their body is
once dissolved, besides how in incoherent is it, with that authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, for if the Parliament (which are onely His great
Councell) offer him a Bill, which Hee is bound to agree, it was more
then ever His Ancestors were; and of their Counsellors, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follow, they are His Commanders.</p>
            <p>We have a Maxime with the Subject, <hi>Modus &amp; conventio vincunt
legem.</hi> In former ages and ever since Parliaments were in use, <hi>Le Roy s'aviser a</hi>
were sufficient authority to make a Bill of both Houses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable;
and how the King has lost that Right, or what new Laws
are found out destructive to that Prerogative, I never yet read, nor
ever shall, unlesse some such new Ordinance or bare Votes can pretend
to such an un warranted power (whereof there was never yet found a
President) which can have no other operation upon my understanding,
then, That the Votes of the present Members which can at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
dispose the undoubted Priviledges of the Crown (by a Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
onely in their own breasts) and given out to us under the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Title of the Peoples Libertie, when indeed they are but Golden
Chains in stead of Bulrushes, and (reserv'd till occasion shall make it
too apparant) may find out a Law of equal force to dispose the Crown,
when they shall so far debilitate the Prince as he shall be no way able
to make resistance; nor when the supporters are not onely undermined
but cleerly taken away; by what reason can we imagine the Structure
may continue <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, that you may be sure we will not unjustly charge
them be pleased to observe with me their Orders in these few instances.</p>
            <p>1. Their countenancing these unwarranted Acts, either by a seditious
huddle of indigent people, and so procuring Petitions to necessitate these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
proceedings, or levying an absolute War against the King; secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us upon no other reasons then that they are the representative body of
the Kingdome, and therefore our Obedience, rather to be expected, then our
Reason satisfied, which indeed is true enough if they proceeded upon that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
rule to which no man could refuse observance, or being entrusted by
us with the power of preceding Parliaments; that they would pursue points
of so high concernment, with the same mature reasons and deliberation, as
they have done and then they might well expect our readinesse to secure their
actions: But suppose we elect one that should speak or endeavour to exact
Treason, does our election bid as to secure him, or will future Parliaments
blame us hereafter for giving up so great a Delinquent to the Iustice of the
Laws? dare we countenance their Intentions, who have fetcht Presidents
from the weakest Princes, (nay, and goe beyond them too) is the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of as able a Prince as ever yet held the Sceptor, nay, and offer their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
<pb facs="tcp:29675:4"/>
to the Vulgar, If the Prince be a foole, a child, &amp;c. ought he not to
be governed by his Councell, though it be against his consent, if it stand with
the publique benefit? what Implication to make of this I understand not,
but I am sure that it was none of our meaning when we gave our voice in
the Election: Can an Ordinance of Parliament without the consent of the
King renew a repeated Act, and with so bold a countenance trample upon
the heels of that Parliament in <hi>Richard</hi> the seconds time, and this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
Act renewed this Parliament, be within one step of it, wherein the
Parliament took the Crown and gave it to the then Earl of <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi>
which was the reason of so much Blood in our Civill Wars, and was not well
setled till of late yeeres? And can we blame the King if He desires shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from such a storme? If it be their intentions, sure one <hi>Bullingbrook</hi> will
not serve their turns, since there have been equall shares in this so great
an adventure. And to vouch the Oath of this Vsurper <hi>H. 4.</hi> which came in
at their benevolence to a Prince of an unquestionable Title, and never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
before or since to any English King that ever we read or heard of
(but with its limitations) is so far from their Loyall pretences, that they are
rather to be beleeved studyed mischiefs and endeavours, to embroyle the
Kingdome in a Civill War.</p>
            <p>2. To disingage all that would out of affection or love, interest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to secure the Kings Person, and Dignitie, (it being too apparent to
any ordinary understanding) that such proceedings were never warranted
by any presidents of preceding Parliaments, or those Laws they call Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
in our Kingdome, they scandalize such with the name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Persons, whereby His Meniall Servants either absolutely refused,
or durst not adventure His attendance, and countenance this medley in such
a sense, that the King himselfe is perpetually traduced under this obstruse
Dialect; which though they dare not put down in plain English, for feare
the most violent amongst them should be ashamed to owne it; yet by such
an implication, as the plainest capacitie cannot but blush, and with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
wonder, whereto this may tend, I would fain be satisfied, what these
might not do, when they had once mastered these their malignants: For if
you will give us as much reason as the Ants, you must beleeve a Winter
may come, as well as think a Summer is come: durst any man then oppose
their proceedings, when they have reduced all to their owne Termes, doe you
not speak your selves the very Law, and we as we ought to yeeld no appeale
from Parliament, being the highest Court in the Kingdome; yet in this
sense as the King is a part of it (for otherwise I understand not by what
right) it hath the preheminence of those they call the Kings Courts, being
both conveened by the same Royall Authority.</p>
            <p>3. The discountenancing any Petitions whatsoever (wherein we desire
to interpose our advice for accommodation or otherwise) though never so
agreeing with our Laws, unlesse they stand with the sence of their party, as
if all our Wisedom were shut up in so narrow limits, and these the only men
in <hi>England</hi> iafallible: yet give me leave to aver, that to the number of
<pb facs="tcp:29675:5"/>
almost two hundred approved able men, whose warranted judgement and
sufficiencies were the onely inducement of their Countries Election, have
been faine to sit still, and see things carryed in this disorderly confusion, (pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
against their earnest endeavours) and have not been so much as
askt their opinions in matters of greatest concernment; but being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to expose their Consciences to so high a Guilt, have with drawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as unusefull Members of such a Body.</p>
            <p>4. To insinuate a beliefe of their care to the Vulgar, They have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
surmised terrible jealousies, which have produced no other effect, then
a desired suspition of the King, yet these offered upon most improbable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturs,
as every private Letter is sufficient grounds to piece up their designes,
or by such persons whose private discontents, lead them to offer these high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
to that sacred person, they were never worthy to serve in the meanest
office; and though there lives were so notorious for their formes extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,
they have by these superfluous invectives found countenance, till
presuming upon their merits, which were none except to abuse the King, can
be called desert; that they have been given up to rapine, or some such dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sin, that nature would never have pardoned, if we had had no Law;
Yet these Mens informations, sufficient grounds to traduce the King, these
Letters most necessary Animaduersions to leavie Forces, to maintain the
Kings Forts, Towns, aed Magazines against him, I, and in his own name
to, as if they could derive that authority from him, that has no power (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Ordinance) to leavie them in his own defence, though his
person is in never so apparant imminent danger; yet they for his good,
and the good of the Kingdome, can pretend to this power, and beyond, yet
that all is not of that infallibility, let Mr. <hi>Pims</hi> Letter from Sir Iohn
Hotham witnesse with me.</p>
            <p>I have committed these few Observations, to the view of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
finding so many bold Pamphlets (with so high impudence) fly
at the face of Majesty unreproved, and every corner stinks of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Doctrin: yet since it is come to this height, that we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our selves, or lose our King,: wherein my purpose failes, my
Life shall make good to my last Breath; but if Religion, Reason, and
Law had not warranted so Iust a cause, I should never have adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cleare a Glasse to so foule a countenance: yet before I conclude,
let me propose one Question in Religion: Whether the Church was
not in its purity in the Primitive times; the world agrees they had in
those Dayes a King that was no Christian? Whether Christ had not
more power (then ever any can or dare pretend to since) to eclipse that
Regall Dignity, if it had been distructive to the Church? yet He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the lowest office of a Magistrate, <hi>But gave to Caesar the things that
were His,</hi> for when the yong Man came to Him and said, <hi>Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
my Brother that he devide the Inheritance with me,</hi> He Replies,
<hi>who made me a Ruler or a Iudge amongst You?</hi> But now, That we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Christian King, professing by his unblemisht Life, the same way
to salvation with us, protesting to conserve our Liberties with his Life,
to make such an apparant difference, which may be the occasion of the
effusion of so much Christion Blood, upon meere Iealousies, will be
the most unheard of disloyalty that can be committed to future Ages.</p>
