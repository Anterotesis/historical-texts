            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME REASONS Offer'd with Submiſſion On behalf of the <hi>Preachers</hi> among the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> for their Exemption from being Taxed as ſuch in the <hi>Poll Bill.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. A Poll or Tax upon <hi>Preachers, We conceive</hi> will either be a Tax laid upon the profits ariſing by Preaching, or as a fine or puniſhment for Preaching: If it were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a fine or puniſhment, that would infringe the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty of Conſcience, which cannot reaſonably nor charitably be ſuppoſed, it follows then, that the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, muſt be a Tax upon the profits ariſing by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And in as much as we allow no profit to them that ſpeak in our Meetings, we conceive that no ſuch Preachers or Teachers ſhould be comprehended in this Bill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The exempting thoſe Clergy-Men from the <hi>Poll,</hi> who do not receive 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for Preaching, yields us a juſt argument from the greater to the leſs. That if they who receive profit under that ſum are exempted, much leſs are they to be taxed who receive nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a uſual exception in Mony Bills, <hi>that ſuch Perſons as receive Alms of the Pariſh, and all poor Houſe-keepers, who, by reaſon of their Poverty only, are exempted from paying to the Church and Poor, are alſo eaſed in the Aſſeſments therein appointed:</hi> And it ſeems not agreeable with this exception, that thoſe amongſt us, who are poor labouring People, ſhould be aſſeſt equal with Clergy-men, having 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> only becauſe ſuch Perſons Preach among us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath been our Principle, ever ſince we were a <hi>People,</hi> that the Goſpel ought to be freely Preached; and thoſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, as Chriſts Miniſters, have a Conſcientious regard to Chriſt's Command, and the Apoſtles Example in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons are humbly offer'd, not wich any deſign to withdraw our Shoulders from bearing our part of the common charge for ſupport of the Government; to which we are thankful for the liberty and peace we enjoy: But to prevent ſuch ſpoil as was occaſioned by the late Poll Act, of which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings we have many Inſtances.</p>
