            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Play was given to my Care by a Friend: I promis'd him not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it in the Difficulties it was to pass through. It has had hitherto but an unpleasant Journey; and I knew no better way to make it Amends, than by taking up its Rest with you; where I am assur'd its Reception will be the best a truly Noble and Generous Soul can give.</p>
            <p>I beg not your Protection, Sir, from those wide-mouth'd Curs, the Critcks: But since they have had their Ends in running it down, 'tis under the Shelter of your Name I desire a poor maim'd Thing, that did its best to shew them Sport, may lye secure from farther Danger.</p>
            <p>It has been long a receiv'd Maxim, That to support the Oppressed, is no less commendable,
<pb facs="tcp:46453:3"/>
than to lead the Victor Captive. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, Sir, with the General good Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the too often detracting World allows you, has encourag'd me (I will not say to trouble you, since doing Good is your Diversion) but still to rely upon your unwearied Generosity.</p>
            <p>Both my self, and my Friend, the Author of this Unsuccessful Piece, as we cannot pretend to justifie its Defects, so, if it were in our Power, we shou'd not choose to do it in a way so Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, least by an impolitick Defence of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we should lessen the Greatness of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending good Nature, in Protecting so mean a Trifle.</p>
            <p>I have but one Reason to wish it had been better; which is, That its Merit might then, perhaps, have given me a larger Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Publishing that Respect and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Zeal, wherewith I am</p>

            <l>To feed (what some Fools call Extravagance)</l>
            <l>Have begg'd this spurious Play from Hands unknown.</l>
            <l>I have engag'd, the honest Rakes o'th' Town,</l>
            <l>That they will all espouse it as their own.</l>
            <l>But e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>re 'tis tried, let me its Cudgels choose:</l>
            <l>I first except all Writers for the other House,</l>
            <l>All good Authors, and—no, I'll trust the Beaux:</l>
            <l>For it's so free from VVit they've no Pretension</l>
            <l>To damn one Line for want of Apprehension.</l>
            <l>Besides, each Beau's a Friend; for if it miss,</l>
            <l>He'll not disturb his solemn Face to hiss.</l>
            <l>And good or bad, the Ladies sure will spare</l>
            <l>The generous Poet, for the labouring Player.</l>
            <l>And now your Smiles a double Kindness hold,</l>
            <l>The Poet shares the Praises, I the Gold.</l>
            <l>Guineas, they say, in low condition be,</l>
            <l>Pray Heav'n they're low enough to fall to me.</l>
