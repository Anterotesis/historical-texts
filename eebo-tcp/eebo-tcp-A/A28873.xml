         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reverend Authour of
this Life in his Dedication
to his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
affirms, that <hi>France</hi> was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him to the intercession of
St. <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi> That <hi>Ann</hi> of
<hi>Austria,</hi> his Mother, after twenty
years of barrenness, had recourse
to Heaven by her fervent Prayers,
to draw down that blessing, and
address'd her devotions in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner, to this holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
of the <hi>Indies.</hi> I know not,
<pb facs="tcp:48349:3"/>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> whether I may presume
to tell the World, that your <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IES<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Y</hi>
has chosen this great Saint
for one of your Coelestial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
tho' I am sure you will
never be asham'd of owning so
glorious an Intercessor; not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a Countrey, where the
Doctrine of the holy Church is
question'd, and those religious
Addresses ridicul'd. Your <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTY,</hi>
I doubt not, has the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
satisfaction of knowing,
that such pious Prayers have not
been unprofitable to you, and
the Nation may one day come
to understand, how happy it
will be for them to have a Son
of Prayers ruling over them. Not
that we are wholly to depend on
this particular Blessing, as a thing
of certainty, though we hope,
and pray for its continuance. The
ways of Divine Providence are
<pb facs="tcp:48349:3"/>
incomprehensible, and we know
not in what times, or by what
methods, God will restore his
Church in <hi>England,</hi> or what farther
tryals and afflictions we are yet
to undergo. Onely this we know,
that if a Religion be of God, it
can never fail, but the acceptable
time we must patiently expect,
and endeavour by our lives not
to undeserve. I am sure if we take
the example of our Soveraigns, we
shall place our confidence in God
alone: we shall be assiduous in
our devotions, moderate in our
expectations, humble in our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and forgiving of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
All other Panegyricks I
purposely omit; but those of
Christianity are such, that neither
your <hi>MAIESTY,</hi> nor my Royal
<hi>MASTER</hi> need be ash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m'd of
them, because their commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is instructive to your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
<pb facs="tcp:48349:4"/>
We may be allow'd, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
to praise Almighty God for
making us happy by your means,
without suspicion of flattery; and
the meanest Subject has the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of joyning his thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with his <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> where
his happiness is equally concern'd.
May it not be permitted me to
add, that to be remember'd, and
celebrated in after Ages, as the
chosen Vessel, by which it has
pleas'd the Almighty goodness to
transmit so great a blessing to
these Nations, is a secret satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which is not forbidden you
to take; the blessings of your
People are a prelibation of the
Joys in Heaven, and a lawful
ambition here on earth.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd
by the greatest example of
a Mother, to rejoyce in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb facs="tcp:48349:4"/>
Son. The Blessed Virgin
was not without as great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of joy, as Humanity could
bear, when she answer'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
of the Angel in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which seem'd to unite the
contradicting terms of calmness,
and of transport. <hi>Be it to thy
Hand-Maid, according to thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis difficult for me to leave
this Subject, but more difficult
to pursue it as I ought; neither
must I presume to detain your
<hi>MAIESTY</hi> by a long Address.
The Life of Saint <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi>
after it had been written by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Authours in the <hi>Spanish</hi> and
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> and by the Famous
<hi>Padre Bartoli</hi> in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue,
came out at length in <hi>French,</hi> by
the celebrated Pen of Father <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours,</hi>
from whom I have Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, and humbly crave leave to
<pb facs="tcp:48349:5"/>
Dedicate it to Your Patronage.
I question not but it will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the censure of those men, who
teach the People that Miracles are
ceas'd. Yet there are, I presume,
a sober party of the Protestants,
and even of the most learn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who being convinc'd
by the concurring testimonies of
the last Age, by the suffrages of
whole Nations in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
<hi>Iapan,</hi> and by the severe scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that were made before the
Act of Canonization, will not
dispute the truth of most matters
of Fact as they are here related;
nay, some may be Ingenuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to own freely that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the Faith amongst Infidels
and Heathens, such miraculous
operations are as necessary now in
those benighted Regions, as when
the Christian Doctrine was first
planted by our Blessed Saviour
and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48349:5"/>
The honouroble Testimonies
which are cited by my Author,
just before the conclusion of his
Work, and one of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
from a learn'd Divine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> though they
slur over the mention of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
in obscure and general
terms, yet are full of Veneration
for his Person. Farther than this
I think it needless to prepossess a
Reader; let him judge sincerely,
according to the Merits of the
Cause, and the Sanctity of his Life,
of whom such wonders are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and attested with such Clouds
of Witnesses: For an impartial
man cannot but of himself consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Honour of God in the
publication of his Gospel, the
Salvation of Souls, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Kingdoms, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
from those Miracles; the
<pb facs="tcp:48349:6"/>
effects of which remain in many
of them to this day.</p>
            <p>But that it is not lawful for me
to trespass so far on the Patience
of Your Majesty, I shou'd rather
enlarge on a particular Reflection,
which I made in my Translation
of this Book, namely, That the
Instructions of the Saint, which
are copied from his own Writings,
are so admirably useful, so holy,
and so wonderfully efficacious,
that they seem to be little less than
the product of an immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.
So much excellent
matter is crowded into so small a
compass, that almost every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
contains the value of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
The nourishment is so
strong, that it requires but little
to be taken at a time. Where he
exhorts, there is not an expression,
but what is glowing with the love
<pb facs="tcp:48349:6"/>
of God; where he directs a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner,
or gives Instructions to a
Substitute, We can scarcely have
a less Idea than of a Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
advising a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imothy</hi> or a <hi>Titus.</hi>
Where he writes into <hi>Europe,</hi> he
inspires his Ardour into Soveraign
Princes, and seems with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his Devotion, even to burn
his Collegues at the distance of the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Madam, I consider that
nothing I can say, is worthy to
detain You longer from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
of this Book, in which all
things are excellent, excepting
only the meanness of my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
in the Translation. Such
as it is, be pleas'd with Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
goodness to accept it, with
the offer of my unworthy Prayers
for the lasting happiness of my
Gracious Soveraign, for Your

own Life and Prosperity, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

the Son of Prayers, and the farther

            <head>THE
Author's Advertisement
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>HAving already presented you with
the Life of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I
thought my self oblig'd to give
you that of St. <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi>
For besides that it was just that the Son
shou'd attend the Father, it seem'd to me,
that these two Saints being concern'd so
much together, the History of the Apostle
of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> wou'd give you a
clearer knowledge of him who was Founder of
the <hi>Jesuites.</hi> I may add likewise, that
many considerable persons, and particularly,
of the Court, have testify'd so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see a compleat History of St. <hi>Xavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
in our Language, that I thought my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
wou'd not be unacceptable to them; and
that in satisfying my own private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:48349:8"/>
I might at the same time content the
Curiosity of others.</p>
            <p>The Writings out of which I have drawn
this Work, have furnish'd me with all I
cou'd desire for the perfection of it in what
regards the Truth, and the Ornaments of
this History: For without speaking of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selline</hi>
and <hi>Orlandino,</hi> I have diligently
read <hi>Lucena</hi> and <hi>Bartoli;</hi> the first of
which wrote in <hi>Portuguese</hi> with this Title,
<hi>The History of the Life of Father</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Xavier, <hi>and of what was done in the</hi>
Indies <hi>by the Religious of the Society of</hi>
Iesus. He informs us, That he had in
his Hands, the Authentick Copies of
the Informations which were made by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>John</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
concerning the Actions of the Blessed Father
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and the Originals of many Letters,
written from the <hi>Indies</hi> on that Subject,
which are to this day deposited in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of the University of <hi>Coimbra.</hi>
As for <hi>Bartoli,</hi> who is so famous by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and who is accounted amongst the
best of the <hi>Italian</hi> Authors, he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from the Archives of the <hi>Casa Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessa</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and from the Acts of the
Canonization, what he relates of our Saint
in the first part of the History of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
intituled, <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48349:8"/>
Though these two Historians have in
some sort collected all that can be said
concerning St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> I omitted

            <p>But seeing St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> himself
has written some parts of those Accidents
which have befallen him in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
I have faithfully copied his Letters,
and from thence have drawn those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
which have much conduc'd to my
Information, and clearing of the Truth.
These Letters have also furnish'd me with
materials to make the Narration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more lively and moving, when you
hear the Saint himself speaking in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
words, and mixing his own Thoughts
and Reflections with his Actions. I had
almost finish'd this my work, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> two other
<pb facs="tcp:48349:9"/>
lives of St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> which before
that time I had not seen: The one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
new, which was written in <hi>Italian</hi> by
Father <hi>Joseph Massei,</hi> the other more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
written in <hi>Spanish</hi> by Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Garcia.</hi> I found nothing in those two
Books, which I had not observ'd in others;
but read them with great pleasure, as
being m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st exactly and elegantly written,
each in their several Tongue.</p>
            <p>For what remains, amongst all those
Historians which I have cited, there is
only the Author of the new <hi>Italian</hi> Life,
who has not follow'd the common errour,
in relation to the Age of St. <hi>Francis Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier:</hi>
For the rest of them not precisely
knowing the year and day of his Birth,
have made him ten years elder than he
was; placing his Nativity about the time
when the passage to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> was
discover'd by <hi>Vasco de Gama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Father <hi>Massei</hi> has taken his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in that particular, from Father <hi>Pous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines.</hi>
that judicious person, to whom we
are owing for the new Letters of St. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
and who has compos'd a Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Latin, touching the year of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Birth.</p>
            <p>He pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>duces, in the said Treatise, a
Latin Paper, written in all appearance,
in the year 1585, and found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb facs="tcp:48349:9"/>
of the house of <hi>Don Juan Antonio,</hi>
Count of <hi>Xavier.</hi> That Paper wherein is
treated of the Ancestours and Birth of the
Saint, and which very probably, as <hi>Pous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines</hi>
judges, is the minute of a Letter
sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Navarra</hi> then
resided, to whom it refers you, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
I say, has these words in it. <hi>Non
scitur certò Annus quo Natus est P.
Franciscus Xaverius. Vulgo tamen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuit,
à quibusdam natum eum dici
anno Millesimo quadragintesimo nona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesimo-sexto:</hi>
which is to say, the year
is not certainly known, in which Father
<hi>Francis Xavier</hi> was Born; but 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
held, that some have reported he was
born in the year 1496.</p>
            <p>But it is to be observed, That these
words, <hi>Non scitur certò Annus quo
Natus est P. Franciscus Xaverius,</hi> are
dash'd out with the stroke of a Pen. There
is also a line drawn over these other words,
<hi>Natum eum dici millesimo, quadragin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesimo,
nonagesimo-sexto:</hi> and this is
written over head. <hi>Natus est P. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus
Xaverius Anno Millesimo quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentesimo
sexto.</hi> Father <hi>Francis Xavier</hi>
was Born in the year one thousand five
hundred and six. There is also written
in the Margin, <hi>Natus est die 7. Aprilis,
<pb facs="tcp:48349:10"/>
anni 1506.</hi> He was Born on the <hi>7th.</hi> of
<hi>April, 1506.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which renders this Testimony more
authentick, is, that at the bottom of the
Letter, these words in <hi>Spanish</hi> are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the same hand, which corrected
those two passages of which I spoke.
<hi>Hallo se la razon del tiempo que el S. P.</hi>
Francisco Xavier <hi>naciò, en un libro
manual de Su hermano el Capitan Juan
de Azpilcueta: la qual Sacò de un li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro,
de Su padre Don Juan Jasso. (vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet)</hi>
The time when the Blessed
Father <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> was Born, is
found in the Iournal of his Brother <hi>Don
Juan de Azpilcueta,</hi> who extracted it
from the Iournal or Manual of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Don Juan Jasso</hi> 'Tis on this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that before I had read the
Life, written by Father <hi>Massei,</hi> I had
already clos'd with the Opinion of Father
<hi>Poussines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the precise day of the Father's
death, I have follow'd the common opinion,
which I take to be the most probable, in
conformity to the Bull of his Canonization.
For the Historians who have mention'd it,
agree not with each other, on what day he
dy'd. 'Tis said in <hi>Herberts Travels</hi> to
the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> translated out of
the <hi>English,</hi> St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
<pb facs="tcp:48349:10"/>
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> dyed the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
1552. Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</hi>
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> affirms that he dyed at
Midnight, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the second of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
the same year. A Manuscript
Letter, pretended to be written by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
de Sainte Foy,</hi> Companion to <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
for the Voyage of <hi>China,</hi> (the
truth of which I suspect) relates that
the Saint dyed on a <hi>Sunday</hi> night, at two
of the Clock, on the second of <hi>December,</hi>
1552. Now 'tis most certain, that in the
year 1552, the second of <hi>December</hi> fell
on a <hi>Friday.</hi> So, that it is a manifest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
to say, that St. <hi>Xavier</hi> dyed that
year either on <hi>Saturday</hi> or <hi>Sunday</hi> the
second of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shou'd apprehend, lest a Life so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
as this, might somewhat shock the
profaner sort of men, if the reputation of
St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> were not well establish'd
in the World; and that the wonderful things
he did, had not all the marks of true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as the Authour who made the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of them has well observ'd. The
Mission of the Saint, gives them an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
even in our first conceptions of
them: for being sent from God for the
conversion of <hi>Infidels,</hi> it was necessary that
the Faith shou'd be planted in the <hi>East,</hi> by
the same means, as it had been through all
<pb facs="tcp:48349:11"/>
the World, in the beginning of the Church.</p>
            <p>Besides which, never any Miracles have
been examin'd with greater care, or more
judicially than these. They were not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wrought in private, and which we
are onely to believe, on the attestation of
two or three interessed persons, such who might
have been surpris'd into an opinion of them:
they were ordinarily publick matters of
fact, avow'd by a whole City or Kingdom,
and which had for Witnesses the body of a
Nation, for the most part <hi>Heathen,</hi> or
<hi>Mahometan.</hi> Many of these Miracles
have been of long continuance; and it was
an easie matter for such who were incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
to satisfie their doubts concerning
them. All of them have been attended by
such consequences as have confirm'd their
truth beyond dispute: such, as were the
Conversions of Kingdoms, and of Kings,
who were the greatest Enemies to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
the wonderful ardency of those new
Christians, and the heroical constancy of
their Martyrs. But after all, nothing can
give a greater confirmation of the Saint's
Miracles, than his Saint-like Life; which
was even more wonderful, than the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
themselves. It was in a manner of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that a man of so holy a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
shou'd work those things, which other
men cou'd not perform; and that resigning
<pb facs="tcp:48349:11"/>
himself to God, with an entire confidence
and trust, in the most dangerous occasions,
God shou'd consign over to him, some part
of his Omnipotence, for the benefit of
Souls.</p>

LIFE
OF
St. FRANCIS XAVIER.</head>
            <head>BOOK 1.</head>
            <p>I Have undertaken to write the Life
of a Saint, who has renew'd in the
last Age, the greatest Wonders
which were wrought in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the Church; and who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a living proof of Christianity. There
will be seen in the Actions of one single
Man, a New World converted by the
power of his Preaching, and by that of
his Miracles: Idolatrous Kings with their
Dominions, reduc'd under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Gospel; the Faith flourishing
in the very midst of <hi>Barbarism;</hi> and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48349:13"/>
Authority of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by Nations the most remote, who
were utterly unacquainted with Ancient
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Apostolical Man,<note place="margin">His Birth.</note> of whom I speak,
is St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> of the Society of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> and one of the first Disciples of St.
<hi>Ignatius Loyola.</hi> He was of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
and according to the Testimony of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Antonio Zapata,</hi> who examin'd his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
from undoubted Records, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
his Pedigree from the Kings of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Father was <hi>Don Iuan de Iasso,</hi> a
Lord of great merit, well conversant in
the management of Affairs, and who
held one of the first places in the Council
of State, under the Reign of King <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Third.</p>
            <p>The name of his Mother was <hi>Mary
Azpilcueta Xavier,</hi> Heiress to two of the
most Illustrious Families in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for the chief of her House, <hi>Don
Martin Azpilcueta,</hi> less famous by the
great Actions of his Ancestors, than by
his own Vertue, married <hi>Iuana Xavier,</hi>
the only Daughter and remaining hope of
her Family. He had by her, no other
Child, but this <hi>Mary</hi> of whom we spoke,
one of the most accomplish'd persons of
her time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48349:13"/>
This Virgin equally beautiful and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
being married to <hi>Don Iasso,</hi> became
the Mother of many Children; the
youngest of whom was <hi>Francis,</hi> the same
whose Life I write. He was born in the
Castle of <hi>Xavier,</hi> on the seventh of <hi>April,</hi>
in the year 1506. That Castle scituate
at the foot of the <hi>Pyrenean Mountains,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight Leagues distant from <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peluna,</hi>
had appertain'd to his Mother's
House for about two hundred and fifty
years. His Progenitors on her side ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtain'd it in gift from King <hi>Thibald,</hi>
the first of that name, in recompence of
those signal services which they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
for the Crown. 'Tis from thence
they took the name of <hi>Xavier,</hi> in lieu of
<hi>Asnarez,</hi> which was the former name of
their Family.</p>
            <p>This Surname was conferr'd on <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
as also on some of the rest of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
lest so glorious a name, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in one onely Woman, shou'd be
totally extinguish'd with her.</p>
            <p>That Providence which had selected
<hi>Francis</hi> for the Conversion of such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of People,<note place="margin">His natural Endowments, and first Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> indued him with all
the Natural Qualities which are requisite
to the Function of an Apostle. He was
of a strong habit of Body, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
lively and vigorous, his Genius
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48349:14"/>
sublime, and capable of the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
his Heart fearless, agreeable in his
Behaviour, but above all, he was of a
gay, complying, and winning Humour:
This notwithstanding, he had a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
aversion for all manner of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and a vast inclination for his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>His Parents, who liv'd a most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Life, inspir'd him with the fear of
God from his Infancy, and took a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
care of his Education. He was no
sooner arriv'd to an age capable of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
than instead of embracing the
Profession of Arms, after the example of
his Brothers, he turn'd himself, of his
own motion, on the side of Learning;
and, as he had a quick Conception, a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Memory, and a penetrating Mind,
he advanc'd wonderfully in few years.</p>
            <p>Having gain'd a sufficient knowledge in
the Latin Tongue, and discover'd a great
propensity to Learning, he was sent to
the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> the most cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and to which the
Gentlemen of <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>
resorted for their Studies.</p>
            <p>He came to <hi>Paris</hi> in the eighteenth
year of his age, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell immediately on
the study of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> 'Tis scarcely
credible with how much ardour he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48349:14"/>
the first difficulties of Logick.
Whatsoever his Inclinations were towards
a knowledge so crabbed and so subtle, he
tugg'd at it with incessant pains, to be at
the head of all his fellow Students; and
perhaps never any Scholar besides himself
cou'd join together so much ease and so
much labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> minded nothing more,<note place="margin">His Father purposes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call him from his Studies, and is diverted from that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> than
how to become an excellent <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
when his Father, who had a numerous
Family of Children, and who was one of
those Men of Quality, whose Fortunes
are not equal to their Birth, was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to remove him from his Studies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having allow'd him a competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for a year or two. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
these his thoughts to <hi>Magdalen Iasso</hi>
his Daughter, Abbess of the Convent of
St. <hi>Clare de Gandia,</hi> famous for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of its Rule, and establish'd by
some holy <hi>Frenchwomen</hi> of that Order,
whom the calamities of War had forc'd
to forsake their Native Country, and to
seek a Sanctuary in the Kingdom of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Magdalen,</hi> in her younger days, had
been Maid of Honour, and Favourite to
the Catholick Queen <hi>Isabella.</hi> The love
of Solitude, and of the Cross had caus'd
her to forsake the Court of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48349:15"/>
quit for ever, the pleasures of this World.
Having chosen the most reform'd Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Spain</hi> for the place of her retreat,
she apply'd her self with fervour to the
exercises of Penitence and Prayer; and
became even from her noviciate, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
pattern of Religious Perfection.</p>
            <p>During the course of her life, she had
great Communications with God; and
one day, he gave her to understand,
that she shou'd dye a sweet and easie
death: But on the contrary, one of her
Nuns was preordain'd to dye in strange
torments. The intention of God was
not thereby to reveal to the Abbess, what
was really to happen, but rather to give
her an opportunity of exercising an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
act of Charity. She comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what her Heavenly Father exacted
from her, and petition'd him for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
            <p>God granted to her what himself had
inspir'd her to demand; and was pleas'd
to assure her by a new Revelation, that he
had heard her Prayers. She made known
to her Ghostly Father, what had pass'd
betwixt God and her, and time verify'd
it. For the Sister above mention'd, dy'd
without sickness, and appear'd in dying
to have had a foretaste of the Joys to
come. On the other side, the Abbess
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48349:15"/>
was struck with a terrible disease, which
took all her Body, as it were in pieces,
and made her suffer intolerable pains;
yet even those pains were less cruel to
her, than those inward torments which
God at the same time inflicted on her.
She endur'd all this with wonderful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Resignation, being well assur'd,
that in the whole series of these Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there was somewhat of Divine.</p>
            <p>For what remains concerning her, from
the first years of her entry into a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life, the gift of Prophecy shone so
visibly in her, that none doubted but
that she was full of the Spirit of God;
and 'tis also probable, that she left a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
of her Prophetick Gifts to her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Daughters. For, after her decease
the Nuns of <hi>Gandia</hi> foretold many things,
which afterward the event confirm'd.
As, amongst others, the unhappy success
of the Expedition to <hi>Algier;</hi> of which
the Duke of <hi>Borgia</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
gave the Advertisement from them to
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, when he was making
his Preparations for that Enterprise.</p>
            <p>It was six years before the death of
<hi>Magdalen,</hi> that <hi>Don Iasso</hi> her Father writ
to her concerning <hi>Xavier.</hi> After she
had receiv'd the Letter, she was illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from above, and according to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48349:16"/>
dictates of that Divine Light, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<hi>Don Iasso,</hi> That he shou'd beware
of recalling her Brother <hi>Francis,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it might cost him for his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in the University of <hi>Paris.</hi>
That he was a chosen Vessel, preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to be the Apostle of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
and that one day he shou'd become a
great Pillar of the Church.</p>
            <p>These Letters have been preserv'd for
a long time afterwards, and have been
view'd by many persons, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the truth judicially in the process of
the Canonisation of the Saint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iasso</hi> receiv'd this Answer from his
Daughter, as an Oracle from Heaven;
and no longer thought of recalling his
Son from his Studies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> thereupon, continued his <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
and succeeded so well in it, that
having maintain'd his Theses, at the end
of his course, with a general applause,
and afterwards taking his degree of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in Arts, he was judg'd worthy to
teach <hi>Philosophy</hi> himself. His Parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more than ever in this new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and he acquir'd an high Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in his publick Lectures on <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
The Praises, which universally were given
him, were extreamly pleasing to his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He was not a little proud to have aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48349:16"/>
the Glory of his Family by the
way of Learning, while his Brothers
were continually adorning it by that of
Arms; and he flatter'd himself, that the
way which he had taken, wou'd lead
him onward to somewhat of greater
consequence.</p>
            <p>But God Almighty had far other
thoughts than those of <hi>Xavier,</hi> and it
was not for these fading Honours that the
Divine Providence had conducted him to
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, when this young
Master of <hi>Philosophy</hi> began his course,
<hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> who had renounc'd the
World, and cast the model of a learned
Society, wholly devoted to the Salvation
of Souls, came into <hi>France</hi> to finish his
Studies, which the obstacles he found in
<hi>Spain,</hi> after his Conversion, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
him to interrupt.</p>
            <p>He had not continued long in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Paris,</hi> before he heard talk of
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and grew acquainted with him.
Our new Professour, who taught at the
Colledge of <hi>Beauvois,</hi> though he dwelt
in the Colledge of St. <hi>Barbe,</hi> with <hi>Peter
le Fevre a Savoyard,</hi> was judg'd by <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
to be very proper for the preaching
of the Gospel, as well as his Companion.
To gain the better opportunity of insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48349:17"/>
himself into their acquaintance,
he took Lodgings with them, and was
not wanting to Exhort them to live up
to the Rules of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Fevre,</hi> who was of a tractable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and was not enamour'd of the
World, resign'd himself without opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But <hi>Xavier</hi> who was of a haughty
Spirit, and whose head was fill'd with
Ambitious thoughts, made a fierce Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
at the first. The Discipline and
Maximes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who liv'd in a mean
Equipage, and valued nothing but that
Poverty, made him pass for a low min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Fellow in the Opinion of our young
Gentleman. And accordingly <hi>Xavier</hi>
treated him with much contempt; rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him on all occasions, and making it
his business to ridicule him.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding, <hi>Ignatius</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no opportunities of representing to
him the great consequence of his Eternal
welfare, and urging the words of our
Blessed Saviour, <hi>What profit is it to a Man
to gain the whole World, and to lose his
ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Soul?</hi> But perceiving that he cou'd
make no impression, on a heart, where
self-conceit was so very prevalent, and
which was dazled with vain-glory, he
bethought himself of assaulting him on
the weaker side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48349:17"/>
When he had often Congratulated
with him for those rare talents of Nature
with which he was endow'd, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
applauded his great Wit, he made
it his business to procure him Scholars,
and to augment his Reputation by the
crowd of his Auditours. He conducted
them even to his Chair, and in present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to their Master never fail'd to
make his Panegyrick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> was too vain, not to receive with
a greedy satisfaction, what ever Incense
was given him of that kind: Applause
was welcome from what ever hands it
came; and withall, he was too grateful,
not to acknowledge those good Offices
which were done him, by a Person whom
he had us'd so very ill: He was the more
sensible of such a kindness, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to himself how little he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it. He began to look with other
eyes, on him who had the appearance
of so mean a Creature, and at the same
time, was inform'd that this Man of so
despicable a presence, was Born of one
of the Noblest Families in <hi>Guypuscoa;</hi> that
his Courage was correspondent to his
Birth, and that onely the fear of God
had inspir'd him with the choice of such
a Life, so distant from his Inclination, and
his Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48349:18"/>
These considerations, in favour of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
led him to hearken without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance,
to those Discourses which were
so little sutable to his natural bent; as
if the quality and vertue of him who
made them, had given a new charm and
weight to what he said.</p>
            <p>While things were passing in this
manner, <hi>Xavier</hi>'s Money began to fail
him, as it frequently happens to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
who are at a great distance from
their own Country: And <hi>Ignatius</hi> who
was newly return'd from the Voyages
which he had made into <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> from whence he had brought
back a large contribution of Alms; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him in so pressing an occasion, and
thereby made an absolute Conquest of
his affections.</p>
            <p>The Heresy of <hi>Luther</hi> began to spread
it self in <hi>Europe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is preserv'd from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heresie.</note> and it was an artifice
of those Sectaries, to procure Proselytes
in the Catholique Universities, who by
little and little might insinuate their new
Opinions into the Scholars, and their
Masters. Many knowing Men of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
were come on that design to <hi>Paris,</hi>
tho' under the pretence of seconding the
intentions of <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> the first, who was
desirous to restore Learning in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
They scattered their Errours in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48349:18"/>
so dextrous a manner that they made
them plausible, and principally endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to fasten on young Scholars, who
had the greatest reputation of Wit. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
who was naturally curious, took
pleasure in these Novelties, and had run
into them of his own accord, if <hi>Ignatius</hi>
had not withdrawn him. He gave an
account of this very thing not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in a Letter to his Elder Brother,
<hi>Don Azpilcueta,</hi> of which <hi>Ignacius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was the Bearer; who made a Voyage
into <hi>Spain,</hi> for those Reasons which I
have set down in another place. And
these are his words, which well deserve
to be related.</p>
            <q>
               <p>He has not onely relieved me, by
himself, and by his Friends, in those
necessities to which I was reduc'd;
but, which is of more importance, he
has withdrawn me from those oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
which I had to contract a
Friendship with Young Men of my
own standing, Persons of great Wit
and well accomplish'd, who had suck'd
in the Poyson of Heresie, and who hid
the corruptions of their heart, under a
fair and pleasing outside. He alone has
broken off that dangerous commerce
in which my own imprudence had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
me: And has hindred me from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48349:19"/>
following the bent of my easy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by discovering to me the snares
which were laid for me: If <hi>Don Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
had given me no other proof of his
kindness, I know not how I cou'd be
able to return it, by any acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I could make. For, in short,
without his assistance, I cou'd not have
defended my self from those young
men, so fair in their outward carriage,
and so corrupt in the bottom of their
hearts.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We may conclude from this Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Testimony, that <hi>Xavier,</hi> far from
carrying the Faith to the remotest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Idolaters, was in danger to make
Shipwrack of his own; had he not fallen
into the hands of such a Friend as was
<hi>Ignatius;</hi> who detested even the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Heresy; and whose sight
was sharp enough to discover Heretiques,
how speciously soever they were disguis'd.</p>
            <p>It was not sufficient to have onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<hi>Xavier</hi> from Errour; but it was
farther necessary, to wean him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the World; these favourable
dispositions which appear'd in him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
<hi>Ignatius</hi> to pursue his Design,
and gave him hope of a fortunate success.
Having one day found <hi>Xavier</hi> more than
ordinarily attentive, he repeated to him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48349:19"/>
these words more forcibly than ever:
<hi>What will it profit a Man to gain the whole
World, and to lose his own Soul?</hi> After
which he told him, that a mind so noble
and so great as his, ought not to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine
it self to the vain honours of this World;
that Coelestial Glory was the onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Object of his Ambition: And that
right reason would require him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that, which was eternally to last,
before what would vanish like a Dream.</p>
            <p>Then it was,<note place="margin">His change of Life.</note> that <hi>Xavier</hi> began to
see into the emptiness of Earthly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and found himself touch'd with the
love of Heavenly Things. But these first
impressions of Grace, had not all their
effect immediately: He made frequent
Reflections within himself, of what the
Man of God had said to him: and it was
not without many serious thoughts,
and after many a hard struggling, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing overcome at length, by the power
of those Eternal Truths, he took up a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lid resolution, of living according to

               </gap>e Maximes of the Gospel, and of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g
in his Footsteps, who had made him
sensible of his being gone astray.</p>
            <p>He resign'd himself therefore to the
Conduct of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> after the Example
of <hi>Le Fevre,</hi> who had already reform'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Life, and was Inflam'd with the Zeal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48349:20"/>
of edifying others. The directions of a
Guide so well enlighten'd, made easie to
<hi>Xavier</hi> the Paths of that Perfection,
which were hitherto unknown to him.
He learnt from his new Master, that the
first step, which a sincere Convert is to
make, is to labour in the subduing of his
darling Passion. As vain-glory had the
greatest dominion over him; his main
endeavours from the very beginning,
were to humble himself, and to confound
his own pride in the sence of his empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and of his sins. But well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he could not tame the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Soul, without mortifying the
Flesh, he undertook the Conquest of his
Body, by Haircloath, by Fasting, and
other Austerities of Penance.</p>
            <p>When his time of vacancies was come,
he perform'd his Spiritual Exercises,
which his Lectures of Philosophy had
till then hinder'd. Those very Exercises
I mean, which <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Inspir'd of God,
had Compos'd at <hi>Manreze;</hi> and of which
I have drawn the Model, in the Life of
that Holy Founder of the Society of
<hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He began his retirement with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fervour,<note place="margin">His retirement, and total Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</note> even to the passing
of four days entire, without taking any
nourishment. His Contemplations were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48349:20"/>
wholly busied day and night on Divine
Matters. And an Ancient Memorial as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, that he went to his Devotions
with his hands and feet tyed; either to
signifie, that he was desirous to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by the Inspiration of the Holy
Spirit, or to give himself the same usage,
which was given to the Man in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the Gospel; <hi>Who dar'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the Wedding-Room, without Cloathing
himself in Wedding-Garments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By meditating at his leisure on the
great truths of Christianity, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on the Mysteries of our Saviour,
according to the Method of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> he
was wholly chang'd into another Man;
and the humility of the Cross ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him more amiable than all the
Glories of the World. These new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights,
caus'd him without the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

which was offer'd him at that time,
and was very considerable, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Profits and of the Dignity.
He form'd also, during his solitude, the
design of glorifying God by all possible
means, and of employing his whole Life
for the Salvation of Souls.</p>
            <p>On these foundations, having finished
the course of Philosophy which he read,
and which had lasted three years and a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48349:21"/>
half, according to the custome of those
times, he studied in Divinity, by the
Counsel of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whose Scholar he
openly declar'd himself to be.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who found
in himself an inward Call to the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Land,
for the Conversion of <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Infidels;</hi> discovered his intentions to <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
which he had already communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Le Fevre,</hi> and four other Learned
young men, who had embrac'd his form
of Life.</p>
            <p>All the seven, engag'd themselves, by
promise to each other, and by solemn
Vows to God Almighty, to forsake their
worldly goods, and undertake a Voyage
to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> or, in case, that in the
compass of a Year they cou'd not find
an accommodation of passing the Seas,
that they would cast themselves at the
feet of our Holy Father, for the Service
of the Church, into what ever part of
the World he would please to send them.</p>
            <p>They made these Vows at <hi>Montmartre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He Conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the day of our Ladies Assumption,
in the year 1534. That holy place, which
has been water'd with the Blood of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and where their Bodies are still
deposited, inspir'd a particular Devotion
into <hi>Xavier,</hi> and possess'd him with a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48349:21"/>
Towards the end of the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he went from <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Le Fevre, Laynez, Salmeron, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez,
Bobadilla,</hi> and three other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
whom <hi>Le Fevre</hi> had gain'd in
in the absence of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Reasons, was oblig'd to go before,
and who was waiting for them at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somewhat before their departure,<note place="margin">What happen'd to him in his Iourney to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi> who was sometimes too far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported,
by the servency of his Soul, had
tied his Arms and Thighs with little
Cords, to morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie himself, for some kind
of vain satisfaction which he took in
out-running and overleaping his young
Companions; for he was very active;
and amongst all the Recreations us'd by
Scholars, he lik'd none but the exercises
of the Body.</p>
            <p>Though the Cords were very straight
about him, yet he imagin'd they wou'd
not hinder him from travelling on foot.
But he had scarcely begun his journey,
when he was taken with extream pains.
He bore them as well as he was able;
and dissembled them, till his strength
fail'd him. His motion had swell'd his
Thighs, and indented the Cords so deep
into his flesh, that they were hardly
visible: Insomuch that the Chirurgions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48349:22"/>
to whom his Fellows discover'd them,
plainly said, that any incisions which
cou'd be made, wou'd serve onely to
increase his pains, and that the ill was
incurable.</p>
            <p>In this dangerous conjuncture, <hi>Le
Fevre, Laynez,</hi> and the rest, had recourse
to Almighty God, and not in vain. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
waking the next morning, found
the Cords fallen down, the swelling
wholly taken away from his Thighs, and
the marks of the Cords only remaining
on his Flesh. They joyn'd in actions of
Thanksgiving to the Almighty, for his
providential care already shewn in their
behalf; and though the ways were very
rugged, in the inclemency of that Season,
yet they chearfully pursu'd their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> was serviceable to his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
on all occasions, and was always
before hand with them in the duties of
Charity: whether it were, that being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly
officious, and of a warm temper,
he was more eager to employ himself for
them; or that his health, miraculously
restor'd, render'd him more obligeing
and charitable towards those by whose
prayers it was recover'd.</p>
            <p>When they were arriv'd at <hi>Venice,</hi>
their breathings were only after the holy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48349:22"/>
places. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whom they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
to see again, and whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
for their common Father,
was of opinion that while they were
waiting the opportunity, of going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Pope's blessing for their Voyage
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> each of them shou'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
himself on works of Charity, in the
Hospitals of the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> whose lott fell,<note place="margin">What he did at <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </note> in the Hospital
of the Incurable, was not satisfied onely
with busying himself all day, in dressing
sick men's sores, in making their Beds,
and doing them more inferiour ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but also pass'd whole nights, in
watching by them. But his care and
pains were not confin'd to the succour
of their Bodies. Tho' he was wholly
ignorant of the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
spoke of God to them, and above
all things exhorted the greatest Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
to repentance, by causing them to
comprehend, in the best manner he was
able, that though their corporal maladies
were incurable, yet the diseases of their
Souls were not so: that how enormous
soever our offences were, we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to rely on God's mercy, and that
a desire of being sincerely converted,
was onely requisite in Sinners for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the grace of their Conversion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48349:23"/>
One of these sick Alms-men had an <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
which was horrble to the sight, but
the noysomness of the stench was yet
more insupportable: Every one shun'd
the miserable Creature, not enduring so
much as to approach him: and <hi>Xavier</hi>
once found a great Repugnance in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to attend him: But at the same time,
he call'd to his remembrance a Maxim of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> that we make no progress in
Vertue, but by vanquishing our selves;
and that the occasion of making a great
Sacrifice, was too precious to be lost.
Being fortify'd with these thoughts, and
encourag'd by the example of St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
de Sienna,</hi> which came into his Mind,
he embrac'd the sick person, apply'd his
Mouth to the Ulcer, surmounted his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
loathing, and suck'd out the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
at the same moment, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance
vanish'd; and after that, he had
no farther trouble in the like cases; of so
great importance it is to us, once to have
throughly overcome our selves.</p>
            <p>Two Moneths were pass'd away in
these exercises of Charity.<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48349:24"/>
Having receiv'd the Benediction of
our Holy Father for their Voyage to the
Holy Land, and obtain'd the permission
for those amongst them who were not in
Sacred Orders, to receive them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Venice. Xavier</hi> there made
his Vows of Poverty and perpetual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
together with the rest in the hands
of <hi>Ieronimo Veralli</hi> the Popes Nuncio,
and having again taken up his Post in the
Hospital of the Incurable, he resum'd
his Offices of Charity, which his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Rome</hi> had constrain'd him to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and continued in those Exercises
till the time of his Embarquement.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the War which
was already kindled betwixt the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and the <hi>Turk,</hi> had broken the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and stopt the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> Insomuch, that
the Ship of the Pilgrims of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
went not out that year according to the
former Custom.</p>
            <p>This disappointment wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and the more, because
he not only lost the hope of seeing those
places which had been Consecrated by
the presence and the Blood of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
but was also berest of an occasion of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his Divine Master. Yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
himself in reflecting on the method
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48349:24"/>
of Gods Providence; and at the same
time, not to be wanting in his duty to his
Neighbour, he dispos'd himself to receive
the Orders of Priesthood, and did receive
them with those considerations of awful
dread, and holy confusion which are not
easy to be express'd.</p>
            <p>The Town appear'd to him an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place,<note place="margin">He prepares himself to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his first Mass.</note> for his preparation, in order to
his first Mass. He sought out a solitary
place, where being separated from the
communication of Man, he might enjoy
the privacies of God: He found this
convenience of a retirement near <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selice,</hi>
not far from <hi>Padoua:</hi> It was a
miserable Thatch'd Cottage, forsaken of
Inhabitants, and out of all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.
Thus accommodated, he pass'd
forty days, expos'd to the injuries of the
Air, lying on the cold hard Ground,
rigidly disciplining his Body, fasting all
the day, and sustaining nature only with
a little pittance of Bread, which he begg'd
about the Neighbourhood: But tasting
all the while, the sweets of Paradise, in
contemplating the Eternal Truths of
Faith. As his Cabin did not unfitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to him the Stable of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
so he propos'd to himself, frequently, the
extreme poverty of the Infant <hi>Iesus,</hi> as
the pattern of his own; and said within
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48349:25"/>
himself, That since the Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
had chosen to be in want of all
things, they who labour'd after him for
the Salvation of Souls, were oblig'd by
his example to possess nothing in this
World.</p>
            <p>How pleasing soever this loneliness were
to him, yet his forty days being now
expir'd, he left it, to instruct the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Neighbour-Towns, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<hi>Monteselice,</hi> where the People were
grosly ignorant, and knew little of the
duties of Christianity.</p>
            <p>The Servant of God made daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
to them, and his penitent
Aspect gave authority to all his words;
insomuch, that only looking on his Face,
none cou'd doubt but he was come from
the Wilderness to instruct them in the
way to Heaven: He employ'd himself
during the space of two or three Months
in that manner. For though there was
no appearance that any Vessel shou'd set
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ail for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> yet <hi>Ignatius</hi> and
his Disciples, who had oblig'd themselves
to wait one Year in expectation of any
such opportunity, wou'd not depart from
the Territories of the Republick, till it
was totally expir'd, that they might have
nothing to upbraid themselves, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Vow which they had made.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48349:25"/>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> being thus dispos'd,<note place="margin">He celebrates his first Mass, and falls sick after it.</note> both by
his Retirement, and his exteriour Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
at length said his first Mass at
<hi>Vicenza;</hi> to which place <hi>Ignatius</hi> had
caus'd all his Company to resort. And he
said it with Tears flowing in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
that his Audience cou'd not refrain
from mixing their own with his.</p>
            <p>His Austere, Laborious Life, joyn'd
with so sensible a Devotion, which often
makes too great an impression on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so much impair'd the strength of his
Constitution, that he fell sick, not long
after his first Mass. He was carry'd into
one of the Town-Hospitals, which was so
crouded, and so poor, that <hi>Xavier</hi> had
in it but the one half of a wretched Bed,
and that too in a Chamber, which was
open on every side. His Victuals were
no better than his Lodging, and never
was sick Man more destitute of Humane
Succours, but in requital, Heaven was
not wanting to him.</p>
            <p>He was wonderfully devoted to St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him.</note>
and had often had recourse to that
blessed Doctor of the Church, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of difficult places in the
Scripture. The Saint appear'd to him
one night, refulgent in his Beams of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and gave him Consolation in his
Sickness. Yet, at the same time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48349:26"/>
to him, that a far greater afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than the present was waiting for him
at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> where himself and one of his
Companions were to pass the Winter;
that some of them shou'd go to <hi>Padoua,</hi>
some to <hi>Rome,</hi> others to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the
remainder of them to <hi>Sienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Apparition fortify'd <hi>Xavier</hi> so
much, that he recover'd suddainly; yet
whether he had some doubts concerning
it, or was of opinion that he ought to
keep it secret, he said nothing of it at that
time. But that which then happen'd
to him, made it evident, that the Vision
was of God. For <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what had been reveal'd to <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
having assembled his Disciples,
gave them to understand, That since the
Gate of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> was shut against
them, they ought not any longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the offering of their Service to the
Pope; that it was sufficient if some of
them went to <hi>Rome,</hi> while the rest of them
dispers'd themselves in the Universities of
<hi>Italy,</hi> to the end, they might inspire the
fear of God into the Scholars, and gather
up into their number, some young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the greatest parts. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them their several stations, just as
they had been foreshewn by St. <hi>Ierome;</hi>
and that of <hi>Bolognia,</hi> fell to the share of
<hi>Xavier</hi> and <hi>Bobadilla.</hi>

            <p>A devout Virgin, whose name was <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella

judg'd him to be a Man of God. And
was led by some interiour motion to
speak to this Stranger Priest when his
Mass was ended. She was so much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
and so satisfy'd with the discourse
of <hi>Xavier,</hi> that she immediately inform'd
her Uncle, at whose House she lodg'd, of
this treasure which she had discover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ierome Casalini,</hi> who was a very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Clergy-man, both in regard of his
noble Blood, and of his Vertue, went in
search of this <hi>Spanish</hi> Priest, upon the
account which was given of him by his
Niece: And having found him at the
Hospital, he importun'd him so much,
to take a Lodging in his House, that <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
cou'd not in Civility refuse him.
But the Holy Man wou'd never accept
of his Table, of whose House he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
He begg'd his Bread from Door

and liv'd on nothing but the Alms which
was given him in the Town.</p>

to the People.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he spoke but very ill; and
his Language was only a kind of <hi>Lingua

it with so much vehemenco, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

who came in Crowds to hear him preach,
departed out of the Church in a profound

            <p>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi> wholly confounded in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with these expressions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
with tears of a tender affection in his
eyes, and blushing in his Countenance,
answer'd him, that he cou'd not but be
astonish'd, that he shou'd pitch upon a
man, so weak, and pusilanimous as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for an enterprise, which requir'd no
less than an Apostle: that nevertheless
he was ready to obey the commands of
Heaven; and that he offer'd himself,
with the whole power of his Soul, to do
and suffer all things, for the salvation of
the <hi>Indians.</hi> After which, giving leave
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48349:30"/>
to his internal joy, to break out, and
to diffuse it self, he more confidently
said to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that his desires
were now accomplish'd. That for a
long time he had sigh'd after the <hi>Indies,</hi>
without daring to declare it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that
he hop'd, from those Idolatrous Nations,
to have the honour of dying for Jesus
Christ, which had been deny'd him in
the Holy-Land.</p>
            <p>He added,<note place="margin">God mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reveals to him, his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mission, to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </note> in the height of these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports,
that at length he saw that clearly,
of vvhich God had often given him a
glymps, under some misterious Figures.
In effect, <hi>Xavier</hi> had frequently dreamt
by night, that he carried on his shoulders,
a Gigantick, and very swarthy <hi>Indian;</hi>
and opprest with this strong imagination,
he groan'd and sigh'd, in that uneasie
slumber, as one out of breath, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
under an intolerable burden;
insomuch that the noise of his groans and
heavings, wak'd those vvho were lodg'd
in the same Chamber: and, one night,
it hapning that Father <hi>Laynez</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd
by it, ask'd him what it vvas
that troubled him: <hi>Xavier</hi> immediately
told his Dream, and added that it put
him into a svveat, with big drops over
all his body.</p>
            <p>Besides this, he once beheld, either in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48349:31"/>
a dream, or in a trance, vast Oceans
full of Tempests and of Rocks, desart I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands,
barbarous Countries, hunger and
thirst raging every where, nakedness,
multiplicity of labours, with bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
and imminent dangers of death
and of destruction. In the midst of this
ghastly Apparition, he cry'd aloud, yet
more, O my God, yet more! and Father
<hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> heard these words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
but however he importun'd
him to declare their meaning, he wou'd
discover nothing at that time; 'till em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
for the <hi>Indies</hi> he reveal'd the
Mystery.</p>

speaking on that subject his face was on
a fire, and the tears came into his eyes.
This was testified of him by Father <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome
Dominec,</hi> who before he enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Society, had convers'd with him
at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> where a strict friendship was

            <p>As <hi>Xavier</hi> vvas advertis'd of this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to the <hi>Indies</hi> but the day before <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caregnas</hi>

               <hi>Paul</hi> the third, overjoy'd, that under
his Pontificate, a gate shou'd be open'd
to the Gospel, in the Oriental <hi>Indies,</hi>
receiv'd him with a most Fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and excited him to assume such
thoughts, as were worthy of so high an
undertaking. Telling him for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
that the eternal wisdom,
is never failing to supply us with strength,
to prosecute the labours to which it has
ordain'd us, even though they shou'd sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

prepare himself for many sufferings,

That Heaven had employ'd him in the
mission of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Apostle of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> for the Conquest of Souls; That
it became him to labour generously, in
reviving the Faith in those Countries,
where it had been planted by that great
Apostle; and that if it were necessary
for him to shed his blood, for the glory
of Christ Jesus, he shou'd account it his
happiness to die a Martyr.</p>
            <p>It seem'd that God himself had spoken
by the mouth of his Vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

impression had these words on the mind

him a divine vigour; and in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to His Holiness, there shone through
a profound humility such a magnanimity
of Soul, that <hi>Paul</hi> the third, had from
that very minute, a certain presage of
those wonderful events, which afterwards
arriv'd. Therefore the most Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
having wish'd him the special as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of God in all his Labours, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

and gave him a most ample Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> departed in the company of

               <note place="margin">He departs from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> in the
year 1540, without any other equipage
besides his Breviary. In giving his last
adieu to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> he cast himself
at his feet, and with all humility desir'd
his blessing. And in taking leave of <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi>
he put into his hands a small Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
which he had written, and sign'd.</p>
            <p>This Memorial, which is still preserv'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> contains, that he approves, as
much as depends on him, the Rules and
Constitutions, which shall be drawn
up, by <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions;
that he elects <hi>Ignatius</hi> to be their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and in failure of him, <hi>Le Fevre.</hi> That
he consecrates himself to God, by the

three vows, of Poverty, Chastity, and
Obedience, in the Society of Jesus, when
it shall be rais'd into a Religious Order,
by the Apostolical Authority.</p>
            <p>The conclusion of that affair, was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected; and indeed it was happily
finish'd, before the ending of the year,
in that almost miraculous manner, as is
related in the Life of St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>

man's Servant, even to the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of the Horses, by an excess of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
which, on those occasions, caus'd
him to forget the Dignity of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
He resign'd his Chamber and
his Bed, to those who wanted them;
and never lodg'd but either on the ground
or on the litter in the Stable. In the

mixing somewhat with that gayety,

            <p>They went by <hi>Loretto,</hi> where they

the motions of Grace, but remain'd in

had scarcely open'd their Mouths for
him, when the Man and Horse, who
were both drowning, came again above

The Gentleman was drawn out, pale in

            <p>He protested afterwards, as <hi>Xavier</hi>

with expressions so lively and so strong, as
if he had already felt them, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd

(as the Saint has assur'd us) that by a just

during their Life, made no preparations
for their Death, had not the leisure to
think on God, when Death surpris'd
them.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadour, and all his People

turn'd not out of the Rode, but only said
to the Embassadour, That he deferr'd the

               <hi>Mascaregnas</hi> had already a high Idea of

increas'd the esteem which he had of

inform of the Holiness of this second

Queen, who were in company together,
receiv'd <hi>Xavier</hi> as a Saint, on the report
of <hi>Mascaregnas,</hi> and entertain'd him with
all imaginable shews of kindness. They
ask'd them diverse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Questions, concerning
their way of living; by what accident

and what was the ground, and ultimate

that strange Persecution, which was

Xavier</hi> made answer to all these demands
in few words, but so very pertinently, as
much satisfy'd both their Majesties: They
gave great approbation, (as himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates

to what we said, concerning the

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48349:37"/>
In the midst of the Conversation the
King sent for the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> his
Son <hi>Don Iuan;</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Maria,</hi>
his Daughter, that the two Missioners
might see them. And from thence his
Majesty took occasion of relating to them,
how many Children he had still living,
and how many he had lost; which
turn'd the Discourse on the Education of
Youth, and before the Fathers were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd,
the King recommended to their

his charge: He gave himself an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and did at <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> what he had
done at <hi>Venice, Bolognia</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for
the space of two years and more. But
besides that, he assisted the sick in the
Hospital day and night, visited the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
every day, and catechis'd the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
many times in the week, he often
discours'd with the principal persons of

Exercises of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At first, he preach'd not in the
Churches, judging, that the Ministries
of the Gospel, ought to begin with less
publick Actions, and went not into the
Pulpit, without being first requested by
the King, who one day sending for him
to the Palace, acquainted him with the
desire he had to hear him preach; and

Divinity, in the University of <hi>Coimbra,</hi>
having heard the news of his Nephew's
arrival, wrote earnestly to the King,
<hi>That it wou'd please him to send Father</hi>
Francis <hi>to him.</hi> He added, <hi>That in case
the Father might have leave to remain with
him till the departure of the Fleet, he
wou'd oblige himself to make two new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
at his own expence, the one in
Canon-Law, the other in Mystical Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
And farther, <hi>That in few years afterwards
he wou'd follow</hi> Xavier <hi>to the</hi> Indies, <hi>and
preach the Gospel in conjunction with him, to
the</hi> Eastern Idolaters.</p>
            <p>These Letters prevail'd nothing; the
Man, who had refus'd so much as to turn
out of his way, to see his Mother, was
bent against the taking of a Journey, and
forsaking his important business to visit
one of his Relations. The King retain'd
<hi>Xavier</hi> at <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> at the request of
<hi>Xavier</hi> himself: And the Father wrote
a Letter of excuse to the Doctor of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
who had written two to him full
of tenderness and friendship. As that
Doctor was unsatisfy'd with that kind of
Life, which his Nephew had embrac'd,
so <hi>Xavier</hi> resolv'd him, on that point, in
this manner. <hi>For what concerns our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
of which so many reports are now
rais'd, I have but one word, at present, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48349:39"/>
say of it. 'Tis of little consequence, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Doctor, to be judg'd by Men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by such, who will needs be judging
before they understand the matter, and
know the merits of the cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to his intention of going to the</hi>
Indies, <hi>he desir'd him to think no farther
of it, for thus</hi> Navarre <hi>relates that passage

               </hi> I had resolv'd to have ended

me uncapable of those labours which attend
his Mission: and if he had not written to
me at his departure, that I shou'd comfort
my self for his absence, by the hope of seeing
each other in the Celestial Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Our two Missioners labour'd not in

               </note> From the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their Ministry, Devotion began to
spread amongst the people. All Men ran
to the blessed Sacrament, which before,
was never thought on, but in <hi>Lent:</hi> And
this holy Custom diffus'd it self insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
through all the Towns of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
Many, who had deferr'd their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from time to time, now on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gave themselves up to God, and even
renounc'd the World. The most invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Enemies were sincerely reconcil'd,
and the most impudent Harlots abandon'd
their prostitute way of living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48349:39"/>
But this change of Manners, was most
particularly apparent at the Court: the
King, who was truly Religious, and full
of goodness, was the first to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against those Vices, which usually
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect the Palaces of Princes. And that
he might introduce a Reformation by
degrees, not only into his House, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
dilate it through his whole Kingdom,
he oblig'd all the young Courtiers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves once a week; for he said,
<hi>That if the Lords and Gentlemen, wou'd
accustom themselves from their tender
years, to the service and fear of God, they
wou'd live with greater Christianity in their
riper age: and if Persons of Quality came
once to give good examples of Religion,
the Commonalty, who form themselves
according to their Model, wou'd not fail to
regulate their manners; and therefore
the reformation of all degrees in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
consisted chiefly in the vertuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of young Noblemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The example of the Prince, and the
young Courtiers drew the rest; and
thereupon <hi>Xavier</hi> writes to <hi>Ignatius</hi> in
these terms.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more regular than the
Court of <hi>Portugal:</hi> it resembles ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Religious Society, than a Secular

Court. The number of Courtiers who come to
Confession, and are afterwards communicated,
every eight days, is so very great, that we
are in admiration of it, and are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
thanksgiving for it. We are so taken
up with hearing Confessions, that if we were
twice so many as we are, there wou'd be
employment more than enough for us. We
are sitting on the Confession-Seat all the
day long, and part of the night, though
none but Courtiers are permitted to come
to us.</p>
            <p>I remember, that I observ'd, when
the King was at <hi>Almerin,</hi> those who
waited on him, from all parts of the
Kingdom, about their own Affairs, as the
custom is, were in great admiration at
this new Court-mode; and when they
beheld the young Gentlemen at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every <hi>Sunday</hi> and
<hi>Holiday,</hi> with great reverence, they
thought themselves in another World.
But the greatest part of them imitating
that which they admir'd, drew near to
the Tribunal of <hi>Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Holy
Table.</hi> Had we Confessours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

attend the Crowds that come to Court,
no Man wou'd venture to apply himself
to the King for any business, before he
had been first with God, and were well
with him.</p>

The two labourers in God's Harvest
were so exhausted with their pains, that
at length they were constrain'd to accept
of the Diet which was provided for them
by the Kings appointment. For they
judg'd their time was better employ'd in
the service of Souls, than in begging their
daily Bread about the Streets. Yet they
omitted not to ask Alms once or twice
a week, that they might not difuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Spirit of Mortification
and Poverty. With these considerations
they reserv'd but little of what was sent
them from the Palace, and distributed the
rest among the poor.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the perpetual labour
of Confessions, reduc'd them to preach
but very seldom, for want of leisure.
But all things duly examin'd, they
thought it of more consequence to Gods
Service, to administer the Sacrament of
Penance, than to preach the Word; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi> was furnish'd
with able Preachers, but was much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in judicious Confessors; which was
the very observation that <hi>Xavier</hi> made
in the Letter above cited.</p>

King told him, he shou'd be very glad, that

of his Letters,</hi> who has so tender an
inclination for our Society, and who wishes
our advancement as much as if he were one

his service. And we shou'd be guilty of a
most horrible ingratitude, even to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Life, if we made not a publick
profession of our Service to him, and if every

The Prince <hi>Don Henry,</hi> who was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
Cardinal not long after, and in
process of time, came to the Crown, by
the death of <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> had not less
affection for them, than the King his
Brother. Being grand Inquisitor, he gave
the Fathers an absolute power in his
Tribunal; and permitted them to disourse
freely with all the Prisoners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>
            <p>Some of the Greatest Quality in the
Court, were so much edify'd with the
Apostolique Life of <hi>Xavier</hi> and <hi>Rodriguez,</hi>
that they were desirous to embrace their
Institute; as some Learned persons of the
City had already done. In short, every
thing succeeded with them, so that <hi>Xavier</hi>
had some apprehensions concerning this
tide of happiness; he bemoan'd it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to himself, and said that Prosperity
was always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormidable, even in the most
pious undertakings; that Persecution was
more desirable, and a much surer mark
of Christ's Disciples.</p>
            <p>The two Missioners appointed for the
<hi>Indies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They wou'd retain him in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </note> liv'd in this manner; and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
waited for the proper season of
Navigation. But the King weighing in
his mind, the great good which they
had done, in so short a time, both amongst
the Nobility, and the Common people,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48349:42"/>
was desirous to retain them still in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
It seem'd reasonable to him, that
the interest of his own Kingdom ought
to be dearer to him, than that of foreign
Nations; and that these new Labourers
would produce a larger increase in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Countries, than amongst <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet that he might undertake nothing
without mature deliberation, he call'd a
Council, and himself propos'd it to them.
All of them approv'd the Kings Opinion,
excepting only the Prince <hi>Don Henry;</hi>
who strongly urg'd, that <hi>Xavier</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi>
having been nominated for the
new World, by the Vicar of our Saviour,
it was in a manner to disturb the Order
of Providence, if he thwarted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Voyage: that the <hi>Indies</hi> were
equally to be consider'd with <hi>Portugal</hi> it
self, since they had been Conquer'd by
the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and were annex'd to the
Imperial Crown. That those Idolaters
had better inclinations towards Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
than was generally thought; and
that they wou'd come over to the faith
of their own accord, when they shou'd
see amongst them disinterested Preachers,
free from Avarice and Ambition.</p>
            <p>As the Opinions of Kings are always
prevalent, the Reasons of <hi>Don Henry</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48349:42"/>
were slighted, and it was concluded in
Council, that the two Missioners shou'd
not depart the Realm. This resolution
afflicted them the more sensibly, because
they both breath'd after those eastern
Countries; their last recourse was to
write to <hi>Rome,</hi> and interpose the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mov'd the Pope in their behalf, but
His Holiness refus'd to make an absolute
decision, and remitted the whole affair
to <hi>Portugal</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Ignatius</hi> sent
word to the two Fathers, that the King,
was to them in the place of God, and
that it was their duty to pay him a blind
obedience. At the same time he also
wrote to <hi>Don Pedro Mascaregnas,</hi> that
<hi>Xavier</hi> and <hi>Rodriguez</hi> were wholly at the
King's Command: And that they shou'd
always remain in <hi>Portugal,</hi> in case his
Majesty desir'd it. Notwithstanding
which, he thought a temperament
might be found, which was, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi>
might be retain'd in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
<hi>Xavier</hi> permitted to go for <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King was satisfied with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of <hi>Ignatius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is permitted to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the King discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

inspir'd by God himself. <hi>Xavier</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with joy at the news of it, gave
thanks to the Divine Goodness, which
had chosen him anew for the Mission
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48349:43"/>
of the Oriential Parts, or rather which
had executed its eternal purpose, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
humane opposition.</p>
            <p>The time of embarquement being
come, he was call'd one day to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
The King discours'd fully with
him, concerning the present condition
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and recommended particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to him the affairs of Religion. He
likewise gave him in charge, to visit the
Fortresses of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how God was serv'd in them: and
withal to give him an account of what
more was requisite to be done for the
establishment of Christianity in those
new Conquests; and to write frequently
on that Subject, not onely to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
but to his own person.</p>
            <p>After this he presented him the four
Briefs, which had been expedited from
<hi>Rome</hi> the same year: in two of which,
our Holy Father had constituted <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
Apostolical Nuncio, and endued
him with ample power for the extending
and maintenance of the Faith, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the East. In the third his Holiness
recommended him to <hi>David</hi> Emperour
of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and in the fourth to all the
Princes who possess'd the Isles of the Sea,
or the Continent from the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi>
even beyond the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48349:43"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third had requested these
Briefs,<note place="margin">He refuses the Provisions offer'd him for his Voyage.</note> and the Pope had freely granted
them, with design thereby to make the
Mission of Father <hi>Francis</hi> the more Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
and Authentique. The Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them from the hands of the King,
with profound respect, saying that as
much as his weakness was capable of
performing, he shou'd endeavour to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
the burden, which God and Man
had laid upon him.</p>
            <p>Some few days before he went to Sea,
<hi>Don Antonio d' Ataida</hi> Count of <hi>Castagne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
who supervis'd the Provisions of the
Naval Army, advertis'd <hi>Xavier</hi> to make
a Note of what things were necessary for
him in order to his Voyage, assuring him
from his Majesty, that he shou'd be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
to his own desire. They want
nothing, reply'd the Father with a smile,
who have occasion for nothing. I am
much oblig'd to the King for his Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and to you for your care of
me; but I owe more to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and you wou'd not wish me to
distrust it.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Castagnera,</hi> who had an
express Order from the King, to make a
large Provision for Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> was
very urgent with him, and importun'd
him so strongly to take something, for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48349:44"/>
fear, said he, of tempting Providence,
which does not every day work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that <hi>Xavier,</hi> not to appear either
obstinate or presumptuous, demanded
some few little Books of Devotion, for
which he foresaw he shou'd have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and a thick Cloath
Habit against the excessive colds, which
are to be endur'd in doubling the
<hi>Cape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count amaz'd that the Father
ask'd for nothing more, besought him to
make a better use of the Kings offers: but
seeing that all his intreaties prevail'd
nothing, you shall not be Master in every
thing, said he, with some kind of heat,
and at the least you cannot possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
a Servant to attend you, because I
am sure you cannot be without one.</p>
            <p>So long as I have the use of these two
hands, replyed <hi>Xavier,</hi> I will have no
other Servant: But decency, rejoin'd
the Count, requires that you shou'd have
one, if it were but to maintain the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of your Character. How shameful
wou'd it seem to behold an Apostolical
Legat washing his own Linnen on the
Deck, and dressing his own Victuals. I
will take upon me for once, said <hi>Xavier,</hi>
to serve my self and others too without
dishonouring my Character. So long
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48349:44"/>
as I do no ill, I am in no fear of scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
my Neighbour; nor of debasing
that Authority with which I am intrusted
by the Holy See. They are these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
considerations, and false notions
of decencies and punctilios which have
reduc'd the Church to that condition, in
which we now see it.</p>
            <p>This positive answer stop'd <hi>Castagne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi>
mouth; but afterwards, he gave
great commendations of <hi>Xavier,</hi> and
publickly said, that he found it much
more difficult to combat the denials of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Francis,</hi> than to satisfie the craving
desires of other men.</p>
            <p>The day of his departure being come
at length,<note place="margin">He goes for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and what he said to <hi>Rodriguez</hi> at parting.</note> and all things in a readiness to

in Priests Orders. <hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> bore
him Company to the Fleet; and then
it was, that embracing each other
with much tenderness, <hi>My Brother, said</hi>
Xavier, <hi>these are the last words which I
shall ever say to you: We shall see each
other no more in this present World; let
us endure our separation with patience:
for most certain it is, that being well uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48349:45"/>
with our Lord, we shall be united in
our selves; and that nothing shall be able
to divide us from the Society which we have
in</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>As to what remains, I will, for your
satisfaction, added he, discover to you
a Secret, which hitherto I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from your knowledge: You may
remember, that when we lodg'd as Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Fellows,
in the Hospital at <hi>Rome,</hi>
you heard me crying out one night, <hi>yet
more, O my Lord, yet more:</hi> You have
often ask'd what that exclamation meant?
and I have always answer'd you, that
you should not trouble your self about
it; I must now tell you, that I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
but, whether sleeping or waking,
God onely knows, all I was to suffer for
the glory of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> Our Lord
infus'd into me so great a delight for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
that not being able to satiate
my self, with those troubles which he
had presented to my imagination, I beg'd
of him yet more. And that was the sence
of what I pronounc'd with so much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y,
<hi>yet more, yet more.</hi> I hope the
Divine goodness, will grant me that in
<hi>India,</hi> which he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oreshewn to me in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and that the desires which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
into me shall be shortly satisfi'd.</p>
            <p>After these words they embrac'd each
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48349:45"/>
other a-new, and parted both of them
in tears. When <hi>Rodriguez</hi> was return'd
on shore, they gave the signal of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and set Sail. This was on the 7th.
of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1541, under the
Command of <hi>Don Martin Alphonso de So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
Viceroy of the <hi>Indies,</hi> a man of
known Integrity, and consummate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
in what related to those parts,
where he had formerly liv'd for many
years. He was desirous of <hi>Xavier</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

the St. <hi>Iames. Xavier</hi> went aboard on his
own Birth-day, entring then on his six

years and somewhat more, had been the

the most skilful Prince of that Age in the

that by little and little, they compleated

himself sufficient employment, during

or rather the whole employment of

            <p>That he might banish Games of
Chance, which almost always occasion
Quarrels and Swearing, he propos'd some
little innocent diversions, capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
the Mind, without stirring up
the Passions. But seeing that in spight of
his endeavours, they were bent on Cards
and Dice, he thought it not convenient
to absent himself, but became a looker
on, that he might somewhat awe them
by his presence; and when they were
breaking out into any extravagance, he
reclaim'd them by gentle and soft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.
He shew'd concernment in their
gains, or in their losses, and offer'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to hold their Cards.</p>
            <p>There were at least a thousand persons
in the Admiral, men of all conditions:
The Father made himself all to all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to gain some to <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
every Man with such discourse as
was most suitable to his Calling. He
talk'd of Sea Affairs to Mariners, of War
to the Souldiery, of Commerce to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and of Affairs of State to men of
Quality. His natural gayety, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48349:48"/>
humour, gain'd him a general e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem:
The greatest Libertins, and most
brutal persons sought his Conversation,
and were even pleas'd to hear him speak
of God.</p>
            <p>He instructed the Seamen daily, in the
Principles of Religion, of which the
greater part were wholly ignorant, or
had at the best but a smattering of it; and
preach'd to them on every Holiday, at
the foot of the main Mast. All of them
profited by his Sermons, and in little
time nothing was heard amongst them,
which was offensive to the honour of
God, or that wounded Christian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or touch'd upan obsceneness, or ill
manners. They had a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him; with one word only, he
appeas'd their Quarrels, and put an end
to all their differences.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy, <hi>Don Martin Alphonso de
Sosa,</hi> invited him from the very first day
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at at his Table; but <hi>Xavier</hi> humbly
excus'd it, with great acknowledgments,
and during all the Voyage, liv'd only on
what he begg'd about the Ship.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the insufferable colds
of <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and the excessive heats of
<hi>Guine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> together with the stench of the
fresh Waters, and putrisaction of their
Flesh Provisions under the Line, produc'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48349:48"/>
many dangerous distempers. The most
common was a pestilential Fever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with a kind of Cancer, which
bred in the Mouth, and ulcerated all the
Gums: The Sick being crowded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
spread the infection amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and as every one was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of getting the disease, they had been
destitute of all succour, if Father <hi>Francis</hi>
had not taken compassion on them. He
wip'd them in their Sweats, he cleans'd
their Ulcers, he wash'd their Linnen, and
rendred them all the most abject services;
but above all things, he had care of
their Consciences, and his principal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
was to dispose them to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Death.</p>
            <p>These were his perpetual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
being at the same time himself
seiz'd with continued sits of Vomiting,
and extream Languishments, which last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two whole Months. For his ease and
refreshment, <hi>Sosa</hi> caus'd him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
with a larger Cabin than
was first appointed for him; he accepted
of it, but it was only to lodge in it,
those who were most desperately ill: As
for himself, he lay bare upon the Deck,
without other Pillow, than the tackling.</p>
            <p>He receiv'd also the Dishes which the
Viceroy sent him from his Table, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48349:49"/>
divided them amongst those, who had
most need of nourishment. So many
actions of Charity, gain'd him the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of the Holy Father from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which continued to him all his
life, even amongst <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Xavier</hi> employ'd his time in
this manner, the Navy following its
course met with Rocks and Tempests,
and contrary Tides. After five Months
of perpetual Navigation it arriv'd at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambique,</hi>
towards the end of <hi>August.</hi>

a Fort, to secure the passage of their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48349:49"/>
and refresh their Sea-beaten men,
who commonly stay there for some time.</p>
            <p>The Army under <hi>Sosa,</hi> was constrain'd
to Winter in this Island, not only because
the season was far spent, but also because
the sick Passengers cou'd no longer sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

which proceeds from hence,
that the Sea overflowing the Low-lands
of the Isle, at the Spring Tides, the Mass
of Waters there gather'd and inclos'd, is
corrupted by the heats: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

Besides the intemperance of the

was raging in the Country.</p>
            <p>Being come ashore, <hi>Sosa</hi> gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

Ship to the Hospital, which is in the
Island, of which the Kings of <hi>Portugal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

are Founders. Father <hi>Xavier</hi> follow'd
them, and with the assistance of his two

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll. The undertaking was beyond his
Strength; but the Soul sustains the Body
of Apostolical Men, and Charity can do
all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48349:50"/>
Animated with this new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervour, he
went from Chamber to Chamber, and
from Bed to Bed, giving remedies to
some, and administring the last Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to others. Every one desir'd to
have him by him, and all acknowledg'd
that the only sight of his Countenance,
avail'd them more than a thousand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>Having pass'd the day in continual
labour, he watch'd all night with dying
men, or laid himself down by those
who were in most danger, to steal a short
unquiet slumber, which was interrupted
almost every moment: At the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
or even at a sigh, he was awake,
and ran to their relief.</p>
            <p>So many fatigues,<note place="margin">He falls sick himself, and yet conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Nature, and he fell sick himself
of a Fever, so violent, and so malignant,
that he was blooded seven times in a little
space, and was three days in a <hi>Delirium.</hi>
At the beginning of his sickness, many
were desirous to have withdrawn him
from the Hospital, where the Contagion
was frightful; and offer'd him their
own Lodgings. He constantly refus'd
their offers, and told them. <hi>That having
made a Vow of Poverty, he wou'd live and
die amongst the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the violence of his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48349:50"/>
was somewhat abated, the Saint for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himself to think on others. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
not being able to sustain his Body,
and burning with his Fever, he visited
his dear Patients, and attended them as
much as his weakness wou'd permit him.
The Physitian having one day met him,
going hither and thither as his Charity
call'd him, in the middle of his Fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
after having felt his Pulse, plainly told
him, that in all the Hospital, there was
not one man in more danger than
himself, and pray'd him that he wou'd
take some small repose, and but give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a breathing time, 'till his Fever
were in the declension.</p>
            <p>I will punctually obey you, reply'd
the Father, when I have satisfi'd one
part of my duty which calls upon me:
it concerns the Salvation of a Soul, and
there is no time to be lost on such an
occasion. Immediately he order'd to be
carried to his own Bed, a poor Ship-Boy
who lay stretch'd out on a little
straw, with a burning Fever upon him,
without Speech or knowledge. The
Youth was no sooner plac'd upon the
Saints Bed, but he came to himself: <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
made use of the opportunity, and
laying himself by the sick Person, who
had led a most dissolute Life, exhorted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48349:51"/>
him so strongly all that night to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
his sins, and to rely on the mercy
of Almighty God, that he saw him dye,
in great contrition, mix'd with saving
hope.</p>
            <p>After this, the Father kept the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
which he had made to the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:
and took a greater care of his
own preservation; insomuch that his
Fever abated by degrees, and at length
left him, of it self; but his strength was
not yet recover'd, when the Navy put to
Sea again. The Viceroy who began to
find himself indispos'd, wou'd make no
longer stay upon a place so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
nor attend the recovery of his
People, to continue his Voyage. He
desir'd <hi>Xavier</hi> to accompany him, and
to leave <hi>Paul de Camerino,</hi> and <hi>Francis
Mansilla</hi> to attend the Sick in the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
where indeed they both perform'd
their duty as became them.</p>
            <p>Thus having made a six months resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on <hi>Mozambique,</hi> they embarqu'd
once more on the 15th. of <hi>March,</hi> and
in the year 1542. But they went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the St. <hi>Iames,</hi> in which they came
thither; changing her for a lighter Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
which made better Sail.</p>
            <p>'Tis here proper to observe,<note place="margin">His first prediction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the success.</note> that the
Father, according to the report of the

Passengers who came vvith him from

that Spirit of Prophecy, which he
had to the end of his days, in so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a degree. For hearing those of the
St. <hi>Iames</hi> commend that Ship, as a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the strongest built, and the best
equip'd of all the Fleet, he said in express
words, that she vvou'd prove unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
And in effect, that Ship, which
the Viceroy left behind him at <hi>Mozam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi>
in the Company of some others,
pursuing her course afterwards to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> was driven against the Rocks,

               </hi>
on the Coast of <hi>Affrick,</hi> tovvards
the Equinoctial Line. 'Tis a Town of
<hi>Saracens,</hi> on the Sea side, in a flat Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
well cultivated, planted all along
with Palm-trees, and beautified with fair
Gardens. It has a large enclosure, and
is fortify'd with Walls, after the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi>
fashion. Tho the building is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resque,</hi>
the Houses notwithstanding, are
both pleasant and convenient. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are warlike, they are black,
and go naked; excepting only that they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48349:52"/>
are cover'd with a kind of an Apron of
Cotton or Linnen, from the wast to the
mid thigh. And indeed the heat of their
Clymat will permit them to wear no
more; <hi>Melinda</hi> being distant from the
Line, but three degrees, and some few
minutes.</p>
            <p>They have always maintain'd a good
correspondence with the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> by
reason of the Commerce establish'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. The Flag of <hi>Portugal</hi> was
no sooner seen, but the <hi>Saracen</hi> King
came down to the Port, attended by
the most honourable Persons of his Court,
to receive the new Governour of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi>
The first object which presented it
self to Father <hi>Francis</hi> when he stept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore,
drew tears from his eyes; but they
were tears of joy and pity mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The <hi>Portuguese</hi> having there a
constant trade, and now and then some
of them hapning to dye, are allow'd a
Burying-place near the Town, full of
Crosses set upon their Graves, according
to the custome of the Catholiques: And
above the rest there was a very large one
of hewn stone, plac'd in the middle, and
all over gilded.</p>
            <p>The Saint ran to it, and ador'd before
it; receiving an inward consolation, to
behold it rais'd so high, and, as it were,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48349:52"/>
triumphing amongst the Enemies of <hi>Iesus
Christ.</hi> But at the same time, he was
sensibly afflicted, that this sign of our
Salvation serv'd less to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Living,
than to honour the memory of the Dead.
And lifting up his hands to Heaven, he
besought the Father of all Mercies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
in the hearts of the Infidels, that
Cross, which they had suffer'd to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on their ground.</p>
            <p>His next thoughts prompted him to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er of Religion with the <hi>Moors,</hi> that
he might endeavour to shew them the
extravagancies of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Belief,
and gain an opportunity of revealing to
them the eternal truths of Christian faith.
One of the Principal Inhabitants, and
wonder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ully bigotted to his Sect, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him, and immediately demanded
of him, if Piety were not wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
in the Towns of <hi>Europe,</hi> as it was
in <hi>Melinda.</hi> For to confess the truth,
said he, of seventeen <hi>Mosques</hi> which we
have, fourteen are quite forsaken; there
are but three remaining, at which we
pay our Devotions; and even those three
are but little visited, and by few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>This proceeds, without all question,
added the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> from some enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
sin, but what it is, I know not:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48349:53"/>
and whatsoever reflections I can make, I
am not able to find what has drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us so dreadful a misfortune. There
is nothing more clear, reply'd <hi>Xavier;</hi>
God, who detests the Prayer of Insidels,
has permitted a worship to moulder away,
which is displeas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not satisfy'd with this reason, nor with
any other argument which <hi>Xavier</hi> us'd
against the Alcoran. While they were
thus disputing, a <hi>Caciz,</hi> or Doctour of
the Law, join'd company with them,
having made the same complaint concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Mosquees,</hi> how little they were
frequented, and how cold was grown the
devotion of the People. I have taken my
measures, said he, and if in two years
<hi>Mahomet</hi> comes not in Person to visit the
Congregations of the Faithful, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him for God's true Prophet,
I will certainly look out for some other
Religion. <hi>Xavier</hi> took pity on the folly
of the <hi>Caciz,</hi> and endeavour'd all he
cou'd to convert him at that instant
from <hi>Mahometanism;</hi> but he cou'd not
prevail upon an obstinate mind blinded
with the opinion of its own reason; and
therefore the Father acquies'd in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of that Providence, which hasfix'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48349:53"/>
the times and revolutions, for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

despair'd not of reducing them to a right

his sorrow to them by dumb signs, for
their ignorance and errours. Afterwards,
whether it were, that some one amongst
them understood the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and
serv'd as Interpreter to all the rest, or
that counting from this very time, he
began to receive from above, the first
fruits of the gift of Tongues, which was

               </gap> him in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> on sundry occasions, he spoke to
them concerning the necessity of Baptism,
and let them know, that there was no
possibility of Salvation, without a sincere
belief in <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> but that the Faith
allow'd of no mixture, and that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christians, they must of necessity
cease to be <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His words made a wonderful impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the Souls and Hearts of those
<hi>Barbarians:</hi> Some of them made him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of their wild Fruits, in token of
their good will; others offer'd him their
Children to be Baptiz'd; All promis'd
him to receive Baptism themselves,
and to lead the Life of true Christians,
on condition he wou'd remain with them.
But when they beheld the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Galeon ready to depart, they ran in
crouds to the Water-side, and besought
the Holy man with tears in their eyes,
not to forsake them.</p>
            <p>So moving a Spectacle wrought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
in <hi>Xavier,</hi> he was earnest with
the Viceroy for leave to stay upon the
Isle, at least till the arrival of the Vessels,
which he had left at <hi>Mozambique.</hi> But
he cou'd obtain no part of his request:
and <hi>Sosa</hi> told him, that Heaven having
design'd him for the <hi>Indies,</hi> it was to be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48349:55"/>
wanting to his Vocation, if he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
this Exchange; and stop'd in
the beginning of his race. That his
Zeal wou'd find a more ample field,
wherein to exercise it self, than in <hi>Soco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tora;</hi>
and People of better inclination
than those Islanders, naturally uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and as ready to forsake the Faith,
as they were easie to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> submitted to these reasons of
the Viceroy, which on this occasion
seem'd to interpret to him the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Almighty God. Instantly they
hoisted Sail, but the Saint was pierc'd
with sorrow to behold those poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who follow'd him with their eyes,
and held up their hands from a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him; while the Vessel was removing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deep, he turn'd his head towards
them, breathing out profound sighs, and
looking mournfully upon them. But
that he might leave nothing upon his
conscience, to upbraid him concerning

before Almighty God, to return
to them, so soon as possibly he cou'd;
or in case he cou'd not, to procure for

<hi>Indies,</hi> the Seat of the Bishop and the
Viceroy, and the most considerable place
of all the East for Traffick. It had been
built by the <hi>Moors,</hi> forty years before

it from the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and subjected it to the
Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time was verify'd the famous
Prophecy of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle, that
the Christian Faith which he had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in divers Kingdoms of the East, shou'd
one day flourish there again; which very
Prediction he left graven on a Pillar of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Stone, for the memory of future A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The Pillar was not far distant from
the Walls of <hi>Meliapore,</hi> the Metropolis
of the Kingdom of <hi>Coromandel;</hi> and it
was to be read in the Characters of the
Country, <hi>That when the Sea, which was
forty Miles distant from the Pillar, shou'd

come up to the foot of it, there shou'd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
in the</hi> Indies, <hi>white Men, and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
who shou'd there restore the true
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Infidels</hi> had laugh'd at this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
for a long time, not believing
that it wou'd ever be accomplish'd, and
indeed, looking on it as a kind of impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
that it shou'd: Yet it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd,
and that so justly, that when
<hi>Don Vasco de Game</hi> set foot on the <hi>Indies,</hi>
the Sea, which sometimes usurps upon the
Continent, and gains by little and little
on the dry land, was by that time risen
to the Pillar, so as to bathe its lower
parts.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be truly said, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had not its full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
till after the coming of Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is related by <hi>Iuan de Figueras
Carpi,</hi> in his History of the Order of the
Redemption of Captives, from the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
of the <hi>Trinity Convent</hi> in <hi>Lisbonne,</hi>
and the Memoirs of the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>'s
Library.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Xavier</hi> was landed, he went
immediately to the Hospital, and there
took his Lodging, notwithstanding the
instances of the Viceroy, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to have had him in his Palace.
But he wou'd not begin his Missionary
Function, till he had paid his respects to
the Bishop of <hi>Goa;</hi> whose name was <hi>Iuan
d' Albuquerque,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
a most excellent person, and one of
the most vertuous Prelates which the
Church has ever had.</p>
            <p>The Father having inform'd him of
the reasons for which his Holiness and the
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had sent him to the <hi>Indies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He visits the Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
presented to him the Briefs of Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the Third, at the same time declaring to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48349:57"/>
him, that he pretended not to use them,
without his approbation and good liking:
After this, he cast himself at his Feet, and
desir'd his Blessing.</p>
            <p>The Prelat, edify'd with the modesty
of the Father, and struck with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Air of Sanctity which appear'd in
his Countenance, took him up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and embrac'd him with great
tenderness. Having often kiss'd the
<hi>Briefs,</hi> he restor'd them to the Father,
with these words, <hi>An Apostolical Legat,
sent from the Vicar of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>has no
need of receiving his Mission from any other
hand: Use freely that power, which the
holy Seat has conferr'd upon you: and rest
assur'd, that if the Episcopal Authority be
needful to maintain, it shall never be
wanting to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that moment they contracted a
most sacred friendship, whose Union
was so strict, that ever after, they seem'd
to have but one Heart, and one Soul:
Insomuch that Father <hi>Xavier</hi> undertook
not any thing, without consulting the
Bishop first; and the Bishop on his side,
imparted all his designs to Father <hi>Xavier:</hi>
and it is almost incredible, how much
this holy Correspondence, contributed
to the Salvation of Souls, and exaltation
of the Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48349:57"/>
Before we pass farther,<note place="margin">The estate of Religion in the <hi>Indies</hi> at his arrival.</note> 'tis of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to know the estate of Religion at
that time in the <hi>Indies.</hi> 'Tis true, that
according to the Prophecy of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
they who discover'd the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> had
new planted Christianity in some parts of
them, where all was in a manner quite
forgotten. But Ambition and Avarice,
in short time after, cool'd the zeal of
these new Conquerours; instead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the Kingdom of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and
of gaining Souls to him, they thought of
nothing more, than of enlarging their
Dominion, and inriching themselves. It
happen'd also, that many <hi>Indians</hi> newly
converted to the Faith, being neither
cultivated by wholsome Instructions, nor
edify'd by good Examples, forgot insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
their Baptism, and return'd to their
ancient Superstitions.</p>
            <p>And if any amongst them kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tant
to his Christianity, and declar'd
himself a Believer, the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who
were uppermost in many places, along the
Coast, and very wealthy, persecuted
him with great cruelty, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
on the part of the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Governour or Magistrates. Whether the
Power of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were not yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
establish'd, or that Interest was
predominant over Justice and Religion.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48349:58"/>
This cruel usage deterr'd the new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from professing <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and was
the reason, that amongst the Infidels, all
thoughts of Conversion were laid aside.</p>
            <p>But what yet appears more wonderful,
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> themselves liv'd more like
Idolaters than Christians. For to speak
somewhat more particularly of their
corrupt manners, according to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was sent to King <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Third of <hi>Portugal,</hi> from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by a
Man in power, and worthy of belief:
some few Months before the arrival of
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> every Man kept as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mistresses as he pleas'd, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
them openly in his own House,
even in the quality of lawful Wives.
They bought Women, or took them
away by force, either for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or to make Money of them.
Their Masters tax'd them at a certain
Sum by the day, and for fault of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
inflicted on them all sorts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
Insomuch, that those unhappy
creatures not being able sometimes to
work out the daily rate impos'd on them,
were forc'd upon the infamous traffick of
their Bodies, and become publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes,
to content the Avarice of their
Masters.</p>
            <p>Justice was sold at the Tribunals, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48349:58"/>
the most enormous crimes escap'd from
punishment, when the Criminals had
wherewithal to corrupt their Judges.</p>
            <p>All methods for heaping up Money,
were accounted lawful, how indirect so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and Extortion was publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
Murther was reckon'd but a venial
trespass, and was boasted as a piece of
bravery.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Goa,</hi> to little purpose,
threatn'd them with the wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the thunder of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
No dam was sufficient for such a
Deluge, their Hearts were harden'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Spiritual Threatning and Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's.
Or to speak more properly, the
deprivation of Sacraments was no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to such wicked wretches, who
were glad to be rid of them.</p>
            <p>The use of Confessions, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
were in a manner abolish'd; and
if any one by chance, was struck with a
remorse of Conscience, and desir'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
himself to God, at the foot of a
Priest, he was constrain'd to steal to his
Devotions by night, to avoid the scandal
to his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>So strange a depravation of manners,
proceeded from these causes. Its rise was
taken from the licence of Arms, which
permit, and almost authorise the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48349:59"/>
disorders in a conquer'd Country. The
Pleasures of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Commerce of
<hi>Infidels,</hi> aided not a little to debauch the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> as starch'd and regular, as they
naturally are. The want of spiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,
contributed largely to this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mischief.</p>
            <p>There were not four Preachers in all
the <hi>Indies:</hi> nor any one Priest without
the Walls of <hi>Goa:</hi> Insomuch, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fortify'd places whole years were
pass'd, without hearing a Sermon or a
Mass.</p>
            <p>Behold a Draught, not unresembling
the face of Christianity in this new World,
when Father <hi>Xavier</hi> arriv'd in it.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Relation from
whence mine is copied, seems to have
had some kind of foresight of his coming:
for, in the conclusion of his <hi>Memorial,</hi> he
prays Almighty God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to send some
holy Man to the <hi>Indies,</hi> who might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the manners of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> by
his Apostolick Instructions, and his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Vertues.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Gentils,</hi> the life they led,
resembled that of Beasts, rather than of
Men. Uncleanness was risen to the last
excess amongst them; and the least cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
were those who had no Religion.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48349:59"/>
The greatest part of them ador'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
under an obscene Figure, and with
Ceremonies which modesty forbids to
mention: Some amongst them chang'd
their Deity every day, and the first living
Creature, which happen'd to meet them
in the Morning, was the Object of their
Worship; not excepting even Dogs or
Swine: In this they were uniform, that
they all offer'd bloody Sacrifices to their
Gods; and nothing was more common,
than to see bleeding Infants on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
slaughter'd by the hands of their
own Parents.</p>
            <p>Such manifold abominations, inflam'd
the Zeal of Father <hi>Xavier:</hi> He wish'd
himself able at the same time, to have
apply'd remedies to them all; yet
thought himself oblig'd to begin with
the houshold of Faith, according to the
precept of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is to say, with
the Christians; and amongst them he
singl'd out the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was like to be most prevalent with
the Baptis'd <hi>Indians.</hi> Behold, in what
manner he attempted this great enterprise
of Reformation.</p>
            <p>To call down the Blessing of Heaven
on this difficult employment,<note place="margin">His first work at <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </note> he conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
the greatest part of the night to
Prayers, and allow'd himself at the most
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48349:60"/>
but four hours of Sleep: and even this
little repose, was commonly disturb'd.
For lodging in the Hospital, and lying
always near the sick, as his custom had
been at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> his slumber was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by their least complaint, and he fail'd
not to rise to their relief.</p>
            <p>He return'd to his Prayers at break of
day; after which he celebrated Mass:
He employ'd the forenoon in the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals;
particularly in that of the <hi>Lepers,</hi>
which is in one of the Suburbs of <hi>Goa.</hi> He
embrac'd those miserable Creatures one
after the other; and distributed amongst
them, those Alms which he had been
begging for them, from Door to Door.
After this he visited the Prisons, and dealt
amongst them the same effects of Charity.</p>
            <p>In coming back, he made a turn about
the Town, with his Bell in his hand, and
gave a loud Summons to the Fathers of
Families, that, for the love of God, they
wou'd send their Children and their
Slaves to Catechism.</p>
            <p>The holy Man was convinc'd in his
Heart, that if the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Youth were
well instructed in the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and form'd betimes to the practice
of good Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christianity, in a little

in case the Children grew up without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48349:60"/>
or discipline, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
hope, that they who suck'd in
Impiety, and Vice, almost with their
Milk, shou'd ever become sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>The little Children,<note place="margin">

in Crowds about him, whether they
came of their own accord, through a
Natural Curiosity, or that their Parents
sent them, out of the respect which they
already had for the holy Man, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

to the Church, and there expounded to
them, the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God,</hi> and all the practices of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi>
which are in use amongst the
Faithful.</p>
            <p>These tender Plants, receiv'd easily the
impressions which the Father made on
them, and it was through these little
Babes that the Town began to change
its Face. For by daily hearing the Man
of God, they became modest and devout:
their Modesty and Devotion, was a silent
censure of that debauchery which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in persons of riper age: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they even reprov'd their Fathers,
with a liberty which had nothing of

that every one now strove who shou'd be
formost, to throw himself at the Fathers
Feet, knocking their Breasts, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lamenting their offences.</p>
            <p>The fruits of Penitence, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Tears, were the certain proofs of
a sincere Conversion. They cancell'd
their unlawful Bonds and Covenants of
Extortion; they made restitution of their
ill gotten Goods; they set at liberty their
Slaves, whom they had opprest, or had
acquir'd unjustly; and lastly, turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Concubines. Whom they were
unwilling to possess by a lawful marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>

               <note place="margin">His industry to gain the <hi>Concubinarians.</hi>
               </note>
almost in the same manner, as our

the deeper they were plung'd in
that darling Vice, the more tenderly he
seem'd to use them. On all occasions he
declar'd himself their Friend; he made
them frequent visits, without fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upbraided with so infamous a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
He invited himself sometimes
to eat with them; and then assuming an
Air of gayety, he desir'd the Master to
bring down the Children to bear him
company. When he had a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
their prettiness, he ask'd to see
their Mother, and shew'd her the same
Countenance, as if he had taken her for
an honest Woman. If she were beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
or well shap'd, he prais'd her, and
said, <hi>she look'd like a</hi> Portuguese: After

who well deserves to be your Wife.</hi> But if
she were a swarthy, ugly <hi>Indian, Good
God!</hi> he cry'd out, <hi>what a Monster do you
keep within your doors! and how are you
able to endure the sight of her?</hi> Such
words, spoken in all appearance, without
design, had commonly their full effect:
The Keeper marry'd her, whom the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48349:62"/>
Saint had commended, and turn'd off
the others.</p>
            <p>This so sudden a change of manners,
was none of those transient sits of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which pass away, almost as soon
as they are kindled; Piety was establish'd
in all places; and they who formerly came
to confession once a year, to speak the best
of it, now perform'd it regularly once a
month. They were all desirous of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
themselves to Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> so
that Writing from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> on that

His Catechising having had
that wonderful success which we have

ordain'd, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the Children shou'd be taught the
Christian Doctrin, in all the Churches
of the Town. The Gentlemen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
applyed themselves to the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Families, and banishment of
vice. They gave the Father considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sums of Money, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
in their presence, in the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
and Prisons. The Viceroy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the Saint thither once a week,
to hear the complaints of the Prisoners
and to relieve the Poor. This Christian
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48349:62"/>
practice was so pleasing to the King of
<hi>Portugal, Iohn</hi> the Third, that afterwards
he writ to <hi>Don Iohn Don de Castro,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> expresly ordering
him, to do that once a month, which
<hi>Don Martin Alphonso de Sosa</hi> never fail'd

from Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi>
and is call'd the Coast of <hi>Fishery,</hi>
there were certain People call'd <hi>Paravas,</hi>
that is to say, Fishers, who had caus'd
themselves to be Baptiz'd some time since,
on occasion of succours which had been
given them by the <hi>Portuguese</hi> against the
<hi>Moors,</hi> by whom they were cruelly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest:
That these People had nothing
more of Christianity, than Baptism, and
the name, for want of Pastours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them; and that it would be a
work well-pleasing in the sight of God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48349:63"/>
to accomplish their Conversion. He
conceal'd not from him, that the Land
was barren, and so destitute of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of life, that no stranger was
willing to settle there. That interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
drew the Merchants thither, in the
season of Pearl-Fishing, and otherwise the
heats were insupportable.</p>
            <p>There cou'd not have been made to
<hi>Xavier</hi> a Proposition more according to
his hearts desire. He offer'd himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least hesitation, to go and instruct
that People: and he did it so much the
more freely, because his presence was
no longer so necessary at <hi>Goa,</hi> where Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
was now grown into a habit, by a
setled form of five months standing.</p>
            <p>Having receiv'd the Benediction of the

his Works, and in his Words. He
Preach'd to them the words of Eternal
Life, and convinc'd their reason of the

though they were, they durst not as
they said, become Christians, without
the permission of their Prince.</p>
            <p>There was at that time, in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
an Officer; sent expresly from the
Prince, to collect a certain annual Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.
Father <hi>Xavier</hi> went to see him,
and expounded so clearly to him, all the
Law of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that the Pagan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
acknowledg'd, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it which was ill; and after that,
gave leave to the Inhabitants to imbrace
it. There needed no more, to a people,
whom nothing but fear witheld from it;
they all offer'd themselves to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd,
and promis'd thenceforth to live in
Christianity.</p>
            <p>The Holy man, encourag'd by so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a beginning,<note place="margin">He Labours in the salvation of the <hi>Paravas.</hi>
               </note> follow'd his way with
more chearfulness; and came to <hi>Tutucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
which is the first Town belonging
to the <hi>Paravas.</hi> He found in effect,
that this People, excepting only their
Baptism, which they had receiv'd rather
to shake off the Moorish Yoke, than to
subject themselves to that of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
were wholly Infidels; and he declar'd to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48349:65"/>
them the Misteries of our Faith, of
which before, they had not receiv'd the
least tincture. The two Church-men
who accompanied him, serv'd him in the
nature of Interpreters: But <hi>Xavier</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
within himself, that these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
frequently alter'd those things,
which pass'd through their mouths;
and that our own words, when spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by our selves, have more vigour
in them, bethought himself of finding
some expedient, whereby to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
without the assistance of another.
The way he took was to get together
some People of the Country, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Language: and to
joyn them with the two Ecclesiastiques,
who were knowing in the <hi>Malabar.</hi> He
consulted both Parties for many days
together, and drudging at his business,
Translated into the <hi>Paravas</hi> tongue,
<hi>the words of the sign of the Cross, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed, the Commandements, the Lords
Prayer, the Salutation of the Angel, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteor,
the Salve Regina, and in sine, the
whole Catechism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Translation being finish'd, the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather got without book, what he cou'd of
it; and took his way about the Villages of
the Coast, in number thirty, about half
of which were baptiz'd, the rest Idolaters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48349:65"/>
I went about, with my Bell in my
hand, says he himself, and gathering
together all I met, both Men and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
I instructed them in the Christian
Doctrin: The Children learnt it easily
by heart, in the compass of a month,
and when they understood it, I charg'd
them to teach it their Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
all of their own Family, and even
their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>On Sundays I assembled the Men and
Women,<note place="margin">His manner of teaching the Christian faith.</note> little Boys and Girls in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
all came to my appointment, with
an incredible joy, and most ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to hear the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I began
with the confessing God to be one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and trine in Persons. I afterwards
repeated, distinctly, and with an audible
voice, <hi>the Lords-Prayer, the Angelical
Salutation, and the Apostles Creed.</hi> All
of them together repeated after me; and
'tis hardly to be imagin'd, what pleasure
they took in it. This being done, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated

every particular Article, ask'd if they
certainly believ'd it? They all protested
to me with loud cries, and their hands
across their breasts, that they firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it. My practice is to make
them repeat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Creed</hi> oftner than the
other Prayers; and I declare to them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48349:66"/>
at the same time, that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Contents of it are true Christians.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Creed</hi> I pass to the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
and give them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the Christian Law is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
in those ten Precepts, that he who
keeps them all according to his Duty, is
a good Christian; and that Eternal Life
is decreed to him: That on the contrary,
whoever violates one of these Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is a bad Christian, and that he
shall be damn'd eternally, in case he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not of his Sin: Both the new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and the Pagans admire our Law,
as Holy, and Reasonable, and consistent
with it self.</p>
            <p>Having done as I told you, my custom
is to repeat with them, the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
and the <hi>Angels Salutation.</hi> Once again
we recite the <hi>Creed,</hi> and at every <hi>Article,</hi>
besides the <hi>Pater noster</hi> and the <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
we intermingle some short Prayer:
for having pronounc'd aloud the first <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
I begin thus, and they say after
me, Jesus, <hi>thou Son of the living God,
give me the Grace to believe firmly, this
first Article of thy Faith, and with that
intention we offer thee that Prayer, of
which thou thy self art Author.</hi> We
add, <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of our Lord</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>obtain for us, from thy belov'd
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48349:66"/>
Son, to believe this Article, without any
doubt concerning it.</hi> The same method is
observ'd in all the other Articles, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in the same manner, we run over
the <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi> When we have
jointly repeated the first Precept, which
is, <hi>To love God,</hi> we pray thus: O Jesu
Christ, <hi>thou Son of the living God, grant
us thy Grace to love thee above all things!</hi>
and immediately after we say the <hi>Lords
Prayer:</hi> Then, immediately we subjoin,
<hi>O holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of</hi> Jesus, <hi>obtain for us,
from thy Son, that we may have the Grace
to keep this first Commandment.</hi> After
which we say the <hi>Ave Maria.</hi> We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same method through the other
nine Commandments, with some little
variation, as the matter requires it.</p>
            <p>These are the things which I accustom
them to beg of God, in the common
Prayers, omitting not sometimes to assure
them, that if they obtain the thing for
which they pray, even that is a means
for them to obtain other things more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
than they cou'd demand them.</p>
            <p>I oblige them all to say the <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iteor,</hi>
but principally those who are to receive
<hi>Baptism,</hi> whom I also enjoin to say the
<hi>Belief.</hi> At every Article I demand of
them, if they believe it without any
scruple, and when they have assur'd me
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48349:67"/>
that they do, I commonly make them
an Exhortation, which I have compos'd
in their own language; being an Epitome
of the Christian Faith, and of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
duties incumbent on us in order to
our Salvation. In conclusion, I baptise
them, and shut up all, in singing the <hi>Salve
Regina,</hi> to implore the assistance of the
blessed Virgin.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident, by what we have already
said, concerning the instruction of the

Tongues, when he began to teach them.
But it appears also, that after he had
made the Translation, which cost him
so much labour, he both understood and
spoke the <hi>Malabar</hi> Tongue, whither he
had acquir'd it by his own pains, or that
God had imprinted the Species of it in

express'd it in a Letter, that God sent
those Distempers amongst that People, to
draw them to him almost in their own

so soon as they had receiv'd Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,

they clearly saw the difference betwixt

            <p>No one fell sick amongst the <hi>Gentils,</hi>
but had immediate recourse to Father
<hi>Xavier.</hi> As it was impossible for him to
attend them all, or to be in many places
at the same time, he sent there Christian
Children where he cou'd not go himself.
In going from him one took his Chape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
another his Crucifix, a third his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquiary,
and all being animated with a
lively Faith, dispers'd themselves through
the Towns and Villages. There gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
about the sick as many people as
they cou'd assemble, they repeated often,

Father; and he was immediately cur'd.</p>
            <p>One day, while <hi>Xavier</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Mysteries of Faith to a great
Multitude, some came to bring him word
from <hi>Manapar,</hi> that one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
persons of that place, was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
by the Devil, desiring the Father
to come to his relief. The Man of God
thought it unbecoming of his Duty, to
break off the Instruction he was then
making. He only call'd to him some of
those young Christians, and gave them a
Cross which he wore upon his Breast;
after which he sent them to <hi>Manapar</hi> with
Orders to drive away the Evil Spirit.</p>
            <p>They were no sooner arriv'd there,
than the possess'd person fell into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fury, with wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions
of his Limbs, and hideous yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
The little Children, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terrify'd, as usually Children are,
made a ring about him, singing the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Church. After which they
compelled him to kiss the Cross; and at
the same moment, the Devil departed
out of him. Many Pagans there present,
visibly perceiving the Vertue of the Cross,
were converted on the instant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bearing the name of Christianity, and yet
keeping a Pagod in reserve to adore in

when those rebukes were of no effect,
they advertis'd the holy Man, to the end,
he might apply some stronger remedy.
<hi>Xavier</hi> went often in their company, to
make a search in those suspected Houses;
and if he discover'd any Idols they were
immediately destroy'd.</p>
            <p>Being inform'd, that one who was

after he was assaulted by a Troop of

All he cou'd do, was to disingage himself
from them, and fly away. Seeing at a

as fast as he cou'd run; with his Enemies
at his heels pursuing him. The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who were assembled for their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Devotion, alarm'd at the loud
cries they heard, and fearing the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were coming to plunder the Church,
immediately shut their Doors; insomuch
that he, who hop'd for safety in a holy

            <p>These Miracles which <hi>Xavier</hi> wrought
by the means of Children, rais'd an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of him, both amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and Idolaters: but so exemplary
a punishment, caus'd him to be respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all the World: and even amongst
the <hi>Brachmans</hi> there was not one, who
did not honour him. As it will fall in
our way to make frequent mention of
those Idol-Priests, it will not be from our
purpose, to give the Reader a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brachmans</hi> are very considerable

               </note> both for their Birth,
and their Employment. According to
the ancient Fables of the <hi>Indies,</hi> their
Original is from Heaven. And 'tis the
common Opinion, that the Blood of the
Gods is running in their Veins. But to
understand how they were born, and
from what God descended, 'tis necessary
to know the History of the Gods of that
Country, which in short, is this.</p>
            <p>The first, and Lord of all the others
is <hi>Parabrama;</hi> that is to say, a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Substance, who has his Being from
himself, and who gives Being to the rest.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48349:71"/>
This God being a Spirit free from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and desirous to appear once under a
sensible Figure, became Man; by the
only desire which he had, to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he conceiv'd a Son, who came out
at his Mouth, and was call'd <hi>Maiso.</hi> He
had two others after him, one of them
whose name was <hi>Visnu,</hi> was born out of
his Breast, the other call'd <hi>Brama,</hi> out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
his Belly. Before he return'd to his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
he assign'd Habitations and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
to his three Children. He
plac'd the eldest in the first Heaven, and
gave him an absolute Command over the
Elements, and mix'd Bodies. He lodg'd
<hi>Visnu</hi> beneath his elder Brother, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd
him the Judge of Men, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Poor, and the Protectour of
of the Unfortunate. <hi>Brama</hi> had for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
the third Heaven, with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendance
of Sacrifices, and other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of Religion. These are the three
Deities which the <hi>Indians</hi> represent by
one Idol, with three Heads growing out
of one Body, with this mysterious signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that they all proceed from the
same principle. By which it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
that in former times they have
heard of Christianity; and that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is an imperfect Imitation, or rather
a Corruption of ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48349:71"/>
They say that <hi>Visnu</hi> has descended a
thousand times on earth, and every time
has chang'd his shape; sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the figure of a Beast, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of a Man; which is the Original
of their <hi>Pagods,</hi> of whom they relate so
many Fables.</p>
            <p>They add, that <hi>Brama,</hi> having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a desire of Children, made himself
visible, and begot the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> whose
Race has infinitely multiplied: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe them demi-Gods, as poor and
miserable as they are. They likewise i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
them to be Saints, because they
lead a hard and solitary life; having ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often no other Lodging than the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of a Tree, or a Cave, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
living expos'd to the Air on a
bare Mountain, or in a Wilderness, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
all the hardships of the weather,
keeping a profound silence, fasting a
whole year together, and making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of eating nothing which has had
Life in it.</p>
            <p>But after all, there was not perhaps a
more wicked nation under the Canopy
of Heaven. The fruit of those austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which they practice in the desart, is
to abandon themselves in publique, to
the most brutal pleasures of the Flesh,
without either shame or remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

For they certainly believe, that
all things, how abominable soever, are
lawful to be done, provided they are sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested

Impostours in the world; their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
consists in inventing new Fables e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

of their cheats is to perswade the simple,
that the <hi>Pagods</hi> eat like men; and to the
end they may be presented with good
cheer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they make their Gods of a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantique
figure, and are sure to endow
them with a prodigious paunch. If those
offerings, with which they maintain
their Families come to fail, they denounce
to the People that the offended <hi>Pagods</hi>
threaten the Country with some dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
judgment, or that their Gods in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
will forsake them, because they
are suffer'd to die of hunger</p>
            <p>The Doctrin of these <hi>Brachmans</hi> is
nothing better than their Life: one of
their grossest errours is to believe that

and Divine. That happy is the man,
who can be sprinkled over, with the
ashes of a Cow, burnt by the hand of a
<hi>Brachman;</hi> but thrice happy he, who in
dying, lays hold of a Cow's tail, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
with it betwixt his hands. For
thus assisted, the Soul departs out of the
Body purified, and sometimes returns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Body of a Cow. That such a
favour, notwithstanding, is not confer'd
but on Heroick Souls, who contemn
life, and dye generously, either by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
themselves headlong from a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
or leaping into a kindled Pile, or
throwing themselves under the Holy
Chariot-wheels, to be crush'd to death
by the <hi>Pagods,</hi> while they are carried

            <p>We are not to wonder, after this, that

according to his custom, and having
engag'd them by little and little, in a
discourse concerning the eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Soul; he desir'd them to
satisfie him what their Gods commanded
them to do, in order to it after death.
They look'd a while on one another,
without answering. At length a <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who seem'd to be fourscore years of

said in a grave tone, that two things
brought a Soul to glory, and made him

to abstain from the murther of a Cow,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48349:73"/>
the other to give Alms to the <hi>Brachmans.</hi>
All of them confirm'd the Old man's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
by their approbation, and applause,
as if it had been an Oracle given from
the mouths of their Gods themselves.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> took compassion on this
their miserable blindness, and the tears
came into his eyes. He rose on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
(for they had been all sitting)
and distinctly repeated, in an audible
tone, <hi>the Apostles Creed,</hi> and <hi>the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
making a pause at the end
of every Article, and briefly expounding
it, in their own language, after which
he declar'd to them, what were Heaven
and Hell, and by what actions the one
and other were deserv'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brachmans</hi> who had never heard
any thing of Christianity before, and had
been listning to the Father with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
rose up, as soon as he had done
speaking, and ran to embrace him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that the God of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
was the true God, since his Law
was so conformable to the Principles of
our inward light. Every one of them
propos'd divers questions to him; if the
Soul were immortal, or that it perish'd
with the Body, and in case that the Soul
died not, at what part of the Body it
went out, if in our sleep we dreamt we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48349:74"/>
were in a far Country, or convers'd
with an absent Person, whether the Soul
went not out of the Body for that time;
of what colour God was, whether black
or white, their Doctours being divided
on that point: the white Men maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was of their colour, the black of
theirs: the greatest part of the <hi>Pagods</hi> for
that reason being black.</p>
            <p>The Father answer'd all their questions,
in a manner to suitable to their gross un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
which was ignorant alike of
things divine and natural, that they were
highly satisfied with him. Seeing them
instructed and dispos'd in this sort, he
exhorted them to embrace the Faith of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the truth being made known
to them, ignorance cou'd no longer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from eternal Punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what victory can Truth obtain, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Souls which find their interest in
following Errour; and who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of deceiving the common people?
They answer'd (said the Saint in one
of his Letters)</hi> that which many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
answer at this day, what will the world
say of us, if they see us change? and after
that, what will become of our Families,
whose only subsistence is from the offerings
which are made to the <hi>Pagods?</hi> Thus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48349:74"/>
interest, and worldly considertions,
made the knowledge of the truth serve only
to their greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards,<note place="margin">The conference of <hi>Xavier</hi> with a Famous <hi>Brachman.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Xavier</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
conference with a <hi>Brachman</hi> who
liv'd in the nature of an Hermite: He
pass'd for the Oracle of the Country,
and had been instructed in his youth, at
one of the most famous Academies of
the East. He was one of those who was
knowing in their most hidden Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which are never intrusted by the
<hi>Brachmans</hi> but to a certain select num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Wise men. <hi>Xavier,</hi> who
had heard speak of him, was desirous to
see him, and he on his side, was as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to see <hi>Xavier.</hi> The intention of
the Saint was to try, in bringing over
this <hi>Brachman,</hi> if he cou'd gain the rest,
who were proud of being his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>After the first civilities which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
pass betwixt two men, who mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
covet an acquaintance, and know
each other by reputation, the discourse

               </gap>ell upon Religion; and the <hi>Brachman</hi>
found in himself at the very first, so great
an inclination for <hi>Xavier,</hi> that he cou'd
not conceal from him those secrets, which
a religious Oath had bound him never
to disclose to any. He confest plainly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48349:75"/>
to him, that the Idols were Devils, and
that there was only one God, Creatour
of the world, and that this God alone
deserv'd the adoration of men; that those
who held the rank of wisdom amongst
the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> solemniz'd the Sunday in
his honour, as a holy-day, and that day
they only said this Prayer, <hi>O God I adore
thee at this present, and for ever.</hi> That
they pronounc'd those words softly, for
fear of being over-heard, and to preserve
the Oath which they had made, to keep
them secret. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, said he, 'tis to be
read in our ancient Writings, <hi>that all the
false Religions shou'd one day cease, and the
whole world shou'd observe one only Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Brachman</hi> having disclos'd these
Mysteries to Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> desir'd him
in his turn, to reveal to him, what was
most mysterious in the Christian Law;
and to engage him to deal the more
freely with him, and without the least
disguise, swore, that he wou'd inviolably,
and for ever, keep the secret. I am so
far, said the Father, from obliging you
to silence, that I will inform you of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
you desire to know, but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that you shall publish in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
what I tell you. The <hi>Brachman</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him his word, he began to
instruct him, by these words of <hi>Iesus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48349:75"/>
Christ, He who will believe, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd,
shall be sav'd.</hi> This he expounded
to him at large; at the same time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
to him, how Baptism was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation: and passing from one
Article of Faith to another, he plac'd the
truth of the Gospel in so advantageous a
light before him, that the <hi>Brachman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
upon the place, he wou'd become
a Christian, provided he might be so in
secret; and that he might have a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
from some certain duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
            <p>This so wicked a disposition made
him unworthy of the Grace of Baptism;
he remain'd unconverted. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which, he desir'd to have in
writing, the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> together
with our Saviour's words, which had
beeen expounded to him.</p>
            <p>He saw Father <hi>Xavier</hi> a second time,
and told him he had dreamt he was
baptis'd, and that afterwards he became
his Companion, and that they travell'd
together preaching the Gospel in far
Countries: but this Dream had no effect,
and the <hi>Brachman</hi> wou'd never promise to
teach the people, that there was one
only God, Creatour of the World, <hi>for
fear,</hi> says he, <hi>that if he broke that Oath
which oblig'd him to secrecy, the Devil
shou'd punish him with death.</hi>

out, and in the sequel, of so great a

the Christian Doctrin from the

presence wrought many Miracles which
were capable of converting them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
casually met a poor Creature, all
naked, and full of Ulcers from Head to

            <p>The process of the Saints Canonization,
makes mention of four dead persons, to
whom God restor'd their life, at this time
by the Ministry of his Servant. The first
was a Catechist, call'd <hi>Antonio Mirand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who had been slung in the night, by
one of those venemous Serpents of the

The second was a Child who fell into a

were a young Man, and a Maid, whom
a pestilential Fever had carry'd off, after a

               </note> which gave to the

Christians, and caus'd him to be call'd,
<hi>The God of Nature amongst the Gentils,</hi>
had no other effect upon the <hi>Brachmans</hi>
than to harden their Hearts, and blind
their Understandings. <hi>Xavier,</hi> despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their Conversion, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound to publish all their wicked
Actions, and bring them into disrepute.
And he perform'd it so successfully, that
those Men, who were had in veneration
by the people, came to be despis'd by
all the World; insomuch, that even the
Children laught at them; and publickly
upbraided them with their Cheats.
They began at first to threaten the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
according to their custom, with the
anger of their <hi>Pagods;</hi> but seeing their
menaces turn'd to scorn, they made use
of another Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What malice soever they harbour'd in
their Hearts against Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> they
manag'd it so well, that to see their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
they might have been taken for
his Friends. They made him visits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him to have some kindness for them,
they gave him many Commendations:
they presented him sometimes with Pearls
and Money. But the Father was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

contributed not a little to the destruction
of Idolatry, through all that Coast.
The life which <hi>Xavier</hi> led, contributed
full as much. His Food, was the same
with that of the poorest people, Rice
and Water. His Sleep was but three hours
at the most, and that in Fishers Cabin
on the Ground: for he had soon made
away with the Matteress and Coverlet,
which the Vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pass'd with God, or with his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>He owns, himself, that his labours were
without intermission; and that he had
sunk under so great hardships, if God
had not supported him. For to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Ministry of Preaching, and
those other Evangelical Functions, which
employ'd him day and night; no quarrel
was stirring, no difference on foot, of
which he was not chosen Umpire. And

certain hours, for clearing up their

There was not any Man fell

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48349:77"/>
were always many, and for the most
part distant from each other, in the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Villages, his greatest sorrow was,
that he could not be present with them
all. In the midst of all this hurry, he
enjoy'd those Spiritual Refreshments and
Sweets of Heaven, which God only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
on Souls, who regard nothing but
the Cross: And the excess of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
was such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was often forc'd
to desire the Divine Goodness to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them: according to what himself
testifies in a Letter to his Father <hi>Ignatius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
though written in general terms, and in
the third person.</p>
            <p>Having related what he had perform'd
in the Coast of the Fishery, I have no
more to add (<hi>says he</hi>) concerning this

The number of Christians daily multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

not being sufficient to cultivate so many

it his duty, to look out for succour. And

'Tis true, that as great works, are not
accomplish'd all at once; in the beginning

who turn'd Christians, of what Country

            <p>There was also a Fund sufficient for the

over which <hi>Borba</hi> presided, was

            </p>
            <p>Matters being thus dispos'd, above
threescore Children, of divers Kingdoms,
and nine or ten different Languages,
were assembled, to be educated in Piety
and Learning. But it was soon perceiv'd,
that these Children wanted Masters, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of instructing and forming them,
according to the intention of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
God Almighty had pre-ordain'd
the <hi>Seminary of Holy Faith,</hi> for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety

               <hi>Borba,</hi> who had the chief Authority in
the Seminary. For it was not till the

that the Company possest it in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
and without dependence. It
then receiv'd the name of a Colledge,
and was call'd <hi>the Colledge of St.</hi> Paul,
from the title of the Church, which was
dedicated to the Conversion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

proceeded, that the Jesuites were call'd

when they were arriv'd there, he
visited all the Villages with them; and
taught them the method of converting

those who were already Christians, in
it. After which, having assign'd to each
of them a division at his particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

            <p>You may judge, what manner of Life I
lead here; by what I shall relate to you.
I am wholly ignorant of the Language of
the People, and they understand as little
of mine; and I have no Interpreter. All
I can perform, is to Baptise Children, and
serve the Sick, an Employment easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,

            <p>This was the Preaching, by which he
declar'd <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and made the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Law appear amiable in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
For amongst those <hi>Barbarians</hi> who
reduce all humanity to the notion of not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48349:81"/>
being inhumane, and who acknowledge
no other duties of Charity, than forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do injuries; it was a thing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
to see a stranger, who without
any interest, made the sufferings of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man his own; and perform'd all
sorts of services to the Poor, as if he
had been their Father, or their Slave.

the first brunt of War; they took flight,
and abandon'd their Country, without
any other thought than of saving their
Lives. In order to which, they threw
themselves by heaps into their Barques,
some of them escaping into little de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Islands, others hiding amongst the Rocks
and Banks of Sand, betwixt Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi>
and the Isle of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> These were the
places of their retreat, together with
their Wives and Children, while the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages</hi>
overran the Coast, and destroy'd
their Country.</p>
            <p>But what profits it to have escap'd the
Sword, when they must dye of hunger?
Those miserable Creatures, expos'd to
the burning heats of the Sun, wanted
nourishment in their Isles, and on their
Rocks, and numbers of them daily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the news of this
Excursion of the Robbers, and the flight
of the Christians was spread about, and
<hi>Xavier</hi> heard it, in the Country where
he then resided. The misfortunes of his
dear <hi>Paravas</hi> touch'd him in the most
tender part, he made hast to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and having been inform'd, that
they were press'd with Famine, he pass'd
speedily to the western Coast, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
solicited the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> to supply
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48349:82"/>
them in this their extream necessity. He
obtain'd twenty Barks, laden with all
manner of Provision, and himself brought
it to their places of retreat, where the
poor <hi>Paravas,</hi> as many as were left alive
of them, were languishing without hope
of comfort, and expecting death to end
their misery.</p>
            <p>The sight of the Holy man, whom
all of them regarded as their common
Father, caus'd them to forget some part
of their misfortune; and seem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
them to Life. He gave them all
imaginable consolation, and when they
had somewhat recover'd their strength,
he brought them back to their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
from whence the <hi>Badages</hi> were
retir'd: Those Plunderers had swept all
away, and the <hi>Christians</hi> were more poor
than ever; he therefore procur'd Alms
for them, and wrote a Letter earnestly
to the Christians of another Coast, to
supply their Brethren in distress.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Paravas</hi> being resetled by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<hi>Xavier</hi> left them under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Missioners, whom he had
brought for them, and turn'd his thoughts
elsewhere. He was desirous to have
carried the sound of the Gospel into the
more Inland Countries, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> yet he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to publish the Law of the true God,
he follow'd the same method, which he
had us'd at the <hi>Fishery.</hi> And that practice
was so successful, that all that Coast was
converted to Christianity in a little space
of time, insomuch, that forty five Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were immediately built. He writes
himself, <hi>that in one month he Baptiz'd
with his own hand ten thousand Idolaters.
And that frequently in one day, he Baptiz'd
a well Peopled Village.</hi> He says also,
<hi>that it was to him a most pleasing object,
to behold, that so soon as those</hi> Infidels
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48349:83"/>
               <hi>had receiv'd Baptism, they ran, vying
with each other, to demolish the Temples of
the Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was at that time,<note place="margin">God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to him the gift of Tongues.</note> properly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

<hi>Vaz,</hi> who attended him in many of his
Travels; and who being return'd into
<hi>Europe,</hi> related those Passages, of which
himself had been an eye witness. The
Holy man spoke very well the Language
of those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> without having
learnt it, and had no need of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
when he instructed. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Church, which was capable of
containing those who came to hear him,
he led them into a spacious Plain, to the
number of five or six thousand Persons,
and there getting up into a Tree, that
he might the farther extend his voice, he
Preach'd to them the words of Eternal
Truth. There it was also, that to the
end the compass of the Plain might serve
in the nature of a Church, he sometimes
celebrated the Divine Mysteries, under
the Sails of Ships, which were spread
above the Altar, to be seen on every
side.</p>

Worship of the <hi>Pagods</hi> to be abandon'd
in this manner; but were resolv'd to be
reveng'd on the Author of so strange an

design, they secretly engag'd some Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
to lye in wait for him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him privately. The Murtherers
lay in Ambush more than once, and in
the silence of the night endeavour'd to
shoot him with their Arrows. But di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence wou'd not suffer their
malice to take place: of all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
one only wounded him, and that
but slightly; as it were rather to give
him the satisfaction of shedding some
blood, in testimony of the Faith, than
to endanger his Life.</p>
            <p>Enrag'd, and desperate for having
miss'd their aim, they sought him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and not finding him, they
set fire on three or four houses, where
they thought he might possibly be lodg'd.
The Man of God was constrain'd one
day, to hide in the covert of a Forest,
and pass'd the following night upon a
Tree, to escape the fury of his Enemies,
who search'd the whole Forest to have
found him: There was a necessity some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that the faithful shou'd keep
guard about him day and night, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48349:84"/>
to that purpose they plac'd themselves in
Arms, about the house, where he was
retir'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Badages,</hi> who
had ravag'd the Coast of <hi>Fishery,</hi> the
year before, animated of themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Christians, and perhaps push'd
forward by the Devils, who saw their
Empire decaying day by day, excited
also by the desire of glory, and above
all things by the hope of booty, enter'd
into the Kingdom of <hi>Travancor,</hi> on the
side of one of those Mountains, which
confine on the Cape of <hi>Comorin:</hi> Their
former success had render'd them so
haughty, and so insolent, that they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
themselves with an imagination
that every thing wou'd bend before them.
But not having now to do as they had
before, with simple Fishers, they were

            <p>The Inhabitants of the Maritime Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
took fright at the noise of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
Army; and retiring, for the most
part with great haste and confusion, into
the Inland Country, carried even to the
Court the news of the invasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48349:85"/>
The King of <hi>Travancor,</hi> whom the

indeed, he is the most powerful of
all the Kings of <hi>Malabar,</hi> recollecting his
Army with all speed, put himself at the
head of it, and march'd towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
The Battel, in all appearance,
was likely to be bloody, and the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
seem'd assur'd, to those Vagabond
Robbers, who were more in number, and
better Disciplin'd.</p>
            <p>

When he arriv'd within distance of being
heard, he stop'd and said to them, in a
threatning voice, <hi>I forbid you in the name
of the Living God, to pass farther, and on
his part, command you to return the way
you came.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These few words cast a terrour into
the minds of those Souldiers who were
at the head of the Army; they remain'd
confounded, and without motion. They
who march'd after them, seeing the
foremost advanc'd not, ask'd the reason
of it: answer was return'd from the first
ranks, that they had before their eyes
an unknown Person habited in black, of
a more than humane Stature, of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
aspect, and darting fire from his
eyes. The most hardy were desirous to
satisfie themselves concerning what was
told them: they were seiz'd with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the sight, and all of them fled
with a precipitate confusion.</p>

our Belief, made many Christians even
in the Court, though contrary to the
Example of the Prince. But the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Actions of <hi>Xavier,</hi> finish'd the
Conversion of the whole Kingdom. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his curing all sorts of diseases, he
rais'd four persons from the Dead; two
Women and two Men. The Act of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization,
relates no more of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Women, but the bare
matter of fact, without any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
but the Resurrection of the Men
is related at large, of which the substance
is in the ensuing account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> preach'd in one of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Villages of <hi>Travancor,</hi> call'd <hi>Coulan</hi>
near <hi>Cape Comorin.</hi> Some were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his first Sermons, but the greater
party remain'd in their ancient Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
after having often heard him. The
most obstinate, 'tis true, listn'd to him
with delight, and found the Maxims of
the Gospel, to be most conformable to
the light of Reason; but the pleasure
which they took in hearing produc'd
nothing; and they satisfy'd themselves
with admiring the Christian Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling themselves to follow it.</p>
            <p>The Father,<note place="margin">He raises two from death.</note> one day finding, that he
spoke to them of God, without working
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48349:87"/>
any thing upon their Hearts, pray'd fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
to the Almighty in their behalf:
and with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
his Countenance more than ordinarily
inflam'd, and with abundance of Tears,
besought him to take pity on those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Idolaters. <hi>O Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>all
Hearts are in thy Hands, thou canst bend,
as it pleases thee, the most stubborn, and
soften the most obdurate: do that honour,
on this day, to the Blood, and the name
of thy beloved Son.</hi> Scarcely had he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Prayer, when he was assur'd, it
was answer'd: turning himself to his
Audience, with the Air of one inspir'd;
<hi>Well,</hi> said he, <hi>since you will not believe
me on my word, behold that which will
make me be believ'd. What testimony do
you desire from me, of those truths which I
have declar'd to you?</hi> At the same instant
he recall'd to his remembrance, that a
Man had been there buried the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Then resuming his discourse in the
same tone that he began it; <hi>Open,</hi> said
he, <hi>the Sepulchre which you clos'd yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and bring out the Body: but observe
carefully, whether he who was buried be
truly dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most incredulous ran hastily to
take up the Corps, far from finding any
the least sign of life, they perceiv'd it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48349:87"/>
began to putrisie with a noisome scent.
They took off the Linnen in which he
was wrapp'd, and laid the dead Man at
the Feet of the Father, who was come to
the place of burial. The <hi>Barbarians</hi>
gaz'd with astonishment on the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and impatiently expected the event.
The Saint fell upon his Knees, and after
a short Prayer, addressing himself to the
Dead, <hi>I command thee,</hi> said he, <hi>in the holy
name of the living God, to arise, for the
confirmation of that Religion, which I
preach.</hi> At these words the Dead arose of
himself, and appear'd, not only living,
but vigorous, and in perfect health.
All who were present, cry'd out, with a
loud voice, <hi>That the God of the Christians
was Omnipotent: and that the Law which
the great Father preach'd, was true.</hi> In
consequence of which, they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at his Feet, desir'd Baptism, and
receiv'd it on the place.</p>
            <p>The other dead person, whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
rais'd to life, was a young Man,
and a Christian, who dy'd at <hi>Mutan,</hi> on
the same Coast, betwixt <hi>Carjapatan</hi> and
<hi>Alicale.</hi> He had been dead above four
and twenty hours, of a pestilential Fever.
<hi>Xavier</hi> met the Corps by chance, as they
were carrying it to the Grave. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the dead man, who were of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48349:88"/>
greatest quality in all the Country, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
the Funeral-Pomp, with all
their kindred, according to the custom
of that Nation. As comfortless as they
were, yet upon sight of the Saint, they
recover'd courage; and embracing his
Knees, implor'd him to restore their Son
to life; being perswaded, that what was
not to be effected by the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wou'd cost him only a word speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Xavier</hi> mov'd by their affliction,
and excited by their Faith, beg'd the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Most High, made the sign
of the Cross, and threw Holy. Water on
the Dead; after which he took him by
the Hand, rais'd him up in the name of
the Lord, and restor'd him living to his
Father and Mother.</p>
            <p>To preserve the memory of an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so wonderful, and so authentick, the
Parents of the Man they rais'd, erected
a great Cross, on the place where the
Miracle was done; and were accustom'd
afterwards to go often thither, and pray
to God before it. These Resurrections
were so famous through all the Country,
and made so great impressions, on the
Souls of the Inhabitants, that the people
came thronging from all parts to behold
the great Father, and to receive Baptism
from his hands. Insomuch, that the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48349:88"/>
whole Kingdom of <hi>Travancor,</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> in few Months:
And the King with some few of his chief
Courtiers, were the only remaining Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
in the Land; by a terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Almighty God, who sometimes
abandons Princes, to their unruly Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and departs from the Great, while
he communicates himself, to those of the
lowest quality.</p>

            <p>THE Reputation of <hi>Xavier</hi> was
not confin'd to the Kingdom
of <hi>Travancor:</hi> it was spread
abroad through all the <hi>Indies;</hi>
and the God of the Christians at the
same time was had in so great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the most Idolatrous Nations
sent to desire the Saint, that he wou'd
come and give them Baptism. His joy
was infinite, to find the Gentils of their
own free motion, searching after the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48349:90"/>
way of Eternal Life, but on the other
side he was afflicted, that he was not
sufficient alone, to instruct so many vast
Countries as were gone astray from
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing the Harvest so great, and the

Missioners. He had such transports of
Zeal on that occasion, as to say in one
of his Letters,</hi> I have often thoughts to
run over all the Vniversities of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and Principally that of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to cry
aloud to those who abound more in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than in Charity, Ah how many Souls are
lost to Heaven, through your default! It
were to be wish'd, that those People wou'd
apply themselves as diligently to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Souls, as they do to the study of
Sciences; to the end they might render to
Almighty God a good account of their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the Talents which he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on them: Many, without doubt, mov'd
with thoughts like these, wou'd make a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
retreat, and give themselves the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of meditating on Heavenly things, that
they might listen to the voice of God. They
wou'd renounce their Passions, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under foot all worldly Vanities, wou'd
put themselves in condition of following the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48349:90"/>
motions of the Divine Will. They wou'd
say from the bottom of their hearts, behold
me in readiness, O my Lord, send me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou shalt please, even to the <hi>Indies</hi>
if thou command'st me.</p>
            <p>Good God, how much more happily wou'd
those Learned men then live, than now they
do! with how much more assurance of their
Salvation! and in the hour of death, when
they are ready to stand forth, before the
dreadful Iudgment-Seat, how much greater
reason wou'd they have, to hope well of God's
Eternal Mercy, because they might say,
<hi>O Lord, thou hast given me five Talents,
and behold I have added other five.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take God to witness, that not being
able to return into <hi>Europe,</hi> I have almost
resolv'd to write to the Vniversity of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and namely to our Masters. <hi>Cornet</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,</hi>
that Millions of Idolaters might be
easily converted, if there were more Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who wou'd sincerely mind the interests
of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and not their own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>'Tis pity that his Letter to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours

               <note place="margin">The Saints Letter to the Doctours of <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
               </note> is irrecoverably lost,
for certain it is, he wrote to them from
the midst of the <hi>Indies,</hi> to engage them
to come, and Preach the Gospel. And
for this, we have the testimony of <hi>Don
Iohn Derada,</hi> one of the chief Magistrates
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48349:91"/>
of the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Paris,</hi> saw the Letter sent from
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> admir'd the Apostolical
Charity, with which it was replenish'd,
and took a Copy of it, as did also many
Divines, to whom it was directed.</p>
            <p>Amongst those Idolatrous Nations,
which breath'd after Baptism,<note place="margin">Ambassadours from the Isle of <hi>Manar</hi> to the Saint.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to be instructed, the <hi>Manarois</hi> were
the first, who made a deputation to the
Saint.</p>
            <p>The Isle of <hi>Manar,</hi> is scituate towards
the most Northern point of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and
at the head of the Sands of <hi>Remanancor.</hi> It
has a very convenient Port, and is a
place of great Trafick. But the Soil is
so sandy and so dry, that it produces
nothing, unless in some few places, which
also are cultivated with much care and
labour. For <hi>Manar</hi> has no resemblance
to <hi>Ceylan,</hi> though plac'd so near it: <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
being the most delicious and most
fruitful part of all the East; where the
Trees are always green, and bear fruits
and flowers in every Season: where
there are discover'd Mines of Gold and
Silver, Chrystal, and Precious Stones:
which is encompass'd with Forests of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bony,
Cynamon, and Coco; and where
the Inhabitants live to an extream old
Age, without any of the incommodities
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48349:91"/>
which attend it. The wonder is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
distant from the <hi>Equinoetial</hi> but six
degrees, the Air is temperate and pure,
and the Rains which water it from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
regularly once a Moneth, joyn'd
with the Springs and Rivers, which pass
through it, refresh the Ground in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
measure, than the scorching heats can
parch it.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was employ'd in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
Christianity in <hi>Travancor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He sends a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner to the Isle of <hi>Manar.</hi>
               </note> when
he receiv'd this Embassy from <hi>Manar.</hi> As
he cou'd not forsake an Infant Church,
without a reasonable apprehension of its
ruine, he sent to <hi>Manar,</hi> one of the Priests
whom he had left on the Coast of <hi>Fishery.</hi>
And God so bless'd the labours of that
Missioner, that the <hi>Manarois</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Christians, but died generously for
the Faith; and this was the occasion of
their Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>The Isle of <hi>Manar,</hi> was at that time
under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Iafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natapan:</hi>
for by that name the Northern
part of <hi>Ceylan</hi> is call'd. This Prince,
had usurp'd the Crown from his elder
Brother; and enslav'd his Subjects. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things he was an implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Christian Faith; though in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
he was a Friend to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese,</hi>
whose Forces only cou'd set
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48349:92"/>
Bounds to his Tyranny. When he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that the <hi>Manarois</hi> were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christianity, he enter'd into that
fury, of which Tyrants only can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
For he commanded, that his
Troops shou'd immediately pass over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Island, and put all to the Sword,
excepting only the Idolaters. His Orders
were punctually executed: and Men,
Women and Children, were all destroy'd,
who had embrac'd the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>It was wonderful to behold,<note place="margin">

               </note> that the
Faithful being examin'd one by one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Religion, and no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
for the saving of their lives, than
to forsake their new Belief, there was
not one amongst them, who did not
openly declare himself a Christian. The
Fathers and Mothers, answer'd for the
newly baptis'd Infants, who were not
able to give testimony of their Faith:
and offer'd them to the death, with
a Resolution, which was amazing to
their Executioners. Six or seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of these Islanders gave up their lives
for the name of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and the
principal place which was consecrated by
so noble Blood, from <hi>Pasim,</hi> which it
was call'd before, now took the name of
<hi>the Field of Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48349:92"/>
This dreadful Massacre, far from abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Christian Law, serv'd only to
render it more flourishing. The Tyrant
had even the shame of seeing his Officers
and Domestick Servants, forsake their
ancient Superstition in despight of him.
But what most inrag'd him, was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of his eldest Son. This young
Prince, inspir'd of God, caus'd himself to
be instructed by a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchant,
who had dealings at the Court: which
yet cou'd not be so secretly perform'd,
but that the King had notice of it. At
the first news, he cut his Throat, and
threw the Body into the Fields, to serve
for food to Salvage Beasts.</p>
            <p>But Heaven permitted not,<note place="margin">A miraculous C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ss, and its effects.</note> that a
death which was so precious in the sight
of God, shou'd be without honour, in
the sight of Men. The <hi>Portuguese</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
buried his Disciple by night; and
on the next morning, there appear'd a
beautiful Cross, printed on the Ground
which cover'd the Body of the Martyr.
The spectacle extreamly surpris'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
They did what they were able,
to deface, (and if I may so say) to blot
out the Cross, by treading over it, and
casting Earth upon it. It appear'd again
the day following, in the same Figure,
and they once more endeavour'd to tread
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48349:93"/>
it out. But then it appear'd in the Air,
all resplendent with light, and darting
its Beams on every side. The <hi>Barbarians</hi>
who beheld it, were affrighted; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
touch'd in their Hearts, declar'd
themselves Christians. The Kings Sister,
a Princess naturally vertuous, having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
embrac'd the Faith, instructed
both her own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and her Nephew,
who was Brother to the Martyr. But
while she directed them in the way of
Heaven, she took care to preserve them
from the cruelty of the Tyrant. To
which purpose she address'd her self to the
Merchant above mention'd, and intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with the lives of the two Princes,
order'd him to convey them to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
of <hi>Goa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Portuguese</hi> manag'd all things so
discreetly, with the concurrence of the
Princess, that he escap'd out of the Island,
with the two Princes, undiscover'd. He
took his way by the Kingdom of <hi>Travan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor,</hi>
that he might behold Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
and present to him, these two illustrious
new Converts. The Father receiv'd them
as Angels descended from above, and
gave immortal thanks to God, for so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Conquest. He fortify'd them in the
Faith, gave them excellent instructions,
and promis'd so to mediate in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48349:93"/>
with the Viceroy of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
that they shou'd have no occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
themselves, for having abandon'd
all things for the sake of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>Iafanatapan,</hi> had
notice of the flight of his Son and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
he broke out into new fury against
the Christians, and put to death great
numbers of them. Being apprehensive,
that his Brother, from whom he had
usurp'd the Crown, and who now led a
wandring life, might possibly change his
Religion also, and beg protection from
the <hi>Portuguese;</hi> he sent Officers round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
with orders to bring him into his
Hands, or at the least, to bring back his
Head. But he fail'd of getting him in
his power either alive or dead. For this
unhappy Prince, attended by ten Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
having pass'd to <hi>Negapatan,</hi> came
by Land to <hi>Goa,</hi> after having suffer'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
hardships, in a Journey of more
than two hundred Leagues.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Enterprise of <hi>Xavier</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour.</note> who was inform'd of
all these proceedings, thought it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make advantage of these favourable
opportunities, without loss of time. He
consider'd, with what perfection Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
might live in a Kingdom where
they dy'd so generously for the Faith,
with so imperfect a knowledge of it.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48349:94"/>
On the other side, he judg'd, that if the
injustice and cruelty of the Tyrant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
unpunish'd, what an inducement
it might be to other Idolatrous Kings,
for them to persecute the new Converts
in their turn. That the only means for
repairing the past, and obviating future
mischiefs, was to dispossess the Tyrant of
the Crown, which he so unjustly wore,
and restore it to his Brother, to whom it
rightfully belong'd: That for these Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
recourse ought to be had to
the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> to ingage them by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Religion to take Arms against
the Usurper of the Kingdom, and the
Persecutour of the Christians.</p>
            <p>In order to this, the Father caus'd

were to pay the <hi>Paravas</hi> of the Coast of
<hi>Fishery,</hi> constrain'd those poor Fishers to
deliver their Pearls almost for nothing;
and thus the exaction of a lawful Tribute

and Oppression in the managment. Men

To conclude, the King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,

            <p>Father <hi>Francis</hi> was wonderfully griev'd
to perceive, that the greatest hindrance
to the growth of Christianity, in those
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48349:95"/>
vast Dominions of <hi>Asia,</hi> proceeded only
from the Christians. He bewail'd it
sometimes to God, in the bitterness of
his Heart, and one day said, <hi>that he wou'd
willingly return to</hi> Portugal, <hi>to complain of
it to the King, not doubting, but so Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

               </note> He arriv'd there
the sixteenth of <hi>December</hi> 1544. where
he happend' to meet with <hi>Michael Vaz,</hi>
Vicar General of the <hi>Indies.</hi> In acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with the Reasons of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
he made him sensible, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Government was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cause of the Avarice and Violence of
the Officers. That <hi>Don Alphonso de Sosa,</hi>
was indeed a Religious Gentleman, but
wanted Vigour; that it was not sufficient
to will good Actions, if at the same time
he did not strongly oppose ill ones: In a
word, that it was absolutely necessary for
the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be inform'd, of
all the Disorders in the <hi>Indies,</hi> by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who was an eye witness of them, and
whose Integrity was not liable to Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Vaz</hi> immediately enter'd into the
Opinions of the Father; and his Zeal
carry'd him to pass himself into <hi>Portugal,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48349:95"/>
in a Vessel which was just ready to set
Sail. <hi>Xavier</hi> prais'd God for those good
intentions, and wrote a Letter by him
to King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third; the beginning
of which, I have here transcrib'd.</p>
            <p>YOur Majesty ought to be assur'd,<note place="margin">His Letter to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

God has made choice of you amongst all the
Princes of the World for the Conquest of
<hi>India,</hi> to the end he may make trial of
your Faith, and see what requital you will
make to him for all his Benefits. You ought
also to consider, that in conferring on you

you shou'd have an opportunity of signalizing
your Zeal, by making known to Idolaters,

            <p>
               <hi>The Saint, after this beginning, gave

May your Majesty be pleas'd, a little to

made for the advancement of Religion; that
having weigh'd all things equally on either

               </note> and sail'd towards <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya;</hi>
in the Ship there was a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Gentleman, much a Libertine, and one
of those declar'd <hi>Atheists,</hi> who make a
boast of their impiety. This was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
enough for the Holy man to make
acquaintance with him. He kept him
company, and was even so complaisant
as to entertain him with pleasant conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
The <hi>Portuguese</hi> was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with his good humour, and took
pleasure in hearing him discourse on
many curious Subjects. But, if <hi>Xavier</hi>
offer'd to let fall a word concerning the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48349:98"/>
Salvation of his Soul, he laught it out,
and wou'd hear no more. If the Father
mildly reprov'd him for his profane and
scandalous way of living; he flew out
into a fury, against the holy practice of
the Church, and swore he wou'd never
more come to Confession.</p>
            <p>These ill inclinations did not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<hi>Xavier</hi> from his undertaking:
He treated this harden'd Sinner after the
manner that Physicians use a Patient ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his Sickness, with all manner of
compassion and soft behaviour. In the
mean time they came to an Anchor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Port of <hi>Cananor,</hi> and going ashore
together, they took a walk into a Wood
of Palm-Trees, which was near their
place of Landing. After they had made
a turn or two, the Saint stripp'd himself
to the wast, and taking a Discipline poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the ends with wire, struck so hard
and so often on his naked body, that in
a very little time his back and shoulders
were all bloody. 'Tis for your sake,
said he to the Gentleman who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him, that I do what you see; and
all this is nothing to what I wou'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
suffer for you. But, added he,
you have cost <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> a much dearer
price: will neither his passion, his death,
nor all his blood suffice to soften the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48349:98"/>
hardness of your heart? After this, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself to our blessed Saviour,
<hi>O Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>be pleas'd to look on thy
own adorable blood, and not on that, of so
vile a Sinner as my self.</hi> The Gentleman
amaz'd and confounded both at once, at
such an excess of charity, cast himself at
the feet of <hi>Xavier,</hi> beseeching him to
forbear, and promising to confess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and totally to change his former
life. In effect, before they departed out
of the Wood, he made a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to the Father, with sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
for his Sins, and afterwards liv'd,
with the exemplary behaviour and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of a good Christian.</p>
            <p>Being return'd to the Port, they went

them to assemble all the Forces
they cou'd make, at <hi>Negapatan,</hi> and make

he lodg'd in the house of a Christian,

at the ill conduct of his graceless Son,
wept day and night; and <hi>Xavier</hi> began
at first to comfort him, saying those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were ordinary in youth; and riper

            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> being come back to
<hi>Cochin,</hi> was very kindly receiv'd by the
Secretary of State, <hi>Cosmo Annez,</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
friend, who was there, on some
important business. Being one day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and talking familiarly, <hi>Xavier</hi>
ask'd <hi>Annez,</hi> if the year had been good
for the <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants? <hi>Annez</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, that it cou'd not have been
better: that not long since, seven Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
had been sent off, which were now
in their passage to <hi>Europe,</hi> and richly
laden. He added, that himself had sent
the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> a rare Diamond,
which had cost six thousand Ducats at
<hi>Goa,</hi> and wou'd be worth more than
thirty thousand at <hi>Lisbonne. Xavier</hi>
had a farther curiosity to enquire, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48349:100"/>
of the Ships had carried the Diamond,
and <hi>Annez</hi> told him, it was the Ship
call'd the <hi>Atoghia,</hi> and that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
the Jewel to <hi>Iohn Norogna,</hi> who
was Captain of the Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> then enter'd into a profound
meditation, and after he had kept silence
for some time, all on the sudden, thus
reply'd, I cou'd have wish'd that a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
of so great value had not been
intrusted to that Ship. And for what
reason answer'd <hi>Annez?</hi> is it not because
the <hi>Atoghia,</hi> has once formerly sprung a
Leak? but, Father, she is now so well
refitted, that she may be taken for a
new Vessel. The Saint explain'd himself
no father; and <hi>Annez,</hi> upon a second
consideration, began to conjecture, both
from the Father's words, and afterwards
from his silence, that there was some
danger in the matter, whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him, to recommend that Ship to
the protection of Almighty God; for in
conclusion, said he, the <hi>Atoghia</hi> cannot
be lost without a very considerable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to me. I have had no order, said
he, to buy that Diamond, so that in case
it shou'd miscarry, the loss will be wholly
mine.</p>
            <p>Sitting one day together at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and <hi>Xavier</hi> observing <hi>Annez</hi> to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48349:100"/>
in great concernment, give thanks to
God, said he, your Diamond is safe, and
at this very time, in the hands of the
Queen of <hi>Portugal. Annez</hi> believ'd <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
on his word; and understood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

            <p>While they were equipping the Fleet,
it happen'd that a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Vessel, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and
laden with Rich Merchandise, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Tempest upon the Coast of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanatapan.</hi>
The King made seizure of it,
and possess'd himself of all within it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
The Captain, and the Ships Company
foreseeing, that if in this conjucture,
War shou'd be made against the Heathen
Prince, they shou'd never be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
their wealth out of his hands, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Officers of the Fleet with large
Presents, to desist from their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Thus, the Tyrant, whom Father
<hi>Xavier</hi> design'd to drive out from his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48349:102"/>
ill-gotten Kingdom, was maintain'd in
it, by the covetousness of Christians; or
or rather by the secret decrees of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which sometimes permits the
Persecutors of the Church, to reign in
peace, to the end a tryal may be made,
of such, as dare to continue constant in
their Faith.</p>
            <p>As holy men resign their Will, to that
of God, <hi>Xavier</hi> wholly abandon'd the
Enterprize of <hi>Iafanatapan;</hi> and thought
only of returning to the Kingdom of
<hi>Travancor.</hi> Being now on Sea, he cast
back his eyes on the Isle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> which
he saw from far; and cry'd out, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for it, <hi>Ah! unhappy Island, with how
many Carcasses do I behold thee cover'd?
and what Rivers of blood, are making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations

those Islanders with the Sword, and the
King of <hi>Iafanatapan,</hi> being himself taken,
together with his eldest Son, was put to
death in his own Pallace: As if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice had not deferr'd the death of
this Persecutor, but only to render it
more terrible, and more memorable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48349:102"/>
Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was very desirous of
returning to <hi>Travancor;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He designs the Voyage of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassar;</hi> and the Conversion of many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</note> but the Winds
blew so contrary, that they always
drove him from the Coast. By this
he judg'd that God had call'd him to
some other place; and thereupon form'd
a resolution of carrying the light of the
Gospel, from Isle to Isle, and from King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to Kingdom, even to the utmost
limits of the East. The news he heard,
during his Navigation, caus'd him sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to cast his thoughts on an Island
situate under the Equinoctial, betwixt
the <hi>Molucca's</hi> and <hi>Borneo,</hi> stretch'd in
length two hundred Leagues from North
to South, and divided into sundry King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
call'd by the Geographers <hi>Celebes,</hi>
by the Historians <hi>Macassar;</hi> from the
names of the two Capital Cities, of the
two Principal Kingdoms, as to the rest,
well peopled, and abounding in all sorts
of Riches.</p>
            <p>It was related to him, that about the
year 1531, two Brothers, both Idolaters,
as were all the Inhabitants of <hi>Macassar,</hi>
going on their private business to <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
the chief of the <hi>Molucca's,</hi> had some
conference, relating to Religion, with
the Governour <hi>Antonio Galvan</hi> a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese,</hi>
one of the most famous Warriours
of his age; and celebrated in History,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48349:103"/>
both for his Piety and Valour. That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
learnt from him, the Vanity of their
Idols, they embrac'd the Christian Faith,
and at their Baptism took the names of
<hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Michael.</hi> That being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into their Country, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lves
taught publickly the Faith of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ:</hi> That all their Countrey-men
with one accord, sent their Embassadours
to the Governour of <hi>Ternate,</hi> desiring
him to send them some to instruct them
in the Principles of Faith: and that the
Heads of this Embassy were the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
known to <hi>Galvan:</hi> that these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
found a very kind reception;
and that for want of a Priest, <hi>Galvan</hi>
gave them a Souldier for their Teacher,
whose name was <hi>Francis de Castro;</hi> a
Man knowing in Religion, and of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Piety. In conclusion, that <hi>Castro,</hi>
who was thus chosen to instruct that
people, imbarking for <hi>Macassar,</hi> was
driven by a Tempest another way.</p>
            <p>Besides this, <hi>Xavier</hi> was likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that not long before, a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Merchant, call'd <hi>Antonio Payva,</hi> going to
<hi>Macassar</hi> in the name of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Captain of <hi>Malacca,</hi> for a Ships lading
of Sandal, a pretious Wood, growing in
that Island, the King of <hi>Supa,</hi> which is
one of the Kingdoms of <hi>Macassar,</hi> came
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48349:103"/>
in person to see him, and ask'd divers
questions relating to the Christian Faith:
that this honest Merchant, better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Traffick, than his Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
yet answer'd very pertinently,
and discours'd of the Mysteries of Faith,
after so reasonable a manner, that the
King, then threescore years of age, was
converted, with all his Family and Court.
That another King of the same Island,
call'd, <hi>the King of</hi> Sion, follow'd his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
and that these two Princes, who
were solemnly baptis'd by the hand of
<hi>Payva,</hi> not being able to retain him with
them, desir'd him to send them some
Priests, who might administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and baptise their Subjects.</p>
            <p>These pious inclinations, appear'd to
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> as an excellent ground-work
for the planting of the Gospel. He
wept for joy at the happy news; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
the profound judgments of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, which after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
the Grace of Baptism to the King of
<hi>Travancor,</hi> when all his Subjects had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it, began the Conversion of <hi>Sion</hi>
and of <hi>Supa,</hi> by that of their Sovereigns.
He even believ'd, that his Evangelical
Ministry, exacted from him, to put the
last hand to the Conversion of those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>

the ancient Founder, and first Father of
Christianity in the <hi>Indies,</hi> whom he had
taken for his Patron and his guide, in the
course of all his Travels.<note place="margin">What happen'd to him in his passage to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liapor.</hi>
               </note> He therefore
resolv'd to go in Pilgrimage to <hi>Meliapor,</hi>
which is distant but fifty Leagues from
<hi>Negatapan,</hi> where the Wind had driven
him back. And imbarking in the Ship
of <hi>Michael Pereyra,</hi> on <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi>
which fell that year 1545, on the <hi>29th</hi>
of <hi>March,</hi> they shap'd their Course along
the Coasts of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> having at first
a favourable Wind, but they had not
made above twelve or thirteen Leagues,
when the Weather chang'd on a sudden,
and the Sea became so rough, that they
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orc'd to make to Land, and cast
Anchor under covert of a Mountain, to
put their Ship into some reasonable secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
They lay there for seven days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in expectation of a better Wind;
and all that time the holy Man pass'd in
Contemplation, without taking any
nourishment, either of Meat or Drink,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48349:104"/>
as they observ'd who were in the Vessel
with him, and as <hi>Iames Madeira,</hi> who
was a Witness of it, has depos'd in form
of Law. He only drank on <hi>Easter-Eve,</hi>
and that at the request of the said <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira,</hi>
a little Water, in which an Onyon
had been boil'd, according to his own
direction. On that very day, the Wind
came about into a favourable quarter, and
the Sea grew calm, so that they weigh'd
Anchor, and continued their Voyage.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Xavier,</hi> to whom God daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
more and more of the Spirit of
Prophecy, foreseeing a furious Tempest,
which was conceal'd under that fallacious
Calm, ask'd the Pilot, <hi>If his Ship were strong
enough to endure the violence of bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ride out a Storm?</hi> The Pilot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
she was not, as being an old crazy
Vessel. <hi>Then,</hi> said <hi>Xavier, it were good
to carry her back into the Port. How,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Francis, said the Pilot, <hi>are you fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with so fair a Wind? You may assure
your self, of good Weather by all manner of
signs, and any little Bark may be in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
'Twas in vain for the Saint to press
him farther, not to believe those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
appearances; neither wou'd the
Passengers follow his advice, but they
soon repented of their neglect. For, far
they had not gone, when a dreadful
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48349:105"/>
Wind arose, the Sea was on a Foam, and
mounted into Billows. The Ship was
not able to withstand the Tempest,
and was often in danger of sinking, and
the Mariners were constrain'd to make
towards the Port of <hi>Negapatan,</hi> from
whence they set out, which with much
ado they at length recover'd.</p>
            <p>The impatience of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> to
visit the Tomb of the Apostle St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
caus'd him to make his Pilgrimage by
Land; and he travell'd with so much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
through the rough and uncouth
ways, that in few days he arriv'd at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liapor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That City is now commonly known
by the name of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Meliapor,</hi> the Monuments which he there finds of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
               </note> because that
bless'd Apostle liv'd so long in it, and
there suffer'd Martyrdom. If we will
give credit to the Inhabitants, it was
once almost swallow'd by the Sea; and
for proof of this Tradition, there are yet
to be seen under Water, the Ruines of
great Buildings. The new Town of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liapor</hi>
was built by the <hi>Portuguese;</hi> near
the Walls there is a Hill, which they
call'd <hi>the little Mount,</hi> and in it a Grott,
wherein they say St. <hi>Thomas</hi> hid himself,
during the Persecution. At the entry of
this Cave, there is a Cross, cut in the
Rock, and at the foot of the Mountain,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48349:105"/>
there arises a Spring, the Waters of
which are of such vertue, that sick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
drinking of them, are ordinarily
cur'd.</p>
            <p>From this small ascent, you pass to a
higher, and much larger Mountain; which
seems form'd by nature, for a lonely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
life. For on one side, it looks
upon the Sea, and on the other is cover'd
with old Trees, always green, which at
once make a fruitful and a pleasing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Hither St. <hi>Thomas</hi> retir'd, to pray
with his Disciples; and here it was also
that he was slain by a <hi>Brachman</hi> with the
thrust of a Spear.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portuguese,</hi> who rebuilt <hi>Meliapor,</hi>
found on the top of the Mountain, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Chappel, of Stone-work, all in Ruins.
They were desirous to repair it, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the holy Apostle, and as they
were rummaging all about, even to the
Foundations of it, they drew out a white
Marble, whereon was a Cross, with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
grav'd round about it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
<hi>That God was born of the Virgin</hi>
Mary, <hi>that this God was Eternal, that the
same God taught his Law to his twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and that one of them came to</hi> Melia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,
<hi>with a Palmers Staff in his hand; that
he built a Church there; that the Kings of</hi>
Malabar, Coromandel <hi>and</hi> Pandi, <hi>with many
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48349:106"/>
other Nations, submitted themselves to the
Law, preach'd by St.</hi> Thomas, <hi>a man holy
and penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Marble of which we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
having on it divers stains of Blood,
the common Opinon is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
suffer'd Martyrdom upon it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it be, the Marble was plac'd upon
the Altar, when the Chappel was rebuilt,
and the first time, that a solemn Mass
was said there, the Cross distill'd some
drops of Blood, in the sight of all the
people: which also happen'd many times
in the following years, on the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Martyrdom is clebrated.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Xavier</hi> was come into the
Town, the Vicar of <hi>Meliapor,</hi> who had
heard speak of him as a Successour of the
Apostles, and a Man sent from God, for
the Conversion of the <hi>Indies,</hi> came to
offer him a Lodging in his House: The
Father accepted of it, because it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
to the Church, wherein were kept
the Relicks of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> and that he
cou'd easily step from thence by night,
to consult the Will of God, concerning his
intended Voyage to <hi>Macassar.</hi>

he cou'd, and went to the Church,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48349:106"/>
through a Church-yard which parted it
from the House. The Vicar perceiv'd it,
and advertis'd <hi>Xavier,</hi> that this passage
was not over-safe by night; and that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Phantomes, had been often seen in
it. The Saint believ'd this only said to
frighten him, and hinder him from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
before day; so, he continued his
usual Prayers; but it was not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he found, that the advice was true.
For the nights ensuing, as he pass'd
through the Church-yard, he saw those
dreadful Specters, which endeavour'd to
have stop'd him; yet he sav'd himself
from them, and even laught at them as
vain Illusions.</p>
            <p>The Demons are too proud, to bear
contempt, without revenge, when God
permits them. One night, when the
Saint was at his Devotions before the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the bless'd Virgin, they assaulted
him in great numbers, and beat him so
violently, that he was all over bruis'd,
and forc'd to keep his Bed, for some days
together. He said nothing of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Vicar; but it was discover'd
by a young Man of <hi>Malabar,</hi> who lodg'd
with the Church, and was awaken'd
with the noise: rising from his Bed, he

his person, nor so much as endeavour to
affright him. They only made a noise,

for all the injuries of Hell. For though
the particulars of what pass'd betwixt
God and him were kept secret, 'tis known
at least, in regard of the principal affair,
for which he consulted God, that he had
an Interiour Light, which gave him
clearly to understand, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to pass to the more Southern
Islands, and to labour in their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Christian strength with which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48349:107"/>
he found himself animated at the same
time, caus'd all the dangers, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
he might apprehend, to disappear;
as is manifest by what he wrote from
<hi>Meliapor,</hi> on that occasion, to two of
his Friends at <hi>Goa, Paul de Camerin</hi> and,
<hi>Iames Borba,</hi> of whom we have made so
frequent mention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hope that God will conferr many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
on me, in this Voyage; since
through his infinite mercy, I have learnt,
with so much spiritual joy, that it is his
holy pleasure, I shou'd go to those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Macassar,</hi> where so many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have been made in these latter years.
For what remains, I am so much resolv'd
on executing, what our Lord has reveal'd
to me, that if I should be wanting on my
part, I shou'd go, to my thinking, in direct
opposition to his Orders, and render my
self unworthy of his Favour, both in this
life and in the next. If I cannot find

            <p>Though his intentions in coming to<note place="margin">The Conversions which he makes at <hi>Meliapor.</hi>

               <hi>Meliapor</hi> were only to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of Heaven in his solitude, yet
he employ'd some part of his time, in the
good of others. His holy Life gave a
lustre and value to his Discourse, and the
sight of him alone, was of efficacy to
touch the Heart. The people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it as a Maxim, <hi>That whoever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
not the Counsel of Father</hi> Francis,
<hi>shou'd dye an Enemy of God.</hi> And they
related the unhappy end of some sinners,
who being urg'd by <hi>Xavier,</hi> to make a
speedy Repentance, had deserr'd the
work of their Conversion. This popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Opinion contributed much, to the
change of Manners in the Town; and
the fear of a disastrous death, serv'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to break off in one moment the
criminal commerce of many years.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Meliapor,</hi> a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Gentlemen,<note place="margin">He bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

scandalous life. His House was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,
in little: and the greatest part of
his business was making a Collection of
beautiful Slaves. <hi>Xavier</hi> went one day
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48349:108"/>
to visit him about Dinner time: <hi>Are you
willing,</hi> said the Father, <hi>that we shou'd
begin an acquaintance by dining together?</hi>
The <hi>Portuguese</hi> was somewhat discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
both at the Visit and the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yet he forc'd himself into good
humour, and made shew of being very
glad of the honour which the Father had
done him. While they were at Table, <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
spoke not one word to him, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his debauchery, and only entertain'd
him with ordinary talk: though they
had been serv'd by young Damsels,
whose Habit was not over modest, and
whose Air was very impudent. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
in the same way he had began,
after they were risen from Dinner, and
in conclusion, took his leave, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him the least reproach.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, surpris'd at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> believ'd his silence
to be a bad omen to him; and that he
had nothing else to expect, but an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Death, and a more unhappy Eternity.
In this thought he went with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to find the Father, and falling
down before him, <hi>Tour silence</hi> (said he)
<hi>has spoken pow'rfully to my Heart: I have
not enjoy'd one moment of repose, since you
parted from me: Ah, Father, if my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
Damnation be not already sfix'd, I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48349:109"/>
put my self into your hands, do with me
what you shall judge necessary for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of my Soul, behold me ready to pay
you a blind obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> embrac'd him, and after he
had given him to understand, that the
mercies of the Lord are infinite, that it
is our duty never to despair, that he
who sometimes refuses to Sinners the
hour of repentance, always grants par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to the Penitent; he caus'd him to
put away those occasions of his sin, and
dispos'd him to a general Confession, the
fruit of which, was a chast and Christian
Life.</p>
            <p>In short, the Father did what he cou'd
desire to be done at <hi>Meliapore;</hi> and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of known Integrity have depos'd on
Oath, that he left the Town so different
from what it was, at his coming thither,
that it was hardly to be known, for the
same place: which also gave him so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
a satisfaction, that giving it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Benedictions, he said that there was
not in all the <hi>Indies,</hi> a more Christian
Town. And at the same time he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy'd,
that one day it shou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
flourishing and wealthy; which
Prediction was accomplish'd some few
years afterward.</p>

Though all these Conversions,<note place="margin">Divers wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful events which encrease his Fame.</note> drew
the publick veneration on Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
it seem'd that God took pleasure in
making the name of his Servant yet
more illustrious, by certain wonderful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.
A Merchant of <hi>Meliapore,</hi> being
just ready to imbark for <hi>Malacca,</hi> went
to take his leave of him. In receiving
his blessing, he beg'd of him some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
token of his friendship. The Father
who was very poor, cou'd find nothing
to give him, but the Chaplet which was
hanging at his neck: This Chaplet,<note n="*" place="margin">or Beads.</note> said
he to the Merchant, shall not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to you, provided you repose your
trust in the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
went away, in full assurance of
the Divine Protection, and without fear
of Pyrates, Winds, or Rocks: but God
wou'd make a tryal of his Faith. He
had already almost cross'd, without the
least hazard, the great Gulph, which is
betwixt <hi>Meliapore</hi> and <hi>Malacca,</hi> when
suddenly there blew a furious Storm, the
Sails were torn, the Rudder broken, and
the Mast came by the Boord; and the
Vessel, afterwards being driven against
the Rocks, was split: The greatest part
of the Seamen and Passengers were
drown'd; some of them held upon the
Rocks, where they were cast away; and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48349:110"/>
the Merchant himself was of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But, being upon the wide Sea, and
not having wherewithal to supply Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to avoid dying by hunger, they
took a resolution, which only despair
cou'd have inspir'd: having gather'd up
some floating Planks of their wreck'd
Vessel, and joyning them together the
best they cou'd, they put themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, and abandon'd their safety to
the mercy of the Waves, without other
hope, than of lighting on some cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
which might possibly carry them
on shore.</p>
            <p>The Merchant full of confidence in
the Blessed Virgin, had still preserv'd the
Chaplet of <hi>Xavier,</hi> and fear'd not drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
while he held it in his hand. The
float of Planks was hardly adrift upon
the waves, when he found he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
out of himself, and believ'd he
was at <hi>Meliapore</hi> with Father <hi>Francis.</hi>
Returning from his extasie, he was
strangely surpriz'd, to find himself on an
unknown Coast, and not to see about
him the Companions of his Fortunes,
nor the Planks to which he had intrusted
his Life. He understood from some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who casually came that way, that
it was the Coast of <hi>Negapatan,</hi> and, in a
transport mix'd with joy and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48349:110"/>
he told them, in how miraculous
a manner, God had deliver'd him from
death.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Portuguese,</hi> by profession a
Souldier, call'd <hi>Ierome Fernandez de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi>
receiv'd a considerable assistance
from <hi>Xavier,</hi> in a different manner, but
full as marvelous. <hi>Fernandez,</hi> having
put off, from the Coast of <hi>Cormandel,</hi>
in a Ship belonging to him, wherein was
all his wealth, to go to another Coast
more westward, was taken near the Cape
of <hi>Comorin,</hi> by the <hi>Malabar</hi> Pyrates, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
covetous and cruel. To save his
life, in losing his goods, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Sea, and was happy enough,
in spight of his ill fortune, to swim to
land, on the Coast of <hi>Meliapore.</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there Father <hi>Francis,</hi> he related his
misfortune to him, and beg'd an Alms.
The Father was almost sorry, at that
time for his being so poor himself, that
he had not wherewithal to relieve the
miserable man, yet he put his hand into
his Pocket, as if he were searching there
for something, but finding nothing, he
lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
turning to <hi>Fernandez,</hi> with looks
full of compassion, have courage, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

said he to him, Heaven will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for you. After which, walking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48349:111"/>
four or five paces, he once more
put his hands into his Pockets, and pull'd
out fifty pieces of Gold, <hi>receive</hi> added
he, <hi>what Heaven sends you: Make use of
it, but speak not of it:</hi> The surprize and
joy of <hi>Fernandez</hi> were so great, that it
was impossible for him to keep silence.
He publish'd in all places, the bounty of
his Benefactour; and the pieces of Gold
were found to be so pure and fine,
that it was not doubted but they were
miraculous.</p>

than what pass'd betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Iohn Duro,</hi> or <hi>Deyro,</hi> as some
have call'd him. He was a man, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five and thirty years of age, who
had formerly born arms; afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Merchant, and owner of a Ship,
very wealthy, and fortunate in all his
traffick: all which notwithstanding, he
was ill satisfi'd with the world, uneasie
to himself, unquiet in the midst of all
his wealth, and perswaded that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
cou'd content his Soul. He went
one day to see the Holy man, and told
him, that for many years he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of changing his condition; and of
serving God as perfectly as he was able,
but, that two reasons had always hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him: the one was, that he never
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48349:111"/>
yet, cou'd meet with any person, who
was capable of shewing him the way of
perfection; the other was, that he was
affraid of falling into Poverty. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he was now out of pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those two points. That for the
first, he hop'd he shou'd walk surely in
the way of Heaven, having so able a
guide as he; and for the second, he had
got sufficiently, for his maintenance in
an honest and comfortable way, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the remainder of his life. He beg'd
leave of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> that he might
follow him, and promis'd on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to defray his charges.</p>
            <p>The Father made <hi>Deyro</hi> understand,
how far he was yet from the Kingdom
of Heaven; that to arrive at perfection,
he must perform what our <hi>Saviour</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel'd
the young man, who seem'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to follow him, that is to say, he
must practise these words in the litteral
sence, <hi>sell all thou hast, and give it to the
Poor. Deyro,</hi> thus undeceiv'd, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
desir'd the Father to take all his
goods, and distribute them amongst the
Poor; but the Father, wou'd neither do
what <hi>Deyro</hi> had propos'd to him, nor
permit that he shou'd himself dispose of
any thing, before he had made Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to him. Foreseeing, without doubt,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48349:112"/>
that being so Rich, he shou'd be oblig'd
to make restitution of some part of that
which he had gain'd.</p>
            <p>The Confession of the Merchant, was
three days in making: after which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sold his Ship, and his Merchandise,
he restor'd what he had got unjustly, and
gave great Alms. And in consequence
of this, under the direction of the Saint,
he gave himself to the exercises of Piety
and Penitence, thereby to lay a solid
Foundation of that perfection, to which
he aspir'd.</p>
            <p>But these fair beginnings,<note place="margin">The new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert falls from grace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes suspected to the Saint.</note> were not
attended with any answerable fruit, and
that Spirit of Retirement, of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of Poverty, was soon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
in a man accustom'd to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyls
of the world, who had always
liv'd in plenty, and who passionately
lov'd his profit. He return'd to the
thoughts of his former condition, and
having recover'd some jewels, and bought
a small Vessel in secret, he set himself to
follow his former way of living.</p>
            <p>When he was just on the point of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sail, a Catechist, call'd <hi>Antonio,</hi>
came and told him, that Father <hi>Xavier</hi>
desir'd to speak with him. <hi>Deyro,</hi> who
thought of nothing more, than of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his escape, and who had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48349:112"/>
his design to the knowledge of
any person, made as if he took him for
another. But <hi>Antonio</hi> persisting in it,
that it was himself, whom the Father
meant, he durst not dissemble any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and went to find him, resolv'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of denying all, as thinking the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at most cou'd have but a bare su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition
of his change, and intended flight.
He therefore assum'd an air of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and presented himself boldly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Saint, but God had given him
knowledge of <hi>Deyro's</hi> intentions. <hi>You
have sin'd,</hi> said <hi>Xavier,</hi> as soon as he
beheld him, <hi>you have sin'd.</hi> These few
words so deeply struck him, that he
threw himself at the feet of the Father,
all trembling, and crying out, <hi>'Tis true,
my Father, I have sin'd;</hi> Penitence then,
my Son, <hi>reply'd the Father,</hi> Penitence!
<hi>Deyro</hi> confess'd himself immediately,
went to sell off his Ship, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the money to the Poor; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
afterwards, and put himself once
more under the conduct of the Father,
with a firm resolution of following his
counsels more sincerely, and of serving
God more faithfully.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Before he went on Board he wrote to

came to his relief. He embrac'd
him tenderly, and said all he cou'd to
comfort him: But the Souldier who was
still in the transports of his fury, thrust
him away, and forbore not even ill
Language to him. <hi>Xavier</hi> stood recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for some time, imploring God's
assistance and counsel; then went and
borrow'd fifty Royals of a Passenger,
brought them to the Souldier, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48349:114"/>
him once more to try his fortune.
At this the Souldier took heart, and
play'd so luckily, that he recover'd all
his losses with great advantage. The
Saint, who look'd on, took out of the
overplus of the winnings, what he had
borrow'd for him; and seeing the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
now return'd to a calm temper,
wrought upon him so successfully, that
he, who before refus'd to hear him, was

is not any, more inclin'd to pleasure;
and this seems chiefly to proceed, from
the mild temper of the air. For there
is an eternal Spring, notwithstanding

follow the natural bent of
their complexion; their whole business
is Perfumes, Feasts, and Musique; to

<hi>Malacca,</hi> in the year 1511, and thirty
thousand men, with eight thousand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Artillery, and an infinite number
of Elephants and Ships were not able to
defend it. It was taken by force, at
the second Assault, by eight hundred
brave <hi>Portugueses,</hi> seconded by some few
<hi>Malabars.</hi> It was given up to pillage,
for three days, and the <hi>Moor King,</hi> after
all his endeavours, was forc'd to fly with
only fifty Horsemen to attend him. The
<hi>Portugueses</hi> built a Cittadel, which the
succeeding Governours took care to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie:
yet not so strongly, as to be proof
against the attempts of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi>
who many times attacq'd it, and half
ruin'd it.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Xavier</hi> came on shore, he
went to visit the Governour of the Town,
to inform him of his intended Voyage
to <hi>Macassar.</hi> The Governour told him,
that he had lately sent thither a Priest,
of holy life, with some <hi>Portuguese</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
and that he expected to hear of
them very suddenly. That in the mean
time he was of opinion, that the Father
and his Companion, shou'd stay at <hi>Malacca,</hi>
till the present condition of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in <hi>Macassar</hi> were fully known. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
gave credit to the Governour, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48349:115"/>
retir'd to the Hospital, which he had
chosen for the place of his abode. The
People ran in Crowds to behold the
countenance of that great Apostle, whose
fame was spread through all the <hi>Indies;</hi>
and over all the East. The Parents
show'd him to their Children; and it
was observ'd, that the Man of God, in
caressing those little <hi>Portugueses,</hi> call'd
every one of them by their proper names,
as if he had been of their acquaintance;
and were not a stranger newly come
on shore.</p>
            <p>For what remains, he found the Town,<note place="margin">In what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he found the Town; and what he did in order to reform it.</note>
in a most horrible corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who liv'd there
at a distance, both from the Bishop, and
the Viceroy of the <hi>Indies,</hi> committed
all manner of Crimes, without fear of
Laws, either Ecclesiastical or Civil. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
Intemperance, Uncleanness, and
forgetfulness of God were every where
predominant, and the Habit only, or
rather the excess and number of their
Vices, distinguish'd the Christians from
the Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>This terrible Prospect of a sinful Town,
gave <hi>Xavier</hi> to comprehend, that his
stay in <hi>Malacca</hi> was necessary, and might
possibly turn to a good account; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he wou'd undertake the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48349:116"/>
of a Town, so universally corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he employ'd some days in serving
of the Sick: he pass'd many nights in

               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>After these Preparatives, he began his
publick instructions according to the
methods which he had frequently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
at <hi>Goa.</hi> Walking the Streets at
evening, with his Bell in his Hand, he
cry'd with a loud voice, <hi>Pray to God for
those who are in the state of Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at Sin:</hi>
and by this, he brought into the minds
of Sinners, the remembrance and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their Offences. For seeing
the ill habits of their Minds, and that the
disease was like to be inflam'd, if violent
remedies were apply'd, he temper'd more
than ever the ardour of his Zeal. Though
he had naturally a Serene Countenance,
and was of a pleasing Conversation, yet
all the charms of his good humour seem'd
to be redoubled at <hi>Malacca,</hi> insomuch,
that his Companion, <hi>Iohn Deyro,</hi> cou'd
not but wonder at his gayety, and soft
behaviour.</p>
            <p>By this procedure,<note place="margin">He labours with success at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca.</hi>
               </note> the Apostle gain'd
the Hearts of all, and became in some
manner, Lord of the City. At the very
first, he rooted out an establish'd custom,
which permitted the young Maids to go
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48349:116"/>
in the Habit of Boys, whenever they
pleas'd, which occasion'd a world of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.
He drove out of Doors, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
or turn'd them into lawful
Wives, according to his former method.
As for the Children, who had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and who learnt Songs of
Bibaldry, and Obsceneness, as soon as
they began to speak, he form'd them so
well in a little time, that they publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recited the Christian Doctrine, and set
up little Altars in the Streets, about
which they sung together the Hymns of
the Catholick Church. But that in which
he was most successful, was to restore the
practice of <hi>Confession,</hi> which was almost
entirely lost. But now, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
crowded the Tribunal of holy <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;</hi>
and the Father was not able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the necessities of so many.</p>
            <p>He labour'd in the knowledge of the
<hi>Malaya</hi> Tongue, which is spoken in all
the Isles beyond <hi>Malacca,</hi> and is as it
were the Universal Language. His first
care was to have a little Catechism tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into it, being the same he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on the Coast of <hi>Fishery:</hi> together
with a more ample instruction, which
treated of the principal duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
He learnt all this without Book,
and to make himself the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48349:117"/>
he took a particular care of the
Pronunciation.</p>
            <p>With these helps, and the assistance of
Interpreters, who were never wanting to
him at his need, he converted many <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
as also <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Iews;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest, a famous Rabbi, who
made a publick Abjuration of <hi>Iudaism.</hi>
This Rabbi, who before had taken for so
many Fables, or juggling tricks, all those
wonders which are reported to have been
done by <hi>Xavier,</hi> now acknowledg'd
them for Truths, by the Evidence of his
own Eyes. For the Saint never wrought
so many Miracles as at <hi>Malacca.</hi> The
Juridical Depositions of Witnesses then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
have assur'd us, that all sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whom he did but touch, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
cur'd; and that his Hands had
an healing vertue, against all Distempers.
One of his most famous cures, was that
of <hi>Antonio Fernandez,</hi> a Youth, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fifteen years of age, was sick to
death. His Mother, a Christian by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but not without some remainders
of Paganism in her Heart, seeing that all
natural Remedies were of no effect, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to certain Enchantments frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practis'd amongst the Heathens, and
sent for an old Sorceress, who was call'd
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48349:117"/>
on a Lace brayded of many
thrids, and ty'd it about the Arm of the
Patient. But instead of the expected
cure, <hi>Fernandez</hi> lost his Speech, and was
taken with such violent Convulsions, that
the Physitians were call'd again; who
all despair'd of his recovery. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
every moment he shou'd breath
his last, when a Christian Lady, who
happen'd to come in, said to the Mother
of the dying Youth, <hi>Why do you not send
for the holy Father? he will infallibly cure
him.</hi> She gave credit to her words, and
sent for <hi>Xavier.</hi> He was immediately
there: <hi>Fernandez,</hi> who had lost his Sense,
and lay gasping in death, began to cry
out, and make violent motions, so soon
as the Father had set his Foot within the
Doors: but when he came into the
Room and stood before the Youth, he
fell into howlings, and dreadful wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Body, which redoubled at the
sight of the Cross, that was presented to
him. <hi>Xavier</hi> doubted not but there
was something of extraordinary in his
Disease, nor even that God, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the Mother, who had made
use of Diabolical Remedies, had deliver'd
her Son to the evil Spirits. He fell on
his Knees by the Bed-side, read aloud
the Passion of our Lord, hung his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48349:118"/>
about the Neck of the sick person,
and sprinkled him with Holy Water. This
made the fury of the Devil cease: and
the young Man, half dead, lay without
motion as before. Then <hi>Xavier</hi> rising
up, <hi>Get him somewhat to eat,</hi> (said he)
and told them, what nourishment he
thought proper for him. After which,
addressing himself to the Father of the
Youth, <hi>When your Son,</hi> added he, <hi>shall be
in condition to walk, lead him your self,
for nine days successively, to the Church
of our Lady of the Mount, where to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
I will say Mass for him.</hi> After this
he departed, and the next day, while he
was celebrating the Divine Sacrifice, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez,</hi>
on the sudden came to himself,
spoke very sensibly, and perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
his former health.</p>
            <p>But how wonderful soever,<note place="margin">Hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

this Youth, appear'd in the Eyes of all
Men, the Resurection of a young Maid
was of greater admiration. <hi>Xavier</hi> was
gone on a little Journey, somewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Neighbourhood of <hi>Malacca,</hi> to
do a work of Charity, when this Girl dy'd.
Her Mother, who had been in search of
the holy Man during her Daughter's sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
came to him, after his return, and
throwing her self at his Feet, all in Tears,
said almost the same words to him,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48349:118"/>
which <hi>Martha</hi> said formerly to our Lord,
<hi>That if he had been in Town, she who was
now dead, had been alive: but if he wou'd
call upon the name of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>the
dead might be restor'd to life. Xavier</hi>
was overjoy'd to behold so great Faith in
a Woman, who was but lately baptis'd,
and judging her worthy of that blessing
which she begg'd, after having lifted up
his Eyes to Heaven, and silently pray'd
to God some little space, he turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, and said to her with much
assurance, <hi>Go; your Daughter is alive.</hi>
The poor Mother seeing the Saint offer'd
not to go with her to the place of Burial,
reply'd betwixt hope and fear, <hi>That it
was three days since her Daughter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd:
'Tis no matter,</hi> answer'd <hi>Xavier,

that he might be more at hand to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

For the Inhabitants, who since the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val

Manners, relaps'd insensibly into their

<hi>Xavier</hi> fail'd not to denounce the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Father <hi>Xavier</hi> expounded to them the
Mysteries of Christianity in one Tongue,
they understood him severally, each in

once in many Tongues.</p>
            <p>They had been already six weeks at

<hi>and to morrow at break of day, we shall be
in view of</hi> Amboyna. In effect, at the
time mention'd, the next morning, they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48349:120"/>
saw that Island. The Pilot being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to cast Anchor; Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
with some of the Passengers, were put
into a Skiff, and the Ship pursu'd its
course. When the Skiff was almost rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to Land, two light Vessels of Pyrats,
which usually cruis'd on that Coast, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
on the sudden, and pursu'd them
swiftly. Not hoping any succour from
the Ship, which was already at a great
distance from them, and being also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
defence, they were forc'd to put off
from Shore, and ply their Oars towards
the main Sea: insomuch that the Pyrats
soon lost sight of them. After they had
escap'd the danger, they durst not make
to Land again, for fear the two Vessels
shou'd lye in wait to intercept them at
their return. But the Father assur'd the
Mariners, they had no further cause of
fear: turning therefore towards the
Island, they landed there in safety, on the
sixteenth of <hi>February.</hi>

in it; besides which, there were in
the Island seven Villages of Christians,
Natives of the place, but without any

was just dead. <hi>Xavier</hi> began to visit
these Villages, and immediately baptis'd
many Infants, who dy'd suddenly after

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48349:121"/>
that the greatest part of the Island be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Christians. He built Churches in
every Village, and made choice of the
most reasonable, the most able, and the
most servent, to be Masters over the rest,
till there shou'd arrive a supply of Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
To which purpose he wrote to
<hi>Goa,</hi> and commanded <hi>Paul de Camerine</hi>
to send him <hi>Francis Mansilla, Iohn Beyra,</hi>
and one or two more, of the first Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which shou'd arrive from <hi>Europe:</hi>
He charg'd <hi>Mansilla</hi> in particular, to come.
His design was to establish in one of
those Isles a House of the Company,
which shou'd send out continual supplies
of Labourers, for the publication of the
Gospel, through all that <hi>Archipelago.</hi>

at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> two <hi>Naval</hi> Armies arriv'd

of the <hi>Molucca's</hi> in the name of the

but their Enterprise succeeded
not. After two years cruising, and long

them, to give Jealousie to the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> who were allyed to the King
of <hi>Ternate,</hi> his Enemy, they took their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48349:122"/>
way by <hi>Amboyna,</hi> to pass into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Europe.</hi> They
were engag'd in an unjust Expedition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rights of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Order from <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, for
that Emperour, to whom King <hi>Iohn</hi> the
third address'd his Complaints thereupon,
disavow'd the Proceedings of his Subjects,
and gave permission, that they shou'd be
us'd like Pyrates.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Portuguese</hi> proceeded not against
them with that severity. But it seems
that God reveng'd their quarrel; in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a contagious
Fever, which destroy'd the greatest
part of their Fleet. It was a sad specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to behold the Mariners and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
lying here and there in their Ships,
or on the shoar, in Cabins, cover'd only
with Leaves. The Disease which consum'd
them, kept all men at a distance from
them, and the more necessity they had
of succour, the less they found from the
People of the Island.</p>
            <p>At the first report which came to
<hi>Xavier</hi> of this Pestilence,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> them.</note> he left all
things to relieve them: And 'tis scarce
to be imagin'd, to what actions his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
led him on this occasion. He was
day and night in a continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at the same time administring to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48349:122"/>
their Bodies and their Souls; assisting the
dying, burying the dead, and Interring
them even with his own hands. As
the Sick had neither Food nor Physick,
he procur'd both for them from every
side; and he who furnish'd him the most,
was a <hi>Portuguese</hi> call'd <hi>Iohn d' Araus;</hi>
who came in his company from. <hi>Malacca</hi>
to <hi>Amboyna.</hi> Nevertheless the Malady
still encreasing day by day, <hi>Araus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fear he shou'd impoverish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by these Charities, and from a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted man, became so hard, that
nothing more was to be squeez'd out of
him. One day <hi>Xavier</hi> sent to him for
some Wine, for a sick man who had
continual faintings: <hi>Araus</hi> gave it, but
with great reluctance, and charg'd the
Messenger to trouble him no more; that
he had need of the remainder for his
own use, and when his own was at an
end, whither shou'd he go for a supply?
These words were no sooner related to
Father <hi>Francis,</hi> than inflam'd with a holy
indignation, <hi>What,</hi> says he, <hi>does</hi> Araus
<hi>think of keeping his Wine for himself, and
refusing it to the Members of</hi> Jesus Christ;
<hi>the end of his Life is very near, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death, all his Estate shall be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
amongst the Poor.</hi> He denounc'd
death to him with his own mouth, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48349:123"/>
the event verify'd the Prediction, as the
sequel will make manifest.</p>
            <p>Though the Pestilence was not wholly
ceas'd, and many Sick were yet aboard
the Vessels, the <hi>Spanish Fleet</hi> set Sail for
<hi>Goa,</hi> forc'd to it, by the approach of
Winter, which begins about <hi>May,</hi> in
those quarters. Father <hi>Xavier</hi> made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
for the necessities of the Souldiers,
and furnish'd them, before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with all he cou'd obtain from the
Charity of the <hi>Portuguese.</hi> He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
them likewise to the Charity of
his Friends at <hi>Malacca,</hi> where the Navy
was to touch, and wrote to Father <hi>Paul
de Camerine</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> that he shou'd not
fail to Lodge in the <hi>Colledge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
those Religious of the Order of St.
<hi>Augustin,</hi> who came along with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that he shou'd do
them all the good Offices, which their

               <hi>Xavier</hi> made some little Voyages to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

some Islands which were half un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled,

               <hi>Baranura;</hi> where he miraculously reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
his Crucifix, in the manner I am

which was given of it by a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese,</hi>
call'd <hi>Fausto Rodriguez,</hi> who was

<hi>Francis, Iohn Raposo,</hi> and my self,
when there arose a Tempest which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
all the Mariners. Then the Father
drew from his bosome a little Crucifix,
which he always carri'd about him, and
leaning over deck, intended to have dipt
it into the Sea; but the Crucifix dropt
out of his hand, and was carri'd off by
the Waves. This loss, very sensibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
him, and he conceal'd not his
sorrow from us. The next morning we
landed on the Island of <hi>Baranura;</hi> from
the time when the Crucifix was lost, to
that of our landing, it was near 24 hours,
during which, we were in perpetual
danger. Being on shore, Father <hi>Francis</hi>
and I, walk'd along by the Sea side, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Town of <hi>Tamalo,</hi> and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
walk'd about five hundred paces,
when both of us beheld arising out of
the Sea, a Crab-Fish, which carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48349:124"/>
his Claws, the same Crucifix,
rais'd on high. I saw the Crab-Fish come
directly to the Father by whose side I
was, and stop'd before him. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
falling on his knees, took his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,
after which the Crab-Fish return'd
into the Sea. But the Father, still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in the same humble posture, hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and kissing the Crucifix, was half
an hour praying with his hands across
his breast, and my self joyning with him
in thanksgiving to God, for so evident
a Miracle: after which we arose, and
continu'd on our way. Thus you have
the Relation of <hi>Rodriguez.</hi>

            <p>They staid eight days upon the Island,
and afterwards set sail for <hi>Rosalao;</hi> where

and having nothing of humane in
them, besides the figure, gave no credit
to his words, and one only man amongst
them, more reasonable than all the rest,
believ'd in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Insomuch, that
the Holy Apostle, at his departure from
<hi>Rosalao,</hi> took off his Shoos, and shook
off the dust, that he might not carry

conditions, and also oblig'd himself on
the publick faith, to keep his word, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<hi>Xavier</hi> fail'd not on his part, of

causing a great Cross to be made, set

it up, on the highest ground of all the
Town, and there, on his knees, amongst

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48349:126"/>
dangerous, both in regard of
the strong Tides, and the uncertain
Winds, which are still raising Tempests
though the Sea be never so calm. The
Ship which carried the Father, was one
of those Vessels, which in those parts are
call'd <hi>Caracores,</hi> of a long and narrow
built, like Gallies, and which use indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
Sails and Oars. Another Vessel
of the same make, carried a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
call'd <hi>Iohn Galvan,</hi> having aboard her
all his goods; they set out together from
<hi>Amboyna,</hi> keeping company by the
way, and both of them bound for the
Port of <hi>Ternate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midst of the Gulph, they were
surpriz'd with a storm, which parted
them so far, that they lost sight of each
other. The <hi>Caracore</hi> of <hi>Xavier,</hi> after
having been in danger of perishing many
times, was at length sav'd, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Port of <hi>Ternate,</hi> by a kind of
Miracle: As for that of <hi>Galvan,</hi> it was
not known what became of her; and the
news concerning her, was only brought
by an evident Revelation.</p>
            <p>The first Saints day, when the Father
Preach'd to the People, he stop'd short
in the middle of his discourse, and said
after a little pause, <hi>Pray to God for the
Soul of</hi> John Galvan, <hi>who is drown'd in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48349:127"/>
the Gulph.</hi> Some of the Audience, who
were friends of <hi>Galvan,</hi> and interessed in
the <hi>Caracore,</hi> ran to the Mariners, who
had brought the Father, and demanded
of them, if they knew any certain news,
of this tragical adventure? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that they knew no more, than
that the storm had separated the two
Vessels. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> recover'd cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
at those words, and imagin'd that
Father <hi>Francis</hi> had no other knowledge
than the Seamen. But they were soon
undeceiv'd by the testimony of their

of debauch'd persons living in that

was extinguish'd with the love of Pleasures.
Restitutions were frequently made; and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48349:128"/>
such abundant Alms were given, that the
House of Charity, set up for the relief of

King of <hi>Tidore,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Boliefe,</hi>
who was King of <hi>Ternate,</hi> before the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
had conquer'd the Island. She
was a Princess of great Wit and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
but extreamly bigotted to her Sect,
and a mortal Enemy to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that is to say, to the <hi>Portuguese.</hi>
Her hatred to them was justly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for having receiv'd them into her
Kingdom, with great civility, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
also permitted them to establish
themselves in one part of the Island, for

               </gap>nce of their Trade, she was
dealt with so hardly by them, that after
the death of the King her Husband, she
had nothing left her, but the bare Title
of a Queen: And by their Intrigues, the
three Princes her Sons, lost the Crown,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48349:128"/>
their Liberty, and their Lives. Her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
fortune constrain'd her to lead a
wandring life, from Isle to Isle: But
Providence, which wou'd accomplish on
her its good designs, brought her back at
last to <hi>Ternate,</hi> about the time when <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
came thither. She liv'd there, in
the condition of a private person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Authority, yet with Splendour, and
retaining still in her Countenance and
Behaviour, somewhat of that haughty
Air, which the Great sometimes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
even in their Fetters.</p>
            <p>The Saint gain'd access to her, and
found an opportunity of conversing with
her. In his first discourse, he gave her a
great Idea of the Kingdom of God: yet
withal inform'd her, That this Kingdom
was not difficult to obtain; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once in possession of it, there was no
fear of being after dispossess'd. Insomuch,
that the <hi>Saracen</hi> Princess, who had no
hopes remaining of ought on Earth,
turn'd her thoughts and her desires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven. 'Tis true, that as she was
indu'd with a great Wit, and was very
knowing in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> there
was some need of Argumentation; but
the Father, still clearing all her doubts,
the dispute only serv'd to make her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
more certainly the falseness of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48349:129"/>
the <hi>Alcoran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the truth of the Gospel.
She submitted to the Saints Reasons, or
rather to the Grace of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and
was publickly baptis'd by the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who gave her the name of <hi>Isabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not satisfy'd with barely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her a Christian. He saw in her a
great stock of Piety, an upright Heart,
a tenderness of Mind, inclinations truly
great and noble; which he cultivated
with admirable care, and set her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by degrees, in the most sublime
and solid ways of a spiritual life: So that
<hi>Neachile,</hi> under the conduct of Father
<hi>Xavier,</hi> arriv'd to a singular Devotion;
that is to say, she grew humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
from disdainful, and haughty as
she was, mild to others, and severe to her
self, suffering her Misfortunes without
complaint of Injuries; united to God, in
her Retirements, and not appearing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
but to exercise the deeds of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to her Neighbour: but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
and honour'd both by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Portugueses,</hi> than when she sat
upon the Throne, in all the pomp and

which are distant from it about sixty

to him, that those Islanders, <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
as they were, had been most of them
baptis'd, but that the Faith had been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
there, immediately after it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd,
and this account he heard of it.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Momoya,</hi> which is
a Town in the Isle <hi>del Moro,</hi> wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
embrace the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> though
all the neighbouring Villages had receiv'd
it. And the Prince, or Lord of that
Town, who chose rather to continue an
Idolater, than to become a <hi>Mahometan,</hi>
being molested by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Governour of <hi>Ternate,</hi> who
was call'd <hi>Tristan d' Atayda,</hi> promising,
that himself and his Subjects wou'd turn
Christians, provided the <hi>Portugueses</hi>
wou'd take them into their protection.
<hi>Atayda</hi> receiving savourably those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the Prince of <hi>Momoya,</hi> the Prince
came in person to <hi>Ternate,</hi> and desir'd Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
taking then, the name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> in
honour of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
At his return to <hi>Momoya,</hi> he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Priest, call'd <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Vaz,</hi> who converted many Idolaters
to the Faith. The number of Christians,
thus daily increasing more and more, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priest call'd <hi>Francis Alvarez,</hi> came to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48349:130"/>
second <hi>Vaz,</hi> and both of them labour'd so
happily in conjunction, that the whole
people of <hi>Momoya</hi> renounc'd Idolatry,
and profess'd the Faith of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
whom the Governour of <hi>Ternate</hi>
had promis'd to send, came from thence
to defend the Town, against the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But the cruelty
which he exercis'd on the Mother of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
Aerio,</hi> Bastard Son to King <hi>Boliefe,</hi>
so far exasperated those Princes and the
neighbouring People, that they conspir'd
the death of all the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who
were to be found in those quarters. The
Inhabitants of <hi>Momoya</hi> naturally change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and cruel, began the Massacre by
the murther of <hi>Simon Vaz,</hi> their first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor;
and had kill'd <hi>Alvarez,</hi> whom they
pursu'd with flights of Arrows to the
Sea-side, if accidentally he had not found
a Bark in readiness, which bore him off,
all wounded as he was, and sav'd him from
the fury of those Christian <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saracens</hi> made their advantage of
these disorders, and Mastering <hi>Momoya,</hi>
chang'd the whole Religion of the Town.
The Prince himself was the only Man,
who continu'd firm in the Christian Faith,
notwithstanding all their threatning,
and the cruel usage which he receiv'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48349:130"/>
from them. Not long after this, <hi>Antonio

for his Prudence, his Valour,
and his Piety, succeeding to <hi>Tristan d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayda,</hi>
in the Government of <hi>Ternate,</hi>
sent to the Isle <hi>del Moro,</hi> a Priest, who
was both able and zealous, by whose
Ministry, the people were once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into the Fold of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
Affairs of the <hi>Infidels</hi> were ruin'd. But
this Priest remain'd not long upon the
Island, and the people destitute of all
Spiritual Instructions, return'd soon after,
through their natural inconstancy, to
their original Barbarism.</p>
            <p>In this condition was the Isle <hi>del Moro,</hi>

and for this very reason, he determin'd
to go, and preach the Gospel there, after
he had stay'd for three Months at <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>
When his design was known, all
possible endeavours were us'd to break it.
His Friends were not wanting to inform
him, that the Countrey was as hideous as
it was barren: That it seem'd accurs'd
by Nature, and a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Beasts than Men. That the Air
was so gross, and so unwholesome, that
Strangers cou'd not live in the Countrey.
That the Mountains continually vomited
flakes of Fire and Ashes, and that the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48349:131"/>
ground it self, was subject to terrible and
frequent Earthquakes. And besides, it
was told him, that the people of the
Countrey, surpass'd in cruelty and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness,
all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of the World.
That Christianity had not softned their
Manners; that they poyson'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that they fed themselves with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Flesh; and that when any of their
Relations happen'd to die, they cut off
his Hands and Feet, of which they
made a delicate <hi>Ragou.</hi> That their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
extended so far, that when
they design'd a sumptuous Feast; they
begg'd some of their Friends to lend them
an old unprofitable Father, to be serv'd up
to the Entertainment of their Guests,
with promise to repay them in kind, on
the like occasion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who
lov'd <hi>Xavier,</hi> added, that since those
Salvages spar'd not their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and their Parents, what wou'd
they not do to a Stranger, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
person? That they were first to
be transform'd into Men, before they
cou'd be made Christians. And how
cou'd he imprint the Principles of the
Divine Law into their Hearts, who had
not the least sence of Humanity? Who
shou'd be his Guide through those thick
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48349:131"/>
intangled Forests, where the greatest part
of them were lodg'd, like so many wild
Beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when, by rare fortune, he
shou'd atchieve the taming of them, and
even convert them, how long wou'd that
Conversion last? at the longest, but
while he continu'd with them. That no
Man wou'd venture to succeed him in
his Apostleship to those parts, for that
was only to be expos'd to a certain
death; and that the Blood of <hi>Simon Vaz</hi>
was yet steaming. To conclude, there
were many other Isles, which had never
heard of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and who were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dispos'd to receive the Gospel.</p>
            <p>These reasons were accompanied with
Prayers and Tears; but they were to
no purpose, and <hi>Xavier</hi> was stedfast to
his Resolution. His Friends perceiving
they cou'd gain nothing upon him by
Intreaties, had recourse in some measure
to Constraint. So far as to obtain from
the Governour of <hi>Ternate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a Decree, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding,

               <hi>He added,</hi> That other less Salvage Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wou'd never want for Preachers:
That these only Isles remain'd for him to
cultivate, since no other Man wou'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them. <hi>In sequel, suffering himself to
be transported with a kind of holy Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:48349:132"/>
If these Isles, <hi>(pursu'd he)</hi> abounded
with precious Woods, and Mines of Gold,
the Christians wou'd have the courage to go
thither; and all the dangers of the World,
wou'd not be able to affright them; they
are base and fearful, because there are only
Souls to purchase. And shall it then be
said, That Charity is less daring than Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice?
You tell me they will take away my
life, either by the Sword or Poison; but
those are favours too great for such a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as I am to expect from Heaven. Yet
I dare confidently say, That whatever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or death they prepare for me, I
am ready to suffer a thousand times more,
for the Salvation of one only Soul. If I
shou'd happen to die by their Hands, who
knows but all of them might receive the
Faith? for 'tis most certain, that since the
primitive times of the Church, the Seed of
the Gospel has made a larger increase in
the Fields of Paganism, by the Blood of
Martyrs, than by the Sweat of Missioners.</p>
            <p>He concluded his Discourse, by telling
them, <hi>That there was nothing really to

not only the Decree against his passage

dear Brethren, though this Evangelical

when the time of Practising it calls

as clear as the Text seems, it becomes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure;

of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom God by his mercy
has explain'd it. For then it will be seen
how frail and feeble is humane nature.
Many here, who love me tenderly, have
done what possibly they cou'd to divert me
from this Voyage; and seeing that I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to their requests, nor to their tears,
wou'd have furnish'd me wiih Antidotes.
But I wou'd not take any, lest by making
provision of Remedies, I might come to
apprehend the danger: and also, because,
having put my Life into the hands of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
I have no need of preservatives
from death. For it seems to me, that the
more I shou'd make use of remedies, the

The <hi>Barbarians</hi> fled, at the sight of

that he was not an Enemy who
came in search of them. He declar'd to
them the motive of his Voyage; speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them in the <hi>Malaya</hi> Tongue. For
though in the Isle <hi>del Moro,</hi> there were
great diversity of Languages, insomuch
that those of three Leagues distance, did
not understand each other in their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
Tongues, yet the <hi>Malaya</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               </note> the roughness and
barbarity of these Islanders, neither of
those qualities were of proof against the
winning and soft behaviour of the Saint.
He brought them back to their Village,
using all expressions of kindness to them
by the way; and began his work, by
singing aloud, the Christian Doctrine,
through the streets. After which he
expounded it to them, and that in a
manner so suitable to their barbarous
conceptions, that it pass'd with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

By this means he restor'd those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

sensible of what Hell was, by those
dreadful Objects which they had before

to the brink of those Gulphs, which shot
out of their bowels, vast masses of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stones, into the air, with the noise
and fury of a Cannon; and at the view
of those Flames which were mingl'd with

he explain'd to them the nature of those

of fire, not only for <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
but also for the true Believers,

He even told them the gaping mouths

one of his Letters, on that subject, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

the Souls of the dead, hidden under

Devils who were desirous to destroy

them, or by the Omnipotent hand of
God, who adds activity to natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

said Mass. In the midst of the Sacrifice,
the Earth was so violently shaken, that
the People ran in a hurry out of the

Altar might be overthrown, yet he

the Celebration of the Sacred Mysteries,
thinking, as he said himself, that the

was driving the Devils of the Island
down to Hell; and that those Infernal
Spirits made all that noise and tumult,
out of the indignation which they had,
to be banish'd from that place, where
they had held dominion for so many
Ages.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48349:136"/>
in him of Divine. But that high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which most of them had conceiv'd
of him, gave him an absolute Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over them. And with the assistance
of Gods grace, which operated in their
Souls, while he was working by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means, he made so total a Change
in them, that they who formerly, in
respect of their manners, were like
Wolves and Tygers, now became tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and mild, and innocent as Lambs.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this,<note place="margin">He is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a cruel and salvage People.</note> there were
some amongst them who did not divest
themselves fully and at once of their

not work all things in a man it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
or to try the patience of the Saint.
The most rebellious to Gods Spirit, were
the <hi>Iavares;</hi> a rugged and inhumane

Not content with not following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of the Father, they laid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ambushes for him; and one day,
while he was explaining the Rules of
Morality to them out of the Gospel,
by a River side, provok'd by the zeal,
wherewith he condemn'd their dissolute
manners, they cast stones at him, with
design to kill him. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> were
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48349:137"/>
on the one side of him, and the River
on the other; which was broad and

is impossible to a man whom Heaven
protects. There was lying on the bank
a great beam of wood; the Saint push'd
it without the least difficulty into the
water, and placing himself upon it, was
carried in an instant to the other side,
where the stones which were thrown,
cou'd no longer reach him.</p>

all that Holy time, in the Island of

            <p>But the chief Employment of Father
<hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He endeavours the Conversion of the King of <hi>Ternate.</hi>
               </note> was to endeavour the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the King of <hi>Ternate;</hi> commonly
call'd King of the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s. This <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
Prince, whose name was <hi>Cacil Aerio,</hi>
was Son to King <hi>Boleife,</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and Enemy to the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> whom <hi>Tristan d'Atayda</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Ternate,</hi> and Predecessour of
<hi>Antonio Galvan,</hi> caus'd to be thrown out
of a Window, to be reveng'd of her.
This unworthy and cruel usage, might
well exasperate <hi>Cacil;</hi> but fearing their
power who had affronted him in the
person of his Mother, and having the
violent death of his Brothers before his
eyes, he curb'd his resentments, and
broke not out into the least complaint.
The <hi>Portuguese</hi> mistrusted this over-acted
moderation, and affected silence; and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48349:139"/>
according to the Maxim of those Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who hold, that they who do the
injury shou'd never pardon, they us'd
him afterwards as a Rebel, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
upon very light conjectures. <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
de Treïtas,</hi> then Governour of the
Fortress of <hi>Ternata,</hi> a man as rash and
imprudent, as <hi>Galvan</hi> was moderate and
wise, seiz'd the person of the Prince,
stript him of all the Ornaments of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and sent him Prisoner to <hi>Goa,</hi> in
the year 1546, with the <hi>Spanish Fleet,</hi> of
which we have formerly made mention.</p>
            <p>The Cause having been examin'd, in
the Soveraign Tribunal of <hi>Goa,</hi> there
was found nothing to condemn, but the
injustice of <hi>Treïtas: Cacil</hi> was declar'd
innocent; and the new Vice-Roy of the
<hi>Indies, Don Iohn de Castro,</hi> sent him
back to <hi>Ternata,</hi> with Orders to the
<hi>Portugueses,</hi> to re-place him on the
Throne, and pay him so much the more
respect, by how much more they had
injur'd him. As for <hi>Treïtas,</hi> he lost
his Government, and being recall'd to
<hi>Goa,</hi> was Imprison'd as a Criminal of
State.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Ternata</hi> was newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd,
when <hi>Xavier</hi> came into the Isle
for the second time. King <hi>Tabarigia,</hi>
Son of <hi>Boleife,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Cacil,</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:48349:139"/>
had suffer'd the same ill fortune, some
years before. Being accus'd of Felony,
and having been acquitted at <hi>Goa,</hi> where
he was Prisoner, he was also sent back
to his Kingdom, with a splendid Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page;
and the equity of the Christians so
wrought upon him, that he became a
Convert before his departure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> was in hope, that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Tabarigia,</hi> wou'd make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on the Soul of <hi>Cacil,</hi> after his
restoration; at least if any care were
taken of instructing him. And the
hopes of the Saint, seem'd not at the first
to be ill grounded. For the <hi>Barbarian</hi>
King receiv'd him with all civility, and
was very affectionate to him, insomuch
that he cou'd not be without his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
He heard him speak of God, whole
hours together; and there was great
appearance, that he wou'd renounce the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>But the sweet Enchantments of the
Flesh,<note place="margin">What hinder'd the King of <hi>Ternata's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</note> are often an invinsible obstacle to
the grace of Baptism. Besides a vast
number of Concubines, the King of
<hi>Ternata,</hi> had an hundred Women in his
Palace, who retain'd the name and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Wives. To confine himself to
one, was somewhat too hard to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
by him. And when the Father
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48349:140"/>
endeavour'd to perswade him that the
Law of God, did absolutely command
it. He reason'd on his side, according
to the Principles of his Sect, and refin'd
upon it in this manner. <hi>The God of the
Christians and of the</hi> Saracens <hi>is the
same God: why then shou'd the Christians
be confin'd to one only Wife, since God has
permitted the</hi> Saracens <hi>to have so many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet sometimes he chang'd his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and said that he wou'd not lose
his Soul, nor the friendship of Father
<hi>Xavier,</hi> for so small a matter. But, in
conclusion, not being able to contain
himself, within the bounds of Christian
purity, nor to make the Law of <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> agree with that of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> he
continu'd fix'd to his pleasures, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in his errours. Only he ingag'd
his Royal word, that in case the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi>
wou'd invest one of his Sons in
the Kingdom of the Isles <hi>del Moro,</hi> he
wou'd on that condition receive Baptism.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> obtain'd from the Vice-Roy
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> what ever the King
of <hi>Ternate</hi> had desir'd; but the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
far from keeping his promise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
from thence-forward a cruel Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against his Christian Subjects.
And the first strokes of it, fell on the
Queen <hi>Neachile,</hi> who was dispossess'd of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48349:140"/>
all her Lands, and reduc'd to live in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
poverty, during the remainder of
her days. Her Faith supported her in
these new misfortunes: And father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
who had baptis'd her, gave her so
well to understand, how happy it was to
lose all things, and to gain <hi>Christ,</hi> that
she continually gave thanks to God, for
the total overthrow of her Fortune.</p>
            <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">He labours with great fruit, in the Court of <hi>Ternate.</hi>
               </note> the Labours of the
Saint, were not wholly unprofitable in
the Court of <hi>Ternate.</hi> He converted
many persons of the Blood Royal; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others, two Sisters of the Prince,
who preferr'd the quality of Christians,
and Spouses of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> before all
earthly Crowns; and chose rather to
suffer the ill usage of their Brother, than
to forsake their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He leaves to the Islanders a Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own Hand.</note> seeing the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

He gave the People of <hi>Ternate</hi> this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
written in his own Hand, that
it might supply his place during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Many Copies were taken of it,
which were spred about the neighbouring
Islands, and even through the Countries
of the <hi>East.</hi> It was read on Holidays,
in the publick Assemblies; and the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48349:141"/>
listen'd to it, as coming from the
Mouth of the holy Apostle.</p>
            <p>Besides this, he chose out, some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

breed them in the Colledge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

These things being thus order'd, and
the <hi>Caracore,</hi> which was to carry him to

thoughts to depart by night, in the most
secret manner that he cou'd, not to sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Inhabitants, who cou'd not hear
of his going from them, without a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

he took, he cou'd not steal away
without their knowledge. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him in Crowds to the Shore, Men,
Women and Children, gathering about
him, lamenting his loss, begging his
Blessing, and beseeching him, with Tears
in their Eyes, <hi>That since he was resolv'd on

reassuring himself, by considering the
Providence of God which had dispos'd of
him another way; he enjoin'd them to
meet in publick every day, at a certain
Church, to make Repetition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine, and to excite each other
to the practice of Vertue. He charg'd
the new Converts to learn by Heart the
Exposition of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which
he had left with them in Writing: But
that which gave him the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
was, that a Priest, who was there

to the Wives of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>After these last words, Father <hi>Xavier</hi>
left his well-belov'd Children in <hi>Iesus,</hi>

strongest of them, invited the Saint to

against a hidden Rock, where the Iron-work

wanted, but that the Vessel had been

            <p>The Father staying some few days
longer on the Isle, visited the seven Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Villages which were there; caus'd
Crosses to be set up in all of them, for
the Consolation of the Faithful; and
one of these Crosses, in process of time,
became famous for a great Miracle, of
which the whole Country was witness.</p>
            <p>There was an extream drought,<note place="margin">A Cross erected by <hi>Xavier</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes famous.</note> and
a general dearth was apprehended. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Women, who before their Baptism
were accustom'd to use Charms for Rain,
being assembl'd round about an Idol, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
the Devil, and perform'd all the
Magick Ceremonies; but their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48349:143"/>
were of no effect. A devout
Christian Woman, knowing what they
were about, ran thither, and having
sharply reprehended those impious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<hi>As if,</hi> said she, <hi>having a Cross so
near us we had no expectations of succour
from it! and that the holy Father had not
promis'd us, That whatsoever we pray'd for
at the foot of that Cross, shou'd infallibly
he granted.</hi> Upon this, she led those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Women towards a River-side, where
<hi>Xavier</hi> had set up a Cross with his own
Hands, and falling down with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that sacred sign of our Salvation,
she pray'd our Saviour, to give them
Water, to the shame and confusion of
the Idol. At the same moment the
Clouds began to gather on every side,
and the Rain pour'd down in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Then, all in Company they ran

them sometimes, to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48349:143"/>
Christians; and believ'd their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
was of proof against the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Tyrants. Neither was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the judgement he made of
them: and they shew'd themselves,
when the <hi>Iaveses,</hi> provok'd, by their
renouncing the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> came
to invade their Island. While the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racene</hi>
Army destroy'd the Country,
six hundred Christians retir'd into a
Castle, where they were presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd.
Though they were to fear all
things, from the fury of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
yet what they only apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was that those Enemies of <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> might exercise their malice against
a Cross, which was rais'd in the midst
of all the Castle; and which Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
had set up with his own hands.</p>
            <p>To preserve it therefore, inviolable
from their attempts; they wrapt it up
in Cloath of Gold, and buried it in the
bottom of the Ditch.</p>
            <p>After they had thus secur'd their
treasure, they open'd the gate to the
Unbelievers, who knowing what had
been done by them, ran immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in search of the Cross, to revenge
upon it the contempt which had been
shown to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find it, they turn'd all their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48349:144"/>
upon those who had conceal'd it,
and who wou'd not discover where it
was.</p>
            <p>Death, seem'd to have been the

            <p>These three Missioners above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,

were form'd by him, for the Apostolick

months at <hi>Malacca,</hi> in expectation of a

               </note>
his old Companion <hi>Iohn Deyro.</hi>
Though <hi>Deyro</hi> was in his attendance, yet
he was not a Member of the Society;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48349:146"/>
for the causes already specify'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
not to be of it, for those which
follow. Some rich Merchants having
put into his Hands a sum of Money, for
the subsistance of the Father, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
it from him. <hi>Xavier,</hi> who liv'd
only on the Alms which were daily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and who hated Money as much
as his Companion lov'd it, look'd on
this Action of <hi>Deyro,</hi> as an injury done
to Evangelical Poverty, and the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he had of it, caus'd him to
forget his usual mildness to Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Not content to make him a sharp
reprimand, he confin'd him to a little
desart Isle not far distant from the Port;
enjoyning him, not only continual Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but fasting upon Bread and Water, till
he shou'd of his own accord recal him.
<hi>Deyro</hi> who was of a changeable, and
easy temper, neither permanent in good,
nor fsix'd in ill, obey'd the Father, and
liv'd exactly in the method which was
prescrib'd.</p>
            <p>He had one night a Vision,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deyro</hi> has a Vision, which God reveals to <hi>Xavier.</hi>
               </note> whether
awake or sleeping has not been decided
by the juridical Informations of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life. It seem'd to him, that he was in
a fair Temple, where he beheld the bless'd
Virgin, on a Throne all glittering with
precious Stones. Her Countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48349:147"/>
severe, and he, making his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to her, was rejected with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as unworthy to be of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of her Son. After which she arose
from the Throne, and then all things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd.
<hi>Deyro</hi> being recall'd from his
solitude some time after, said nothing of
his Vision to Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> to whom
God had reveal'd it. He even deny'd
boldly to have seen any, though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repeated it to him, with all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
<hi>Xavier,</hi> more scandaliz'd
than ever with this procedure of <hi>Deyro,</hi>
refus'd all farther communication, with a
Man, who was interes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He rid his Hands of him, but withal
foretold him, <hi>That God wou'd be so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to him, as to change his evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that hereafter he shou'd take
the Habit of St.</hi> Francis. Which was so
fully accomplish'd, that when the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
were taken in the <hi>Indies,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Holiness and Miracles of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
Deyro</hi> then wore the Habit of St.

whole burden of the work. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of treating with him, concerning
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48349:147"/>
the business of their Conscience. Not
being able to give audience to all,
many of them were ill satisfy'd, and
murmur'd against him: But since their
discontent and murmurs proceeded from
a good principle, he comforted himself,
and rather rejoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

teaching Children the Christian Doctrin,
visiting the Prisoners and the Sick, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
Enemies, and doing other works
of Charity.</p>
            <p>While the Saint was thus employ'd,
there happen'd an Affair, which much
increas'd his Reputation in all the <hi>Indies.</hi>
For the understanding of the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it will be necessary to trace it from
its Original.</p>
            <p>Since the Conquest of <hi>Malacca</hi> by the<note place="margin">The occasion of the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen's</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise against <hi>Malacca.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Portuguese,</hi> the neighbouring Princes
grew jealous of their Power and made
many attempts to drive that Nation out
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which came to brave them
at their own Doors. Thereupon, they set on
foot many great Armies, at divers times,
but always unsccessfully, and learning by
dear-bought experience, that multitude
can hardly prevail against true valour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:48349:148"/>
These disgraces provok'd the <hi>Sultan
Alaradin,</hi> King of <hi>Achen,</hi> instead of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
him. <hi>Achin,</hi> is the greatest King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Island of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> distant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twelve Leagues from the <hi>terra fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of <hi>Malacca.</hi> This Prince was a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan,</hi>
an implacable Enemy of the
Christians by his Religion, and of the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> by interest of State. Yet he
durst not immediately assault the Fortress
of <hi>Malacca.</hi> All his Fury was spent in
cruising about the Coasts, with a strong
Fleet, thereby to break the trade of the
<hi>Portugueses,</hi> and hinder the Succours
which they had from <hi>Europe.</hi> His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was then to attack the Town, when
it shou'd be bare of Defendants, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
of Stores of Victuals: But to
compass his Enterprise, he was to assure
himself of a Port, which was above <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca</hi>
towards the <hi>North;</hi> which might
serve for a convenient retreat to his Fleet,
and had also occasion for a Fortress, to
secure himself from the Enemy. He
therefore made himself Master of that
Port, and order'd the building of a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</p>

Souldiers, train'd up in Wars, and
well experienc'd in Naval-Fights, were
chosen out, for this glorious Expedition;
and five hundred of them, call'd <hi>Oraba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi>
were the flower of the whole Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and accordingly wore Bracelets of
Gold, as a distinguishing mark of their
high Extraction. There was besides a
great number of <hi>Iannisaries,</hi> newly
arriv'd at the Court of <hi>Achen,</hi> who
serv'd as Volunters, and were eager of
shewing their courage against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
The Fleet consisted of sixty great
Ships, all well equipp'd, and man'd,
without reckoning the Barks, the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,
and the Fire-ships. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the <hi>Saracen, Bajaja Soora,</hi> a

his Exploits in Arms, that his Prince
had honour'd him with the Title of King

even before he had besieg'd the

this at <hi>Malacca,</hi> but what the Army of
<hi>Achen</hi> brought it self. They came before
the place, and enter'd the Port, on the
<hi>9th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 15. 17, about
two a Clock in the morning, resolv'd
to assault it, while they were savour'd
by the darkness. They began by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48349:149"/>
charge of their Artillery; and sending in
their Fire-ships against the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Vessels. After which, the most daring
of them landed; ran without any order,
against that part of the wall, which they
believ'd weakest, fill'd up part of the
Ditch, and mounted the Ladders with
a furious assault. They found more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
than they expected: The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
and the Inhabitants, whom the
shouts, and Artillery of the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
had at first affrighted, recovering cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
through the imminence of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the necessity of Conquering,
or dying, ran upon the Rampart,
and vigorously repuls'd the Assailants;
overthrowing their Ladders, or tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Enemies headlong from them,
insomuch that not a man of them enter'd
the Town, and great numbers lay dead
or dying in the Ditch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soora</hi> comforted himself for the ill
success of his assault, by the execution,
which his fire Ships, and Cannon had
done. All the Vessels within the Port,
were either burnt, or disabled. And the
Rain which immediately fell, serv'd not
so much to extinguish the Flames, as
the violent wind which then arose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to kindle them. Those of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen,</hi>
proud of that action, appear'd next
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48349:149"/>
morning on their Decks, letting fly their
pompous Streamers, and shouting, as if
already they were Victorious. But their
insolence was soon check'd: The Cannon
from the Fortress forc'd them to retire,
as far off, as the Isle of <hi>Vpe.</hi> In the
mean time, seven poor Fishermen, who
had been out all night about their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and were now returning to
the Town, fell into an Ambuscade of
the Insidels, were taken and brought
before the General. After he had cut
off their Ears and Noses, he sent them
back with a Letter, directed to <hi>Don

but the fire. <hi>Duarte de Bareto,</hi> who by
his Office had the super-intendance of
their Naval Stores, was commanded to
fit out these Foysts with all expedition.
But he protested it was not in his
power; for besides that, the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazins
were empty of all necessaries for
the equipping of them, there was no
Money in the Treasury for Materials.</p>

fund, was ready to lose courage; when
<hi>Xavier,</hi> by a certain impulse of Spirit,
suddenly began to embrace seven Sea
Captains, there present, who were of
the Council of War. He begg'd of them
to divide the business amongst them, and
each of them apart, to take care of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out one Gally: At the same time,
without waiting for their answer, he
assign'd every man his task. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
durst not oppose <hi>Xavier,</hi> or rather
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48349:151"/>
God, who inclin'd their hearts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Saints request. Above an
hundred Work-men, were instantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
on every Vessel; and in four days
time the seven Gallies were in condition
of fighting. <hi>Melo</hi> gave the <hi>Catur,</hi> to
<hi>Andrea Toscano,</hi> a man of Courage, and
well vers'd in Sea affairs. He divided
amongst the seven Captains, an hundred
and fourscore Souldiers, chosen men, and
appointed <hi>Francis Deza,</hi> Admiral of the
Fleet. <hi>Xavier</hi> was desirous to have gone
along with them, but the Inhabitants
who believ'd all was lost, if they lost
the Father, and who hop'd for no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
but from him alone, in case
the Enterprise shou'd not succeed, made
such a disturbance about it, that upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deliberation, it was resolv'd to keep
him in the Town.</p>
            <p>The day before their embarkment,<note place="margin">He exhorts the Souldiers, and Captains to do their duty.</note>
having call'd together the Souldiers and
the Captains, he told them that he shou'd
accompany them in Spirit; and that
while they were engaging the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
he wou'd be lifting up his hands to
Heaven for them. That they shou'd
sight valiantly, in hope of glory, not
vain and perishable, but solid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.
That in the heat of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
they shou'd cast their eyes on their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48349:152"/>
Crucify'd Redeemer, whose quarrel they
maintain'd, and beholding his wounds,
themselves should not be affraid either of
wounds or death: and how happy shou'd
they be to render their Saviour life for
life.</p>
            <p>These words inspir'd them with such
generous and Christian thoughts, that
with one voice they made a Vow, to fight
the Insidels, to their last drop of blood.
This solemn Oath was so moving to
<hi>Xavier,</hi> that it drew tears from him;
he gave them all his blessing, and for
their greater encouragement, nam'd them
<hi>The Band of our Saviour's Souldiers:</hi> in
pursuit of which, he heard every man's
confession, and gave them the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his own hand.</p>
            <p>They embark'd the day following,<note place="margin">The Fleet set out: and what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>appen'd at that time.</note>
with so much chearfulness, that it seem'd
to presage a certain Victory. But their
joy continu'd but a moment. They
had scarcely weigh'd Anchor, when the
Admiral split, and immediately went to
the bottom, so that they had hardly
time to save the men. The crowd of
People, who were gather'd together on
the shore to see them go off, beheld this
dismal accident; and took it for a bad
omen of the expedition, murmuring at
the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ime against Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:48349:152"/>
who was the Authour of it; and casting
out loud cries to recall the other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis.
The Governour, who saw the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in an uproar, and apprehended the
consequences of this violent beginning,
sent in haste to seek the Father. The
Messenger found him at the Altar, in the
Church of our Lady <hi>del M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>te,</hi> just
ready to receive the Blessed Sacrament;
he drew near to whisper the business to
him, but the Father beckon'd him with
his hand, to keep silence, and retire.
When Mass was ended, Return, said <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
without giving the man leisure to
tell his Message, and assure the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from me, that he has no occasion
to be discourag'd for the loss of one Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
By this the Saint made known, that
God had reveal'd to him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd.
He continu'd some time in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
before the Image of the Virgin, and
these words of his were over-heard. <hi>O
my Iesus, the desire of my heart, regard
me with a favourable eye; and thou, holy
Virgin, be propitious to me! Lord Iesus,</hi>
(he continu'd) <hi>look upon thy sacred wounds,
and remember they have given us a right
to ask of thee every thing conducing to our
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Prayers being ended,<note place="margin">He upbraids the Governour with his dissidence.</note> he goes to
the Citadel: The Governour allarm'd
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48349:153"/>
with the cryes and murmurs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
cou'd not dissemble his disturbance,
but reproach'd the Father, for having
engag'd them in this Enterprise. But
<hi>Xavier</hi> upbraided him with his distrust
of God; and said smiling to him, What
are you so dejected for so slight an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident?
after which, they went in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to the shore, where the Souldiers
belonging to the Admiral, stood in
great consternation, for the hazard they
had run so lately. The Father re-assur'd
them, and exhorted them to remain
constant, in their holy resolution, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their petty misadventure:
he remonstrated to them, that Heaven
had not permitted their Admiral to sink,
but only to make tryal of their faith;
neither had themselves been sav'd from
shipwrack, but only that they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Vow. In the mean time, the
Governour held it necessary to summon
the great Council. All the Officers of
the Town, and the principal Inhabitants,
were of opinion to give over an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
which as they thought, was begun
rashly, and cou'd have no fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
But the Captains and Souldiers
of the Fleet, encourag'd by the words of
the holy man, and inspir'd with vigour
which had something in it, of more than
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48349:153"/>
humane, were of a quite contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They unanimously protested,
that they had rather dye, than violate
that Faith, which they had solemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For the rest, said
they, what have we more to fear this
day, than we had yesterday? our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is not diminish'd, though we have
one Vessel less: and we shall fight as
well with six <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oysts, as we shou'd with
seven. But, on the other side, what
hopes ought we not to conceive, under
the auspices, and promise of Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Xavier,</hi> taking the word,<note place="margin">He foretells what is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.</note> 
               <hi>The
lost Gally shall be soon made good,</hi> said
he with a Prophetick voice; <hi>before the
Sun goes down, there shall arrive amongst
us two better Vessels than that which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd.
And this I declare to you from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God.</hi> This positive Prediction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
the whole Assembly; and caus'd
them to put off the determination of the
Affair, 'till the day ensuing. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of the day was pass'd with
great impatience, to see the effect of
the Father's promise; when the Sun was
just on the point of setting, and many
began to fear the accomplishment of the
Prophecy, in the very minute, mark'd
out by the Father, they discover'd from
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48349:154"/>
the Clock-house of our Lady <hi>del Monte</hi>
two <hi>European</hi> Ships which were Sailing
directly from the North. <hi>Melo</hi> sent out
a Skiff immediately to hale them, being
inform'd that they were <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
one belonging to <hi>Iames Soarez Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lego,</hi>
and the other to his own Son <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar,</hi>
who came from the Kingdom of
<hi>Patan,</hi> but who took the way of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
without intentions of casting Anchor at
<hi>Malacca,</hi> to avoid paying Customes; he
went in search of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> who
was at his Devotions, in the Church
<hi>del Monte,</hi> and told him, that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
wou'd be accomplish'd to little
purpose, if the Ships came not into the
Port. <hi>Xavier</hi> took it upon himself to
stop them: and going into the Skiff,
which had hail'd them, made directly to
the two Vessels. The Masters of the
Ship, seeing the man of God, receiv'd
him with respect. He made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the present juncture of affairs,
and earnestly besought them, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of their Religion, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to assist the Town against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy of the Christian name, and
the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> And to ingage
them farther, by their particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
he let them see the danger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they were casting themselves,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48349:154"/>
in case they shou'd obstinately pursue
their Voyage, and that they were going
without consideration, to precipitate
themselves into the hands of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They yielded to the reasons of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the next morning enter'd the
Port, amidst the shouts and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People. After this, there was
no farther dispute of fighting the Enemy,
and the most timerous came about, to
the Opinion of the Captains and the
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>All things being in a readiness to set<note place="margin">The <hi>Portuguese</hi> Fleet goes in search of the Enemy.</note>
sail, the Admiral <hi>Francis Doza</hi> receiv'd
the Flag from the hands of <hi>Xavier,</hi> who
had solemnly blessed it, and mounted the
Ship of his Brother <hi>George Deza,</hi> instead
of his own which was already sunk. The
rest of the Captains, who had been on
shore, return'd on Ship-board, and with
the two newly arriv'd Vessels, the whole
Fleet consisted of nine, their number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
being encreas'd by fifty men, they
were in all, two hundred and thirty <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses.</hi>
The Fleet went out of Port,
the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> with strict Orders
from the General, not to pass beyond
the <hi>Pulo Cambylan,</hi> which is the farthest
bounds of the Kingdom of <hi>Malacca</hi> on
the West. His reason was, that since
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48349:155"/>
they were so much inferiour in strength
to the Enemy, who vastly out-number'd
them, in men and shipping; their glory
consisted in driving them from off their
Coasts; and not in farther pursuit of
them. That what hope soever we have
in God, yet it becomes us not to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpt
him, because Heaven is not accustom'd
to give a blessing to rashness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
            <p>Thus setting out full of assurance and
of joy, they arriv'd in four days at <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
Cambylan,</hi> without having any news
of the Enemy, notwithstanding their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to find him out. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in obedience to the Governour, was
thinking to return, though the courage
of his Souldiers prompted them to pass
beyond the Bounds prescrib'd them; and
to go in search of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> into
whatsoever corner of the World they
were retir'd. The Admiral I say was
dispos'd to have gone back, when the
Moon suddenly went into an Eclipse.
It was one of the greatest which had
ever been observ'd, and seem'd to them
to Prognosticate the total defeat of the
<hi>Mahometans.</hi> But the same night there
arose so violent a wind, that they were
forc'd to stay upon their Anchors, for
the space of three and twenty days suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48349:155"/>
Their Provisions then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to grow short, and the Wind not
suffering them, to turn to the Coast of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> they resolv'd on taking in fresh
Provisions at <hi>Tenasserim,</hi> towards the
Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fleet.</note> all things were in
confusion at <hi>Malacca.</hi> The hopes which
Father <hi>Xavier</hi> had given the People, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
them for some few days. But
seeing a month was now expir'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intelligence from the Fleet, they
believ'd it was either swallow'd by the
Waves, or defeated by the <hi>Achenois,</hi> and
that none had escap'd to bring the news.
At the same time, the <hi>Saracens</hi> reported
confidently, they had it from good
hands that the Fleets had met, that the
<hi>Achenois</hi> had cut in pieces all the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi>
and had sent the heads of their
Commanders, as a Present to their King.
This bruit was spread through all the
Town, and was daily strengthen'd after
the rate of false rumours, which are full
of Tragical Events. The better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
this report, they gave the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of time and place, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
actions of the Battel. The Sorcerers
and Soothsayers were consulted by the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Women, whose Husbands and Sons
were in the Fleet: and they confirm'd
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48349:156"/>
what-ever was related in the Town. It
came at last to a publick rising against
<hi>Xavier;</hi> and the Governour himself was
not wholly free from the popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Xavier,</hi> far from the least despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the promises of God, and of
the knowledge he had given him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the condition of the Fleet, with
an erected countenance assur'd, they
shou'd suddenly see it return victorious.
Which notwithstanding, he continu'd
frequent in his Vows and Prayers; and
at the end of all his Sermons, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to their Devotions, the happy
return of their desir'd Navy. Their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were so much invenom'd, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
against him, that many of them
treated him with injurious words, while
he was rally'd by the more moderate,
who were not asham'd to say, his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
might be of use, for the Souls of the
Souldiers, who were slain in fight, but
were of little consequence, to gain a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
which was lost.</p>
            <p>Some fresh Intelligence,<note place="margin">A new cause of Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>Bintan,</hi> Son to that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
whom <hi>Albuquerque</hi> the Great, had
despoil'd of the Kingdom of <hi>Malacca,</hi>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:48349:156"/>
sought for nothing more, than an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of re-conquering of what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had lost by force of Arms. Seeing
the Town now bare of Souldiers, and
hearing that the <hi>Achenois</hi> had beaten the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> he put to Sea, with three
hundred Sail, and put in at the River of
<hi>Muar,</hi> within six Leagues of <hi>Malacca,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he might the better execute his
design, by concealing it, he wrote from
thence to the Governour</hi> Melo, That he
had arm'd a Fleet against the King of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
his Enemy, but that having been inform'd
of the defeat of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> he was
come as a Friend and Brother of the King
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to succour <hi>Malacca,</hi> against
the King of <hi>Achen,</hi> who wou'd not fail to
master the Town, if the course of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
was not stopp'd; that therefore he
desir'd only to be admitted into the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came into the possession of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
after which he had no farther
cause of apprehension.</p>
            <p>Melo, <hi>whom the Constancy of Father</hi>
Xavier <hi>had reassur'd, discover'd the
Snare, which was laid for him; and
trick'd those, who had intended to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent

Bintan, That the Town had no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
as being abundantly provided both of

Men and Amunition. That so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qeurour

by night a Fisher-boat, going by
their Ships. They stop'd the Boat, and
the Fisher-men being examin'd, told
them, <hi>That the</hi> Achenois <hi>were not far
distant, that they had been six weeks in
the River: That they had plunder'd all
the Low-lands, and were now building a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48349:157"/>

with joy: And <hi>Deza</hi> infinitely pleas'd,

he spent his Powder to no purpose, and
that he warn'd the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Guard. What he did with
more prudence, was to send three Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
up the River, to discover the Enemy,
and observe their Countenance, while he
put all things in order for the Fight.
The three <hi>Foysts,</hi> in their passage, met
with four <hi>Brigantines,</hi> which the Enemies
had detach'd, to know the meaning of
the Guns which they had heard. Before
they had taken a distinct view on either
side, the three <hi>Foysts</hi> had grappel'd each
a <hi>Brigantine,</hi> and seiz'd her; the fourth
escap'd. The Souldiers put all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

the Oath which they had tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Victory, from the intercession of the
holy Father, who had promis'd it.</p>
            <p>All unanimously answer'd, <hi>That they
wou'd fight it out to death; and shou'd be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to dye in defence of their Religion. Deza,</hi>
animated, by this their answer, posted
himself advantageously on the River, so
as to be able from thence to fall upon the
Enemy, without indangering his little
Fleet, to be incompass'd by their numbers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Achenois</hi> no sooner were inform'd
by their <hi>Brigantine,</hi> of the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Navy, than they put themselves into a
condition of attacking it. They were
not only insolent by reason of their
strength, but provok'd also by the late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
they had receiv'd in their <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines;</hi>
so that full of fury, without the
least ballancing of the matter, they set Sail
with all their Navy, excepting only two
Vessels, and two hundred Land-Souldiers,
which were left in Guard of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Slaves, and all their Booty. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Wind for them, and coming
down the River, they were carry'd with
such swiftness, that <hi>Deza</hi> was hardly got
aboard the Admiral, when he heard
their Drums, and their yelling shouts,
which re-eccho'd from the Shores, and
neighbouring Mountains. They were
divided into ten Squadrons, and each of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48349:159"/>
them compos'd of six Vessels, excepting
only the first, which consisted but of
four, but those the strongest of the Fleet.
The Admiral, on which the King of <hi>Pedir</hi>
was on board, was in the first Squadron,
and with him were three <hi>Turkish Galions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That fury which transported the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi>

Immediately after, the two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
met, and stemm'd each other.

three <hi>Galions</hi> which were in Front with

to save their General, and the principal
Lords of his Retinue. But these <hi>Galions</hi>
which were a cross the Stream, and took
up half the breadth of it, stopp'd their
own Vessels, which follow'd File by File.
Insomuch, that those of the second rank

               </gap>laughter, and at the thundring of the

Insomuch that the <hi>Achenois</hi> leapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Their General being taken up, when

great; for besides the two Guard-ships
which came into the power of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,
and wherein was all the Pillage,
which the Enemy had gain'd; they took
at least forty five Vessels, which might

sixty two pieces of Ordnance, whereon
were graven the Arms of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
which had been lost in divers Wars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd

            <p>The King of <hi>Parlez,</hi> no sooner had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

out of the Woods where he lay conceal'd,
he came with five hundred Men, and fell

Having cut them in pieces, he went to

Valour of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess:

               </note> preaching in the great
Church, betwixt nine and ten of the
Clock, on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, which was
the fourth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> according to the
old Calendar, at the same time, when
the two Fleets were actually ingag'd,
stopp'd short on the sudden, and appear'd
transported out of himself; so manifest a
change appear'd, both in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and his whole person. Having
somewhat recover'd himself, instead of
following his Discourse, inspir'd with a
Divine Impulse, he declar'd to his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the incounter, and shock of the two
Navies, but in a Mysterious and Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
manner.</p>
            <p>The Assembly, not comprehending
their Preachers meaning, were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that he was distracted; still as the
Fight grew warmer, and the ingagement
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48349:161"/>
came to be more close, he seem'd to be
more and more inflam'd, with all the
motions of a Man inspir'd, and speaking
still Prophetically. At the length, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eyes on the Crucifix that was before
him, he said with tears in his Eyes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with sighs, but with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
and distinct voice, <hi>Ah</hi> Jesus, <hi>thou
God of my Soul, and Father of all Mercies,
I most humbly implore thee by the Merits
of thy sacred Passion, not to forsake those
who sight thy Battle.</hi> After these words,
he hung down his Head, as overweary'd,
and lean'd upon his Pulpit, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speaking. Having continu'd in that
posture for some time, he sprung up, on
the sudden, and said aloud, with all the
motions of Joy, which he cou'd not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<hi>My Brethren,</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>has
vanquish'd for you. At this moment, while
I am speaking, the Souldiers of his bless'd
name, have compleated their Victory, by
the entire defeat of the Enemies Navy.
They have made a great slaughter, and we
have lost but four of our</hi> Portugueses. <hi>You
shall receive the news of it on Friday next,
and may shortly expect the return of your
victorious Fleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How incredible soever this appear'd,
yet <hi>Melo,</hi> and the principal persons of
the Town there present, gave credit to

which had somewhat of Divine in it,
and bore the testimony of its Truth.
Yet the Wives and Mothers of the absent
Souldiers, apprehending still it might be

desir'd it shou'd be true. The Father assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them all in the Afternoon, at the

repeated so distinctly, the whole series of
what he had said in the Morning, that

The Town receiv'd them with repeated

who was at the head of the People on

Souldiers to understand, that they ow'd

since his return from the <hi>Molucca's</hi>
and was just on his departure, when the
Ships, which early come from <hi>China,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in the Port. A <hi>Iapponesse,</hi> whose
name was <hi>Anger,</hi> came with these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
expresly to see <hi>Xavier.</hi> He was a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout
five and thirty years of Age, Rich,
Nobly born, and one whose life had been
sufficiently libertine. The <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
who two years before had made the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Iapan,</hi> had been acquainted
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48349:162"/>
with him at <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> the place of his
birth, and understood from his own
mouth, that having been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the remembrance of the sins
of his youth, he had retir'd himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the solitary <hi>Bonzes.</hi>
But that neither the solitude, nor the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those <hi>Heathen</hi> Priests, had been
able to restore him the tranquillity of
his Soul, and that thereupon, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into the World, more disquieted
than ever, with his remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>Some other <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants, who
at that time came to <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> and
who had seen Father <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Malacca,</hi>
the first Voyage he had made thither,
made an intimate acquaintance, and
friendship with <hi>Anger.</hi> And this <hi>Iapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,</hi>
discovering to them the perplexity
of his Soul, which augmented daily,
more and more, they told him that in
<hi>Malacca,</hi> there was a Religious man, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for his holy Life, well experienc'd
in the conduct of Souls, and most proper
to settle his perplex'd Conscience, and
that if he wou'd try this remedy, they
wou'd facilitate the means to him, and
bring him to the Saint, of whom they
had spoken. That it was Father <hi>Francis
Xavier,</hi> their friend, the refuge of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48349:163"/>
and comforter of troubled minds.</p>

               </note>
strong desire of going to see the holy
man, but the length of the Voyage,
which was eight hundred leagues, the
dangers of a tempestuous Sea, and the
considerations of his family, somewhat
cool'd him. A troublesome affair, which
he had upon his hands at the same time,
at length resolv'd him. For having kill'd
a man in a quarrel, and being pursu'd
by Justice, he cou'd not find a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
retreat, than the Ships of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
nor a surer way of preserving his life,
than to accept the offer they had made
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alvarez Vaz,</hi> who had most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
him to take this Voyage, and who
had many times offer'd to bring him to
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> had not yet finish'd all
his business, when this <hi>Iaponnese</hi> came to
take sanctuary in his Ship. He therefore
gave him Letters of recommendation to
another <hi>Portuguese,</hi> call'd <hi>Ferdinand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi>
who was at another Port of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
and who was suddenly to set sail
for <hi>Malacca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anger</hi> departed by night, attended by
two Servants; being arriv'd at the Port,
and enquiring for <hi>Ferdinand Alvarez,</hi> he
lighted accidentally on <hi>George Alvarez,</hi>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:48349:163"/>
who was just ready to weigh Anchor.
This <hi>George</hi> was a wealthy Merchant, a
man of probity, and who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
affection for the Father. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Letters of <hi>Alvarez,</hi> as if they
had been address'd to himself, took the
three <hi>Iaponians</hi> into his Ship, entertain'd
them with all kindness, and brought
them to <hi>Malacca,</hi> taking great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the good Office he shou'd do in
presenting them to the man of God, who
might perhaps make them the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of their Country. But the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was, that they miss'd of the Father,
who was just gone for the <hi>Molucca's:
Anger,</hi> more disquieted in a foreign land,
than he had been at home, and despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ever seeing him, whom he had
so often heard of from his friends, had
it in his thoughts to have return'd to
<hi>Iapan,</hi> without considering the danger
to which he expos'd himself, and almost
forgetting the murther which had caus'd
his flight; according to the custom of
Criminals, who blind themselves in
those occasions, and whom divine justice
oftentimes brings back to the same place,
where they had committed their offence.
Whereupon, he went again to Sea, and
having made some little stay in a Port
of <hi>China,</hi> he pursu'd his Voyage. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48349:164"/>
some <hi>Iaponian</hi> Islands were in sight,
when there arose a furious Tempest,
which indanger'd the sinking of the Ship,
and which in four days brought him
back into the same Port of <hi>China,</hi> from
whence he had set out. This was to
<hi>Anger</hi> a favourable effect of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
for the same hand which drives
the guilty to the Precipice, sometimes
preserves them from falling into it,
and pulls them back, after a miraculous
manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iaponnese</hi> very happily for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
met there, <hi>Alvarez Vaz,</hi> just ready
to set sail for <hi>Malacca.</hi> The <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
who lov'd <hi>Anger,</hi> reprov'd him for his
impatience, and offer'd to re-conduct
him to the place, which he had so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
left; withall telling him that
according to all appearances, the Father
by this time was return'd from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca's.
Anger,</hi> who still carried about
him a troubled Conscience, and thereby
was easily induc'd to any proposition
which tended to compose it, follow'd
the advice of <hi>Vaz,</hi> and return'd with
him.</p>

The Father, who foresaw, not only that
this <hi>Iaponian,</hi> shou'd be the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
of that Kingdom, but also by his
means, the Gospel shou'd be Preach'd in
it, was transported with joy at the first
sight of him, and embrac'd him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
tenderness. The sight of the
Saint, and his embracements, gave such
consolations to <hi>Anger,</hi> that he no longer
doubted of receiving an entire satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from him. Understanding in some
measure the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Language, <hi>Xavier</hi>
himself assur'd him, that the disquiets of
his mind shou'd be dissipated, and that
he shou'd obtain that Spiritual repose, in
search of which, he had undertaken so
long a Voyage: But that before he cou'd
arrive to it, it concern'd him first to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and practise the law of the true
God, who alone cou'd calm the troubles
of his heart, and set it in a perpetual
tranquillity. <hi>Anger,</hi> who desir'd nothing
so much, as to have his Conscience in
repose, and who was charm'd with the
great goodness of the Father, offer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be directed in all things by him.
The Servant of God, instructed him in
the Principles of Faith, of which his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48349:165"/>
Friends the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> had already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him some knowledge; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of their Profession were capable of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. But to the end his Conversion
might be more solid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

Christianity before their Baptism. The
Father had yet a further purpose in it,
that these first fruits of <hi>Iaponian</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
shou'd be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48349:165"/>
with the most horrible Tempest,
which was ever seen. They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd,
at the very beginning of it, to
cast over-board all their Merchandise,
and the winds roar'd with so much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that the Pilot not being able to
hold the Rudder, abandon'd the Vessel to
the fury of the Waves. For three days and
nights together, they had death continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present before their eyes: and nothing
reassur'd the Mariners, but the serene
countenance of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> amidst
the cries and tumults in the Ship. After
he had heard their Confessions, implor'd
the help of Heaven, and exhorted all of
them to receive with an equal mind, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life or death, from the hand of God,
he retir'd into his Cabin. <hi>Francis Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyra</hi>
looking for the man of God, in the

from him, found him on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Crucifix, wholly taken up, and
lost to all things but to God. The Ship
driven along by an impetuous current,
already struck against the Sands of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
and the Mariners gave themselves
for lost, without hope of recovery;
when the Father coming out of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,
ask'd the Pilot for the Line and Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
with which he was accustom'd to
fathom the Sea: having taken them, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48349:166"/>
let them down to the bottom of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
he pronounc'd these words, <hi>Great
God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, have
mercy on us.</hi> At the same moment, the
Vessel stop'd, and the Wind ceas'd. After
which, they pursu'd their Voyage, and
happily arriv'd at the Port of <hi>Cochin,</hi> on
the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary, 1548.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There the Father gave himself the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

by a Vessel of <hi>Lisbon</hi> which was
just in a readiness to set sail. The first
was to the King of <hi>Portugal, Iohn</hi> the

Counsels, concerning the duties of a
King, he advertis'd him a-new, that his

the evil Government of his Ministers, and
that one day an account must be given

establishment of our Faith. On the one side
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48349:166"/>
the Zeal of God's service, and his glory,
encourag'd me to write to you; on the other,
I was diverted from that resolution, by the
fear I had of writing to no purpose. But
at the same time, I concluded that I cou'd
not be silent, without betraying my Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Function: and it also seem'd to me,
that God gave me not those thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some particular design; which probably
was, that I might communicate them to
your Majesty, and this Opinion, as the more
likely, has at length prevail'd with me. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
I always fear'd, that if I shou'd
freely give you all my thoughts, my Letter
wou'd only serve for Evidence against you,
at the hour of your death, and wou'd aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against your Majesty the rigour of the
last Iudgement, by taking from you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of ignorance. These considerations
gave me great anxieties, and your Majesty
will easily believe me. For in fine, my heart
will answer for me, that I desire not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all my strength, or even my life it
self for the Conversion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> out
of any other prospect, than to free your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Conscience, as much as in me lies,
and to render the last Iudgement less ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to you. I do in this but that which
is my duty; and the particular affection
which you bear our Society, well deserves,
that I shou'd sacrifice my self for you.</p>

After he had inform'd his Majesty, how
much the jealousies and secret divisions
of his Officers, had hinder'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the Gospel, he declares, that he
cou'd wish the King wou'd bind himself
by a solemn Oath, to punish severely,
whosoever they shou'd be, who shou'd
occasion any prejudice to the farther
propagation of Faith in the <hi>Indies.</hi> And

had the authority in their hands, were
made sensible, that their faults shou'd not
escape punishment, the whole Isle of
<hi>Ceylan,</hi> all Cape <hi>Comorine,</hi> and many
Kings of <hi>Malabar</hi> wou'd receive Baptism
in the space of one year; that as many

of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and make profession
of his Doctrine, if those Ministers of

you, that your Fortresses are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream

to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> who are there in
Garrison, and to the new Christians esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
in the Towns and Villages depending
on them. I speak by experience; and that
which I have seen with my own eyes, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
me to write concerning it. Being at
<hi>Malacca,</hi> and at the <hi>Molucca's,</hi> I Preach'd
every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and all Saints days twice;
and was forc'd upon it; because I saw the
Souldiers and People had great need of
being frequently taught the word of God.</p>
            <p>I Preach'd then, in the morning to the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> at Mass: I went again into
the Pulpit, in the afternoon, and instructed
their Children, their Slaves and Idolaters
newly converted, accommodating my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to the measure of their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and expounding to them the Principle
Points of Christian Doctrine, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Besides which, one day in the week,
I assembled in the Church, the Wives of
the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and Catechis'd them on
the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> on the <hi>Sacraments
of Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Much
fruit wou'd be gather'd in few years, if
the same method mere constantly observ'd
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48349:168"/>
in all places. I preach'd also, every day,
in the Fortresses, the Principles of Religion,
to the Sons and Daughters of the Souldiers,
to their Servants of both Sexes; in fine,
to the Natives of the Country, who were
born Christians: and these Instructions had
so good effect, that they totally renounc'd
the Superstitions and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rceries, which were

            <p>I descend into all these petty circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to the end your Majesty may judge,
according to your prudence, what number
of Preachers may be necessary here; and
that you may not forget to send many to
us. For if the Ministry of Preaching, be
not more exercis'd amongst us, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

I shou'd counsel him, I say, to ask of God,

these dreadful words, <hi>Give an account of

was full of consolation to them.</p>
            <p>In the height of the Tempest, <hi>said he in
his Letter,</hi> I took for my Intercessours
with God, the living persons of our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with all those who are well affected to
it; and join'd to these, all Christians, that
I might be assisted with the merits of the
Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> the holy Catholick Church,
whose Prayers are heard in Heaven, though
her Habitation be on Earth. Afterwards
I address'd my self to the Dead, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to <hi>Piere le Fevre,</hi> to appease the
wrath of God. I went through all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Angels, and the Saints, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
them all. But to the end, that I
might the more easily obtain the pardon of
my innumerable sins, I desir'd for my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectress
and Patroness, the most holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Queen of Heaven, who
without difficulty obtains from her beloved
Son, whatsoever she requests. In conclusion,
having repos'd all my hope in the infinite
merits of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus

I enjoy'd a greater satisfaction, in

            <p>In very truth, being as I am, the worst
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48349:169"/>
of all Men, I am asham'd to have shed so
many tears of joy, through an excess of
heavenly pleasure; when I was just upon the
point of perishing. Insomuch, that I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
pray'd our Lord, that he wou'd not
free me from the danger of my Shipwrack,
unless it were to reserve me for greater
dangers, to his own Glory and his Service.
For what remains, God has often shewn me
by an inward discovery, from how many
perils and sufferings I have been deliver'd,
by the Prayers, and Sacrifices, of those of
the Society; both such as labour here on
Earth, and such who enjoy the fruits of
their labours in the Heavens. When I
have once begun the mention of our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I can never leave; but the departure of
the Vessels constrains me to break off:
and behold what I have judg'd most proper
for the conclusion of my Letter. If I ever
forget thee, O Society of <hi>Jesus,</hi> let my right
hand be unprofitable to me, and may I even
forget the use of it. <hi>Si oblitus unquam

that since, during the course of this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

the <hi>Pagans,</hi> neither wou'd they leave it
without S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pulture; but buried it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

and set up a Cross over the Grave.</p>
            <p>Though these Infidels, whom they
serv'd, did not hinder them from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
in Christianity, and that every one
of them in particular, was resolv'd to
persevere in his Faith, even in the midst
of Idolatry, yet they had a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to return into the company of the
Faithful, where they might be supply'd
with those Spiritual Succours, which they
wanted, and lead a life yet more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to their Belief. So, that as soon
as they had the news of Father <hi>Xavier</hi>'s
return, who had baptis'd the greatest
part of them, they came to desire him,
That he wou'd make their peace with
their Masters, whom they had left to
free themselves from slavery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
that they were content, once more
to lose their Liberty in prospect of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48349:171"/>
Salvation of their Souls. <hi>Xavier</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them with open Arms, as his well-belov'd
Children, and afterwards obtain'd
their Pardon.</p>
            <p>After he had visited all the Villages,
he made some stay at <hi>Manapar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He stays at <hi>Manapar,</hi> and what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd there.</note> which is
not far distant from <hi>Cape Comorine.</hi> As
the only end, which he propos'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
was to plant the Gospel in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
and that in order to it, he must
there establish the Society, he began to
regulate all things, according to the
Principles, and in the Spirit of Father
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> General of the Order. Having
reassembled all the Labourers in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
of that Coast, he examin'd their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Talents, and Vertues, in familiar
conversation with them, by causing them
to give an account of what pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and them in their own Hearts.
After he had assign'd to each of them,
the places which were most convenient
for them, both in regard of their bodily
strength, and of their spiritual endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
He constituted Father <hi>Antonio
Criminal,</hi> superiour of all the rest: And
to the end they might be more capable
of serving that people, he order'd every
one of them, with all possible care, to
apply himself to the study of the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>
Language; which obtains through
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48349:172"/>
all that Coast. Upon this account he
commanded Father <hi>Francis Henriquez,</hi> to
reduce that Tongue into the Rules of Art,
and to compose an exact Grammar of it,
according to the method of the Greek
and Latin Grammars. The work seem'd
impossible, especially to one, who was
newly come from <hi>Europe,</hi> and who had
little knowledge in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongues:
Nevertheless <hi>Henriquez</hi> compass'd it in a
small time, which was apparently a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of Obedience. In the mean while,
<hi>Xavier</hi> judging, that the Exposition of
the Christian Doctrine, which he had
made for those of <hi>Molucca,</hi> might be of use
to his dear <hi>Paravas,</hi> order'd a <hi>Malabar</hi>
Priest, who was well vers'd in the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese,</hi>
to translate it into his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
But to the end that the conduct
of the Missioners might be Uniform, and
that the same Spirit might animate all of
them, besides the instructions which he
gave them by word of Mouth, he gave
them the following Rules in writing.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">The Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hing Coast.</hi>
               </note> Where ever the lot of
your Ministry shall fall, be mindful of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
Infants newly born; and perform it
your selves, without trusting the care of it,
to any other person. There is nothing at
present, of more importance. Do not wait
till the Parents bid you come; as they may
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48349:172"/>
easily neglect it, it behoves you to run
through all the Villages, to enter into the
Houses, and to Christen all the Infants
you can find.</p>
            <p>After the great concernment of giving
Baptism, you ought to be careful of nothing
more, than of entring those little Children
into the principles of Faith, who are grown
capable of Instruction. Not being able to
be in all places, you shall cause the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capoles,</hi>
and the Teachers of the Catechism,
to perform their duty, and religiously to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Customs establish'd. To which
purposes, when you visit the Villages, to
take an account of what passes there, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Masters, with their Scholars, and
know from the Children, in the presence of
those who are accustom'd to instruct them,
what they have learnt, or forgotten since
your last visit; this will double the ardency
of the Scholars, and the diligence of their
Teachers.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sundays,</hi> gather the Men together in
the Church, to repeat their Prayers, and
observe well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the <hi>Pantagatins,</hi> or
chief of the people are there present. You
are to expound the Prayers which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat;
and reprove them for the Vices then
in fashion: which you are to make them
comprehend by using familiar Examples.
In fine, you are to threaten the more stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48349:173"/>
sinners with the wrath of God; and
tell them, that if they do not reform their
lives, their days shall be shorten'd, by all
manner of Diseases: that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Kings
shall inslave them, and that their immortal
Souls shall become fuel to the everlasting
flames of Hell.</p>
            <p>When you come to any place, you shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
your selves, what quarrels are stirring
in it, and who are the parties; after which
you shall endeavour to reconcile them.
These Reconciliations are to be made in the
Church, where it will be fitting to assemble
all the Women on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> as the Men on
<hi>Sundays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Malabar</hi> Priest, shall have

to be carefully read to the Women on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays,</hi>
to the Men on <hi>Sundays.</hi> If you
are there present, you shall read it your
selves, and add to the Exposition, what

            <p>Distribute to the Poor those Collections
which are made for them in the Churches,
by the Charity of the Congregation; and
beware of taking any part of them for your
own uses.</p>
            <p>Fail not every <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi>
to put the Faithful in mind, of giving you
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48349:173"/>
notice, when any one falls sick, to the end
you may visit them. And give them to
know, that if they do not advertise you,
and that the sick person dies, you will not
allow him burial amongst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christians, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their neglect.</p>
            <p>When you visit the sick, take especial
care that they repeat to you, the <hi>Apostles
Creed</hi> in their Mother Tongue. Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
them on every Article and ask them,
if they believe sincerely. After this make
them say the <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Prayers, and then read the Gospel
over them.</p>
            <p>For the burial of the dead, you shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Children, and coming out of the
Church with them, the Cross being at the
head of the Procession, you shall sing the
Christian Doctrine, coming and going. You
shall say the Prayers of the Church, at the
House of the dead person; and before he is
put into the ground. You shall also make a
short Exhortation to the Assembly, before
the Corps, upon the necessity of death, the
amendment of life, and the practice of
Vertue.</p>
            <p>You shall give notice to the Men on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and to the Women on <hi>Saturday,</hi> to
bring their sick Children into the Church,
that you may read the Gospel over them, for
their cure; and that the Parents from
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48349:174"/>
thence may receive increase of Faith, and
respect to the Temples of our Lord.</p>
            <p>You shall your selves determine all liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
causes; and if you cannot end them
on the place, defer them to the next <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi>
and after Divine Service cause them
to be expedited by the principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the place. Yet I will not that
these sort of Affairs, shou'd take up too
much of your time: Nor, that you prefer
the care of your Neighbour's temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
before works of Charity, which
respect the Salvation of Souls; and am of
opinion, That when any important business
of that kind shall happen, you shou'd remit
it to the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Commandant.</p>
            <p>Do all things in your power, to make your
selves belov'd by those people; for by that
you will be able to do more good upon them,
than by being fear'd. Decree no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against any person, but by the advice
of Father <hi>Antonio Criminal:</hi> And if the
Commandant of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> be present,
do nothing without his order. In case any
Man or Woman, shall make a <hi>Pagod,</hi> or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol,
banish them from the Village if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Criminal</hi> consent to it. Testify great
affection to the Children who frequent the
Christian Schools; pardon, and wink at their
faults sometimes, lest a severe usage shou'd
fright them from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:48349:174"/>
In presence of a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> abstain from
reproving and condemning the Natives of
the Countrey, who are Christians; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
commend and excuse them, on all
occasions. For considering how lately they
have embrac'd the Faith, and what assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is wanting to them, to live like good
Christians, 'tis only to be admir'd, that they
are not more vicious.</p>
            <p>Be serviceable in all you can to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar</hi>
Priests, in what relates to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Advantage: take care that they confess
themselves, and say Mass, and give good
Examples, and write nothing against them
to any person whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Live so well with the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants,
that no misunderstanding be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perceiv'd betwixt you, and them. For
the rest of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> use all sort of
means, to make them your Friends: Have
never any quarrel with any of them, though
they shou'd bring you into Law, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with you without the least provocation
on your part. If they use the new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
hardly, oppose them, but with much
mildness; and if you find your opposition
may be likely to succeed, make your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Commandant; with
whom, I once again beseech you, never to
have any difference.</p>

succeeded with him. When he had gain'd
the affection of <hi>Segueyra,</hi> he spoke to
him of Eternity, with so much power,
that the young Gentleman, entred into
serious thoughts, and made a general
Confession to him. <hi>Xavier,</hi> to ingage
him the more in the ways of Goodness,
and to free him from that confinement
of the Hospital, where his Crimes had
forc'd him to take Sanctuary, made up
the business with his Adversaries, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his pardon from the Governour of
<hi>Malacca:</hi> But seeing the soft and dissolute
manner of living in <hi>Malacca,</hi> was capable
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48349:177"/>
of ruining all his good intentions, he
advis'd him to leave the <hi>Indies,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Europe. Segueyra,</hi> who was sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his own weakness, and desir'd to
save his Soul, promis'd the Father to obey
him, and put himself into a condition,
of executing his promise. In effect he
took the way of <hi>Goa,</hi> with design from
thence to go for <hi>Portugal.</hi> But being
made a Receiver of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
by the Viceroy <hi>Don Iohn de
Castro,</hi> he thought no more of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
but relaps'd into his first Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi> was wholly lost to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
when he happen'd to meet
him at <hi>Bazain,</hi> the sight of the Father
surpris'd him at first, and almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
him. But straight recovering,
he came up boldly to him, and took his
hand, to have kissed it according to his
former custom. The Father as courteous
and civil as he was, yet thrust him back,

            <p>The <hi>Portuguese,</hi> in great disorder, and
not knowing how to excuse himself;
laid all the blame upon the Governour,
who had detain'd him, in some sort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

his will. <hi>But,</hi> reply'd <hi>Xavier</hi> with
a holy indignation, <hi>is it the Governour
who has oblig'd you to lead the life of a
Beast, and to continue for two years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <hi>Don Iohn de Castro,</hi> who was desirous
of profiting by the Father's Counsels,

of the greatest Wits, and most knowing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48349:178"/>
Persons of that Age. <hi>Torrez,</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
on the Fleet, which came from
<hi>Mexico</hi> to the <hi>Molucca</hi> Islands; and which,
having sail'd over so many Seas, to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose, stay'd at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> as we
have already related. He there met
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and was so charm'd with his
manner of life, that he had thoughts of
becoming his Disciple. But besides, that
the labours which are unseparable from
the Ministry Apostolical, somewhat
shock'd him, he judg'd, that he ought
to undertake nothing, but by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the Bishop of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>Amboyna,</hi> without
forming any resolution, and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
opening himself to Father <hi>Xavier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was arriv'd at
<hi>Goa,</hi> he presented himself to the Bishop,
who being in want of Spiritual Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
gave him one of the chief Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riats
of his Diocess. <hi>Torrez</hi> was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that God requir'd nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of him; and for the space of four
or five months, perform'd all the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of that Office, which the Bishop
had given him in charge. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
disquiets of his Soul, render'd him
suspitious of his own condition, and
brought him to believe, that God had
punish'd him, for not following the new
Apostle of the East.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:48349:179"/>
Being one day, much troubled in his
mind, he went to the Colledge of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and open'd himself to Father <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilotti,</hi>
desiring him, to unfold to him
the nature of that Institute, with which
he was so much taken, by seeing Father
<hi>Xavier</hi> at <hi>Amboyna.</hi> As some interiour
motions had of late, push'd him on, to
the performance of somewhat that was
great, and of suffering all things for the
glory of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> he found the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> so conformable to the
present dispositions of his Soul, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
farther ballancing the matter, he was
resolv'd to go through the Spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it himself for the change of
his condition. From the second day,
he receiv'd such light, and so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from above, that he believ'd himself
in Heaven already. He cou'd not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admire, that those plain, and
easy truths, which he had often read,
without any taste of them, shou'd make
such lively impressions in him, as now
they did. And he discover'd this to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilotti,</hi>
with expressions full of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless being assrighted at the
prospect of a perpetual ingagement, and
perhaps tempted by the Devil, he cou'd
not settle to it, and was every day, more
and more irresolute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:48349:179"/>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> arriv'd just at that point of
time. He had scarcely seen <hi>Torrez,</hi> when
behold a man, fix'd on the sudden, and
resolv'd, and pressing to be receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Children of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The
Apostle receiv'd him, and took pains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to form him, according to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Society. He also admitted
some <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who had great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
for the Mission, and were inflam'd
with the zeal of Souls.</p>
            <p>They liv'd together in the Colledge
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervour reign'd,
not only amongst the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> but also
amongst those of the Seminary, whose
numbers increas'd daily. The <hi>Iaponnese,
Anger,</hi> was amongst them, leading a
most regular life, and breathing after
that Baptism, which had been deferr'd
'till the return of the Holy man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> did not satisfie himself,<note place="margin">He instructs <hi>Anger</hi> a new, and causes him to be farther taught by <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez.</hi>
               </note> with
having instructed him anew: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
over to the care of <hi>Torrez,</hi> who
fully explain'd to him all the Mysteries
of Faith. <hi>Anger</hi> with his two Servants,
who receiv'd the same instruction, were
at length solemnly Baptis'd, on <hi>Whit-Sunday,</hi>
by the Bishop of <hi>Goa, Don Iohn
d' Albuquerque;</hi> so, that the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to take possession of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Nation in the World, on the same
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48349:180"/>
day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when the holy Spirit
descending on the Apostles, gave them
their Mission to carry the Gospel, to all
the People of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anger</hi> was desirous to be nam'd <hi>Paul
de Sainte Foy,</hi> in memory of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
belonging to the <hi>Society of Iesus,</hi>
where he had receiv'd the particular
knowledge of the Divine Law, which
was sometimes call'd the <hi>Colledge of St.</hi>
Paul, and sometimes the <hi>Seminary of the
Holy Faith.</hi> One of his Servants took
the Name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi>
In receiving Baptism, he receiv'd
the peace of Soul, which he never cou'd
obtain before; and writ word of it to
<hi>Rome,</hi> the same year, in a Letter to
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> dated <hi>November</hi> the
<hi>25th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the end, that the new Converts
might have the true Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Morality, and that their behaviour
might be answerable to their Belief, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Xavier</hi> intrusted <hi>Torrez,</hi> with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them the spiritual Exercises of the
Society.</p>
            <p>During the thirty days, that these <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponians</hi>
were in retirement, 'tis not to be
express'd, what Coelestial illuminations,
what holy thoughts, what interiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
the Holy Spirit infus'd into them.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48349:180"/>
               <hi>Anger</hi> cou'd speak of nothing but of God;
and spoke of him with so much serven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that it seem'd even to burn him up.
The Mystery of the Passion, mov'd him
above all the rest, and he was so ravish'd
with the goodness of God, so possess'd
with love, in considering a God Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
that he breath'd nothing but Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
and the Salvation of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
So that he was often heard to
cry out, in the midst of his Devotions,
<hi>How glad shou'd I be to dye for thee, O
my God. O my dear</hi> Japonians, <hi>how much
are you to be lamented, and what Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
do you raise in me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Master and Servants came out of
their retirement with so much ardour,
that <hi>Xavier</hi> wrote into <hi>Europe,</hi> that
he was animated by their Example to
the service of God, and that he cou'd not
look on them, without blushing at his
own Cowardise.</p>
            <p>In conversing with them,<note place="margin">He hears news from <hi>

what he had formerly learnt by

               </hi> and other
<hi>Portugueses,</hi> that the Empire of <hi>Iapan,</hi>
was one of the most populous in the
World: That the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
curious, and covetous of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and withall docible, and of great
Capacity. That being generally inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48349:181"/>
and very rational, if they were
instructed in the Morals of Christianity,
they wou'd easily submit to them; and
that if the Preachers of the Gospel, liv'd
according to Gospel Rules, the whole
Nation wou'd subject it self to the yoke
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> not perhaps so readily at
first, but in process of time, and after
clearing of their doubts.</p>
            <p>There needed no more, to induce
<hi>Xavier</hi> to carry the Faith into <hi>Iapan,</hi>
the mildness, the civility, and the good
parts of the three Baptis'd <hi>Iaponians,</hi>
made him conceive a high opinion of
all the rest: And the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
newly return'd from <hi>Iapan,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
it so fully to him, that in these
three, he had the pattern of the whole
Nation, that he doubted not, but that
the Christian Religion wou'd make an
admirable progress there. But that which
<hi>Anger</hi> told him, that there were in his
Country many Monasteries of <hi>Heathen</hi>
Priests, that some of them led their
lives in solitude and contemplation, that
every Monastery had its Superiour, who
was a Person venerable for his Age and
Learning: that they came abroad from
their lonely abode, once a week, with
morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i'd looks, and uncouth habits, to
Preach to the People; that in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48349:181"/>
they drew such lively Figures of
Hell, that the Women wept, and cry'd
out, at those dismal representations. All
this, I say, appear'd to <hi>Xavier,</hi> as so
many doors, and in-letts for the Faith;
and he prais'd God, that by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conduct of his Providence, which
secretly manages the Salvation of men,
the Spirit of Lyes, had thus prepar'd the
ways for the Spirit of Truth.</p>
            <p>He ador'd also the wisdom of the same
Providence, which taking the occasion
of a man who fled from Justice, and
sought repose for his troubled Conscience,
had led three <hi>Iaponians</hi> from their native
Country, and brought them to <hi>Goa,</hi> that
they might serve for Guides to a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner.
But, that these Guides might
be the more serviceable, he thought fit
they shou'd learn to Read and Write,
in the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Language. <hi>Anger,</hi> whom
from henceforth we shall name <hi>Paul de
Sainte Foy,</hi> was easily instructed, in all
they taught him; for besides that he
was of a quick and lively apprehension,
he had so happy a memory, that he
got by heart almost all the <hi>Gospel of
St.</hi> Matthew, which Father <hi>Cosmo de
Torrez,</hi> had Expounded to him before
his Baptism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:48349:182"/>
In the mean time <hi>Don Iohn de Castro,</hi>
was rigging out a Fleet, with design
to possess himself of <hi>Aden,</hi> one of the
strongest Towns of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and
scituate at the foot of a high Mountain,
which reach'd even to the Sea, by a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
tongue of Earth. This Port is of
great importance, to shut up the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the <hi>Indies</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi>
who go thither by the red Sea;
and from this consideration it was, that
<hi>Albuquerque</hi> the Great, endeavour'd to
have Master'd it in the year 1513, but
the vigorous resistance of the <hi>Achenois</hi>
forc'd him to forsake the Siege. After
that time, they were desirous of their
own accord, to have deliver'd it up to
the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> thereby to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the tyranny of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
Yet it was not then done, through the
fault of a Captain call'd <hi>Soarez,</hi> who
having no Orders to take Possession of
the Town, was so weak a Politician as
to refuse it, when it was offer'd to the
Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That People, whom the <hi>Turk</hi> us'd
worse than ever, testifi'd the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
under the Government of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro,</hi>
and it was on that occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
he sent a Fleet towards the Streight of
<hi>Mecca,</hi> under the Command of his Son,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48349:182"/>
               <hi>Alvarez de Castro.</hi> Eight Foysts of <hi>Goa,</hi>
full of Souldiers, set out for the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Aden.</hi> Amongst these there was
one very brave Fellow, renown'd for his
Military Actions, but blacken'd with all
sorts of Crimes, and more infamous by
his Debauch'd Manners, than known by
his Valour. He seem'd a kind of salvage
Beast, who had no more of Man in him,
than the bare Figure, nor any thing of
a Christian, besides the name. Above
eighteen years he had abstain'd from
Confession; and that he once presented
himself to the Bishop of <hi>Goa,</hi> was less
to reconcile himself to God, than to
take off the imputation, of being either
a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or an <hi>Idolater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> had cast an eye upon
this wretch,<note place="margin">He undertakes the Conversion of a Souldier.</note> and waited only an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to labour in so difficult a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
Understanding that this Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
was imbarking on one of the Foysts,
which were going to joyn the Fleet, he
went out of the Colledge of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at
the first notice of it, taking nothing
with him, besides his <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>viary,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the same Vessel. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by those who saw the Father, that
he had Orders from the Viceroy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
his Son <hi>Alvarez,</hi> and every
one was glad of it, excepting only he,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48349:183"/>
for whose sake he came. He drew near
the Souldier, and when they had weigh'd
Anchor, began to make acquaintance
with him, and grew familiar to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that the rest of the Souldiers, who
were less debauch'd, cou'd not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admire it, and some of them said of
<hi>Xavier,</hi> what a <hi>Pharisee</hi> said formerly
of our Lord, <hi>If this Man were indeed a
Prophet, he wou'd discern what manner of
man he was, in whom he takes so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Discourses, did not at all daunt
the Father. He saw his Souldier playing
whole nights together, for he was a great
Gamester. He took no notice of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
and sometimes heard him
Swear without seeming to regard it.
Only one day he said to him, that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
requir'd a Compos'd Spirit, and if
he took not the better heed, that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which he had in Play, wou'd make
him lose.</p>
            <p>The Souldier, brutal as he was, grew
insensibly to have a kindness for a man,
who was so much concern'd in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and took pleasure in hearing
him discourse not only of War, and Sea
Affairs, but also of Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
In conclusion, he made some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the horrour of his life, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48349:183"/>
felt even some remorse of Conscience
for it. Being one day together with the
Father, in a private part of the Ship,
<hi>Xavier</hi> ask'd him, to whom he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
himself before he went on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board?
Ah Father, said the Souldier, I
have not been at Confession these many
years. And what do you imagine wou'd
become of you, said the holy man, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
you shou'd be kill'd in this action,
and in the condition you now are? I
wou'd once have Confess'd my self, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Souldier, at least for fashion,
and decency, but the Vicar of <hi>Goa</hi> wou'd
not so much as hear me, but told me I
was a Reprobate, and deserv'd nothing
but Hell-Fire. The Vicar was, in my
Opinion, said <hi>Xavier,</hi> somewhat too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
to treat you in that manner. He
had perhaps his Reasons for that usage,
and I have mine to treat you otherwise.
For indeed the Mercies of our Lord are
infinite, and God wou'd have us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to our Brethren, as he himself is
to us: Thus, when the Sins of which
you find your self guilty, were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

to a general Confession,<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

his memory his past life, and drawing
him into the particulars of those Sins,
which a man of his Character and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
might possibly have committed.
While they were upon these terms, the

for refreshment. Many of the Fleet
went on shore, and amongst the rest,
the Father and the Souldier, they went
together to a wild solitary place: there
the Souldier made his Confession with
abundance of tears, resolv'd to expiate
his Crimes, with whatsoever Penance

never so rigorous. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ave</hi> to say. Whereat the Penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much amaz'd, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
it, my Father, said he, that being
so great a Sinner as I am, you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me so light a Penance? Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
answer'd <hi>Xavier,</hi> O my Son, we
shall appease the Divine Justice: and at
the same instant, he withdrew into a
Wood, while the Souldier perform'd his
Penance. There he did, what he had
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48349:184"/>
formerly done on the like occasion: he
bar'd his Shoulders, and disciplin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so rigorously, that the Souldier heard
the noise of the strokes, and came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him, beholding the Father all
in blood, and rightly judging what was
the motive of so strange an action, he
snatch'd the Discipline out of his hands,
and crying out, it was the Criminal who
ought to endure the punishment, and
not the innocent to bear the pains of
Sin; he immediately strip'd himself, and
chastis'd his body with all his strength.
<hi>Xavier</hi> often-times embrac'd him, and
declar'd, that it was for his sake alone
that he came on Ship-board. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him wholsome Admonitions
to confirm him in the Grace of God, he
left him, and return'd to <hi>Goa</hi> on the first
Vessel which went out of the Port, where
they made the stay. As for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
he follow'd the Fleet, and after
the Expedition of <hi>Aden</hi> was ended, he
enter'd into Religion, chusing one of
the most austere Orders, where he liv'd
and dy'd, in extraordinary holiness.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Father was return'd
to <hi>Goa,</hi>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48349:185"/>
himself in a daily decay of health
and strength, and doubting not the end
of his life was near approaching, he quiet
laid aside all business, and substituted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to supply his place. After which
his thoughts were wholly employ'd on
death, and the great concernments of
Eternity. He had many long conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and refus'd to see any one but him.
During these Transactions, a Ship, which
came from <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> brought Letters to
the Viceroy from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
who gave great praises to his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and continu'd him for three years
longer, in the Government of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
As <hi>Don John</hi> was much belov'd,
so on this occasion, publick rejoycings
were made over all the Town. But the
Sick Viceroy, hearing the discharge of
the Artillery, and seeing almost from his
Bed the Bonefires that were made, cou'd
not forbear laughing at it, though he was
almost in the agonies of death. <hi>How
deceitful and ridiculous is this World,</hi> said
he, <hi>to present us with honours of three
years continuance, when we have but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more to live!</hi> The Father assisted
him, even to the last drawing of his
breath, and had the consolation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a great man of this world, expiring
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48349:185"/>
with the thoughts of a Saint in Holy
Orders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> being Master of himself, in
some manner, after the decease of <hi>Don
Iohn de Castro,</hi> who had desir'd him not
to stir from <hi>Goa,</hi> during the Winter, had
thoughts of visiting once more the Coast
of <hi>Fishery,</hi> before his Voyage to <hi>Iapan;</hi>
his resolutions of which, he had not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
declar'd. But the incommodities
of the season hinder'd him; for at one
certain time, the Sands so choke up the
Channels of the Isle, that no Ship can
either go out of the Port, or enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>In waiting 'till the Navigation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
free;<note place="margin">He applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more than ever to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Life.</note> the Saint apply'd himself par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to the exercises of a Spiritual
Life, as it were to recover new strength
after his past Labours, according to the
custom of Apostolical men, who in

with God, refresh themselves, after the
pains which they have taken with their
Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that in the Garden of
<hi>Saint Paul's Colledge,</hi> sometimes in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at other times in retiring into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

               </gap>lames which burnt within him,

gave us to understand, that he wou'd

hinder him from the labours of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Vocation, nor from succouring the
distrest, in the Hospitals and Prisons.
On the contrary, the more lively and
ardent the love of God was in him, the
more desirous he was, to bring it forth,
and kindle it in others. His Charity
caus'd him often to relinquish the quiet
of Solitude, and the delights of Prayer;
therein following the Principle of his
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that it was necessary to
forsake God for God.</p>

and <hi>Xavier</hi> was disposing himself
to set Sail for the Cape of <hi>Comorine,</hi> when
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48349:186"/>
a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Vessel arriv'd from <hi>Mozam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi>
which brought in her, five Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Society. The most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
of these Missioners, and of five o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which came along with the Fleet,
was <hi>Gaspar Barzeus,</hi> a <hi>Flemming</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Father <hi>Francis,</hi> had already heard
speak of him, as an excellent Labourer,
and a famous Preacher; but his Presence
and the Testimony of all the Ship, gave the
Saint such great Idea's of his Merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
he look'd on him from thence forward,
as an Apostle of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries.</p>
            <p>He pass'd five days with these new
Companions, on the fourth of which, he
caus'd Father <hi>Gaspar</hi> to preach before
him, that he might see his Talent for
the Pulpit; and discover'd in him all the
Qualities of a perfect Preacher. Many
<hi>Portuguese</hi> Gentlemen, who had been
much edify'd, by the Vertues and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of <hi>Barzeus</hi> during all the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
which had been exceeding dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
came and fell at the Feet o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one of the chief Citadels, which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
enjoy in <hi>India,</hi> were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
He admitted some of them before
his departure, and deferr'd the rest till
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48349:187"/>
his return: but he wou'd that all of them
shou'd perform the Spiritual Exercises of

There he comforted and confirm'd the

Enemies of the Christian
name. He also encourag'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Labourers of the Society, who for
the same reason, went in daily hazard
of their lives. Having understood, that
Father <hi>Francis Henriquez,</hi> who cultivated
the Christianity of <hi>Travancor,</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dissatisfy'd, and believ'd he lost his
time, because some of those new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
shaken either by the Promises or
Threatnings of a new King, who hated
the Christians, had return'd to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Superstitions, he writ him Letters
of Consolation, desiring him to be of
good courage, and assuring him, that
his Labours were more profitable than
he imagin'd: that when all the Fruit of
his Zeal, shou'd be reduc'd to the little
Children who dy'd after Baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God
wou'd be well satisfy'd of his endeavours,
and that after all, the Salvation of one

for all his pains; that God account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with us for our good intentions, and
that a Servant of his, was never to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
unprofitable, who labour'd in his
Vineyard, with all his strength, whatever
his success might prove.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was not content, to
have fortify'd the Missioners, both by
word and writing in his own person, he
desir'd of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he wou'd
also encourage them with his Epistles;
and principally, that he wou'd have the
goodness to write to <hi>Henry Henriquez,</hi> a

whom <hi>Don Iohn de Castro,</hi> had nam'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The Father was desirous to obtain his
Letters of Recommendation to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Malacca.</hi> that in vertue of
them his passage to <hi>Iapan,</hi> might be made
more easy.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the news he receiv'd, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48349:188"/>
the <hi>Chinois,</hi> ill satisfy'd of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi>

seem'd to have broken all his Measures,

and it was known that he design'd a

length of the way, which was thirteen
hundred Leagues: The certain and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
dangers, to which he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his life, not only by reason of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
which continually infest those

remaining, and Territories of Idolaters:
That he might go thither in Gods name,

For those Letters, which you shall write to
those unwearied Labourers, who bear the

that you can; for preaching is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
good; and amongst all Evangelical
Employments, there is none more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but beware of advancing any doubtful
propositions, on which the Doctors are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Take for the Subject of your Sermons,
clear and unquestionable truths, which tend
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48349:193"/>
of themselves to the regulation of manners.
Set forth the enormity of Sin, by setting
up, that infinite Majesty, which is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sinner. Imprint in Souls, a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
horrour of that Sentence, which shall be
thunder'd out against Reprobates at the last
Iudgment. Represent with all the colours
of your Eloquence, those pains which the
damn'd are eternally to suffer. In fine,
threaten with death, and that with sudden
death, those who neglect their Salvation;
and who having their Conscience loaded
with many Sins, yet sleep in security, as if
they had no cause of fear.</p>
            <p>You are to mingle with all these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
that of the Cross, and the death of
the Saviour of Mankind; but you are to do
it, in a moving pathetical manner; by those
figures, which are proper to excite such
motions, as cause in our Hearts a deep sorrow
for our Sins, in the presence of an offended
God, even to draw Tears from the Eyes of
your Audience. This is the Idea, which I wish
you wou'd propose to your self, for preaching
profitably.</p>
            <p>When you reprove Vices in the Pulpit,<note place="margin">He institutes him in the way of correcting Sinners.</note>
never characterise any person, especially the
chief Officers, or Magistrates. If they do
any thing which you disapprove, and of
which you think convenient to admonish
them; make them a visit, and speak to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48349:194"/>
them in private, or, when they come of
themselves to Confession, tell them at the
sacred Tribunal of Penance, what you have
to say to them; but never advertise them
in publick of it: for that sort of People,
who are commonly proud and nice of hearing,
instead of amendment by publick admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
become furious, like Bulls, who are
prick'd forward by a Goad: Moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you take upon you, to give them private
admonition, be careful to enter first into their
acquaintance, and familiarity.</p>
            <p>Make your admonition, either more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or more strong, according as you have
more or less access to them. But always
moderate the roughest part of your Reproof,
with the gaiety of your Air, and a smiling
Countenance, by the civility of well-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd
words, and a sincere protestation, that
all you do, is but an effect of the kindness
you have for them. 'Tis good also to add
respectful submissions to the pleasingness of
your Discourse, with tender Embraces, and
all the marks of that Consideration and good
Will you have for the person of him, whom
you thus correct. For if a rigid Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and harsh Language shou'd accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reproof, which of it self, is hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
and bitter to the tast, 'tis not to be
doubted, but Men accustom'd to Flatteries,
will not endure it: and there is reason to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48349:194"/>
apprehend, that a burst of rage against the
Censor, will be all the fruit of the Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For what concerns Confession,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He prescribes him a method, for administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrament of Penance.</note> 
               <hi>behold
the method which I judge the fittest for
these Quarters of the East, where the
License of Sin is very great, and the use
of Penance very rare.</hi> When a Person,
harden'd in a long habit of Vice shall come
to Confession, exhort him to take three or
four days time of preparation, to examine
his Conscience throughly, and for the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his memory, cause him to write
down the Sins which he has observ'd in all
the Course of his Life, from his Childhood
to that present time. Being thus dispos'd,
after he has made his Confession, it will
not be convenient, that you shou'd be too
hasty in giving him absolution. But it will
be profitable to him, to retire two or three
days, and abstain from his ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and dealings with men, and to
excite himself to sorrow for his sins, in
consideration of the love of God, which will
render his Sacramental Absolution of more
efficacy to him. During that little interval
of retirement, you shall instruct him in the
way of Meditation, and shall oblige him
to make some meditations, from the first
week of Exercises. You shall counsel him
to practise some mortification of his Body;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48349:195"/>
for example, to Fast, or to Discipline him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which will help him to conceive a true
sorr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w for his offences, and to shed the
tears of Penance. Besides this, if the
Penitents have enrich'd themselves by sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
ways, or if by their malitious talk,
they have blasted the reputation of their
Neighbour, cause them to make restitution
of their ill-gotten Goods, and make repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Brethren's honour, during
the space of those three days. If they are
given to unlawful Love, and are now in
an actual commerce of Sin, cause them to
break off those Criminal ingagements, and
forsake the occasions of their Crime. There
is not any time more proper, to exact from
Sinnes those duties, the performance of
which is as necessary as it is difficult; for
when once their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervour is past away, it
will be in vain to demand of them the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their promise; and perhaps you
will have the trouble of seeing them fall
back into the Precipice, for want of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to a distance from it.</p>
            <p>In administring the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,<note place="margin">He continues to instruct him, on the Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect of Confession.</note>
take heed of discouraging those, who
begin to discover the wounds of their Souls
to you, by appearing too rashly and too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
severe. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w enormous soever their
Sins may be, hear them, not only with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
but with mildness; help out, even
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48349:195"/>
their bashfulness, by testifying to them your
compassion, and not seeming to be amaz'd at
what you hear. Insinuate into them, that
you have heard in Confession sins of a much
more crying nature: and lest they shou'd
despair of Pardon for their faults, speak
to them of the infinite Mercies of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>When they declare a crime in such a
manner, that you may perceive they are in
trouble how to speak, interrupt them, by
letting them know, that their sin is not
altogether so great as they may think: that
by God's assistance you can heal the most
mortal wounds of the Soul; bid them go on
without any apprehension, and make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of telling all. You will find some of
them, whom either the weakness of their
Age or Sex will hinder from revealing to
you their more shameful sins. When you
perceive that bashfulness has ty'd their
tongue, be before hand with them, and by
the way of a charitable prevention, let them
know, that they are neither the first, nor
the only Persons, who have fallen into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that those things which they want
the confidence to tell you, are little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of what you have heard from others,
on the same Subject. Impute some part of
their offence to the corruption of Nature,
to the violence of the Temptation, and to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48349:196"/>
the unhappiness they had to be ingag'd in
such Occasions and pressing Circumstances,
where their fall was almost unavoidable.
In fine, I must advertise you, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from such persons, that unseasonable
shame-fac'dness, which keeps them silent;
from such Persons, I say, whom the Devil
has made as bashful after a Crime, as they
were impudent before it, it may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
sometimes, to discover to them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the frailties of our own past Lives.
For what can a true and servent Charity
refuse. for the safety of those Souls who
have been redeem'd with the blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ!</hi> But to understand, when this
is proper to be done, how far to proceed,
and with what precautions, is what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Spirit, and your experience must
teach you, in those particular Conjunctures.</p>

by not frequenting it, or by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
with <hi>Pagans, Mahometans and

given them by some Christians, and
principally (which I speak with shame
and sorrow) by such Priests, whose Life
is not more holy, than that of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For, beholding some of them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the Altar, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48349:196"/>
assisting at it, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and reverence, they imagine, that
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is not, as we say he is, in

               <hi>Make it

reasons which are capable of establishing it;
and shew them, that the surest means for
them to come out of their errours, and
leave their Vices, is often to approach
that Sacrament, with suitable preparations
to it.</hi>

               <hi>Though your Penitents may be well

               <hi>think not when
they shall declare their Sins, that your
business is done.</hi> You must dive into the
bottom of their Conscience, and by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
draw out of them, what themselves
know not. Ask then of them, by what ways
and in what manner, they make advantage
of their Money: what are their Principles,
and what their Practise, in their Sails, in
their Borrowing, and in all their Business.
You shall find Vsury reigning throughout
their Traffick; and that they who have no
stings of Conscience, in relation to unjust
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48349:197"/>
dealings, have by indirect ways scrap'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the greatest part of their Estates.
But in things, where money has to do, many
are so harden'd, that being charg'd with
rapine, they have either no scruple concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, or so very light, that it never breaks
their sleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use particularly this Method, towards
the Governours, the Treasurers, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and other Officers belonging to
the Revenue.</hi> Whensoever they present
themselves before you in the Sacred Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
interrogate that sort of People, by
what means they grow so rich, what secret
they have to make their Offices and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
bring them in such mighty Sums? If
they are slye of telling you, turn and wind
them every way, and the most mildly that
you can, make them speak, in spight of
themselves. You shall soon discover their
tricks, and secret ways of management, by
which, an inconsiderable number of those
they call men of Business, divert to their
own private advantages, what was design'd
for the publick profit. They buy up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
with the King's Money, that by
selling them again, they may be able to
make up their Accompts. And by taking
up all the Commodities in the Port, they
put the people upon a necessity of buying at
their Price, that is, at most intolerable
Rates.</p>

that they may be driven to Compound with
those Sharks of State, for half their due,
and let them go off with the other half:
this open Robbery, this manifest Villany,
those Gentlemen call by a mollify'd name,
the fruits of their industry. When you
have squeez'd out of them the Confession of
these Monopolies, and the like, by wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
them, with apt questions, you will
come more easily to the knowledge of their
ungodly gains, and what they ought to make
restitution of, to their Neighbour, in order
to their being reconcil'd to God, than if in
general, you shou'd interrogate them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their injustice. For example, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of them, what persons they have
wrong'd, they will immediately answer,
that their memory upbraids them not with
wronging any man; and behold the reason!
Custom is to them, in the place of Law;
and that which they see done before them
every day, they perswade themselves may
be practis'd without Sin. As if Custom
can authorize by I know not what kind of
prescription, that which is vitious and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in its own nature. You shall admit
of no such right; but shall declare to such

in your own Person, you shall carry
to Church that Exposition of the Apostles
Creed, which I have put into your hands,
and the practice which I have compos'd,
how to pass the day in Christian duties.
You shall give Copies of that Practice, to
those whose Confessions you hear; and shall
enjoyn them for their holy Penance, to do
for certain days, that which is contain'd
in it. By this means they shall accustom
themselves to a Christian Life, and shall
come to do of their own accord, by the
force of custom, that which they did at
the first, only by the command of their
Confessour. But, foreseeing, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

it in some publick Place, that they who

point out their Design, and their Talents

you. In this last Case, after you have caus'd
them to perform the Spiritual Exercises
for a month together, you shall make a
tryal of them, in some such manner, as
may edify the People, without exposing
them to be ridiculous. Order them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to serve the Sick in the Hospitals,
and to debase themselves to the meanest,
and most distastful Offices. Make them
visit the Prisoners, and teach them how
to give comfort to the miserable. In fine,
Exercise your Novices, in all the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of humility, and mortification, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them not to appear in publick, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
habits, which may cause them
to be derided by the multitude; suffer it
not, I say, far from imposing it upon them.
Ingage not all the Novices, indifferently
to those tryals, which their nature most
abhors; but examine well the strength of
each, and sute their mortification to their
temper, to their education, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
they make in Spirituals, in such
sort, that the tryal may not be unprofitable,
but that it may produce its effect, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that measure of grace, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them. If he who directs the Novices,
has not all these considerations, it will fall
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48349:201"/>
out, that they who were capable of making
a great proficience in Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue, with good
management, will lose their courage, and
go backward. And besides, those indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
tryals, too difficult for Beginners,
take off the love of the Master from his
Novices, and cause his Disciples to lessen
their confidence in his directions. In the
mean time, whoever forms young People to
a Religious Life, ought to leave nothing
untry'd, to bring them to a candid and
free discovery of their evil inclinations,
and the suggestions of the Devil, at the
same moment, when they are tempted, for
without this, they will never be able to
disintangle themselves, from the Snares of
the Tempter; never will they arrive to a
religious perfection. On the contrary, those
first seeds of evil being brooded over, and
nourish'd, as I may say, by silence, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
produce, most lamentable effects;
even so far, 'till the Novices come to
grow weary of regular Discipline, to nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate
it, and at length throw off the yoke of
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and re-plunge themselves in
the pollutions of the World.</p>
            <p>They, amongst those young men, whom
you shall observe, to be most subject to vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
and delighted with sensual pleasures,
and other vices, ought to be cur'd, in this
following manner. Make them search for
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48349:202"/>
reasons, and for proofs, against those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to which they are inclin'd: And when
they have found many, help them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some short Discourses on them. Cause
them afterwards to pronounce those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
either to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or in the Hospitals, to those who are in a
way of recovery, so as to be present at
them, or in other places; there is reason
to hope, that the things which they have
fix'd in their Minds, by constant study,
and strong application will be at least as
profitable to themselves, as to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Doubtless they will be asham'd,
not to profit by those Remedies, which they
propose to others, and to continue in those
Vices, from which they endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
their Hearers. You shall use pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sinners, who cannot conquer themselves so
far, as they commonly say, to put away
the occasions of their Sin, or to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of those goods, which they have
gotten unlawfully, and detain unjustly from
other men. After you have indear'd your
self to them, by a familiar acquaintance,
advise them to say that to their own
Hearts, which they wou'd say to a Friend,
on the like occasion, and ingage, as it were

which he had exercis'd for thirty years,
and of all the actions of his life, he was
so struck with the horrour of immediate

was not very regular, for a man of his

that there was no forgiveness for the

               <hi>Martinez,</hi> who formerly had been very
nearly acquainted with him, seem'd to
breathe anew, at the hearing of that
name, and suddenly began to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to go see (said he) the man of
God. But the attempt he made, serv'd
only to put him into a fainting Fit. The
Father, entring at the same moment,
found him in it. It had always been his
custom, to make his first visit, to the
Ecclesiastical Superiours; but besides
this, the sickness of the Vicar, hasten'd
the Visit. When the sick man, was
come by little and little to himself, <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
began to speak to him of Eternity,
and of the conditions requisite to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
death. This discourse threw <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinez</hi>
back again, into his former ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
and the Servant of God, in this
occasion, found that to be true, which
he had often said, that nothing is more
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48349:208"/>
difficult, than to perswade a dying man
to hope well of his Salvation, who in the
course of his life, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>latter'd himself
with the hopes of it, that he might Sin
with the greater boldness.</p>
            <p>Seeing the evil to be almost past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
he undertook to do violence to
Heaven, that he might obtain for the
Sick man, the thoughts of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the grace of a religious death.
For he made a Vow upon the place, to
say a great number of <hi>Masses,</hi> in honour
of the most Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> of the Blessed
<hi>Virgin,</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> and some of the
<hi>Saints,</hi> to whom he had a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
His Vows were scarcely made,
when <hi>Martinez</hi> became calm; began to
have reasonable thoughts, and receiv'd
the last Sacraments, with a lively sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for his Sins, and a tender relyance
on Gods Mercies; after which, he dy'd
gently in the arms of <hi>Xavier,</hi> calling on
the name of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

labours of <hi>Francis Perez,</hi> and <hi>Roch

them the year before to <hi>Malacca,</hi> there
to found a Colledge of the Society, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the desire of the People, and
they had been very well receiv'd. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48349:209"/>
had begun to open a publick School,
for the instruction of the youth in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Piety, according to the Spirit
of their Institute. <hi>Oliveira</hi> had wholly
given himself to the Ministry of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the conduct of Souls, but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself more especially to the care
of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi> of which, there was
always a vast Concourse in the Town.
For the first, came expresly from <hi>Mecca,</hi>
and the last from <hi>Malabar,</hi> to endeavour

The most considerable of all, was a

<hi>Iuan Bravo;</hi> who by his noble Birth and
Valour, might justly hope to raise his
fortunes in the World. But he pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Evangelical Poverty, and Religious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
before all those earthly expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

ready to have taken Ship for <hi>Goa,</hi> there
to execute those thoughts, with which
Heaven had inspir'd him, when he was
inform'd, that <hi>Xavier</hi> wou'd take <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca</hi>
in his way. He therefore waited
for him, and in the mean time liv'd with
<hi>Perez</hi> and <hi>Oliveira,</hi> as if he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48349:209"/>
of the Society. At least he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
himself as much as he was able,
to their manners, and habited himself
like them: that is to say, instead of rich
Garments, he put on an old threed-bare
Cassock, with which he look'd the World
in the face, without having yet forsaken
it. He perform'd the Spiritual Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for a month together, and never
came out of his retirement, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
himself in works of Charity in the
Hospital: There for three months, he
attended the Sick, living in Poverty,
and begging his Bread from door to door,
even in the sight of <hi>Iames Sosa</hi> his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Admiral of the Fleet, which was
Rigging out for the <hi>Molucca's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Tryals oblig'd the Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Bravo</hi> into the Society. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him almost immediately, to take
the first Vows, and finding in him an
excellent foundation, for all the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Vertues, he took care to cultivate
him; even so far, as to leave him in

                  </note> my dear Brother, the from
of life, which you are constantly to
practise every day. In the morning, as
soon as you are awaken'd, prepare your
self to meditate on some Mystery of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48349:210"/>
our Lord; beginning from his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and continuing to his glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension;
the Subjects of the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are mark'd, and put in Order, in
the Book of Exercises. Employ at the
least half an hour in Prayers; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your self to it, with all those inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
dispositions, which you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you practis'd, in your retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a month. Consider every day
one Mystery, in such manner, that if,
for Example, on <hi>Monday,</hi> the Birth of
our Saviour, was the Subject of your
Meditation, that of his Circumcision
shall be for <hi>Tuesday;</hi> and so in course,
'till in a months time, having run
through all the actions of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
you come to contemplate him ascending
into Heaven in Triumph. You are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Month, to begin these Meditations
again, in the same order.</p>
               <p>At the end of every Meditation,
you shall renew your Vows of Poverty,
Chastity, and Obedience, to which you
have oblig'd your self. You shall make
them, I say, a-new, and offer them to
God with the same serven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you first made them. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of your Vows, will weaken in
you the motions of Concupiscence, and
render all the Powers of Hell less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48349:210"/>
of hurting you; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I am of opinion that you ought
never to omit them.</p>
               <p>After Dinner, you shall resume your
mornings Prayer, and reflect on the
same Mystery, half an hour; you shall
also renew your Vows, at the end of
your Meditation. You are to employ
your self in this manner interiourly
through all the variety of your outward
business; giving an hour in every day,
to the consideration of the most holy
life of our <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> in whatsoever
Affair, or in whatsoever Incumbrance
you are ingag'd. You may practise
this with most convenience, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
half an hour in the morning, and
another half in the afternoon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my direction.</p>
               <p>Before you lie down at night, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
well your Conscience, in calling
over your thoughts, words, and actions
of all the day; and even observing, if
you have not fail'd of doing something,
which it was your duty to have done;
let this discussion be as exact, as if you
were just ready to Confess your self.
After you have conceiv'd a most lively
sorrow for your faults, by the motive
of God's love, you shall humbly ask
Pardon of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and vow amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48349:211"/>
to him. In fine, you shall so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
your self to rest, that your sleep
may come upon you, in thoughts of
Piety, and in resolutions of passing the
next day, with greater holiness.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, at your waking,
think on the Sins which you observ'd
in the examen of the night before: and
while you are putting on your Cloaths,
ask the assistance of Gods Grace, that
you may not that day, relapse into your
yesterdays offences. Then perform your
mornings Meditation, and proceed
through your whole days work, as I
have order'd you. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> But be so punctual,
and so constant in all these spiritual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
that nothing but sickness cause
you to forbear them. For if, when you
are in health, you shou'd deferr, or leave
them off, under some pretence of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
be sure you make a scruple of it,
and let not the day pass over you, till
in the presence of your Brethren, you
confess your fault, and of your own free
motion, demand Penance, for having
omitted or neglected that which was
so strictly commanded by your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>For what remains, whatsoever you
do, or in whatsoever condition of Spirit
you may be, labour with all your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48349:211"/>
still to overcome your self. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
your Passions, embrace what is most
abhorring to your sense, repress all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
desire of Glory, most especially;
and spare not your self in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
till you have torn out of your Heart,
the very Roots of Pride; not only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
your self to be debas'd beneath
all men, but being glad to be despis'd.
For, hold this for certain, that without
this Humility and Mortification, you can
neither advance in Vertue, nor serve
your Neighbour as you ought, nor be
acceptable to God, nor, to conclude all,
persevere in the Society of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obey in all things, the Father with
whom you live; and however displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or difficult the things may be, which
he commands you, perform them with
much chearfulness, never opposing his
Orders, nor making any exceptions on
your part, on any account whatsoever.
In fine, hearken to him, and suffer your
self to be directed in all things by him,
as if Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> were personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
speaking to you, and directing
you.</p>
               <p>With whatsoever temptations you
shall find your self assaulted, discover
them all sincerely to him who governs
you; and remain perswaded, that this
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48349:212"/>
is the only means of subduing them.
Besides this advantage, there accrue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to surmount that natural shamefac'dness

               </note> there came news from <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
and some Letters reported, That one
of the Kings of that Island, had desir'd
some Preachers to be sent to him, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Embassy to the Viceroy of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
That this King had learnt somewhat of
the Christian Law, and that a strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
had made him desirous of knowing
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48349:212"/>
more. This accident was related in those
Letters, after this following manner.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants, being land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Port, belonging of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
City, of one of those Kingdoms of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
were lodg'd by the King's order, in
a forsaken House, which was thought to
be haunted by evil Spirits; the common
opinion, was not ill grounded, and the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> soon perceiv'd, that their
Lodging was disturb'd. They heard a
horrible rumbling all the night; they
felt themselves pull'd out of their Beds,
and beaten in their sleep, without seeing
any one. One night being awaken'd,
at the cry of one of their Servants, and
running with their Arms towards the
place, from whence the noise was heard,
they foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Servant on the ground,
trembling for fear. They ask'd him the
occasion of his out-cry, and why he
shook in that manner: He answer'd,
<hi>That he had seen a frightful Apparition, such
a one, as Painters use to draw for the picture
of the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> As this Servant, was not
thought either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aint-hearted, or a liar,
the <hi>Portugueses</hi> no longer doubted, what
was the meaning of all that ratling and
clutter, which they heard every night;
to put an end to it, they set Crosses in
all the Rooms, after which they heard
no more of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:48349:213"/>
The <hi>Iaponneses</hi> were much surpris'd, to
hear the House was not at quiet: The
King himself, to whom the <hi>Portugueses</hi>
had said, <hi>That the Christian Cross had
driven away the euil Spirits,</hi> admir'd that
wonderful effect, and commanded Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be set up in all places, even in his
own Palaces, and in the High-ways. In
consequence of this, he desir'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
from whence the Cross deriv'd
that Vertue? and for what cause
the Devils so much fear'd it. Thus, by
little and little, he enter'd into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Faith. But as the <hi>Iaponneses</hi>
are extreamly curious, not content to be
instructed by Souldiers and Merchants,
he thought of sending for Preachers, and
in that prospect, sent an Embassadour
to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This news gave infinite satisfaction to
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He disposes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the Voyage of <hi>Japan,</hi> more earnestly than ever.</note> and so much the more
hasten'd his Voyage, by how much, he
now perceiv'd the <hi>Iaponians</hi> were dispos'd
to receive the Gospel. There were in
the Port of <hi>Malacca,</hi> many <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Vessels, in readiness to set Sail for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
but all of them were to make many
other Voyages by the way, which was
not the Saints business. His only means,
was to have recourse to a <hi>Iunck</hi> of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
(so they call those little Vessels)
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48349:213"/>
which was bound directly for <hi>Iapan.</hi>
The Master of the Vessel, call'd <hi>Neceda,</hi>
was a famous Pirate; a Friend to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi>
notwithstanding the War which
was newly declar'd against them; so
well known by his Robberies at Sea, that
his Ship was commonly call'd, <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
Vessel. Don Pedro de Sylva,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Malacca,</hi> got a promise from the
<hi>Chines</hi> Captain, that he wou'd carry the
Father, safely, and without injury, and took
Hostages, to ingage him inviolably to keep
his Faith; but what can be built on the
word of a Pirate, and a wicked man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier,</hi>

on the twenty fourth of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the
dusk of the Evening; and set Sail the
next Morning at break of day with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Wind. When they were out
at Sea, the Captain, and Ships Crew,
who were all Idolaters, set up a <hi>Pagod</hi>
on the Poop; sacrifis'd to it in spight of
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and all his Remonstrances to
the contrary, and consulted him by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Ceremonies, concerning the success
of their Voyage. The answers were
sometimes good, and sometimes ill: In
the mean time they cast Anchor at an
Isle, and there furnish'd themselves with
Timber, against the furious gusts of those
uncertain Seas. At the same time they
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48349:214"/>
renew'd their Interrogatories to their
Idol; and cast Lotts, to know whether
they shou'd have good Winds. The Lotts
promis'd them a good passage, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Pagans</hi> pursu'd their course merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But they were no sooner got out to
Sea again, when they drew Lotts the
third time, to know, whether the <hi>Iunk</hi>
shou'd return sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely from <hi>Iapan</hi> to <hi>Malac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
The answer was, That they shou'd
arrive happily at <hi>Iapan,</hi> but were never
more to see <hi>Malacca.</hi> The Pirate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
was extreamly superstitious, resolv'd at
the same instant, to change his Course;
and in effect, tack'd about, and pass'd his
time, in going to every Isle, which was
in view. Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was sensibly
displeas'd, that the Devil shou'd be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of their destiny, and that all things
shou'd be order'd, according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of the Enemy of God and Man.</p>
            <p>In cruising thus leisurely, they made
the Coast of <hi>Cochin China;</hi> and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,
which ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e at the same time,
threaten'd them more than once with
Shipwrack. The Idolaters had recourse
to their ordinary Superstitions. The Lott
declar'd, that the Wind should fall, and
that there was no danger. But an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Gust so rais'd the Waves, that the
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iners were forc'd to lower their Sails,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48349:214"/>
and cast Anchor. The shog of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
threw a young <hi>Chinese</hi> (whom <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
had Christen'd, and carry'd along
with him) into the Sink, which was
then open. They drew him out half dead,
much bruis'd, and hurt in the Head very
dangerously. While they were dressing
him, the Captain's Daughter fell into the
Sea, and was swallow'd by the Waves,
notwithstanding all they cou'd do to save
her.</p>
            <p>This dismal accident, drove <hi>Neceda</hi>
to despair; <hi>And it was a lamentable sight,</hi>
says <hi>Xavier</hi> himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>to behold the disorder in the Vessel.
The loss of the Daughter, and the fear of
Shipwrack, fill'd all with tears, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Idolaters, instead of
acknowledging, that their Idol had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them with a lye, took pains to
appease him, as if the death of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese</hi>
Woman, had been an effect of their
Gods displeasure. They sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is'd Birds
to him, and burnt Incense in honour of
him; after which they cast Lotts again,
to know the cause of this disaster which
had befaln them. They were answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d,
<hi>That if the young Christian, who had fell
into the Sink, had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d the Captain's
Daughter had been preserv'd. Then Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceda,</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:48349:215"/>
transported with fury, thought to
throw <hi>Xavier</hi> and his Companions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.
But the Storm ceasing in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
his mind grew calmer by degrees, he
weigh'd Anchor, and set Sail again, and
took the way of <hi>Canton,</hi> with intention
there to pass the Winter. But the Designs
of Men, and Power of Devils, can do
nothing against the Decrees of Providence.
A contrary Wind broke all the projects
of the Captain, constraining him, in his
own despight, to enter with full Sails in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ocean of <hi>Iapan.</hi> And the same Wind
carry'd the <hi>Iunk</hi> of the Pirate, toward

            <p>
               <hi>Iapan</hi> was anciently one Monarchy.<note place="margin">

The Emperour, whom all those Isles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d,
was call'd the <hi>Dairy:</hi> and was
descended from the <hi>Camis,</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the popular Opinion, came in a
direct line from the Sun. The first Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Empire was that of the <hi>Cubo,</hi>
that is to say, Captain General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For the raising of this Dignity,
which in it self was so conspicuous, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48349:216"/>
of time, the name of <hi>Sama</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that of <hi>Cubo;</hi> for <hi>Sama</hi> in their
Language signifies Lord. Thus the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of <hi>Iapan,</hi> came to be call'd <hi>Cubo
Sama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above three hundred years ago, the
<hi>Cubo Sama</hi> then being, beholding the
Scepter of <hi>Iapan</hi> in the hands of a <hi>Dairy,</hi>
who was cowardly and es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eminate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from him, and got possession of
the Regal Dignity. His design was to
have reduc'd the whole Estate under his
own Dominion: but he was only able
to make himself Master of <hi>Meaco,</hi> where
the Emperour kept his Court, and of
the Provinces depending on it. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of other Provinces, maintain'd
themselves in their respective Jurisdictions
by force of Arms, and shook off the
yoke, as well as he. Insomuch that the
Monarchy came to be suddenly divided,
into Sixty six Cantons, which all assum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
the names of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Since these revolutions, the King of
<hi>Meaco,</hi> took the Title of <hi>Cubo Sama,</hi> and
he who had been depriv'd of it, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the name of <hi>Dairy:</hi> and, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his Descendants have had always the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48349:217"/>
same Title, and enjoy'd the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
This in general, was the face of
the Government, in the times of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Xavier:</hi> for some years afterwards,
<hi>Nabunanga,</hi> one of the Neighbour Kings
to him of <hi>Meaco,</hi> defeated the <hi>Cubo Sama</hi>
in a pitch'd Battle, and follow'd his blow
with so much success; that having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
all those petty Princes, he reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the whole Empire of <hi>Iapan,</hi> under his

transmigration of Souls, after the Doctrine
of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Some of them pay Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship to the Sun and Moon; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the <hi>Camis,</hi> those Ancient Kings,
of whom we have made mention, and
to the <hi>Potoques,</hi> the Gods of <hi>China.</hi> There
are divers of them who adore some kinds
of Beasts, and many who adore the Devil
under dreadful Figures. Besides these,
they have a certain Mysterious Deity
whom they call <hi>Amida;</hi> and say this God
has built a Paradise of such distance from
the Earth, that the Souls cannot reach it
under a Voyage of three years. But the
God <hi>Xaca,</hi> is he, of whom they report
the greatest Wonders; who seems to be

by the Devil himself, or by his Ministers.
For if one wou'd give credit to them,
<hi>Xaca</hi> being born of a Queen, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the carnal knowledge of Man,
retir'd into the Desarts of <hi>Siam,</hi> and there
under-went severe Penances, to expiate
the Sins of Men: that coming out of his
Wilderness, he assembled some Disciples,
and preach'd an Heavenly Doctrine in
divers Countries.</p>
            <p>'Tis incredible how

him with much humanity, and with so

believ'd him dead. This kind reception
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48349:218"/>
gave <hi>Paul de Sainte Foy</hi> the confidence
to petition the King for the pardon of
that action, which had occasion'd his
departure, and it was not difficult for
him to obtain it.</p>
            <p>The King, naturally curious, as the
<hi>Iaponians</hi> generally are, enquir'd much
of him, concerning the <hi>Indies; as what
was the nature of the Country, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

<hi>were as brave, and as powerful,
as they were represented by common Fame.</hi>
When <hi>Paul</hi> had satisfy'd him on these

               </note> and seeing with what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
he was heard, produc'd a Tablet of
the Virgin, holding the little <hi>Iesus</hi> in
her arms. The Tablet was very curious,
and <hi>Xavier</hi> had given it to this <hi>Iapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,</hi>
that he might shew it, as occasion
offer'd. The sight alone of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Painting, wrought so much upon
the King, that being touch'd with
thoughts of Piety and Reverence, he sell
on his knees, with all his Courtiers, to
honour the Persons therein represented;
which seem'd to him, to have an air that
was more than humane.</p>

He commanded it shou'd be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Queen his Mother. She was
also charm'd with it, and prostrated her
self by the same instinct, with all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of her Train, to salute the Mother
and the Son. But, as the <hi>Ioponian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are yet more inquisitive than the
men, she ask'd more inquisitive than the
men, she ask'd a thousand questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
which gave <hi>Paul</hi> the desir'd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
of relating all the Life of
<hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and this Relation so much
pleas'd the Queen, that some few days
after, when he was upon his return to
<hi>Cangoxima,</hi> she sent one of her Officers
to have a Copy of the Tablet: which she
had seen: but a Painter was not to be
found to satisfie her curiosity. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
that at least she might have an
abridgment in writing of the chief
Points of Christianity, and was satisfy'd
therein by <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father overjoy'd at these good
inclinations of the Court,<note place="margin">The Saint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes himself to
the study of the <hi>Japonian</hi> Tongue.</note> thought ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
of making himself capable to
preach in the Language of the Country.
There is but one Language spoken
through all <hi>Iapan:</hi> but that so ample,
and so full of variety, that in effect, it
may be said to contain many Tongues.
They make use of certain words, and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48349:219"/>
Phrases, in familiar Discourse; and of
others in studied compositions. The Men
of quality have a Language quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Vulgar. Merchants and
Souldiers have a Speech proper to their
several Professions, and the Women speak
a Dialect distinct from any of the rest.
When they treat on a sublime Subject,
for Example, of Religion, or Affairs of
State, they serve themselves of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
terms; and nothing appears more
incongruous amongst them, than to
confound these different manners of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
            <p>The holy Man had already some light
notions of all these Languages, by the
communication he had with the three
<hi>Iaponian</hi> Christians; but he knew not
enough to express him with ease and
readiness, as himself acknowledges in his
Epistles, where he says, that he and his
Companions, at their first arrival, stood
like Statues, mute and motionless. He
therefore apply'd himself with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
to the study of the Tongue, which
he relates in these following words. <hi>We
are return'd to our Infancy,</hi> says he, <hi>and
all our business at present, is to learn the
first Elements of the</hi> Japonian <hi>Grammar.
God give us the grace to imitate the simplicity
and innocence of Children, as well as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the exercises of Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:48349:220"/>
We ought not to be astonish'd in this
passage, last quoted, that a man to whom
God had many times communicated the
gift of Tongues, shou'd not speak that of
<hi>Iapan,</hi> and that he shou'd be put to the
pains of studying it. Those favours were
transient, and <hi>Xavier</hi> never expected them.
Insomuch, that being to make abode in a
Country, he studied the Language of it,
as if he cou'd not have arriv'd to the
knowledge of it, but by his own industry.
But the holy Spirit assisted him after an
extraordinary manner, on those occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as we have formerly observ'd. And
we may say, that the easiness wherewith
he learnt so many Tongues, was almost
equivalent to the lasting gift of them.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Xavier</hi> and his Companions
were labouring to acquire that knowledge
which was necessary for their preaching
the word of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He baptizes the whole Family of <hi>Paul de Sainte Foy.</hi>
               </note> to the People of
<hi>Cangoxima, Paul de Sainte Foy,</hi> with
whom they lodg'd, himself instructed his
own Family: God gave that Blessing to his
Zeal, that besides his Mother, his Wife
and Daughter, many of his Relations
were converted and baptiz'd by <hi>Xavier.</hi>
Within the compass of forty days, the
Saint understood enough of the Language
to undertake the translation of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Exposition</hi> of it, which
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48349:220"/>
he had compos'd in <hi>India.</hi> As fast as he
translated, he got every parcel of it by
Heart, and with that help, was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that he might begin to declare the
Gospel. But seeing that in <hi>Iapan,</hi> all the
Measures of the Laws and Customs, are
to be taken, and observ'd with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness,
and nothing to be attempted in
publick, without permission from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he wou'd first visit the King of
<hi>Saxuma,</hi> and chose the time, on the day
of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel. He had
put the whole Empire under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that glorious General of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Host, who chas'd the Rebellious
Angels out of Heaven, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his daily Prayers to him, that he
wou'd exterminate those Devils from <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
who had usurp'd the Dominion of
it, for so many Ages.</p>
            <p>The Apostle of the <hi>Indies</hi> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
at the Court of <hi>Saxuma.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to the Court of <hi>Saxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and is well receiv'd.</note> 
               <hi>Paul de
Sainte Foy,</hi> had spoken of him there, in
such a manner, as infus'd the desire of
seeing him into all Hearts, and caus'd
him to be look'd on with admiration,
when he first appear'd. The King and
Queen treated him with honour, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
great affection to him, and discours'd
with him the better part of the night.
They cou'd not but be astonish'd that he
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48349:221"/>
and his Companions, were come from
another World, and had pass'd through so
many stormy Seas, not out of an avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
design, of enriching themselves
with the Gold of <hi>Iapan,</hi> but only to
teach the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> the true way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life. From the very first meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the King caution'd <hi>Xavier,</hi> to keep
safely all the Books and Writings, which
contain'd the Christian Doctrine; <hi>For,</hi>
said he, <hi>if your Faith be true, the Demons
will be sure to fly furiously upon you; and
all manner of mischief is to be expected
from their Malice.</hi> Afterwards he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
permission to the Saint to preach the
Christian Law, within the whole extent
of his Dominions; and farther caus'd
his Letters Patents to be expedited, by
vertue of which, all his Subjects had free
liberty of being made Christians, if they
so desir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> took advantage of this happy
conjuncture;<note place="margin">He begins to preach at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goxima,</hi> and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

preaching in <hi>Cangoxima.</hi> He began by
explaining the first Articles of the Creed.
That of the <hi>Existence of one God,</hi> all
powerful, the Creatour of Heaven and
Earth was a strange surprise to his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
who knew nothing of a first Being,
on whom the Universe depended, as on its
Cause and Principle. The other Articles
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48349:221"/>
which respect the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
appear'd to them yet more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Insomuch, that some of them held
the Preacher for a Mad-man, and laugh'd
him to scorn. Notwithstanding which,
the wiser sort, cou'd not let it sink into
their Belief, that a Stranger, who had
no Interest to deceive them, shou'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
so many hardships and dangers,
and come so far, on set purpose, to cheat
them with a Fable. In these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they were desirous of clearing
those doubts, which possess'd them, in
relation to those Mysteries which they
had heard. <hi>Xavier</hi> answer'd them so
distinctly, and withal so reasonably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the assistance of <hi>Paul de Sainte Foy,</hi>
who serv'd him for Interpreter, in case of
need, that the greatest part satisfy'd
with his solutions, came over to the
Faith.</p>
            <p>The first who desir'd Baptism, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it, was a man of mean condition,
destitute of the goods of Fortune; as if
God will'd, that the Church of <hi>Iapan</hi>
shou'd have the same Foundations, of
meanness and Poverty, with the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

him, and by his Vertue he became

His good behaviour, and frankness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gain'd him the favour of their

the Knowledge of the <hi>European

either out of shame to change his
Opinion at that age, or perhaps, because
those who have doubted all their life, are

            <p>The esteem which <hi>Ningit</hi> had for <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>

new Religion, cou'd only be inspir'd by

               <hi>Xavier</hi> for the edification
of the People, who commonly judge by
appearances of things, abstain'd entirely
both from Flesh and Fish. Some bitter

rigorously, and litterally, that abstinence
of which the <hi>Bonza's</hi> make profession,
or rather that which they pretend to
practise. And he accustom'd himself to
this immediately, upon what <hi>Paul

the Ministration of his Servant, gave
farther confirmation to the Christian
Law. The Saint walking out one day up-the
Sea shore, met certain Fishers, who
were spreading their empty Nets, and
complain'd of their bad fortune. He had
pity on them, and after making some
short Prayers, he advis'd them to Fish
once more. They did so, on his word,
and took so many Fish, and of such
several sorts, that they cou'd hardly
draw their Nets. They continued their
Fishing for some days after, with the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48349:224"/>
same success; and what appears more
wonderful, the Sea of <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> which
was scarce of Fish, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
had great plenty.</p>
            <p>A Woman, who had heard reports
of the Cures which the Apostle had made
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> brought him her little
Child, who was swell'd over all the
Body, even to deformity. <hi>Xavier</hi> took
the Infant in his arms, look'd on him
with eyes of pity, and pronounc'd thrice
over him these words, <hi>God bless thee;</hi>
after which, he gave the Child back
to his Mother, so well, and beautiful,
that she was transported with joy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>This Miracle made a noise about the
Town; and gave occasion to a Leper,
to hope a cure for his Disease, which he
had sought in vain for many years. Not
daring to appear in publick, because his
uncleanness had excluded him from the
Society of men, and made him loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to all Companies; he sent for <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
who at that time happen'd to be
ingag'd in business, and cou'd not come;
but deputed one of his Companions to
visit him; giving order to ask him thrice,
if he was content to believe in Christ,
in case he shou'd be heal'd of his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
and thrice to make the sign of the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48349:225"/>
Cross over him, if he promis'd constantly
to embrace the Faith. All things pass'd
according to the Commission of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the Leper oblig'd himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian upon the recovery of
his health; and the sign of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cross was
no sooner made over him, but his whole
body became as clean, as if he had never
been infected with Leprosy. The sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness
of the Cure, wrought in him to
believe in Christ, without farther dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and his lively Faith brought him
hastily to Baptism.</p>
            <p>But the most celebrated Miracle which
<hi>Xavier</hi> wrought in <hi>Cangoxima,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He raises a Maid from Death.</note> was the
Resurrection of a young Maid of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
She died in the flower of her youth,
and her Father who lov'd her tenderly,

Being an Idolater, he had no sourse of

<hi>Xavier</hi> mov'd at the faith, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of the Father, withdraws, with
<hi>Fernandez</hi> his Companion, to recommend
his desire to Almighty God; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            </p>
            <p>The Idolater, who expected that the
Saint wou'd have accompanied him to
his house, and there call'd upon the name
of his God, over the Body of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
thought himself ill us'd, and cheated,
and went away dissatisfy'd. But before
he had walk'd many steps homeward, he
saw one of his Servants, who transported
with joy, cried out aloud to him, at a
distance, that his Daughter liv'd. Soon
after this, his Daughter came her self to
meet him, and related to her Father, that
her Soul was no sooner departed from
her Body, but it was seiz'd by two ugly
Fiends, who wou'd have thrown her
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48349:226"/>
headlong into a Lake of Fire; but that
two unknown Persons, whose Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
were venerably modest, snatch'd
her out of the gripe of her two Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
and restor'd her to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, but in what
manner she cou'd not tell.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iaponian,</hi> suddenly apprehended,
who were the two Persons concern'd in
her Relation, and brought her straight
to <hi>Xavier,</hi> to acknowledge the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he had receiv'd. She no
sooner cast her eyes on him, and on <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez,</hi>
than she cry'd out, <hi>Behold my
two Redeemers!</hi> and at the same time,
both she, and her Father desir'd Baptism.
Nothing of this nature had ever been
seen in that Country: no History ever
made mention that the Gods of <hi>Iapan</hi>
had the power of reviving the dead. So
that this Resurrection, gave the People
a high conception of Christianity, and
made famous the name of Father
<hi>Xavier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing will make more evident
how much a Favourite he was to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">God avenges the Saint.</note>
and how prevalent with that God,
whom he declar'd, than that exemplary
Judgment, with which Divine Justice,
punish'd the bold impiety of a man, who
either carried on by his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> madness,
or exasperated by that of the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> one
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48349:226"/>
day rail'd at him, with soul injurious
Language. The Saint suffer'd it with
his accustom'd mildness, and only said
these words to him, with somewhat a
melancholly Countenance, <hi>God preserve
your Mouth.</hi> Immediately the Miscreant
felt his tongue eaten with a Cancer, and
there issued out of his mouth a purulent
Matter, mix'd with Worms, and a stench
that was not to be endur'd. This Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
so visible, and so sudden, ought
to have struck the <hi>Bonza's</hi> with terrour;
but their great numbers assur'd them in
some measure, and all of them acting in
a Body against the Saint, each of them
had the less fear, for his own particular.
What rais'd their indignation to the
height, was that a Lady of great Birth
and Riches, Wife to one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Lords of all the Court, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
liberal to the <hi>Pagods,</hi> was solemnly
Baptis'd with all the Family.</p>
            <p>Seeing they prevail'd nothing by the
ways they had attempted,<note place="margin">A new Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Xavier,</hi> by the <hi>Bonza's.</hi>
               </note> and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality, were not less enamour'd
of the Christian Doctrine, than the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and on the other side, not daring
to use violence, in respect of the King's
Edicts, which permitted the profession
of Christianity, they contriv'd a new
Artifice, which was to address a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48349:227"/>
to the King, of the King himself,
on the part of their Country Deities.
The most considerable of the <hi>Bonza's</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been elected, in a general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for this Embassy, went to the Prince,
and told him, with an air rather threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
than submissive, that they came
in the name of <hi>Xaca</hi> and <hi>Amida,</hi> and
the other Deities of <hi>Iapan,</hi> to demand of
him, into what Country he wou'd ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them? that the Gods were looking
out for new habitations, and other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
since he drove them shamefully out
of his Dominions, or rather out of theirs,
to receive in their stead a stranger God,
who usurps to himself Divine honours,
and will neither admit of a Superiour,
nor an Equal. They added haughtily,
that 'tis true he was a King; but what a
kind of King was a profane Man? was it
for him to be the Arbiter of Religion,
and to judge the Gods? what probability
was there too, that all the Religions of
<hi>Iapan</hi> shou'd err, and the most prudent
of the Nation be deceiv'd after the run
of so many Ages? what wou'd Posterity
say, when they shou'd hear that the King
of <hi>Saxuma,</hi> who held his Crown from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mida</hi>
and <hi>Xaca,</hi> overthrew their Altars,
and depriv'd them of the honours, which
they had so long enjoy'd? but what
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48349:227"/>
wou'd not the Neighbouring Provinces
attempt, to revenge the injury done to
their Divinities? that all things seem'd
lawful to be done, on such occasions;
and the least he had to fear, was a civil
war, and that so much the more bloody,
because it was founded on Religion.</p>
            <p>The Conjuncture in which the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's</hi>
found the King,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Saxuma,</hi> is turn'd against <hi>Xavier</hi> and the Christians.</note> was favourable to
them. It was newly told him, that the
Ships of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which usually landed
at <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> had now bent their course
to <hi>Firando,</hi> and was extreamly troubled
at it; not only because his Estates shou'd
receive no more advantage by their
Trade, but also because the King of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi>
his Enemy, wou'd be the only
gainer by his loss. As the good-will which
he shew'd in the beginning to Father
<hi>Xavier,</hi> had scarce any other Principle
but Interest, he grew cold to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after this ill news; and this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
made him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> incline to hearken to the

            <p>Whatsoever good inclinations there

these new Edicts hinder'd those of <hi>Cangoxima,</hi>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:48349:228"/>
from any farther Commerce
with the three Religious Christians; so
easily the favour or displeasure of the
Prince, can turn the People.</p>
            <p>They, not withstanding, whose heart
the Almighty had already touch'd, and
who were Baptis'd, far from being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the grace of their Vocation, were
more increas'd in Faith, not exceeding
the number of an hundred; they found
themselves infinitely acknowledging to
the Divine Mercy, which had elected
them to compose this little Flock. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
it self augmented their servour;
and all of them declar'd to Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
that they were ready to suffer Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

he daily assembled them; where having
read some passages of Scripture, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into their own Language, and
suitable to the present condition of that
Infant Church, he explain'd to them
some one of the Mysteries of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Life; and his Auditours were so
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48349:228"/>
fill'd with the interiour Unctions of the
Holy Spirit, that they interrupted his
speech at every moment, with their
sighs and tears.</p>
            <p>He had caus'd divers Copies of his
Catechism to be taken,<note place="margin">He causes his Catechism to be Printed, before his departure.</note> for the use of the

with the Life of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which he
entirely. Translated, he caus'd it to be

and amongst the Persecuting
<hi>Bonza's,</hi> and not one single man of them
shou'd be perverted from the Faith. It
happen'd, that even their exemplary lives,
so edify'd their Countrey-men, that they
gain'd over many of the Idolaters: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that in the process of some few
years, the number of Christians was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
to five hundred Persons; and the
King of <hi>Saxuma</hi> wrote to the Viceroy of
the <hi>Indies,</hi> to have some of the Fathers

fearful Precipices on every side; and the
Fortress approachable by one onely way,
where a Guard was plac'd both day and
night. The inside of it was as pleasing,
as the outside was full of horrour. A
stately Palace compos'd the Body of the
place, and in that Palace were Portico's,
Galleries, Halls, and Chambers, of an
admirable Beauty, all was cut in the
living stone, and wrought so curiously,
that the works seem'd to be cast within
a Mould, and not cut by the Chizzel.</p>
            <p>Some People of the Castle, who were
returning from <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> and who had
there seen <hi>Xavier,</hi> invited him by the
way, to come and visit their Lord; not
doubting but <hi>Ekandono,</hi> wou'd be glad to
see so famous a Person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> who sought all occasions of

The good reception which
was made him, gave him the means of
teaching immediately the true Religion,
and the ways of Eternal Life. The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
of the Prince, and Souldiers of
the Garrison, who were present, were so
mov'd, both by the Sanctity, which
shone in the Apostles Countenance, and
by the truth which beam'd out in all
his words, that after the clearing of their
doubts, seventeen of them at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

were possess'd with the same desire, and
had receiv'd the same favour, if <hi>Ekando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
had not oppos'd it by reason of state,
and contrary to his own inclinations,
for fear of some ill Consequences from
the King of <hi>Saxuma:</hi> For in his heart he
acknowledg'd <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Xavier</hi> privately to Baptise his Wife,

hands <hi>the form of Baptism in writing; the
Exposition of the Creed, the Epitome of our
Saviour's Life, the Seven penitential Psalms,
the Letanies of the Saints, and a Table of

to cause the <hi>Penitential Psalms</hi> to be sung

his Orders, and those seeds of Piety grew
up so fast, that some few years after, <hi>Louis

wou'd have me moderate with my Equals;

these Reasons, command me still to be a

gone from thence,<note place="margin">He arrives at <hi>Firando;</hi> and what reception he had there.</note> pursu'd their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
sometimes by Sea, and sometimes
travel'd by Land. After many labours
chearfully undergone by them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangers which they pass'd, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at the Port of <hi>Firando,</hi> which was

               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:48349:232"/>
did all they were able, for the
honourable reception of Father <hi>Xavier.</hi>
All the Artillery was discharg'd at his
arrival, all the Ensigns and Streamers
were display'd, with sound of Trumpets;
and, in fine, all the Ships gave shouts of
joy, when they beheld the man of God.
He was conducted, in spight of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance,
with the same p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mp to the
Royal Palace; and that magnificence was
of no small importance, to make him
consider'd in a Heathen Court, who
without it might have been despis'd;
since nothing was to be seen in him, but
simplicity and poverty. The King of
<hi>Firando,</hi> whom the <hi>Portugueses</hi> gave to
understand, how much the man whom
they presented to him was valued by
their Master, and what credit he had
with him, receiv'd him with so much
the greater favour, because he knew the
King of <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> had forc'd him to go
out of his Estates: for to oblige the
Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and do a despight to
that of <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> he presently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
the three Religious Christians
to publish the Law of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> through
all the extent of his Dominions.</p>
            <p>Immediately they fell on preaching in

on their Souls; and in less than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days, he baptis'd more Insidels at <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi>
than he had done in a whole year
at <hi>Cangoxima.</hi> The facility which he
found of reducing those people, under
the obedience of the Faith, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to leave with them <hi>Cosmo de Torrez,</hi>
to put the finishing hand to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and in the mean time, to go
himself to <hi>Meaco,</hi> which he had design'd
from the beginning. That Town being
the Capital of the Empire; from whence
the knowledge of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> might easily
be spread through all <hi>Iapan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Departing with <hi>Fernandez,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He takes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi,</hi> in his way to <hi>Meaco.</hi>
               </note> and the
two <hi>Iaponian</hi> Christians, <hi>Matthew</hi> and
<hi>Bernard,</hi> for this great Voyage at the end
of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1550, they arriv'd
at <hi>Facata</hi> by Sea, which is twenty
Leagues distant from <hi>Firando;</hi> and from
thence Embark'd for <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> which
is an hundred Leagues from it. <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guchi</hi>
is the Capital of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naugato,</hi> and one of the richest Towns of
all <hi>Iapan</hi> not only by the Traffick of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
who come thither from all parts;
but also by reason of Silver Mines, which
are there in great abundance, and by
the fertility of the Soy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l; but, as Vices are
the inseparable Companions of wealth, it
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:48349:233"/>
was a place totally corrupted, and full
of the most monstrous debaucheries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> took that place,<note place="margin">He stays at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi;</hi> his Actions there.</note> but the strange corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Manners, gave him so much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and withal so great compassion,
that he cou'd not resolve to pass farther,
without publishing <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> to those
blind and execrable Men, nor without
making known to them, the purity of
the Christian Law. The Zeal which
transported him, when he heard the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Crimes of the Town, suffer'd
him not to ask permission from the King,
as it had been his Custom in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He appear'd in publick on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
burning with an inward Fire, which
mounted up into his Face, and boldly
declar'd to the people, the eternal truths
of Faith. His Companion <hi>Fernandez</hi> did
the same in another part of the Town.
People heard them out of Curiosity, and
many after having enquir'd who they
were, what dangers they had run, and
for what end, admir'd their Courage, and
their procedure void of Interest, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the humour of the <hi>Iaponians,</hi>
whose Inclinations are naturally noble,
and full of esteem for Actions of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
From publick places, they were
invited into Houses, and there desir'd to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48349:233"/>
expound their Doctrine more at large,
and at greater leisure. <hi>For if your Law
appear more reasonable to us than our own,</hi>
(said the principal of the Town) <hi>we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves to follow it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when once a man becomes a Slave
to shameful Passions,<note place="margin">What hinder'd the fruit of his preaching at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi.</hi>
               </note> 'tis difficult to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what he thinks the best, and even
to judge reasonably what is the best.
Not a man amongst them kept his word.
Having compar'd together the two Laws,
almost all of them agreed, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine was most conformable to
good sence, if things were only to be
taken in the Speculation; but when they
came to consider them in the Practise,
and saw how much the Christian Law
discourag'd Vengeance, and forbad Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy,
with all Carnal Pleasures, that
which had appear'd just and reasonable
to them, now seem'd improbable, and
the perversity of their Wills, hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd
the light of their Understanding;
so that, far from believing in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
they said, <hi>That</hi> Xavier <hi>and his Companions
were plain Mountebanks, and the Religion
which they preach'd a meer Fable.</hi> These
reports being spread abroad, exasperated
the Spirits of Men against them; so that
as soon as any of them appear'd, the
people ran after them, not as before
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:48349:234"/>
to hear them preach, but to throw Stones
at them, and revile them. <hi>See,</hi> they
cry'd, <hi>the two</hi> Bonza's, <hi>who wou'd inveigle
us to worship one only God, and perswade us
to be content with a single Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oxindono</hi> the King of <hi>Amanguchi,</hi>

what had pass'd, was willing to be
judge himself of the Christians new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
He sent for them before him,
and ask'd them in the face of all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
of what Country they were, and
what business brought them to <hi>Iapan?
Xavier</hi> answer'd briefly, That they were
<hi>Europeans,</hi> and that they came to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Divine Law. <hi>For,</hi> added he, <hi>no
Man can be sav'd, who adores not God,
and the Saviour of all Nations, his Son</hi>
Christ Jesus, <hi>with a pure Heart, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship. Expound to me,</hi> reply'd the
Prince, <hi>this Law which you have call'd
Divine.</hi> Then <hi>Xavier</hi> began, by reading
a part of the Book which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Tongue, and which
treated of the Creation of the World,
of which none of the Company had ever
heard any thing; of the Immortality of
the Soul, of the Ultimate End of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, and of Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments; in fine, of the
Coming of our Saviour, and the Fruits of
our Redemption. The Saint explain'd
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48349:234"/>
what was needful to be clear'd, and spoke
in all above an hour.</p>
            <p>The King heard him with attention,<note place="margin">He preaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King in <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> without success.</note>
and without interrupting his Discourse;
but he also dismiss'd him, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
a word, or making any sign,
whether he allow'd, or disapprov'd of
what he said. This silence accompany'd
with much Humanity, was taken for a
permission by Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> to continue
his publick preaching. He did so with
great warmth, but with small success.
Most of them laugh'd at the Preacher,
and scorn'd the Mysteries of Christianity.
Some few indeed, grew tender at the
hearing of our Saviour's Sufferings, even
so far as to shed Tears, and these Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Compassion dispos'd their Hearts to
a belief; but the number of the Elect was
inconsiderable: for the time pre-ordain'd
for the Conversion of that People, was
not yet come, and was therefore to be
attended patiently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> then having made above a

               <note place="margin">He pursues his Voyage for <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</hi>
               </note> and gather'd

<hi>Meaco,</hi> with his three Companions, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez,
Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Bernard;</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
bemoan'd the blindness and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy

receive the Gospel; yet chear'd up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the considerations of Gods
Mercies, and an inward voice was still
whispering in their Hearts, That the Seed

in a season when the Rains were
continually falling; during a Winter
which is dreadful in those parts, where
the Winds are as dangerous by Land, as
Tempests are at Sea. The Colds are
pinching, and the Snow drives in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
that neither in the Towns nor
Hamlets, people dare adventure to stir
abroad; nor have any Communication
with each other, but by cover'd Walks
and Galleries. 'Tis yet far worse in the
Country, where nothing is to be seen but
hideous Forests, sharp pointed and ragged
Mountains, raging Torrents across the

Plains. Sometimes 'tis so cover'd over
with Ice, that the Travellers fall at every
step; without mentioning those prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Isicles, hanging over head, from the
high Trees, and threatning the Passengers
at every moment with their fall.</p>
            <p>The four Servants of God travell'd in
the midst of this hard season, and rough
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:48349:235"/>
ways, commonly on their naked Feet,
passing the Rivers, and ill accommodated
with warm Cloaths, to resist the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencies
of the Air and Earth, loaden
with their necessary Equipage, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other provisions of life, than grains
of Rice roasted or dry'd by the Fire,
which <hi>Bernard</hi> carry'd in his Wallet.
They might have had abundantly, for
their sustenance, if <hi>Xavier</hi> wou'd have
accepted of the Money, which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
Merchants of <hi>Firando</hi> offer'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

wou'd have made use of what the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Indies</hi> had supply'd him with,
in the name of the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
But he thought he shou'd have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ronted
Providence, if he shou'd have furnish'd
himself with the Provisions needful to a
comfortable subsistance; and therefore
taking out of the Treasury, a thousand
Crowns, he employ'd it wholly for the
relief of the poor, who had receiv'd Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
Neither did he rest satisfy'd with
this Royal Alms he drew what he cou'd
also, from his Friends at <hi>Goa,</hi> and <hi>Malac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
And it was a saying of his, <hi>That the
more these new Converts were destitute of
worldly goods, the more succour they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd:
That their Zeal was worthy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Ages of the Church; and that there
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48349:236"/>
was not a Christian in</hi> Japan, <hi>who wou'd not
chuse rather to lose his life, than forfeit the
love of</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>The Journey from <hi>Amanguchi</hi> to <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
is not less than fiften days, when the
ways are good, and the season conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for travelling. But the ill weather
lengthen'd it to our four Travellers,
who made two months of it; sometimes
crossing over rapid Torrents, sometimes
over Plains and Forrests thick with Snow,
climbing up the Rocks, and rowling
down the Precipices. These extream la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
put Father <hi>Xavier</hi> into a Fever,
from the first moneth, and his sickness
forc'd him to stop a little at <hi>Sacay.</hi> But
he wou'd take no remedies, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
put himself upon his way.</p>
            <p>That which gave them the greatest
trouble,<note place="margin">He follows a Horseman, with great difficulty.</note> was, that <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was
their guide, most commonly misled them.
Being one day lost in a Forrest, and not
knowing what Path to follow, they met
a Horseman who was going towards
<hi>Meaco; Xavier</hi> follow'd him, and offer'd
to carry his Male, if he wou'd help to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
them from the Forest, and shew
them how to avoid the dangerous passages.
The Horseman accepted <hi>Xavier</hi>'s offer, but
trotted on at a round rate; so that the
Saint was constrain'd to run after him, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:48349:236"/>
the fatigue lasted almost all the day. His
Companions follow'd him at a large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and when they came up to the
place, where the Horseman had left him,
they found him so spent, and over-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd,
that he cou'd scarcely support him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Flints, and Thorns, had torn his
Feet, and his Legs were swell'd, so that they
broke out in many places: All these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
hinder'd him not from going
forward. He drew his strength from the
Union he had with God, continually pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the morning to the evening; and
never interrupting his Devotions, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exhort his Friends to Patience.</p>
            <p>In passing through the Towns and
Villages,<note place="margin">He instructs the people in pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the People, who gather'd about

at him; and the little Children cry'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, <hi>Deos, Deos, Deos,</hi> because speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, he had commonly that <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
word in his Mouth, which he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Pronounc'd without Repetition. For
discoursing of God, he wou'd not use
the <hi>Iaponnese</hi> Language, till they were
well instructed in the Essence and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Divine Majesty; and he
gave two reasons for it: The first. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound not one word in all the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48349:237"/>
Language, which well express'd that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Divinity, of which he desir'd to
give them a distinct notion: The second,
because he fear'd le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t those Idolaters
might confound that first Being, with
their <hi>Camis,</hi> and their <hi>Potoques,</hi> in case
he shou'd call it by those names, which
were common to their Idols. From
thence he took occasion to tell them, <hi>That
as they never had any knowledge of the true
God, so they never were able to express his
name: That the</hi> Portugueses, <hi>who knew
him, call'd him</hi> Deos: and he repeated
that word with so much Action, and
such a tone of Voice, that he made even
the <hi>Pagans</hi> sensible, what Veneration was
due to that Sacred Name. Having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
condemn'd, in two several Towns,
the false Sects of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Vices reigning there, he was drawn
by the Inhabitants without the Walls,
where they had resolv'd to stone him.
But when they were beginning to take
up the Stones, they were overtaken by
a violent and sudden storm, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
them all to betake themselves to
flight: The holy man continu'd in the
midst of this rack of Heaven, with flash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Lightning darting round about him,
without losing his habitual tranquility;
but adoring that Divine Providence, which
fought so visibly in his favour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:48349:237"/>
He arriv'd at length at <hi>Meaco,</hi>

the <hi>Dairy,</hi> and the <hi>Saso</hi> kept their Court,
seem'd to promise great matters to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Xavier;</hi> but the effect did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the appearances: <hi>Meaco,</hi> which in
the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Tongue, signifies a thing
worth seeing, was no more than the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of what formerly it had been: so
terribly Wars and Fires had laid it waste.
On every side Ruines were to be beheld,
and the present condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Affairs,
threatn'd it with a total destruction. All
the Neighbouring Princes, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd
together against the <hi>Cubosama,</hi> and
nothing was to be heard but the noise of
Arms.</p>
            <p>The Man of God endeavour'd to have
gain'd an Audience from the <hi>Cubosama,</hi>
and the <hi>Dayri,</hi> but he cou'd not compass
it. He cou'd not so much as get admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the <hi>Saso,</hi> or High-Priest of the
<hi>Iaponian</hi> Religion. To procure him those
Audiences, they demanded no less than
an hundred thousand <hi>Caixes,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to six hundred <hi>French</hi> Crowns;
and the Father had it not to give. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
of doing any good, on that side,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:48349:238"/>
he preach'd in the publick places, by
that Authority alone, which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
gives his Missioners: As the
Town was all in confusion, and the
Thoughts of every man taken up with
the reports of War, none listen'd to him,
or those who casually heard him in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by, made no reflections on what he
said.</p>

to no purpose, seeing no appearance of
making Converts amidst the disturbance
of that place, he had a strong impulse of
returning to <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> without giving
for lost, all the pains he had taken at <hi>Meaco;</hi>
not only because of his great sufferings,
and sufferings are the gains of Gods A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
but also, because at least he had
preach'd <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in that place; that
is to say, in the most Idolatrous Town of
all the Universe, and open'd the passage
for his Brethren, whom God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
in the years following, there
to establish Christianity, according to the
Revelations which had been given him
concerning it.</p>
            <p>He imbark'd on a River which falls
from the adjoining Mountains, and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Being in the Ship, he cou'd not turn off
his Eyes from the Stately Town of <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi>

himself as an <hi>Israelite,</hi> departing out of a

people, as one day destin'd to be the

perceiving that Presents are of great

to the Houses of the Great, and will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
want leisure to say their Prayers, or
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48349:240"/>
to make their recollections. Perhaps also
they will want time, to say their Mass or
their Breviary; or not have enough, for
their repast, or even for their natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For it is incredible, how importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
these <hi>Japonians</hi> are, especially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Strangers, of whom they make
no reckoning, but rather make their sport
of them. What therefore will become of
them, when they rise up against their Sects,
and reprehend their Vices? yet these impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
became pleasing to Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
and afterwards produc'd a good effect. As the
<hi>Japonnese</hi> are of docible and reasonable
minds, the more they press'd him in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
they understood the truth the more.
So that their doubts being satisfy'd, they
comprehended easily, that there were no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
in our Faith, nothing that wou'd
not abide the test of the most severe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion.</p>
            <p>It was in the midst of these interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,<note place="margin">He answers many men, with one only word.</note>
with which the Saint was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd,
that by a prodigious manner
of speech, the like of which was scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever heard, he satisfy'd with one only
answer, the questions of many persons,
on very different Subjects, and often op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to each other: as suppose, <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul, the motions of the
Heavens, the Eclipses of the Sun and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48349:241"/>
Moon, the Colours of the Rainbow, Sin and
Grace, Hell and Heaven.</hi> The Wonder
was, that after he had heard all their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
demands, he answer'd them in few
words, and that these words, being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd
in their ears, by a vertue all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
gave them to understand what
they desir'd to know, as if he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
each of them in particular: They
frequently took notice of this Prodigy,
and were so much amaz'd at it, that
they look'd on one another like men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
and regarded the Father with
admiration, as not knowing what to
think or say. But as clear sighted, and
able as they were, for the most part, they
cou'd not coneive that it was above the
power of nature. They ascrib'd it to I
know not what secret kind of Science,
which they imagin'd him only to possess.
For which reason, Father <hi>Cozmo de Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi>
being return'd from <hi>Firando</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi,</hi>
the <hi>Bonza's</hi> said, This man is
not endu'd with the great knowledge
of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> nor has the art of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
many doubts with one onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>The process of the Saints Canonisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
makes mention of this Miracle;
and Father <hi>Antonio Quadros,</hi> who travel'd
to <hi>Iapan</hi> four years after Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
               <pb n="459" facs="tcp:48349:241"/>
writes it to Father <hi>Diego Moron,</hi> Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
of <hi>Portugal:</hi> these are his words, <q>A
<hi>Iaponnese</hi> inform'd me, that he had seen
three Miracles, wrought by Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
in his Country. <hi>He made a Person
walk, and speak, who was Dumb, and taken
with the Palsey. He gave voice to another
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ute: And hearing to one that was deaf.</hi>
This <hi>Iaponian</hi> also told me, that Father
<hi>Xavier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> was esteem'd in <hi>Iapan,</hi> for the
most knowing man of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that
the other Fathers of the Society were
nothing to him, because they cou'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
but one Idolater at a time; but
that Father <hi>Xavier</hi> by one only word,
decided ten or twelve questions. When
I told him, that this might probably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
because those questions were alike,
he assur'd me it was not so; but that on
the contrary, they were very different.
He added, lastly, that his was no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
thing with him, but a common
practice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Xavier</hi> and his Companion
<hi>Fernandez</hi> were a little disingag'd from
these importunities,<note place="margin">He preaches in <hi>Amanguchi.</hi>
               </note> they set themselves
on preaching twice a day, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places of the Town, in despight of
the <hi>Bonza's.</hi> There were seven or eight
Religions in <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> quite opposite
to each other; and every one of them
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48349:242"/>
had many Proselytes, who defended their
own as best. Insomuch that these <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's,</hi>
who were heads of Parties, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disputes amongst themselves; but
when once the Saint began to publish
the Christian Law, all the Sects united
against their common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>my. Which
notwithstanding they durst not openly
declare, against a man who was favour'd
by the Court, and who seem'd even to
themselves to have somewhat in him,
that was more than humane.</p>
            <p>At this time God restor'd to Father
<hi>Xavier</hi> the gift of Tongues,<note place="margin">He speaks the <hi>Chinese</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, without learning it.</note> which had
been given him in the <hi>Indies,</hi> on divers
occasions; for without having ever learnt
the <hi>Chinese</hi> Language, he preach'd every
day to the <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, who Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> in their Mother-tongue,
there being great numbers of them. He
preach'd in the Afternoon to the <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
in their Language, but so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and with so much ease, that he
cou'd not be taken for a Foreigner.</p>
            <p>The force of truth, against which
their Doctours cou'd oppose nothing that
was reasonable in their disputations; the
novelty of three Miracles which we
have mention'd, and of many others,
which <hi>Xavier</hi> wrought at the same time,
his innocent and rigid life, the Divine
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48349:242"/>
Spirit which enliven'd his Discourses;
all these together made so great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on their hearts, that in less than
two months time, more than five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Persons were Baptis'd. The greatest
part, men of quality and learning; who
had examin'd Christianity to the bottom,
and who did not render up themselves
for any other reason, than for that they
had nothing farther to oppose.</p>
            <p>It was wonderful, according to the
report of the Saint himself,<note place="margin">The fruit of his Preaching.</note> to observe
that there was no other speech but of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> through all the Town; and
that those who had most eagerly fought
against the Christian Law in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
vvere now the most ardent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, and to practise it with most
exactness. All of them were tenderly

               </gap>ectionate to the Father, and were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loath to leave his Company. They
took delight in making daily questions
to him, concerning the Mysteries of
Faith, and 'tis unspeakable what invvard
refreshments they found, in seeing that
all was Mysterious even in the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ceremonies; as for example, in
the manner wherewith the Faithful sign
themselves with the Cross.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Father on his side had as ample
a satisfaction;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His joy in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the servour of the Faithful.</note> 
               <hi>and he confesses it himself,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48349:243"/>
in a Letter, which he directed some time
after to the</hi> Iesuites <hi>in</hi> Europe.—Though

than I ever was: for the pains which
are taken, to Cultivate a reasonable Nation,
which loves the Truth, and which covets to
be sav'd, afford me matter of great joy.
I have not, in the course of all my life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a greater satisfaction, than at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi;</hi>
where multitudes of People
came to hear me, by the Kings permission.
I saw the pride of their <hi>Bonza's</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and the most inflam'd Enemies of
the Christian Name, subjected to the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Gospel. I saw the transports
of joy in those new Christians, when after
having vanquish'd the <hi>Bonza's</hi> in dispute,
they return'd in Triumph. I was not less
satisfy'd, to see their diligence in labouring
to convince the Gentiles, and vying with
each other in that undertaking; with the
delight they took in the relation of their
Conquests; and by what arguments and
means they brought them over, and how
they rooted out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eathen Superstitions,
all these particulars gave me such abundant
joy, that I lost the sence of my own afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Ah, might it please Almighty God,
that as I call to my remembrance, those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
which I have receiv'd from the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48349:243"/>
Fountain of all mercies, in the midst of my
labours, I might not only make a recital
of them, but give the experience also, and
cause them to be felt and consider'd as they
ought by our Vniversities of <hi>Europe,</hi> I am
assur'd, that many young men, who study
there, wou'd come higher to employ all the
strength of their parts, and vigour of their
minds, in the Conversion of an Idolatrous
People, had they once tasted those heavenly
refreshments, which accompany our Labours.</p>
            <p>These inward delights of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,<note place="margin">His occasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were not yet so pure, but that
some bitterness was intermix'd. He was
not without sorrow for <hi>Oxindono</hi> King of
<hi>Amanguchi;</hi> who, though perswaded of
the excellence of Christianity, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in Idolatry by carnal pleasures.
And for <hi>Neatondono,</hi> first Prince of the
Kingdom, who having noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
inclinations, might have prov'd
the Apostle of the Court, if some trivial
Reasons had not hinder'd him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Christian. He, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
his Wife, respected <hi>Xavier</hi> as their
Father, and even honour'd him as a
Saint. They also lov'd the Faithful, and
succour'd them in all their needs. They
spoke of our Faith in terms of great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
but having founded many
Monasteries of <hi>Bonza's,</hi> it troubled them
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:48349:244"/>
as they said, to lose the fruit of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and thus the fear of being frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
of I know not what rewards, which
the <hi>Bonza's</hi> promis'd them, caus'd them
to neglect that eternal recompence, of
which the holy man assur'd them.</p>
            <p>But how powerful soever the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Princes is usually in matters of
Religion,<note place="margin">The Faith is embrac'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Princes example; and by what means.</note> yet on all sides Christianity
was embrac'd; and an action of <hi>Xavier</hi>'s
Companion did not a little contribute,
to the gaining over of the most stubborn.
<hi>Fernandez</hi> preach'd in one of the most
frequented places of the Town: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his crowd of Auditors, were

of their Sect, who cou'd not
conceive the Maximes of the Gospel;
and who heard the Preacher with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intention, than to make a sport of
him. In the midst of the Sermon, a
man, who was of the skum of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
drew near to <hi>Fernandez,</hi> as if it
were to whisper something to him, and
hawking up a mass of nastiness, spit it
full upon his face. <hi>Fernandez</hi> without
a word speaking, or making the least sign
that he was concern'd, took his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,
wip'd his face, and continu'd
his discourse.</p>
            <p>Every one was surpris'd at the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48349:244"/>
of the Preacher; the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd,
who had set up a laughter at
this affront, turn'd all their scorn into
admiration, and sincerely acknowledg'd
that a man who was so much master of
his passions, as to command them on
such an occasion, must needs be endu'd
with greatness of Soul, and Heroick
Courage. One of the chief of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
discover'd somewhat else in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken
patience. He was the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
amongst all the Doctours of <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guchi,</hi>
and the most violent against the
Gospel. He consider'd that a Law, which
taught such patience, and such insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of affronts, cou'd only come from
Heaven; and argu'd thus within himself,
<hi>These Preachers, who with so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
endure the vilest of all injuries,
cannot pretend to cozen us. It wou'd cost
them too dear a price; and no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
another at his own expence. He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who made the heart of man, can place
it in so great Tranquility. The force of
Nature cannot reach so far; and this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
patience must proceed alone from some
Divine Principle: these People cannot but
have some infallible assurance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they believe, and of the recompence
which they expect. For, in fine, they are
ready to suffer all things for their God;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48349:245"/>
and have no humane expectations. After
all, what inconvenience, or danger can it
be to embrace their Law: If what they
tell us of Eternity, be true, I shall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
miserable in not believing it: and,
supposing there be no other Life but this,
is it not better to follow a Religion, which
elevates a man above himself, and which
gives him an unalterable peace, than to
profess our Sects, which continue us in all
our weakness, and which want power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the disorders of our hearts.</hi> He made
his inward reflections on all these things,
as he afterwards declar'd, and these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
being accompany'd with the
motions of Grace, touch'd him so to the
quick, that as soon as the Sermon was
ended, he confess'd that the vertue of the
Preacher had convinc'd him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
Baptism, and receiv'd it with great
solemnity.</p>
            <p>This illustrious Conversion,<note place="margin">

Many who had a glimmering of the

He was come to <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> on purpose
to be made a <hi>Bonza.</hi> But being inform'd
that the Sect of <hi>Bonza's,</hi> of which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd

a first Principle, and that their
Books had made no mention of him, he
chang'd his thoughts, and was unresolv'd
on what course of living, he shou'd fix.
'Till being finally convinc'd, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Doctour, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Xavier,</hi> he became a Christian.
The name of <hi>Laurence</hi> was given him;
and it was he, who being receiv'd by
<hi>Xavier</hi> himself into the <hi>Society of Iesus,</hi>
exercis'd immediately, the Ministry of
preaching, with so much fame, and so
great success, that he converted an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

These young <hi>Bonza's</hi> discover'd

being made privy to the secrets of every

But where was Providence, if the Law of</hi>

Jesus <hi>was necessary to Salvation, which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

cou'd not posibly be true. And if the</hi> Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean

it,</hi> China <hi>cou'd never have been so long

the principal heads of their Accusation,

shall content my self with what the

Idolaters instead of congratulating their

is the Law of God, not that which is

that which is written in Hearts, by the

amongst you, that Theft and Adultery were
to be avoided; and from thence it was that
Thieves and Palliards sought out secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

the private stings of their own Consciences,
which cease not to reproach the guilty to
themselves, though their wickedness be not

follows, that God has not left so many Ages
destitute of Knowledge, as your</hi> Bonza's
<hi>have pretended.</hi> By this he gave them
to understand, that the Law of Nature
was a step, which led them insensibly to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48349:248"/>
the Christian Law: And that a man who
liv'd morally well, shou'd never fail of
arriving to the knowledge of the Faith,
by ways best known to Almighty God;
that is to say, before his death, God
wou'd either send some Preacher to him,
or illuminate his Mind by some imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Revelation. These Reasons, which
the Fathers of the Church have often us'd
on like occasions, gave such satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that they found no
farther difficulty in that point, which
had given them so much trouble.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bonza's</hi> perceiving that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">The <hi>Bonza's</hi> provoke the King against the Christians.</note>
preferr'd the Authority of <hi>Xavier</hi>
above theirs, and not knowing how
to refute their Adversary, made a
Cabal at Court, to lessen the Christians
in the good Opinion of the King. They
gave him Jealousies of them, by decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their behaviour, and saying, <hi>They
were men of Intrigue, Plotters, Enemies of
the publick safety, and dangerous to the
person of the King:</hi> Insomuch, that <hi>Oxin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono,</hi>
who had been so favourable to
them, all on the sudden, was turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. 'Tis true, that as the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneses,</hi>
value themselves above all things,
in the inviolable observation of their
word, when they have once ingag'd it,
he durst not revoke that solemn Edict,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:48349:249"/>
which he had publish'd in favour of the
Christians, but to make it of no effect,
he us'd the Faithful with great severity,
even so far, as to seize upon their Goods,
and began with men of the first rank in
his Dominions. At the same time the
<hi>Bonza's,</hi> grown insolent, and swell'd with
this new turn of Tyde, writ Letters and
Libels, full of invectives against <hi>Xavier.</hi>
They said the was a vagabond Beggar,
who, not knowing how to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

nor these calumnies of the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

and they were all so servent, that not

to forgoe his Fortunes, but also to shed
his Blood for the defence of his Faith, it
the King shou'd be carry'd on, to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the growing Church with Fire and
Sword, as it was believ'd he wou'd. The
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:48349:249"/>
Reputation of the Apostle was also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
in spight of the false reports
which were spread concerning him; and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> had of late some thoughts of

were proper for <hi>Iapan;</hi> and his design
was to come back by <hi>China,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of which Country, had already
inflam'd his Heart. For discoursing dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with such <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants as were
resident at <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> he had entertain'd
a strong Opinion, that a Nation so polite,
and knowing, wou'd easily be reduc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to Christianity: And on the other side,
he had great hopes, that when <hi>China</hi>
shou'd be once converted, <hi>Iapan</hi> wou'd
not be long after it; at least the more
unbelieving sort of <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> often said;
<hi>That they wou'd not alter their Religion,
till the</hi> Chineses <hi>had led the way. Let
him carry his Gospel to that flourishing and

parts, who was one of the <hi>Iaponian</hi>
Converts, which accompany'd him, and
gave him a Letter, directed to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Saint desir'd them to send him word,
who they were, from whence bound,
and how soon they intended to return?
After which he told them, <hi>That his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
were to return to the</hi> Indies, <hi>and
that he shou'd be glad to meet them, in case
they were dispos'd to repass thither.</hi> In

and <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> whom he left
at <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> put himself upon his way,
towards <hi>Mid-september,</hi> in the year 1551.
He might have made this Voyage easily
by Sea; but he lov'd rather to go by
Land, and that on Foot, according to his
Custom. He took for his Companions,
<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Bernard:</hi> two Christian
Lords wou'd be also of the party. Their
Goods had lately been confiscated, as a
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:48349:251"/>
punishment for changing their Religion;
but the Grace of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which was
to them instead of all, render'd their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
so precious, that they esteem'd
themselves richer, than they had been
formerly. Another Christian bore them
company; that <hi>Laurence</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irnam'd the
<hi>Squint-ey'd,</hi> because of that imperfection
in his sight.</p>
            <p>The Father walk'd chearfully with his
five Companions,<note place="margin">He falls sick with overtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling himself; and after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rest, pursues his Iourney.</note> as far as <hi>Pinlaschau,</hi>
a Village distant a League or two from
<hi>Figen.</hi> Arriving there he found himself
so spent with travelling, that his Feet
were swollen, and he was seiz'd with a
violent Headach, so that the cou'd go no
farther. <hi>Matthew, Laurence</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
went on to carry news of him to
the Vessel. When <hi>Edward de Gama</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that the holy Man was so near,
he call'd together all the <hi>Portugueses,</hi>
who resided at <hi>Fucheo;</hi> and having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out the Principal amongst them, got
on Horseback with them, to pay him
their Respects in Ceremony. <hi>Xavier,</hi>
whom a little rest had now recruited,
and who was suspicious of the Honour
which they intended him, was already
on his Journey, but fell into that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush
of Civility, which he wou'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have shunn'd. The Cavalcade came
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:48349:251"/>
up to him, within a Leagues distance of
<hi>Figen;</hi> and found him walking betwixt
the two Lords of <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> who had
never left him; and himself carrying his
own Equipage. <hi>Gama</hi> was surpris'd to see
a person so considerable in the World in
such a posture, and alighting from his
Horse, with all his Company, saluted
him with all manner of respect. After
the first Complements were over, they
invited the Father to mount on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back;
but he cou'd not be perswaded:
so that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> giving their Horses
to be led after them, bore him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
on foot, even to the Port.</p>
            <p>The Ship was equipp'd in all its flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,<note place="margin">He is receiv'd with Honour by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses;</hi> and complemented from the King of <hi>Bungo.</hi>
               </note>
with Flags hung out, and Stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
waveing, according to the Orders of
the Captain. They, who were remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her, appear'd on the Decks, and
stood glittering in their Armour. They
gave him a Volley, at his first approach;
and then discharg'd all their Cannon.
Four rounds of the Artillery being made,
the noise of it was heard so distinctly at
<hi>Fucheo,</hi> that the City was in a fright;
and the King imagin'd that the <hi>Portugueses</hi>
were attack'd by certain Pyrates, who
lately had pillag'd all the Coasts. To clear
his Doubts, he dispatch'd away a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of his Court to the Ship's Captain.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:48349:252"/>
               <hi>Gama,</hi> shewing Father <hi>Francis</hi> to the
Messenger, told him, that the noise which
had allarm'd the Court, was only a small
testimony of the honour which was
owing to so great a Person, one so dear
to Heaven, and so much esteem'd in the
Court of <hi>Port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iapanner,</hi> who saw nothing but
poverty in the person of the Father, and
remember'd what had been written of
him from <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> stop'd a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking: then, with amazement in
his face; I am in pain, <hi>said he,</hi> what
answer I shall return my Prince: for
what you tell me has no correspondence
either with that which I behold, or with
the account we have receiv'd from the
<hi>Bonza's</hi> of <hi>Amanguchi;</hi> who have seen
your Father <hi>Bonza</hi> entertain a familiar
Spirit, who taught him to cast lots, and
perform certain magical operations to
delude the ignorant. They report him
to be a Wretch forsaken, and accurst by
all the World; that the Vermin which
are swarming all over him, are too nice
to feed on his infectious flesh; besides
which, I fear, that if I shou'd relate
what you say concerning him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our
Priests wou'd be taken, either for Ideots,
or men of false Understanding, or for
envious Persons, and Impostours. Then
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:48349:252"/>
               <hi>Gama,</hi> replying, told the <hi>Iaponian</hi> all that
was necessary to give him a good impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Saint; and to hinder him from
contempt of his mean appearance. On
this last Article, he declar'd to him, that
he, who had so despicable an outside,
was of noble blood; that fortune had
provided him w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th wealth, but that
his vertue had made him poor; and that
his willful want of all things, was the
effect of a great Spirit, which despis'd
those empty pomps that are so eagerly
desir'd by Mankind. This Discourse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
the <hi>Iapanner</hi> with admiration: he
made a faithful relation of it to his King;
and added of himself, that the <hi>Portugueses</hi>
were more happy in the possession of this
holy man, than if their Vessel were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Ingots of Gold.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Bungo</hi> had already heard

               </note> and gave no
credit to what the <hi>Bonza's</hi> of <hi>Amanguchi</hi>
had written of him. He was a Prince
of five and twenty years of age, very
judicious, generous, and civil: but too
much ingag'd in carnal pleasures, after
the manner of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Princes. What

This Letter vvas carried by a young
Prince of the blood Royal, attended by
thirty young Lords belonging to the
Court; and accompani'd by a venerable
Old Man, vvho was his Governour,
call'd <hi>Poomendono,</hi> one of the vvisest and
most qualifi'd of all the Kingdom, and
natural Brother to the King of <hi>Minato.</hi>
The honour which vvas paid by the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> to Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> so surpriz'd
the Prince, that, turning to his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he said aloud, <hi>The God of these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must be truly great, and his counsels
hidden from Mankind, since it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that these wealthy Ships shou'd be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to so poor a man as is this</hi> Bonza
<hi>of the</hi> Portuguese: <hi>and that the roaring of
their Cannon, shou'd declare, that Poverty
has wherewithall to be pleasing to the Lord
of all the world; even that Poverty which
is so despicable of it self, and so disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the general opinion, that it seems e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a crime to think of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we have a horrour for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,

it may be this poor man is so much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
of his wants, and so esteems
them, that he is Pleasing to the God
whom he adores, and that practising it
vvith all imaginable rigour, for his sake,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48349:254"/>
he may be richer than the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the World.</p>
            <p>The young Embassadour being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to Court, reported to the King,
with vvhat respect his Letter had been
receiv'd; and took upon him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
that Prince, that this <hi>European
Bonza</hi> vvas to be treated vvith greater
honour, and far otherwise than their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Bonza's;</hi> even so far as to say,
that it vvou'd be an enormous sin to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
him vvith them. That for the rest,
he was not so poor as his Enemies had
suggested; that the Captains and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese</hi>
Merchants vvou'd bestow on him
both their Ship, and all their Treasure,
in case he wou'd accept of them; and
that, properly speaking, he vvas not to
be accounted poor, who possess'd as
much as he desir'd. In the mean time,
the <hi>Portugueses</hi> being assembled, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
how Father <hi>Xavier</hi> shou'd appear in
Court the next morning, all of them
vvere of opinion, that he shou'd present
himself with all the Pomp an Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
they cou'd devise. At first he
oppos'd it, out of the aversion he had
for this Pageant show, so unsuitable to
the Condition of a Religious man: but
afterwards he yielded to the request, and
withall to the reasons of the Assembly.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48349:254"/>
Those reasons vvere, That the <hi>Bonza's</hi>
of <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> having written all they
cou'd imagine, to render <hi>Xavier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
it was convenient to remove
those false conceptions from the People;
and at the same time, to let them see
how much the Christians honour their
Ministers of the Gospel, that thereby
the <hi>Heathens</hi> might be the more easily
induc'd to give credit to them; so that
the honour wou'd reflect on <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and the preaching wou'd be rais'd in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
according to the esteem which vvas
given to the Preacher.</p>
            <p>They prepar'd therefore,<note place="margin">In what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </note> with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
for the Entry of the Saint, and
set out the next morning before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
in a handsome equipage. There
were thirty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
amongst them, richly habited;
with their Chains of Gold, and adorn'd
with Jewels. Their Servants and Slaves,
vvell cloath'd likewise, vvere attending
on their Masters. Father <hi>Xavier</hi> wore
a Cassock of black Chamlet, and over
it a Surplice, with a Stole of green Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
garnish'd with a Gold Brocard.
The Chalop and the two Barques, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they made their passage from the
Ship to the Town, were cover'd on the
sides, with the fairest <hi>China</hi> Tapestry;
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48349:255"/>
and hung round, with silken Banners of
all colours. Both in the Sloop, and in
the Barques, there were Trumpets,
Flutes, and Hautbois, and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Musick, which playing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made a most harmonious consort: the
news which was spread about <hi>Fucheo,</hi> that
the great <hi>European Bonza</hi> was to enter
into the Town that morning, drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons of Quality to the Sea side;
and such a multitude of people ran
crowding together, at the sounding of
the Trumpets, that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> cou'd
hardly find footing to come on shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quansyandono</hi> Captain of <hi>Canafama,</hi> and
one of the principal of the Court, was
there attending them, by Order from
the King. He receiv'd the Saint with
great civility; and offer'd him a Litter
to carry him to the Palace: but <hi>Xavier</hi>
refus'd it, and walk'd on foot, with all his
Train, in this order: <hi>Edward de Gama</hi>
went foremost bare-headed, with a Cane
in his hand, as the Gentleman of the
Horse, or <hi>Major domo</hi> to the Father.
Five other <hi>Portugueses</hi> follow'd him, who
were the most considerable persons of
the Ship. One of them carri'd a Book, in
a Bag of white Sattin; another a Cane
of <hi>Bengale,</hi> headed with Gold; a third
his Slippers, which were of fine black
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48349:255"/>
Velvet, such as are worn only by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the first Quality: a fourth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a fair Tablet of our Lady, wrapt
in a Scarf of violet Damask; and the
fifth a magnificent Parasol. The Father
came next after them, in the habit which
I have describ'd; with an air compos'd
betwixt Majesty and Modesty. The rest
of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> follow'd; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their countenance, their dress, and
the beauty of their train, they resembled
rather Cavaliers and Lords, than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Merchants. They pass'd in this
manner through the chief Streets of the
City, with sound of Trumpets, Flutes,
and Hautbois, follow'd by an infinite
multitude of People, without r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>koning
into the number, those who fill'd the
Windows, the Balconies, and the tops
of houses. Being arriv'd at the great
Place, which fronts the Royal Palace, they
found there six hundred of the King's
Guards, drawn up, some arm'd with
Lances, others with Darts, all of them
with rich S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ymiters, hanging by their
sides, and costly Vests upon their backs.
These Guards, at the sign given them
by their Captain call'd <hi>Fingeindono,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
in good order towards the Saint,
after which they divided into two
ranks, and open'd a passage for the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48349:256"/>
Father through the midst of them.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Palace,<note place="margin">His entry into the Palace of the King of <hi>Bungo.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi>
who walk'd immediately before
the Father, turn'd towards him, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
him with great respect. One pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him the Cane, and another the
Velvet Slippers; he who held the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol,
spread it over his head; and the
two others, who carried the Book and
Picture plac'd themselves on each side of
him. All this was so gracefully perform'd,
and with so much honour to the Father,
that the Lords who vvere present, much
admir'd the manner of it: and they were
heard to say amongst themselves, that
<hi>Xavier</hi> had been falsly represented to
them by the <hi>Bonza's:</hi> that questionless
he was a man descended from above,
to confound their Envy, and abate their
Pride.</p>
            <p>After they had gone through a long
Gallery, they enter'd into a large Hall,
full of People; who by their habit, which
vvas of Damask heighten'd with Gold,
and diversify'd with fair Figures, seem'd
to be Persons of the highest Quality.
There, a little Child, whom a Reverend
Old Man held by the hand, coming up
to the Father, saluted him with these
words. <hi>May your arrival in the Palace of
my Lord the King, be as welcome to him,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48349:256"/>
as the Rain of Heaven to the Labourers,
in a long and parching drought: Enter
without fear,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>for I assure
you of the love of all good men; though
the wicked cannot behold you without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
in their faces, which will make
them appear like a black and stormy night.
Xavier</hi> return'd an answer, suitable to
his age who had made the Complement;
but the Child reply'd, in a manner,
which vvas far above his age. <hi>Certainly</hi>
said he, <hi>you must be endu'd with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
courage, to come from the end
of all the world, into a strange Country,
liable to contempt, in regard of your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;
and the goodness of your God, must
needs be infinite, to be pleas'd with that
Poverty, against the general opinion of
mankind.</hi> The <hi>Bonza's</hi> are far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of this nature; they who
publickly affirm, and swear that the
Poor are no more in a possibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
than the Women.</p>
            <p>May it please the divine goodness of
our <hi>Lord, reply'd Xavier,</hi> to enlighten
those dark and wretched Souls, with the
beams of his Coelestial truth, to the end
they may confess their errour, both as to
that particular, and to the rest of their
Belief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:48349:257"/>
The Child discours'd on other Subjects,
and spoke with so much Reason, and
with that sublimity of Thought, that the
Father doubted not but he was inspir'd
by the holy Spirit, who when he pleases
can replenish the Souls of Infants with
Wisdom, and give Eloquence to their
Tongues, before Nature has ripen'd in
them the use of Reason.</p>
            <p>In these Entertainments,<note place="margin">He receives the Complements of several persons in the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

surprising to all the Assistants, they pass'd
into another Hall, where there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen richly habited, and of good
Meen. At the moment when the Father
enter'd, all of them bow'd with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
which Action they repeated
thrice, and so very low, that they touch'd
the ground with their Foreheads; as the
<hi>Iapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neses</hi> are very dextrous at that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
And this Reverence, which they
call <hi>Gromenare,</hi> is only perform'd by the
Son to the Father, and by the Vassal to
his Lord. After this, two of them sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
from the Company, to testify their
general joy at the sight of him, one of
them spoke in this manner. <hi>May your
arrival, holy Father</hi> Bonza, <hi>

                  </gap>e as pleasing
to our King, as the smiles of a Babe are to
his Mother, who holds him in her Arms;
which certainly will be, for we swear to you
by the Hairs of our Heads, that every

thing, even to the very Walls. which seem
to dance for joy at your desir'd presence,
conspires to your good reception; and excites
us to rejoice at your arrival; we doubt not
but it will turn to the Glory of that God,
of whom you have spoken so greatly at</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguchi.
This Complement being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
these young Lords were following
the Father, but the Child of whom we
made mention, and whom <hi>Xavier</hi> led by
the Hand, made a sign to them, that they
shou'd go no farther. They mounted on
a Terrace border'd with Orange-trees,
and from thence enter'd into another

and retir'd apart. They enter'd
into the Kings Antichamber, where the
principal Lords of the Kingdom, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
him. After he had been receiv'd
by them with all possible civilities, he
was at last introduc'd to his Audience in
a Chamber which glitter'd with Gold on
every side. The King, who was standing,
advanc'd five or six paces, at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Father, and bow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
even to the ground, thrice successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
at which action all the Company
were in great amazement. <hi>Xavier,</hi> on
his side, prostrated himself before that
Prince, and wou'd have touch'd his Foot,
according to the Custom of the Country,
but the King wou'd not permit him;
and himself rais'd up the Saint: then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the Hand, he caus'd him to
sit down by him, on the same <hi>Estrade.</hi>
The Prince his Brother, was seated some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lower; and the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were
plac'd over against them, accompany'd
by the most qualify'd persons of the
Court. The King immediately said all
the obliging things to the Father, which
cou'd be expected from a well-bred Man.
And laying a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>side all the pomp of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48349:258"/>
which the Kings of <hi>Iapan</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us'd to quit in publick, treated him
with the kindness and familiarity of a
Friend. The Father answer'd all these
Civilities of the Prince with a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
respect, and words full of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and submission: after which, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
occasion to declare <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to
him, he explain'd in few words, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Maxims of Christian Morality; but
he did it after so plausible a manner, that
at the conclusion of his Discourse, the
King cry'd out in a transport of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>How can any Man learn from God
these profound secrets? Why has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

For, in fine, we our selves are
Witnesses of what we had formerly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
and all we hear, is maintain'd by
proofs so strong and evident, and withal,
so conformable to the light of Nature, that
whoever wou'd examine these Doctrines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of Reason, will find,
that Truth will issue out, and meet him on
every side; and that no one proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
another. 'Tis far otherwise with our</hi>
Bonza's, <hi>they cannot make any Discourse
without the clashing of their own Principles;
and from thence it happens, that the more

themselves, and recanting their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
every moment; insomuch, that the
clearest Head, and the most ready Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
can comprehend nothing of their
Doctrine; and in relation to Eternal
Happiness, we are always left in doubt,
what we shou'd believe. A most manifest

            </p>
            <p>In this manner spoke the King; and it
was easy to judge by the vehemence of
his action, that he spoke from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

abstain'd from all sensual pleasures; that

that they administred to the Sick, instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Children, comforted the Distrest,
reconcil'd Enemies, appeas'd Seditions, and
pacify'd Kingdoms; that, which was first
and chiefest, they gave Letters of Exchange

<hi>were the familiar Friends of the Stars,
and the Confidents of the Saints; that
they were priviledg'd to converse with them
by night, to cause them to descend from
Heaven, to embrace them in their Arms,
and enjoy them as long as they desir'd.</hi>
These extravagances set all the Company
in a laughter; at which the <hi>Bonza</hi> was
so inrag'd, that he flew out into greater
passion, till the King commanded his
Brother to impose silence on him. After
which, he caus'd his Seat to be taken
from under him, and commanded him
to withdraw, telling him, by way of
raillery, <hi>That his Choler was a convincing
proof of a</hi> Bonza's <hi>Holiness,</hi> and then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
adding, <hi>That a Man of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
had more commerce with Hell than
Heaven.</hi> At these words the <hi>Bonza</hi> cry'd
out with excess of rage, <hi>The time will
come, when no Man of this World, shall be
worthy enough to serve me; there is not
that Monarch now breathing on the face of
the Earth, but shall be judg'd too vile to
touch the Hem of my Garment.</hi> He meant,
when he was to be transform'd into one

               </gap>ities, and that God and he
shou'd be mix'd into one Divinity; which
is the reward of a <hi>Bonza</hi> after death.
Though the King cou'd not hear his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:48349:260"/>
madness without smiling, yet he had so
much compassion on his Folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he
took upon him to confute those extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
propositions; but <hi>Xavier</hi> desir'd
him to defer it to a fitter time, till he had
digested his fury, and was more capable
of hearing Reason. Then the King said
only to <hi>Faxiondono, That he shou'd go
and do Penance, for the pride and insolence
of his Speech, wherein he had made himself
a companion of the Gods. Faxiondono</hi> did
not reply, but he was heard to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and grind his Teeth, as he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.
Being at the Chamber Door, and
ready to go out, <hi>May the Gods,</hi> said he
aloud, <hi>dart their Fire from Heaven to

Kings, who shall presume to speak like

            <p>The King and <hi>Xavier</hi> prosecuted their

desir'd of God, on his side, that he wou'd
graciously hear the Saints request, yet
on this condition, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
together in Heaven, and never be
divided from each other, that they might
have the opportunity of long Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of discoursing to the full of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

rather not to baptise the King of
<hi>Bungo,</hi> than to precipitate his Baptism,
Or rather he thought, that his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
wou'd be always speedy enough,
provided it were sincere and constant,
Thus the great care of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
in relation to the Prince, was, to give
him an aversion to those infamous Vices
which had been taught him by the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's;</hi>
and in which he liv'd vvithout
scruple, upon the Faith of those his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Now the King, attending with
great application to the man of God,
and having long conversations with him,
began immediately to change his life,
and to give the demonstrations of that
change. From the very first, he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
out of his Chamber, a beautiful
youth who vvas his Minion, and also
forbad him the entry of his Palace. He
gave bountifully to the Poor, to whom
he had formerly been hard-hearted, as
thinking it was a crime to pity them,
and an act of Justice to be cruel to them,
according to the Doctrine of his <hi>Bonza's,</hi>
who maintain'd that poverty not only
made men despicable, and ridiculous,
but also Criminal, and worthy of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>everest punishments. According to the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48349:263"/>
Principles of the same Doctours, Women
with Child vvere allow'd to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
miscarry by certain Potions, and
even to murther those Children, whom
they brought into the World against
their will. Insomuch that such unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cruelties were daily committed; and
nothing was more common in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Bungo,</hi> then those inhumane
Mothers. Some of them to save the
charges of their food and education, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to avoid the miseries attending
Poverty, and many to preserve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Chastity, however debauch'd
and infamous they were. The King, by
the admonition of the Father, forbad those
cruelties on pain of death. He made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Edicts, against divers <hi>Pagan</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which were lascivious or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and suffer'd not the <hi>Bonza's</hi> to set
a Foot within his Palace. As to what
remains, he was wrapt in admiration at
the vertue of the holy man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
often to his Courtiers, that when
he saw him appear at any time; he
trembled even to the bottom of his heart,
because he seem'd to see the Countenance
of the man of God, as a clear mirrour,
representing to him the abominations of
his Life.</p>

them in those subtle answers,
which one of them had return'd in their

the ruine of Christianity, as that which

was not deceiv'd in his conjectures; and,
from the beginning, had a kind of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that this turn of State, wou'd
conduce to the advantage of the Faith.
For having desir'd the King of <hi>Bungo,</hi>

to say something in private to him, <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
laid hold on that opportunity, and
gave him most important counsel for
the Salvation of his Soul. He advis'd
him above all things to bear in mind how
soon the greatness and pomp of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life will vanish away; that life is
but short in its own nature: that we
scarcely have begun to live, before death
comes on; and if he shou'd not dye a
Christian, nothing less was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than eternal misery. That, on the
contrary, whoever being truly faithful,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:48349:266"/>
shou'd persevere in the grace of Baptism,
shou'd have right to an everlasting inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
with the Son of God, as one of
his beloved Children. He desir'd him
also to consider, what was become of so
many Kings and Emperours of <hi>Iapan:</hi>
what advantage was it to them to have
sate upon the Throne, and wallow'd in
pleasures for so many years, being now
burning in an Abysse of Fire, which was
to last to all Eternity. What madness
was it, for a man to condemn his own
Soul to endless punishments, that his
body might enjoy a momentary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
That there was no Kingdom,
nor Empire, though the Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of the World shou'd be put into
the ballance, whose loss was not to be
accounted gain, if losing them, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
an immortal Crown in Heaven:
That These truths, which were indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
had been conceal'd from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
and even from all the <hi>Iaponians,</hi>
by the secret judgement of Almighty
God, and for the punishment of their
offences. That, for his own particular,
he ought to provide for that account,
which he was to render of himself; how
much more guilty wou'd he appear in
Gods presence, if, the Divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

the paths of happiness, he shou'd yet

            <p>This discourse made such impressions
on the King, and so melted into his
heart, that the tears came thrice into his
eyes: but those tears were the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of it at that time; so much that
Prince, who had renounc'd those impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which are abhor'd by Nature, was
still fasten'd to some other sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
And it was not 'till after some
succeeding years, that having made more
serious reflections on the wholesome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions

by the Merchants, who were
to set sail within few days after: The
departure of the Saint was joyful to the
<hi>Bonza's,</hi> but the glory of it, was a great
abatement to their pleasure. It appear'd
to them, that all the honours he had
receiv'd, redounded to their shame; and
that after such an affront, they shou'd remain
eternally blasted in the opinion
of the People, if they did not wipe it
out, with some memorable vengeance.
Being met together, to consult on a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
which so nearly touch'd them, they
concluded that their best expedient was
to raise a Rebellion in <hi>Fucheo,</hi> as they
had done at <hi>Amanguchi;</hi> and flesh the
People by giving up to them the Ship
of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants, first to be
plunder'd, then burnt, and the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themselves to be destroy'd. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this, if fortune favour'd
them, to attempt the Person of the
King, and having dispatch'd him, to
conclude their work by extinguishing
the Royal Line. As <hi>Xavier</hi> was held
in veneration in the Town, even amongst
the most dissolute Idolaters, they were
of opinion they did nothing, if they
did not ruine his reputation, and make
him odious to the people. Thereupon,
they set themselves at work, to publish,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:48349:268"/>
not only what the <hi>Bonza's</hi> of <hi>Amanguchi</hi>
had written of him, but what they
themselves had newly invented: <hi>That he
was the most wicked of Mankind, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the living and the dead; his practice
being to dig up the Carcasses of the buried,
for the use of his Enchantments, and that
he had a Devil in his Mouth, by whose as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
he charm'd his Audience.</hi> They
added, <hi>That he had spell'd the King; and
from thence proceeded these new vagaries
in his Vnderstanding and all his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but that in case he came not out of
that fit of madness, it shou'd cost him no less
than his Crown and Life: That</hi> Amida <hi>and</hi>
Xaca, <hi>two powerful and formidable Gods,
had sworn to make an Example of him and
of his Subjects; that, therefore the people,
if they were wise, shou'd prevent betimes
the wrath of those offended Deiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Honour on that Impostour of
a</hi> Bonza, <hi>and these European Pirates, who
made their Idol of him.</hi> The people were
too well perswaded of the Holiness of
<hi>Xavier,</hi> to give credence to such impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
stories, as were rais'd of him; and
all the <hi>Bonza's</hi> cou'd say against him,
serv'd only to increase the publick hatred
against themselves: Thus despairing of
success amongst the multitude, they
were forc'd to take another course, to
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:48349:268"/>
destroy him in the good Opinion of the
King.</p>
            <p>About twelve Leagues distant from
the Town,<note place="margin">A new Artifice of the <hi>Bonza's</hi> against the Saint.</note> there was a famous Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Lectures of the Mysteries of their Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

But however skill'd he was in all
Siences, his Authority was yet greater
than his Knowledge. Men listen'd to
him as to the Oracle of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and an
implicit Faith was given to all he said.
The <hi>Bonza's</hi> of <hi>Fucheo</hi> were perswaded,
that if they cou'd bring him to the
Town, and set him up against <hi>Xavier,</hi> in
presence of the Court, they shou'd soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their lost Honour; such confidence
they had of a certain Victory over the
<hi>European</hi> Doctor. On this account they
writ to <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> with all the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of an earnest Invitation, and sent
him word, That if he wou'd give himself
the trouble of this little Journey, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the injury they had receiv'd, they
wou'd carry him back in triumph on their
Shoulders to his Monastery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bonza,</hi> who was full as vain as he
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48349:269"/>
was learn'd, came speedily, attended by
six <hi>Bonza's,</hi> all Men of Science, but his
inferiours and Scholars. He enter'd the
Palace at that point of time, when <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
and the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had Audience of
the King, for their last farewel, being to
embark the next morning. Before the
King had dismiss'd them, he was inform'd,
that <hi>Fucarandono</hi> desir'd to kiss his Hand,
in presence of the <hi>Portuguese Bonza.</hi> At
the name of <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> the King was
a little nonplus'd, and stood silent for
some time, suspecting that he came to
challenge Father <hi>Xavier</hi> to a Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and devising in himself some means
of breaking off this troublesome affair,
as he afterwards acknowledg'd. For what
ever good Opinion he had of the Saints A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
Yet he cou'd not think him strong
enough to encounter so formidable an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary;
and therefore out of his kindness
to him, was not willing to expose him
to a disgrace in publick. <hi>Xavier,</hi> who
perceiv'd the Kings perplexity, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
from whence it might proceed,
begg'd earnestly of his Majesty, to give
the <hi>Bonza</hi> leave of entrance; and also
free permission of speaking. <hi>For, as to

need not give your self the least disquiet.
The Law I preach is no earthly Science,

cou'd not resolve to run off like a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
or, to forsake those new Christians,
whose ruine had been sworn by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Priests. How eager soever those
Merchants were to get out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where their lives were in so little
safety, yet their fear for Father <hi>Xavier</hi>
kept them lingring there some days
longer; they deputed the Captain of the
Vessel to him, who was to desire him in
their name to make haste to them. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
de Gama,</hi> after a long enquiry, found
him at last in a poor Cabin, with eight
Christians, who, having been the most
zealous in opposition of the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> were
in reason to expect the more cruel usage
at their hands, and were content to offer
up their lives, provided they might die
in the Arms of the Man of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Captain urg'd him with the

               <hi>and set before him all the dangers which
attended him: that, being at the mercy
of the</hi> Bonza's, <hi>his death was inevitable;
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:48349:272"/>
and that the means of escaping wou'd be
lost, when once the Tempest shou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to rise. The Father, far from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to these Arguments, was offended at
the Captain and the Merchants, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to hinder him from the Crown of
Martyrdome, which he had taken so
long a Journey to obtain:</hi> My Brother,
<hi>said he to</hi> Gama, <hi>with a servour which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
the holy ambition of his Soul,</hi>
how happy shou'd I be, if I cou'd receive
what you reckon a disgrace, but what I account
a Soveraign Felicity! but I am unworthy of
that favour from Almighty God; yet I will
not render my self more unworthy of it,
which assuredly I shou'd, if I embark'd with
you. For what scandal shou'd I give, by
flying hence, to my new Converts? Might
they not take occasion from it, to violate
their promises to God, when they shou'd
find me wanting to the duty of my Ministry?
If, in consideration of that Money, which you
have receiv'd from your passengers, you think
your self oblig'd to secure them from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which threatens them, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
have summon'd them on Board; ought not
I by a stronger motive, guard my Flock,
and die with them for the sake of a God,
who is infinitely good, and who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
me at the price of his own life, by
suffering for me on the Cross? Ought not I
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48349:273"/>
to seal it with my Blood, and to publish it
by my death, that all men are bound to
sacrifice their Blood and Lives to this God
of Mercies?</p>
            <p>This generous answer,<note place="margin">The Captain takes up a Resolution to stay with <hi>Xavier.</hi>
               </note> wrought so
much upon the Captain, that, instead of
doubling his solicitations on Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
he resolv'd to partake his Fortune,
and not to leave him. Having taken up
this Resolution, without farther care of

all his losses for a trifle, while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
the Company of <hi>Xavier;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
indeed to his Merchants, but it
was only to declare to them the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Father, and his own al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
that in case they wou'd not stay, he
gave up his Vessel to them: they were
supply'd with Mariners and Souldiers,
and had plentiful Provisions laid in, both
of Food and Ammunition for War. They
might go at their pleasure, wheresoever
they design'd, but for his own particular,
he was resolv'd to live and die with the
Man of God.</p>
            <p>Not a Man of them but subscrib'd to
the Opinion of the Captain; and they
were one and all for following his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Fortune of the Saint. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they put into the Port again; for
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48349:273"/>
the Ship had lain off at a good distance,
for fear of some attempt, which might
be made upon it from the Town; Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were left for its defence; and the
Captain and Merchants came in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to <hi>Fucheo.</hi> Their return gave new
vigour to the Christians, and amaz'd
the People, who cou'd not but wonder
that so poor a man shou'd be had in such
esteem by his Country-men, that they
chose rather to run the hazard of their
wealth, and of their lives, than to lose
the sight of him.</p>

themselves a little to the times, and
to renew the dispute betwixt <hi>Xavier</hi> and
<hi>Fucarandono</hi> before the Court. To seem
before-hand with the Christians, they
made it their own Petition to the King,
who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reely granted it, but on some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which were to be observ'd on

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48349:274"/>
noise was to be banish'd in dispute; no flying
out to be permitted, nor any provocation
by sharp language. That the Arguments
and Answers were to be couch'd in precise
terms, and drawn up in form of a just di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
as it shou'd be agreed by the Iudges,
who were to moderate: That the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Audience was to decide the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
That if the Point were doubtful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, the Suffrages shou'd be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that he shou'd be judg'd to have
reason on his side, who had the majority
of Voices. Lastly, That whoever was willing
to enter himself in Christian, might profess
his Faith, without hindrance or molestation
from any man.</hi> These Conditions were
too reasonable to be accepted by the
<hi>Bonza's.</hi> They appeal'd from the King,
to the King better inform'd, and told
him boldly, that in matters of Religion,
it was not just that the Profane, (that
is the Layety) shou'd be Umpires: but
when they found the King resolv'd to
maintain his point, they quitted theirs.
The next morning was agreed on for
the Conference; and some of the most
understanding Persons of the Court were
appointed Judges. <hi>Fucarandono</hi> made
his appearance at the time, attended by
three thousand <hi>Bonza's.</hi> The King, who
was either apprehensive of his own safety,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:48349:274"/>
amongst that Religious rabble, or fear'd
at least that some disorder might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
permitted but four of all the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron

with envy, beholding the pompous entry

of an Embassadour from Heaven,
and Interpreter of the Gods, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with a Lyar. <hi>Fucarandono,</hi>
who heard all these Passages from his

and turning to his four Associates, told
them, <hi>that he suspected this day wou'd be

of night. After he had thus spoken,
the <hi>Bonza</hi> held his peace: And <hi>Xavier,</hi>
who had receiv'd a sign from the King,
to make reply, said at the beginning of
his discourse, <hi>that seeing</hi> Fucarandono
<hi>had mingled many things together, it was
reasonable, for the better clearing of the
difficulties, to tye him up to one single pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which was not to be left, till it
was evacuated, and plainly found to be
either true of false.</hi> All agreed this was
fair, and <hi>Fucarandono</hi> himself, desir'd <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
to shew cause, why he and his
Companions, spoke evil of the Deities of
the Country?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Saint reply'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The answer of <hi>Xavier</hi> to the first question of <hi>Fucarandono.</hi>
               </note> That he gave not to
Idols the name of Gods; because they were
unworthy of it: and that so sacred a Title
was only proper to the Soveraign Lord,
who had Created Heaven and Earth. Then
he proceeded to discourse of the Divine
Being, and describ'd those Properties, which
are known to us by the light of Nature:
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:48349:276"/>
that is to say, his Independence, his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
his Omnipotence, his Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Iustice, without circumscription.
He made out, that those infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cou'd not be comprehended by any created
understanding, how refin'd soever. And
thus having fill'd his Auditors with a vast
Idea of the Deity, he demonstrated, that
the Idols of <hi>Japan,</hi> who, according to the
<hi>Japonians</hi> themselves, had been men, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the common Laws of Time and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were not to be accounted Gods; and
at the most were only to be reverenc'd as
Philosophers, Law-givers, and Princes;
but not in the least as Immortal Powers;
since the date, both of their birth, and
death, was register'd in the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.
That, if their Works were duly
consider'd, they were yet less to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for Omnipotent. That having not
been able, after their decease, to preserve
their Stately Palaces, and Magnificent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
from decay, there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that they had built the Fabrick of the
Vniverse, or cou'd maintain it, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state. Lastly, that this appertain'd
alone to the true God, who is worshipp'd by
the Christians: and that, considering the
beauty of the Heavens, the fruitfulness of
the Earth, and the order of the Seasons,
we might conclude, That he only who is a
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48349:276"/>
Spirit, Eternall, All Powerful, and All
Wise, cou'd be the Creatour, and absolute
Commander of the World. <hi>As soon as</hi>
Xavier <hi>had concluded, the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
cry'd out, that he spoke reason:
and the Judges immediately pronounc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as a manifest truth, that the</hi> Pagods
<hi>were not Gods.</hi> Fucarandono <hi>wou'd have
reply'd, but the general cry gave it for
a cause decided. And the King impos'd
silence on the</hi> Bonza, <hi>according to the
Articles of Agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Bonza</hi> pass'd on to another
question in his own despight;<note place="margin">The second que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of <hi>Fuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randono,</hi> to which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answers with the same success as to the former.</note> and ask'd
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> why he allow'd not of
those Bills of Exchange, which they
gave in favour of the dead; since the
Rich found their accompt in them, and
that they had their return of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with Usury in Heaven. The Father
answer'd, that the right we had to a
better world, was founded not on those
deceitful Letters, but on the good
works, which are practis'd with the
Faith and Doctrine which he preach'd.
That he who inspir'd it into our Souls,
was <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the true and only Son
of God, who was Crucify'd for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Sinners; and that they who
preserv'd that living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith 'till death,
shou'd certainly obtain Eternal happiness:
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:48349:277"/>
that for what remain'd this holy Law
was free from worldly interest, and that
it excluded not from Heaven either the
poor, or Women; that even poverty,
which is patiently endur'd, was a means
of gaining the Kingdom of Heaven: and
that the weaker Sex, had greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
than ours, by reason of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and piety, which is almost inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in their nature. The applause which
follow'd this discourse was general: only
<hi>Fucarandono,</hi> and his Companions, who
had not wherewith to reply; and yet
were too obstinate to recant, kept a
discontented silence. It was judg'd
that <hi>Xavier's</hi> Opinion was the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and the dispute adjourn'd to the
day following.</p>
            <p>These ill successes wou'd have driven
the <hi>Bonza to despair,</hi>

               </note> if his presumption
had not kept up his Spirits: he return'd
at the time appointed; but as if he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
his own strength, as presuming
as he was, he brought with him six o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bonza's,</hi> the most learned amongst
them, and chosen out of all their Sects;
not to be bare Spectatours of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
but to relieve each other, and to
charge every one in his turn. At the
first they propounded very subtile que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
concerning the Mysteries of our
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48349:277"/>
Faith; Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was surpris'd at the
hearing of them: and as those questions
which are not reported by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese,</hi>
particularly, were in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
above the knowledge of the
<hi>Pagans,</hi> he was almost induc'd to think
the Devil had suggested them: at the
least he acknowledg'd that to solve them
he needed an extraordinary assistance from
above; and desir'd the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to
second him with their Prayers, during
the disputation: whether he receiv'd that
supernatural assistance, or that those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
did not so much surpass his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as he had thought, he answer'd to
the satisfaction of the whole Assembly.
When Judgment was pass'd that those
questions were fully decided, one of the
<hi>Bonza's,</hi> whose heart was wholly set on
riches, and who believ'd that there was
nothing more charming in the World,
than Gold and Silver, undertook to prove
that God was an Enemy to the Poor:
<q>For, <hi>said the Bonza,</hi> since he denys them
those blessings, which he bountifull
gives the Rich, and in causing them to
be born in a mean condition exposes them
to all the Miseries and ignominy of life,
is it not a sign, that he has neither kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
nor value for them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:48349:278"/>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> deny'd the Consequence of
that proposition; and argu'd both from
the Principles of Morality, which look
on Riches as false goods, and out of the
grounds of Christianity, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Salvation, count them true evils:
he reason'd thereupon so justly, and
withal so clearly, that his Adversaries
were forc'd to give up the cause, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Relation of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
who was witness of it. After this, they
advanc'd such extravagant and mad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
that they cost the Father no
trouble to confute; for they destroy'd
themselves. But the most pleasant part
of this days work was, that the seven
<hi>Bonza's</hi> not being able to agree, on some
points of Doctrine, fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and wrangled with so much heat
and violence, that at last they came to
down-right railing; and had proceeded
to blows, if the King had not interpos'd
his Authority, which frighten'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
quiet. This was the end of that days
disputation; and nothing more confirm'd
the minds of the Auditors, on the side
of <hi>Xavier,</hi> than to see his Adversaries at
Civil Wars amongst themselves.</p>

next morning, with a great attendance,
to walk in the Town, according to his
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48349:278"/>
custom, and passing by the house where
the <hi>Portugueses</hi> lodg'd, sent a message to
the holy man, desiring him to come to
his Gardens, where he wou'd shew him
sport, provided he came well arm'd;
for he was to kill with one blow two
<hi>Kites</hi> or <hi>Puttocks,</hi> at the least, out of
those seven, which yesterday endeavour'd
to have pull'd out his eyes. <hi>Xavier,</hi>
who easily understood his meaning,
came out to pay him his respects, and
to acknowledge the honour which was
done him. The King took him by the
hand, and led him to the Palace amidst
the acclamations of the People. The
seven <hi>Bonza's</hi> represented by the seven
<hi>Kites,</hi> were already in the Hall, with
a confirm'd impudence, and so much
the more haughty, as they had the less
reason so to be: according to the usual
character of vain and self-opinion'd
men.</p>
            <p>The first step they made in order to

wherein they declar'd void the sentence
of the Umpires, appeal'd from them, and
set forth new objections and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
upon the questions formerly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The King answer'd himself, that
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:48349:279"/>
those Points which had been decided,
had no need of any further explanation:
and that they were already ty'd up, by
the Conditions of the Conference, which
both Parties had accepted. He added,
that Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was ready to go on
Ship-board; and that it was not reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to lose time by fruitless repetitions;

by an equivocal sound; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

at this ridiculous exception, which was

               <hi>on which the</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's
<hi>more insisted, were thought to be
more solid, and of greater consequence.
The first was propos'd on this manner:</hi>
Either God foresaw that <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his
Accomplices wou'd revolt and be damn'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
or he foresaw it not. If he had no
foresight of it, his prescience did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so far, as you wou'd have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
but if he foresaw it, the consequence
is worse, that he did not hinder this Revolt,
which had prevented their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Your God, being as you say, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all goodness, must now be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by you, for the original cause of so
much evil. Thus you are forc'd, <hi>said the</hi>
Bonza, to confess, either ignorance or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in your God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> was so much amaz'd to hear
a <hi>Bonza</hi> reasoning like a School-man, that

that he might not be understood
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:48349:280"/>
by the <hi>Iaponians) see how the Devil has
sharpen'd the Wit of these his Advocates.</hi>
In the mean time, one of the <hi>Bonza's</hi>
coming up to the charge, said, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the same Principle, <hi>That if God
had foreknown that</hi> Adam <hi>wou'd sin, and
cast down together with himself his whole
Progeny into an Abyss of miseries, why did
he create him? At least when our first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

why did God let so many Ages pass
away, without giving it a remedy? Why
did he not descend from Heaven, and make
himself Man, to redeem humane kind, by
his death and sufferings, as soon as ever
Man was guilty? To what degree did th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who had read whatsoever the Fathers,
and School Divines had said concerning

to their Doctrine; but the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese,</hi>
who relates the Objections, durst
not undertake to write the Solutions of
them, if we will believe himself, because
they surpass'd the Understanding of a
Merchant. The <hi>Bonza's</hi> made many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
to all which the Father gave the
proper Solutions in few words, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of the Schools:
whether it were that they comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the Solutions, or were it out of their
hot-headedness, or that they seem'd not
to understand them, to avoid the shame
of being bassled, they yeilded not, but
cry'd out louder than before. As they
disputed more for Victory than Truth,
they deny'd all things, even to those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which are self-evident; pretending
thereby to encumber their Opponent.
<hi>Xavier</hi> knew what use to make of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
he turn'd the Confusion upon
them, by reducing them to manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
from whence they cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
disingage themselves. So that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of answering, they gnash'd their
Teeth, foam'd at Mouth and stamp'd,
and star'd about like Mad-men. The
King, whose Indignation was rais'd, by
seeing the obstinacy of the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> said
to them in a kind of Passion, <hi>As for my
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48349:281"/>
self, as far as I am capable of judging, I
find that Father</hi> Xavier <hi>speaks good Sence,
and that you know not what you say. You
shou'd either understand better, or be less
violent, than you appear, to judge of these
Truths without prejudice. But if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law be wanting to you, make use of
your Reason, which of it self will let you see,
that you are not to deny things which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
nor to bark like Dogs.</hi> After these
words he rose from his Seat, and taking
<hi>Xavier</hi> by the Hand, brought him back
to his own Lodging. The people, who
follow'd in great multitudes, made loud
acclamations, and the Streets rung with
the Praises of the holy Man. While the
<hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's,</hi> mad with rage and envy, cry'd
out aloud, <hi>May the fire of Heaven fall
down upon a Prince, who suffers himself to
be so easily seduc'd, by this Foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus concluded the Disputations which
he had with <hi>Fucarandono</hi> and the <hi>Bonza's:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fruit of his Disputation with the <hi>Bonza's.</hi>
               </note>
They were very glorious for him, and
for the Religion which he preach'd; but
brought not forth the expected fruit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Idolaters who were present at
them. For neither the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whom we have frequently cited,

make mention of any new Conversions
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:48349:281"/>
which were made; and it affords great
occasion for our wonder, that the Lords
of the Court, who so much approv'd the
Doctrine of Christianity, shou'd still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the practice of Idolatry, and of
their Vices: If it were not always to be
remembred, that in Conversion, the
light of the Understanding avails nothing,
unless the Heart be also touch'd; and that
the Philosophers, of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks, <hi>having known God, did not glorify
him as God.</hi> Nevertheless we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
believe, that these Disputations in
progress of time fail'd not of their due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:

that the <hi>Iavans,</hi> a fierce and warlike

three hundred <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who were

had only escap'd by retiring into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.
In short, that <hi>Malacca</hi> was now
become a place of horrour; and that the
Enemy wearied with the slaughter, had
reserv'd many thousands of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

               </gap>t the Port; and declar'd to them, that
the sins of that corrupt City had drawn
down the Curse of God upon it, as he

them at the same time, to supplicate
the Father of all Mercies, for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his Divine Justice, and the himself

from the King of <hi>Bungo,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
with him in the same Vessel. The
business of this Embassy was to seek the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48349:282"/>
friendship of the Viceroy of the <hi>Indies;</hi>
and to obtain a Preacher from him,
who might finish the Conversion of that

belonging to the King of <hi>Minaco,</hi> call'd
<hi>Meleitor:</hi> From whence crossing a

At that time the change of the
Moon alter'd the Weather; and there
blew a furious South-wind, so that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
with all his Art cou'd not bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. The Tempest carry'd the Ship
into a Sea, unknown to the <hi>Portugueses;</hi>
and the Face of Heaven was so black
with Clouds, that during five days and
nights there was no appearance of Sun
or Stars: Insomuch, that the Mariners
were not able to take the Elevation of
the Pole, and consequently not to know
vvhereabouts they were. One day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Evening, the Wind redoubled
with so much fury, that the Vessel had
not povver to break the Waves, so high
the vvent, and came on with so much
violence. In this terrible conjuncture
they thought sit to cut down the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,
that the Ship might work the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

at the same time, vvhich increas'd the
Tempest, they cou'd not draw out of
the Sloop five <hi>Portugueses</hi> and ten <hi>Indians,</hi>
as well as Slaves and Mariners, which
vvere in her.</p>
            <p>Those of the Ship had neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
nor hope remaining,<note place="margin">How <hi>Xavier</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He exhorted them to lament their Sins,
thereby to appease the wrath of God,
and he himself pour'd forth whole show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Tears before the Face of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
When night was now at the
darkest, a lamentable cry was heard, as
of people just upon the brink of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and calling out for succour. The
noise came from the Sloop, vvhich the
violence of Winds had torn off from the
Vessel, and which the Waves were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away. As soon as the Captain
had notice of it, he order'd the Pilot to
turn towards those poor Creatures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering, that by his endeavour of
saving his Nephevv <hi>Alphonso Calvo,</hi> vvho
was one of the five <hi>Portugueses</hi> in the
Sloop, the Ship must certainly be lost,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:48349:283"/>
and himself with her. In effect, as it
vvas difficult to steer the Ship, when
they vvou'd have turn'd her tovvards the
Sloop, she came across betwixt tvvo
Mountains of Water, which lock'd her
up betwixt them; one of those Waves
fell upon the Poop, and wash'd over the
Deck; and then it was, that the whole
Company thought their business was
done, and nothing but cries and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were heard on every side. <hi>Xavier,</hi>
who was at his Prayers in the Captain's
Cabin, ran out toward the noise, and
saw a miserable object, the Vessel ready
to bulge, the Seamen, the Souldiers, and
the Passengers, all tumbling in confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on each other, deploring their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
destiny, and expecting nothing
but present death. Then the holy Man
lifting up his Eyes and Hands to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
said thus aloud, in the transport of
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ship which already was sinking under
Water, rais'd her self aloft, without any
visible assistance, and gain'd the surface
of the Waves. The Mariners encourag'd
by so manifest a Miracle, so order'd the
Sails, that they had the Wind in Poop,
and pursu'd their course.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="544" facs="tcp:48349:284"/>In the mean time the Sloop was vanish'd

she was swallow'd by the Waves. The
Captain lamented for his Nephew, the
rest shed tears for their lost Companions.
As for the Father, his greatest affliction
was for two <hi>Mahometan</hi> Slaves, whom he
cou'd not convert to Christianity. He
sigh'd, in thinking of their deplorable
condition, but in the midst of these anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thoughts, entring into himself, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly recollecting himself in God,
it came into his mind to intercede with
Heaven for the protection of the Sloop,
in case it were not already lost. In this
he follow'd the inspiration of the holy
Spirit, and his Prayer was not yet ended,
when he perceiv'd that it was heard:
Insomuch, that turning towards <hi>Edward
de Gama,</hi> who was oppress'd with sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>Afflict not your self, my Brother,</hi>
said he, with a chearful Countenance,
<hi>before three days are ended, the Daughter
will come back, and find the Mother.</hi> The
Captain was so buried in his grief, that
he savv too little probability in what the
Father said, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound any strong belief
upon it. Which notwithstanding, at
break of day, he sent one up to the Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to see if any thing were within ken:
but nothing was discover'd, saving the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:48349:284"/>
Sea, which was still troubled, and white
with foam. The Father, who had been
in private at his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>votions, came out
two hours after, with the same chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
upon his Countenance; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given the good day to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Pilot, and six or seven <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi>
who were in Company, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
<hi>If they had not yet seen the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop?</hi>
they answer'd they had not: and
because he desir'd that some one might
again get up to the Scuttle, one of the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> call'd <hi>Pedro Veglio,</hi> reply'd
thus bluntly, <hi>Yes Father, the Chalop will
return, but not 'till another be lost:</hi> he
meant that it was impossible the same
Chalop shou'd come again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> mildly reprehended <hi>Veglio</hi> for
his little Faith;<note place="margin">He expects the return of the Chalop (or Cockb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have put under the protection of the
<hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> and for whose sake I have
vow'd to say three Masses to our <hi>Lady
of the Mountain,</hi> shall not perish. After
this, he urg'd <hi>Gama</hi> to send up to the
Scuttle for discovery: <hi>Gama,</hi> to satisfie
the man of God, went up himself with a
Sea-man; and after having look'd round
him for the space of half an hour, neither he
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48349:285"/>
nor the other cou'd see any thing. In
the mean time, <hi>Xavier,</hi> whose stomach
was turn'd with the tossing of the Ship,
and who had been two days and three
nights, without eating, was taken with
a violent head-ach, and such a giddiness,
that he cou'd scarcely stand. One of
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants, call'd <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
Mendez Pinto,</hi> desir'd him to repose
a little while, and offer'd him his Cabin;
<hi>Xavier,</hi> who by the Spirit of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
usually lay upon the Deck, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his courtesie, and desir'd this further
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour, that the Servant of this Merchant,
who was a <hi>Chinese,</hi> might watch before
the door, that none might interrupt his
rest.</p>
            <p>The intention of the Father,<note place="margin">He renews his Prayers for the return of the Chalop.</note> was not
to give the least refreshment to his Body:
he set himself again to Prayers, and it
was affirm'd by the <hi>Chinese</hi> Servant, that
from seven in the morning, when he
retir'd, he had been constantly on his
knees, 'till the evening, groaning in the
agony of his Spirit, and shedding tears.
He came out from his retirement after
Sun set, and once more enquir'd of the
Pilot, if they had not seen the Chalop,
which cou'd not possibly be far distant.
The Pilot reply'd, that it was in vain
to think of her, and that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48349:285"/>
for her to resist so furious a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.
But in case that by some wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
accident, or rather by some miracle,
she had been preserv'd, she must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty leagues distance from
the Ship. <hi>'Tis the propriety of Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to remain unshaken, and secure,
when humane reason leaves us destitute of
hope.</hi> The Saint acknowledg'd, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
to have spoken judiciously, and yet
doubted not but the Chalop wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
He constantly maintain'd, that
she cou'd not be far off; and press'd him
to send up to the Scuttle before the dusk.
The Pilot, less out of complaisance to the
Father, than out of his desire to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, went up himself, and cou'd
discover nothing. <hi>Xavier,</hi> without any
regard to the affirmation of the Pilot,
instantly desir'd the Captain to lower
the Sails; that the Chalop might more
easily come up with the Ship. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the holy man, carri'd it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reasons of the Pilot: The Sail-yard
was lower'd; and a stop was made
for almost three hours. But at length,
the Passengers grew weary, as not being
able any longer to bear the rowling of
the Ship, and one and all cry'd ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
Sail. The Father upbraided them with
their impatience: and himself laid hold
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48349:286"/>
on the Sail-yard, to hinder the Seamen,
from spreading the Sails: and leaning
his head over it, broke out into sighs
and sobbings, and pour'd out a deluge
of tears.</p>
            <p>He rais'd himself a little after,<note place="margin">He prays once more for the return of the Chalop.</note> and
keeping his eyes fix'd on Heaven, yet
wet with tears; <hi>O Iesus, my Lord and
my God,</hi> said he, <hi>I beseech thee by thy
holy Passion, to have pity on those poor
People, who are coming to us, through the
midst of so many dangers.</hi> He compos'd
himself, after he had utter'd this, and
continu'd leaning on the Sail-yard, wholly
silent, for some time, as if he had been
sleeping.</p>
            <p>Then a little Child,<note place="margin">The Chalop ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and comes up with the Ship.</note> who was sitting
at the foot of the Mast, cry'd out on
the sudden, <hi>a Miracle a Miracle, behold
the Chalop.</hi> All the Company gather'd
together at the cry, and plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Chalop within musquet shot.
Nothing but shouts and exclamations of
joy were heard, while she drew still
nearer and nearer to the Vessel. In the
mean time, the greatest part fell down
at the Feet of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
they were Sinners, unworthy
the Company of a man so holy, ask'd
him pardon for their Unbelief. But the
Father, in great confusion, for being
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48349:286"/>
treated in this manner, escap'd out of
their hands as soon as possibly he cou'd;
and shut himself up within the Cabin.
In conclusion, the Chalop came up with
the Ship; and it was observ'd, that
though the Waves were in great agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
she came right forward, without
the least tossing, and stop'd of her self.
It was also taken notice of, that she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
without any motion, 'till the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
men which she carri'd, were enter'd
the Ship, and that the Seamen had
fasten'd her behind the Poop. When
they had embrac'd those men, whom so
lately that had given for lost, every one
was desirous of knowing their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and were much surpris'd to
understand, that they were come through
the midst of the most horrible tempest,
which was ever seen, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
either of drowning, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their way: because, <hi>said they,</hi>
Father <hi>Francis</hi> was our Pilot, and his
presence freed us even from the shadow
of any fear. When the Ships Company
assur'd them, that the Father had been
always with themselves, those of the
Chalop, who had beheld him constantly
steering it, cou'd not believe what had
been told them. After some little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
on the matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>act, both sides
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:48349:287"/>
concluded, that the Saint had been at
the same time in two places: And this
evident Miracle, made such an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the minds of the two <hi>Saracen</hi>
Slaves, who had been in the Chalop,
that they abjur'd their <hi>Mahometism.</hi> The
impatience of these fifteen men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their miraculous Steersman, who
had so happily brought them to the
Ship, and who vanish'd from their eyes,
at the same moment, when they joyn'd
her, oblig'd <hi>Xavier</hi> to come out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
shew himself. They wou'd have saluted
him as their Protectour, by prostrating
themselves before him, but he wou'd not
suffer it: declaring to them, that it was
the hand of the Lord, and not his,
which had deliver'd them from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.
At the same time he render'd
publick thanks to God, for so eminent
a favour, and order'd the Pilot to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his Voyage, assuring him, that he
shou'd have a good wind immediately.
The Pilots Experience of the Sea, did
not promise him this sudden change;
but this late deliverance of the Chalop,
quicken'd his belief in the Fathers words;
and it was not long, before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that he who commands the winds
and Seas, had authoris'd the holy man
to make that Prediction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="551" facs="tcp:48349:287"/>The Sails were scarcely spread,<note place="margin">He arrives at the Isle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a north wind arising, the air clear'd up,
and the Sea was immediately calm'd.
So that in thirteen days sailing, they
arriv'd at the Port of <hi>Sancian,</hi> where
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants of the Ship had
traffique. As the season of sailing in
those Seas, was already almost past,
there were remaining but two Ships of
the <hi>Indies</hi> in Port; one of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to <hi>Iames de Pereyra.</hi> The Ship
of <hi>Edward de Gama</hi> not being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

without stopping by the way, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Saint went into the Ship of his friend
<hi>Pereyra.</hi> It was wonderful, that at the

Vessel, the wind which for the space of
fifteen days had blown at North, which
was full in their faces, who were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the <hi>Indies,</hi> came about on the
sudden, so that the day following, which
was the last of the year, 1551, they
set Sail again. Another Ship, which
was waiting also for a wind, set out in
their Company; but that Vessel found
afterwards to her cost, that she carri'd

horrible confusion, the Pilot sat singing
at his ease, as if the Waters had been

shook with fear, demanded of him, <hi>With

just upon the brink of death.</hi> 'Tis because

so mov'd with this continu'd Miracle,
that they vow'd to become Christians,

               <pb n="554" facs="tcp:48349:289"/>
and <hi>China.</hi> The Father told his friend,
what progress the Faith had made in
little time, in the Kingdoms of <hi>Saxuma,</hi>
of <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> and of <hi>Bungo;</hi> and what
hopes he had conceiv'd, to convert all
those Islands with great ease, when once
the <hi>Chineses</hi> shou'd be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And on that
motive, he had fix'd his resolution to
go to <hi>China;</hi> that his return to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
was only in order to this intended
Voyage, after he had regulated the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Society at <hi>Goa.</hi> That on
this account, he had brought with him
from <hi>Iapan,</hi> the Translation of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
into the <hi>Chinese</hi> Language: by
the benefit of which he hop'd to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the first difficulties, which in
matters of Conversion are still the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
Some <hi>Portugueses</hi> who were in the
same Vessel, and were well acquainted
with the Government of <hi>China,</hi> thought
this proposition of the Father not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
extravagant. They told him, that
besides the ill understanding which was
betwixt <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to strangers on pain of death,
or of perpetual imprisonment, to set a
foot upon that Kingdom. And that
the Merchants of their Nation, who had
stoln thither, for the benefit of trade,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:48349:289"/>
having been discover'd, some of them
had lost their heads, others had been put
in Irons, and cast into Dungeons, there
to lye and rott for the remainder of
their lives. They added, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that there was a safe and certain
way of entring into <hi>China,</hi> provided
there was a solemn Embassy sent to the
Emperour of that Country, from the
King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But since that cou'd
not be compass'd without a prodigious
expence, if nothing else were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
but only the Presents for the
Emperour, and his Ministers of State,
in all probability the Viceroy of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
wou'd not burden himself with the

when he had enough to do, to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pereyra</hi> had yet another thing which

               </note> during a great calm, vvhich
made the Navigation pleasing; vvhen
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48349:290"/>
suddenly they perceiv'd one of those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Hurricanes arising, vvhich in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sink a Vessel. All the Company
gave themselves for lost; or if they
had any hope remaining, it was only in
consideration of the Saint; and therefore
they earnestly desir'd him, to intercede
vvith God in their behalf. The holy
Man, without replying, retir'd to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions:
he return'd to them not long
after vvith his Countenance all on Fire,
and gave his blessing to the Ship, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
these follovving words aloud;
<hi>This Vessel of the</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The holy Cross.</note> Santa Cruz, (for so
she was nam'd) <hi>shall never perish on the
Seas; the place where she was built, shall
behold her fall in pieces of her self. Might
it please Almighty God,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>that
the same cou'd be said, concerning that
Vessel which put to Sea with us! But we shall
be witnesses too soon of her unhappy destiny!</hi>
At that very instant appear'd the signs,
which were to begin the verification of
the Prophecy; the Whirlwind vvas dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and the Sea grew calm. Not
long afterwards, they beheld the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,
and dead Bodies, floating on
the Waters, and from thence concluded,
that the Hurricane had destroy'd the Ship
vvhich follow'd them. Immediately
their Opinion was confirm'd by two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:48349:291"/>
vvho had gotten on a Plank,
vvhen the Ship vvas foundering; and
who having aftervvards struggl'd vvith
the Waves, vvere driven by them to the
Board of <hi>Pereyra's</hi> Vessel. The rest of
the Navigation was prosperous; a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
season was never known. The Ship
being landed at the Port of <hi>Sincapour,

also by the same conveyance, to Father
<hi>Francis Perez,</hi> Superiour of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> at
<hi>Malacca,</hi> and commanded all of them to
provide refreshments for the <hi>Iaponneses,</hi>
vvho came along with him.</p>

               </note>
that it almost blotted out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of all they had suffer'd in
the War. The Inhabitants ran crouding
to the Shore, and at the first appearance
of the Saint, nothing was to be heard,
but acclamations and shouts of rejoicing
on every side. They receiv'd him at his
landing, with all the tenderness of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and all the Reverence imaginable.
In conducting him to the House of the
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48349:291"/>
Society, they shew'd him, as he pass'd
along, the Ruines of their Houses, and
told him sighing, <hi>That if he had not left
them, they had been preserv'd from the fury
of the</hi> Javans, <hi>as they had formerly been
protected from the</hi> Barbarians <hi>of</hi> Achen. But
the Father answer'd them, <hi>That their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sins had call'd down the wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon them. That nothing cou'd divert
it, but a speedy change of life; and that
the only means of reconciling themselves to
God, was to receive those chastisements at
his Hands, with the Spirit of Humiliation
and of Penitence.</hi> He visited the old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<hi>Don Pedro de Silva,</hi> and the new
one, who succeeded him, <hi>Don Alvarez
de Atayda,</hi> and communicated to them
his design, concerning an Embassy to
<hi>China.</hi> Both of them concurr'd in the
Opinion, that it wou'd be advantageous
to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of Christianity. <hi>Iames Pereyra</hi>
not being capable of accompanying the
Father to <hi>Goa,</hi> for the reason above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
furnish'd him at present with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Crowns, for the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of that intended Voyage; and sent
a Servant with the Father, vvith Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

enter'd with his <hi>Iaponians,</hi> into the Vessel

from vvhence she departed at the same
time, when <hi>Xavier</hi> went on board of
<hi>Antonio,</hi> her Reputation was extended
over all the <hi>East.</hi> Wheresoever she ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
she was receiv'd vvith Ceremony,
and saluted by all other Ships with the
honour of their Canon. All Merchants
were desirous of stowing their Goods in
her, and willingly paid the Carriage of their
Wares, and the dues of Custom, beyond
the common price of other Vessels. The
weight of Lading vvas never consider'd,
but her Freight was alvvays as much as
they cou'd croud into her. As she lasted
very long, and that thirty years after
the decease of the Father she vvas in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was us'd for the traffick of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> they never fail'd of lading her
with an extraordinary Cargo, all worn
and Worm-eaten as she was. The Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
into whose hands she came, during
the space of those thirty years took on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this one precaution, vvhich was to
keep her off from Shore; so that
when she was to be resitted, that vvork
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:48349:292"/>
was constantly done upon the Sea. As
to vvhat remains, 'tis true she met with
many ill accidents and hardships; she
was often ingag'd vvith Pyrates, and
combated by Tempests: but she escap'd
clear of all those dangers, and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one repented of embarking in her.
One time 'tis acknowledg'd, sailing
from <hi>Malacca,</hi> to <hi>Cochin,</hi> with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
lading, she sprung a leak, and
took in so much Water, at the beginning
of the Voyage, that the Passengers, who
were very numerous, were of Opinion
to unlade her of half her burden, and
half her Men, and to put them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ships, vvhich were in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But those Vessels, vvhich had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
their whole lading, wou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to ease the <hi>Santa Cruz;</hi> so that fear
overpowring the Ships Company, they
return'd speedily into the Port. The
whole Tovvn was surpris'd to see th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>essel of the Saint.
Being thus pulickly upbraided vvith their
vvant of Faith, to mend their Errour,
they took out nothing of the Lading,
but put again to Sea. And vvhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

who perceiving her to be half rotten,
and open'd in diverse parts, concluded
she cou'd serve no longer, unless she
were brought into harbour, and set upon
the Stocks. For which purpose she was
sent to <hi>Cochin,</hi> and hal'd ashore on the
same Dock where she had been built; but
she was no sooner there, than she fell in
pieces of her self; nothing remaining of
that great bulk, besides Planks and
Beams of Timber, unprofitable for any
thing, but for the Fire. The Inhabitants
of <hi>Cochin,</hi> vvho knew the Prediction of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Saint, to every Circumstance, came
out to behold its accomplishment. An
inconsiderable Merchant, call'd <hi>George
Nugnez,</hi> who happen'd to be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
began to think within himself, that
there might be yet remaining in those
Planks, somewhat of the Vertue, which
the blessing of the Saint had imprinted
in them; and thereupon took one of
them, which he caus'd to be nail'd to
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:48349:293"/>
his own Frigate, out of the perswasion
he had, that with this assistance he shou'd
be secure from Shipwrack. Thus being
fill'd with a lively Faith, he boldly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
such long, and hazardous
Voyages, that Ships of the greatest bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vvere affraid to make: and without
consideration of the weather, adventur'd
many times to cross the most tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gulphs. When he was told, that it
vvas not the part of a prudent Man, to
endanger himself in that manner, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
<hi>That the Winds and Seas were
well acquainted with his Fright, and had a
Reverence for the Plank of the</hi> Santa
Cruz: In effect, his little Vessel, vvas ever
fortunate enough, to escape the greatest
perils: and vvhat was most remarkable,
was, That having had the same destiny
vvith the Ship in her Adventures, and

the year 1552. The King of the <hi>Maldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's</hi>
had been there, for some months:
He was a Prince of about twenty years
of age, born in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and bred up in the hatred of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:48349:294"/>
The revolt of his Subjects, who
lov'd him not, or hated the Government,
forc'd him for the safeguard of his life,
to abandon his Kingdom, and to seek San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
amongst the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> by
whom he hop'd to be restor'd. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Society receiv'd him into their
House, and went about to convert him,
by letting him see the falsehood of his
Sect. The ill posture of his Affairs,
made him apt to receive the instructions
which vvere given him by Father <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
Heredia,</hi> who endeavour'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
with great Zeal. But his fear of
farther exasperating his Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in case he chang'd his Religion,
caus'd him to defer that change from
time to time; and perhaps he had never
forsaken the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if Father
<hi>Francis</hi> had not arriv'd to compleat that
work, which <hi>Heredia</hi> had begun. The
holy Apostle preach'd the word vvith so

that at length he reduc'd him to the
obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> notwithstanding all
the motives of worldly interest to the
contrary. Having instructed him anew in
the Mysteries of Christianity, he solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baptis'd him. In sequel of which, he
excited the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to replace him on
the Throne, and nominated some of the
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:48349:294"/>
Fathers to accompany the Naval Army,
which shou'd be sent to the <hi>Maldivia's.</hi>
His intention was, that they shou'd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Conversion of the whole
Kingdom, when once the King shou'd be
establish'd. But because it was of small
importance to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
that those Islands, which produce neither
Gold, nor Spices, nor Perfumes, shou'd
be made tributary to it, the Governours
did nothing for that exil'd Prince; who
despairing to recover his Dominions,
marri'd a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and liv'd a private
life, till the day of his death: Happy
only in this, that the loss of his Crown,
was made up to him, by the gift of Faith,
and the Grace of Baptism.</p>

visited the sick in the Town-Hospitals;

which was the House of the Society. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ordinary embracements, which
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:48349:295"/>
were more tender than ever, he enquir'd
if none were sick within the Colledge?
He was answer'd, there was only one,
who was lying at the point of death.
Immediately <hi>Xavier</hi> went, and read the
Gospel over him. At the sight of the
Father the dying man recover'd his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and was restor'd to health. The
Physicians had given him over, and all
things had been order'd for his burial:
But he himself had never despair'd of his
recovery; and the day when <hi>Xavier</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
he said with a dying voice, <hi>That
if God wou'd grant him the favour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

            </p>
            <p>The Relation which <hi>Xavier</hi> made to

               </note> concerning the Church
of <hi>Iapan,</hi> was infinitely pleasing to
them: And he himself was fill'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
consolation, in learning from them
the present condition of Christianity in
the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Missioners whom he
had dispers'd before his departure, were
almost all of them united at his return.
Some of them were come by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and others of their own motion,
concerning urgent business; as if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit had re-assembl'd them expresly,
that the presence of the Man of God,
might redouble in them their Apostolick
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:48349:295"/>
Zeal, and Religious Fervour. God had
every where blest their labours. The
Town of <hi>Ormus,</hi> which fell to the lott
of Father <hi>Gaspar Barzaeus,</hi> had wholly
chang'd its Countenance: <hi>Idolaters, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi>
and <hi>Iews</hi> ran in multitudes to
Baptism: The Temples of Idols were
consecrated to Christ; the Mosques and
Synagogues were dispeopled, ill Manners
were reform'd, and ill Customs totally
abolish'd. Christianity flourish'd more
than ever in the Coast of <hi>Fishery,</hi> since
the death of Father <hi>Antonio Criminal,</hi>
who had cultivated it with care, and in
that cultivation was massacred by the
<hi>Badages.</hi> The blood of the Martyr seem'd
to have multiply'd the Christians; they

to lay down their lives for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The Gospel had not made less

and at <hi>Meliapore,</hi> at the <hi>Molucca's,</hi>
and in the Isles <hi>del Moro.</hi> Put it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
incredible, with what profit, the
Gospel Labourers preach'd at <hi>Goa.</hi> All
the Priests of Idols had been driven out
of the Isle of <hi>Goa,</hi> by Order from the
Governour, and at the solicitation of
one of the Fathers, belonging to the
Colledge of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It was also prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,

under severe Penalties, to perform
any publick action of Idolatry within
the District of <hi>Goa:</hi> and those Ordinances
by little and little, reduc'd a multitude
of Gentils. As for the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> their

and Concubines were now as scarce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as

In the mean time, the wars which

Religion, was worse than irreligion; and
that <hi>Iesus</hi> wou'd disown before his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
those who disown'd him before

and resolv'd to declare himself so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
a Christian, as soon as he had

concluded a Peace through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation

The rest of the Lords follow'd his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,

to have an understanding much above

The great performances of your Children,

of Faith, and principally at the Cape
of <hi>Comorin,</hi> all this obliges me to write to
your Reverence, and to give testimony of
what I have beheld with my own Eyes.
Indeed, the Fathers of your Society are
admirable labourers in our Lords Vineyard;
and are so faithfully subservient to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
that their endeavours for the good of
those Souls, with which I am intrusted,
give me hope of remaining the fewer years
in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> I dare not undertake the
relation of all their particular Actions, and
if I durst adventure it, want time for the
performance of it; I will only tell you, that
they are here like Torches lighted up, to
dissipate the thick darkness, wherein these
barbarous people were benighted; and that
already by their means, many Nations of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
believe one God in three persons:
For what remains, I freely grant them all
they require of me for the good of Souls.
Every one of them partakes with me in my
Power and Authority, without appropriating
any of it to my self: and I look upon my
self, as one of the Members of that holy
Body, though my life arises not to their
perfection. In one word, I love them all

were yet but Novices in the Faith, and
scarcely to be accounted Christians, he
enjoin'd them the practices of the most
perfect interiour life, which they cou'd
not possibly under stand; and as they
cou'd not acquit themselves of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
which were too sublime for them,
he fail'd not to punish them severely.
From thence arose Murmurs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,

seize on those young ill-treated <hi>Indians:</hi>
and from thence: also it came to pass,
that many of them, not able to endure

the least contradiction, upon this became
more assuming, and fantastical. So that
one day, he turn'd out, all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scholars of the Seminary; as if they
had been uncapable of Discipline: and
receiving into their places, seven and,
twenty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who desir'd to be of

Bishop <hi>Don Iuan d' Albuquerque,</hi> who was

fear'd to increase the distemper, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to cure it. Neither was the
Rectour so confin'd to <hi>Goa,</hi> that he made
not frequent sallies into the Country;
whether his natural activity wou'd not

requir'd a larger sphere; or that, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, to make a false step, that is, having
much opiniatreté, great credit, and good

the people, who had been hitherto

what had pass'd; presented to them the

to them. But submission sometimes
gains, that which haughty carriage goes

was unworthy of the Society of <hi>Iesus;</hi>
which notwithstanding, he was not
willing to pull off his Habit at <hi>Goa,</hi> for

he sent him to the Fortress of <hi>Diu,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Cambaya;</hi> with Orders, to the

his infirmities.</hi> The Saint, who had a

not hearken to him, and judg'd him to
be so much the more worthy of those

to be uncapable. As <hi>Barzaeus</hi> was the

                  </gap>rem Dei gloriam;</hi> to God's
greater honour. Those Instructions are
very ample; and I shall give you onely
the most material.</p>
            <p>Have before your eyes continually your
own nothingness, and endeavour above all
things to have your mind so possess'd with
it, that the contempt of your self may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave you. Always treat the Fathers
of the Society with great mildness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
as well those who inhabit with you,
as those who live in other places, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
let not the least rough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess, or
haughty carriage appear in you, if it be
not when your moderation and humility are
turn'd into contempt; for on such occasions,
having nothing in your intentions but the good
of your Inferiours, and not making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of your authority the object of your
vengeance, you are to make the guilty some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
sensible of your power. But you shall
only punish them so far as need requires,
and for their amendment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion
of our Brethren, who were witnesses of
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:48349:307"/>
their fault. All the offences which shall
be committed either by the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thers or the
Brothers against the rule of obedience, ought
to be punish'd by some correction: and in
so doing, the Character of Priesthood, must
be no priviledge to the Offendour. If any
of your Inferiours, act presumptuously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, and full of self-opinion, resist
you with stubbornness, raise your self in
opposition to their pride; and speak magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially
to them: let your behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, have more of severity than
of mildness. Impose some publick penance
on them: and beware of all things, that
they may not observe in you the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness,
which they will be sure to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
fear; for nothing more encourages the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tractable and haughty to Rebellion, than
the softness and fearful spirit of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And it is not credible, how assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
proud, and peremptory they will grow,
when once they find the reins are slacken'd,
and that their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>silanimous Superiour is
afraid of punishing their want of due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
Impunity hardens that sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their insolence; or rather, it makes
them more and more audacious; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs
the peace of Religious Houses. Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
then my Orders, without fearing the
opinion or speech of People: and let no
consideration, no regard of persons, hinder
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:48349:308"/>
you from the performance of your duty.
Amongst your Inferiours, you will find
some, who are neither obstinate nor disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
but who are weak; who are forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of what is enjoyn'd them, who indeed
despise not the Orders of their Superiours,
but sometimes neglect them, either out of
faintheartedness, or want of sence. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
such men, with more gentleness
and moderation, and temper your reproof
with the mildness of your countenance; and
if you find it necessary so punish them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
but an easie penance on them. Never
admit into the Society, such as are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
with judgement, and good natural
parts: nor those who are of a weak consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and proper for no employment, or
of whom you may reasonably suspect, that
they wou'd enter into Religion for secular
respects, rather than out of a sincere devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of serving God. When they shall
have ended their exercises, you are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them in the service of the Sick, in the
publick Hospitals, and in the meanest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the House. You shall cause them t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
give you an account of the endeavours they
have made, to acquit themselves well of
their ordinary meditations, according to the
form prescrib'd. If you are assur'd, that
they are luke-warm and faint, at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
you will do well to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>smiss them,
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:48349:308"/>
and turn them out of the Society betimes:
or, if there be any hope of their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you shall withdraw them for some
days from those interiour exercises; depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them by way of penance, of an honour
which their negligence has made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to enjoy; (and such indeed is that
of communicating with God in Prayer) to
the end that being asham'd, to stand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from that coelestial commerce, they
may desire more ardently to be re-admitted
to it. I recommend extreamly to you, that
you pay an extraordinary respect to my
Lord the Bishop; and that you be obedient
to him. Beware of doing any thing which
may displease him: Endeavour, on the
contrary, to serve him in all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your power: and acknowledge by
all manner of good Offices, those infinite
obligations which we have to so charitable
a Father and Benefactour. Command those
Fathers who are out of <hi>Goa,</hi> to write to
him from time to time, but not too prolixly:
and to give him an account of the fruit of
their labours. That they mention in their
Letters, as far as truth will give them
leave, the commendation of his Vicars;
and omit not the other good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious:
and if they can say no good of them,
let them be silent of them; for we are not
to imagine that our duty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liges us, to
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:48349:309"/>
complain to the Bishop, of the ill conduct of
his Vicars, or of other Gospel-Labourers:
There will never be wanting those who will
ease us of that trouble. Beware, not to
trouble your self with the management of
worldly business; nor even to encumber your
Inferiours with it, on any occasion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
When Secular men shall desire to
ingage you in the employments of civil life,
return this answer, <hi>That the time which
remains free to you from preaching, and
the administration of the Sacraments, is
scarce sufficient for your studies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
which are yet necessary to you
before you go into the Pulpit, or appear
in the Tribune of Penance: that you
cannot prefer the care of Worldly things,
before the cure of Souls, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Order and Rule of Charity.</hi>
By this means you shall disengage your self
from all those sorts of encumbrances; and
without this circumspection, you will do
great prejudice to the Society: for you
ought to understand, that the World often
enters by this door into Religious Houses,
to the extream damage both of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and of Religion.</p>
            <p>In the visits which are made to you,
endeavour to find out the bottom and end
of their design, who come to see you. For
some there are, the least part of whose bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness

Merchandises were ready to be cast over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
when Father <hi>Francis</hi> desir'd the
Captain not to be too hasty. But the
Sailours saying, that the Tempest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
as usually it does towards eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Vessel cou'd not so convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be disburden'd in the dark, he bid
them not disturb themselves about it, for
the storm shou'd cease, and they shou'd
make Land before Sun-set. The Captain,
who knew how certain the Predictions
of <hi>Xavier</hi> were, made not the least scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of believing him; and the event ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd
the Prophecy. The Sea grew calm,
and Land appear'd before the setting of
the Sun.</p>
            <p>But while every one was rejoicing at
the nearness of the Port,<note place="margin">Before his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Malacca,</hi> he knows the Plague is in the Town.</note> the holy Man
had sadness in his Countenance, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
sigh'd. Some of them enquir'd the
cause, and he bade them pray to God
for the City of <hi>Malacca,</hi> which was visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with an Epidemical disease. <hi>Xavier</hi>
said true, for the sickness was so general,
and so contagious, that it seem'd the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a Pestilence. Malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
rag'd about the Town, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
off the strongest Constitutions in a

almost at sight. In this condition the

the Inhabitants. Every one promis'd

in their expectation.</p>
            <p>So soon as he was set on shore,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> he went
in search of the Sick, and found employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough amongst them for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his Charity. Not a man of
them, but desir'd to confess to Father
<hi>Francis;</hi> and to expire in his Arms; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the popular opinion, that
whoever dy'd in that manner, cou'd not
fail of being sav'd. He ran from Street
to Street with his Companions, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up the poor, who lay languishing
on the ground, for want of succour. He
carry'd them to the Hospitals, and to the
Colledge of the Society, which on this
occasion he chang'd into an Hospital.
And when both the Colledge and the
Hospitals were full, he order'd Cabins to
be built along the Shore, out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of rotten Vessels, for Lodgings,
and necessary uses of those distress'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
After which he procur'd them
Food and Medicines, which he begg'd
from the devouter sort, and himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which appear'd most wonderful, was,
that though the sick cou'd not be serv'd,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:48349:313"/>
nor the dying assisted, nor the dead bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
without taking the infection, and it
was death to take it, yet <hi>Xavier</hi> and his

This indeed was wonderful, but
there was also an undoubted miracle,

took the Habit of the Society.
When the Mortality was almost ceas'd,
the Saint pursu'd his design of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
to <hi>China,</hi> and treated with <hi>Don
Alvarez'd Atayda,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi>
on whom the Viceroy had repos'd
the trust of so important an Affair. <hi>Don
Alvarez</hi> had much approv'd this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
when <hi>Xavier</hi> had first open'd it,
at his return from <hi>Iapan,</hi> and had even
promis'd to favour it with all his power.
But Envy and Interest are two passions,
which stiflxse the most reasonable thoughts,
and make men forget their most solemn
Protestations.</p>
            <p>The Governour had a grudging to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyra,</hi>

who, the year before, had refus'd
to lend him ten thousand Crowns; and
cou'd not endure, that a Merchant shou'd
be sent Ambassadour to the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
in the World. He said, <hi>That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that</hi> Pereyra, <hi>whom the Viceroy had
impower'd by his Letters, was some Lord
of the Court of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and not</hi> James
Pereyra, <hi>who had been Domestick Servant
to</hi> Don Gonsalvo de Cotigno. But that
which most disturb'd him, was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the honour of such an Embassy,
the Merchant shou'd make so vast a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it
of his Wares, which he wou'd sell off
at an excessive rate in <hi>China.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:48349:314"/>
said, <hi>That in his own person, were to
be consider'd the services of the Count his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that those hundred thousand Crowns
which wou'd be gain'd at least by</hi> Pereyra,
<hi>were a more suitable reward for the Son of</hi>
Atayda, <hi>than for the</hi> Valet de Chambre
<hi>of</hi> Cotigno. With such grating thoughts
as these he sought occasions to break off
the Voyage; yet he wou'd not declare
himself at first; and the better to cover
his design, or not to seem unthankful to
Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> he fed him with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
For the holy Man had procur'd
him the command of Captain Major of
of the Sea; and himself had brought
him the provisions for that place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when first the Father had open'd
his purpose of going into <hi>China, Atayda</hi>
seem'd to have espous'd the project with
great affection, and ingag'd himself to
make it succeed, in case the Ports and
Navigations of the <hi>Portugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

depending on him. To oblige him yet
farther, the Saint had procur'd from the
Viceroy, and brought along with him,
certain extraordinary priviledges, which
had not been compris'd in the provisions
of the Command. And lastly, That he
might wholly gain him, at his arrival,
finding the Governour very sick, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him with great diligence, and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:48349:315"/>
made himself at once, both his Nurse
and his Chaplain; watching by him all
the night, and saying Mass for him in the
morning. But all these Offices of
friendship, wrought nothing on a heart,
where Jealousy and Avarice were predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.</p>

quickly discover'd them, and at the same
time wrote to <hi>Pereyra,</hi> who was yet at
<hi>Sunda,</hi> advising him to come without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Equipage, and to affect nothing of
magnificence, that he might not farther
exasperate an interessed and jealous Soul.
But all the modesty of the Ambassadour
cou'd not hinder the Governour from
breaking out. At the first noise of his
arrival, he sent Officers of Justice, and
Souldiers to the Port, with Orders to
make seisure on the Ship call'd <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi>
to take away the Rudder, and give it
into his hands. This was the first act of
Jurisdiction, which was exercis'd by <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against <hi>Xavier</hi> himself, that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which had been procur'd him by
<hi>Xavier,</hi> and pushing his ingratitude as
far as it cou'd go. In the mean time, to
cover his Passion with the pretext of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, according to the common
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:48349:315"/>
practice of men in power, he protested

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oudly, That the interests of the Crown
had constrain'd him to act in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
That he had receiv'd information
from his Spies, that the <hi>Iavans</hi> were
making preparations of War, to come
upon <hi>Malacca,</hi> once again: That he
cou'd not have too many Ships in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
against such formidable Enemies;
and that the <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> was of absolute
necessity to the Kings service. This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which was the product of his own
Brains, was soon exploded by the arrival
of some other <hi>Portuguese</hi> Vessels, who
coming from the Isles of <hi>Iava,</hi> made
Oath, that these <hi>Barbarians</hi> being ingag'd

no thoughts of any Forreign Conquest.
<hi>Don Alvarez</hi> not being able any longer

who made these Remonstrances to him
from the Father; they extended even to
the Saint himself; whom he look'd on,
as the Author, and head of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.
'Tis incredible, what injurious
words he gave him, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> how rudely he
treated him, on several occasions: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:48349:317"/>
that it was the common talk of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> that this Persecution might pass
for the Martyrdom of Father <hi>Xavier.</hi>
The Servant of God resented nothing
which was done to his own person. He
bless'd God continually, for giving him
occasions of suffering; but he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
sensible of what Religion, and
the progress of the Gospel suffer'd, and
was often seen to weep abundantly.</p>
            <p>He ceas'd not for a moneth together
to sollicite the Governour: sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
him by the wounds of a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
Saviour, sometimes urging him with
the fatal consequences of a miserable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and endeavouring to let him
understand, what a crime it was to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the publication of the Gospel; but
these Divine Reasons prevail'd as little
with <hi>Don Alvarez,</hi> as the Humane had
done formerly. This strange obduracy,
quite overwhelm'd the Father, when he
saw that all these ways of mildness were
unsuccessful, and the season of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pass'd away; after he had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
God upon it, he concluded, that
it was time to try the last remedies.
Ten years were now expir'd since his
coming to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and hitherto no
one person, excepting only the Bishop of
<hi>Goa,</hi> was made privy to his being the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:48349:317"/>
Nuncio. He had kept this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
in profound silence, and had not
once exercis'd his power. But now he
thought himself oblig'd to own it, in a
business of so great consequence, and to
strike with the Thunders of the Church,
if occasion were, the Man who made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
War against the Church.</p>

the hand of the Grand Vicer; having
sent for him, he began with shewing
him one of the Briefs of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third,
which constituted him his Nuncio, in all
the Kingdoms of the <hi>East.</hi> After this,
he requested <hi>Suarez</hi> to shew this Brief to
<hi>Don Alvarez,</hi> and to explain to him the
Censures which were incurr'd by those,
who shou'd oppose the Popes Legats in
matters of Religion, and to exhort him,
by what was most holy in the World, to
suffer the Embassy to proceed. In case
of refusal, to threaten him with Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
punishments from the Vicar of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> and to adjure him at the same
time, by the death of the Saviour of
Mankind, to take compassion on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> had always hop'd, that the
Governour wou'd open his Eyes; and in
that writing which he gave the Vicar to
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:48349:318"/>
ingage him in that nice Commission,
there were these following words. <hi>I
cannot believe that Don</hi> Alvarez <hi>can be so

when he shall know the Intentions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Holy See.</hi> He desir'd the
Grand Vicar in the same Writing, to
send that very Paper back to him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the answer of Don <hi>Alvarez,</hi>
that both the one and the other might
be an authentick evidence to the Bishop
of <hi>Goa,</hi> that he had omitted nothing, for
advancing the Embassy; and that if it
succeeded not, the fault lay not at his
door. <hi>Suarez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

according to all the directions
which had been trac'd out to him by the
Father. But nothing cou'd work upon
<hi>Alvarez.</hi> He laught at the threatnings,
and broke out into railing Language a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the person of <hi>Xavier,</hi> saying
loudly, that he was <hi>an ambitious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,

signify'd little to a man, who

you also. And I confess to you, that if
my intentions had not been right, I

The favour which I desire of you, is that
you wou'd not come to see me; for fear

            <p>But though Father <hi>Xavier</hi> wrote very

in favour of <hi>Pereyra,</hi> he wrote nothing

was witness of it, having intercepted
the Letters of the Father. In effect, he
found not the least expression of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against him; at which he was
wonderfully surpris'd. The man of God
daily offer'd the Sacrifice of the Mass
for him, and shed many tears at the
foot of the Altar, to the end he might
obtain for him, the favour of a sincere
Repentance. He said one day, he shou'd
lose at once, his Estate, his Honour, and
his Life; and added, I beseech God that
he lose not his Soul also.</p>
            <p>For what remains, Though the door
of <hi>China</hi> seem'd to be shut upon him,
since all hopes of the Embassy were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
which had facilitated his entrance
into that Kingdom, yet the Saint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair'd
not of preaching the Gospel to
the <hi>Chineses;</hi> and a thought came into
his head, that if he cou'd get to an Isle,
which was neighbouring to <hi>Canton,</hi> he
might from thence go privately over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Continent. That if he were stop'd,
and put in Prison, he shou'd at least
preach to the Prisoners; that from the
Prisons, the Christian Doctrine might
spread into the Towns, and possibly
might reach the Court. That perhaps
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:48349:320"/>
also the great men of the Empire, and
even the Emperour himself, might have
the curiosity to see a man, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and was silent for some time, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with his face to the ground; soon after
he rose up, with a vehement action;
which had somewhat of a holy disdain

one against another, and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying, <hi>that he wou'd not

He then foretold with circumstances at
large, and more than formerly, the
punishments which Heaven had prepar'd
for the Governour of <hi>Malacca;</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on board, left the people who had
follow'd him thus far, astonish'd at his
Prophecies, and afflicted at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Immediately they set sail;<note place="margin">He embarques, and what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens afterwards</note> and there
were in the Vessel above five hundred
persons, counting in the Passengers and
Servants. They were already forward
on their Voyage, when the wind fell on
the sudden; and in a moment the waves
were laid, and the face of the Ocean
grew so smooth, that the <hi>Santa Cruz</hi>
stood still, and mov'd no more, than if
she had been at Anchor. During this
becalming, which lasted fourteen days
together, their water fail'd them; and
some dy'd from the first want of it;
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:48349:321"/>
they row'd on every side with their
Chalop, to make discovery of some
Coast, where they might find fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Being far at Sea they cou'd discern
nothing, but the Island of <hi>Formosa,</hi> at
least they believ'd it so to be; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to gain the shoar, but in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
days time, notwithstanding all their
attempts, they cou'd not reach it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Ship was full
of sick people, who were burnt up with
a deadly thirst, and they had all perish'd
without hope of succour, if one of them,
reflecting, within himself, that Father
<hi>Xavier</hi> had been always prevalent with
God, had not hinted this notion to the
rest: whereupon all of them coming on
their knees before him, besought him,
with more tears than words, to obtain
from Heaven, either Wind or Water
for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> bad them address themselves
to God in their own behalf:<note place="margin">He changes the salt-water into fresh.</note> caus'd them
to recite the Litany on their knees, at

in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> He himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
also into a Chamber; from whence
coming out some time after; he went
down into the Chalop with a little Child,
and having caus'd him to taste of the Sea
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:48349:322"/>
water, ask'd him whether it were fresh,
or salt? The Child answering that it was
salt, he commanded him to taste again,
and the Child told him that it was fresh.
Then the Father returning into the Ship,
order'd them to fill all their Vessels, but
some amongst them being eager to drink,
found the water salt. The Saint made
the sign of the Cross over the Vessels,
and at the same moment the water losing
its natural faltness, became so good, that
they all protested, it was better than
that of <hi>Bangar,</hi> of which the Sea-men
make their ordinary provision, and which
is esteem'd the best Water in all the
<hi>Indies.</hi>

The greatest part of the Mariners
and Passengers, kept, out of devotion,
some of this water, at the first as a

kept in private for three days. He was
a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and the Miracle of the

them to the Inhabitants of an Isle call'd

was a place of great traffick, full of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
from several parts. The desire

sixty persons, some <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

much further out of their way, if the
Captain, upon the word of the Saint, had
not struck sail, and cast anchor, 'till the
return of the Chalop, which he had
sent out to discover the neighbouring
Coast. She was three days before she
came back, and all the Ships Company
imagin'd that she had been overtaken by

It has few Inhabitants, who are Natives,
almost no Provisions, and is so barren of

it seems rather a place of Banshment
than of Commerce. The <hi>Chineses</hi> had
permitted the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to buy their Commodities, and sell
their own to them, without breaking their

that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> durst come no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

was it permitted them to build so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid

Chest, take all my Money if you will, and

the Merchants Chest were thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

took out three hundred Crowns, which

were sufficient to marry the Orphan May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Some time afterward, <hi>Veglio</hi> count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over his Money, and finding the sum

you, that you shall not die without being
first advertis'd of the day of your death.
<hi>After these predictions,</hi> Veglio <hi>was quite
chang'd into another man, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to exercises of Piety; and in
the condition of a Merchant, liv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the life of a Religious. What had
been foretold him, that he should have
warning of his death, came frequently
into his remembrance; and he cou'd not
hinder himself one day, from asking the
Saint, at what time, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it shou'd be? The Saint told him,
without pausing,</hi> When you shall find the
taste of your Wine bitter, then prepare your
self for death, and know that you have but
one day more to live.</p>

He had several losses in his Trade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the chance of things which
are depending on the Sea. But his
Friends continually reliev'd him, in his
necessities, and gave him wherewithal to
set up again. At length being one day
at a great Entertainment, and more gay
than ever, having ask'd for Wine, he
found the taste of it was bitter. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
remembring the Prophecy of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Xavier,</hi> he was seiz'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
horrour; which begining from the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:48349:326"/>
Soul, spread over his Body, as if death
had been pronounc'd against him, or the
Image of death presented to his Eyes.
Nevertheless, somewhat recovering his
Spirits, for his farther satisfaction in the
point, he desir'd his fellow Guests at
the Table, to taste the Wine out of his
Glass. All judg'd it to be excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
himself, who made divers tryals of
it on his Palat. He call'd for other
Wines, and another Glass; but always
found the same bitterness. Then no
longer doubting, but that his last hour
was coming, after he had made an interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Sacrifice of his life to God, he related
to the Company that Prediction, which
was now accomplish'd; and arose from
the Table, with the thoughts of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
who is disposing himself for death.
Having distributed his Goods betwixt
his Children and the Poor, he went to see
his Friends, and to give and take the last
farewel: Notwithstanding his great age
he was in perfect health. It was thought
he doted, and they endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him out of his melancholly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.
But their Arguments prevail'd
so little on his mind, that he gave orders
for his own Funeral, and invited his
Friends to do him the last kind Office,
of accompanying his Corps to burial.
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48349:327"/>
To content him, and to make themselves
merry at his folly, they attended him
into the Church: In their presence he
receiv'd the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and the <hi>Extream
Vnction,</hi> without being sick; afterwards
he laid himself upon the Beer, and caus'd
them to sing the Mass for the Dead. The
people gather'd in a crowd at the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the report; some drawn by the
novelty of the sight, the rest to be Ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how the Prediction of Father
<hi>Xavier</hi> wou'd succeed. Mass being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Priest attended by his Inferiours,
perform'd all the Ceremonies of the
Church about the Grave, and at length,
sung the last words belonging to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
burial, over the old man, who was
alive, and bore his part in the Responses.
There now remaining no more to do; the
Servant of <hi>Veglio</hi> coming to help his
Master off the Beer, he found him dead.

Hurricane. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> who had
great concernments in that Vessel, being
allarm'd at so inevitable a danger, came
running for comfort to Father <hi>Xavier.</hi>
But the Father assur'd them, they had no
cause of fear; and that the Ship was safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arriv'd at her Port. They kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
quiet, upon the assurance of his
word; till finding that the Ship made no
return, which was to stay at <hi>Iapan</hi> but
some few days, they gave her for lost.
<hi>Xavier</hi> reprov'd their want of Faith, and
positively told them, that she shou'd
come back before the week were ended.

This miraculous foreknowledge,<note place="margin">He raises up a dead man, and drives the Iy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers out of the Island.</note> was
accompany'd by actions as surprising;
and without speaking of a dead Infant,
which <hi>Xavier</hi> restor'd to life, but whose
Resurrection is without Circumstances in
the Acts of the Saints Canonization, he
clear'd the Country of the Tygers, which
laid it waste. These furious Beasts came
in Herds together out of the Forrests,
and devour'd not only the Children, but
the Men also, whom they found scatter'd
in the Fields, and out of distance from
the Retrenchments which were made for
their defence. One night the Servant
of God went out to meet the Tygers,
and when they came near him, threw
holy Water upon them, commanding

at the arrival of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi>
was immediately changd to sadness,
when they understood that he had only
taken <hi>Sancian</hi> in his way to <hi>China.</hi> They
all endeavour'd to dissuade him from it:
and set before his Eyes, the rigorous
Laws of that Government: That the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:48349:328"/>
Ports were narrowly observ'd, by vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and faithful Officers, who were
neither to be circumvented, nor brib'd
with Presents. That the <hi>Mandarins</hi> were
cruel to all strangers; that the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some <hi>Portuguese</hi> Sea-men, being cast
by Tempest on the Coast of <hi>Canton,</hi> had
been severely whip'd, and afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
in dark Dungeons, where if they
were not already dead, they were still
exercis'd with new punishments; that
for himself, the least he cou'd expect was
perpetual imprisonment, which was not
the business of an Apostle, who design'd
to run from place to place, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Faith through all the <hi>East.</hi>
These Arguments made no impression on
the Saint: He had fortify'd his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with more potent Reasons, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
the Merchants in the same tenour
in which he had written to Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Perez,</hi> That he cou'd not distrust the
Divine Goodness, and that his distrust
wou'd be so much the more Criminal,
because the powerful inspiration of the

the <hi>Chineses</hi> the Gospel of the living God.

can the Demons, and their Ministers do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

them by the Soveraign Lord of all

being of Opinion, that this fix'd inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Man of God, was partly
grounded on his ignorance of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which he believ'd they magnify'd
to him, beyond their natural proportion,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48349:329"/>
sent some <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, with whom
they traded, to discourse the business
calmly with him; but the matter went
otherwise than they had imagin'd. Those
<hi>Chineses,</hi> to whom <hi>Xavier</hi> fail'd not to
speak of Christianity, and who were
men of understanding, advis'd him to
the Voyage, instead of disswading him:
they counsel'd him only to carry Books
which contain'd the Christian Doctrine;
and added, that not long since, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt some learned men into
the neighbouring Kingdoms, to inform

different from the receiv'd opinions of
the <hi>Chineses.</hi> That they believ'd the
Christian Doctrine wou'd be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at Court; and that it seem'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to them, that the novelty of so
reasonable a belief, wou'd make his way,
who was the first bearer of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> was overjoy'd to find a passage
open'd for the Gospel,<note place="margin">He takes his measures for the Voyage of <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> to the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Nation of the World: and doubted
not but that the Christian Religion,
coming to be compar'd by judicious men,
with the other Opinions of the East,
wou'd have the advantage. Being thus
encourag'd to pursue his purpose, his first
business was to provide himself of a good
Interpreter. For <hi>Antonio</hi> the <hi>Chinese,</hi>
               <pb n="636" facs="tcp:48349:330"/>
whom he had brought from <hi>Goa,</hi> was
wholly ignorant of the Language which
is spoken at the Court, and had almost
forgotten the common Idiome of the
vulgar. He found out another <hi>Chinese,</hi>
who had a perfect knowledge of the
Language of the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and who
cou'd also write excellently well, in
which consists the principal knowledge
of <hi>China.</hi> For the rest, he was a man
well shap'd, of a good presence, of great
natural parts, of a pleasing conversation,
and which was above all, he seem'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
devoted to the Christians; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
all possible good Offices, whether
he hop'd to make his fortune, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to the Emperour, one who
publish'd a new Law, or that God had
inspir'd him with those pious thoughts.</p>
            <p>There was more difficulty in finding
Sea-men, to transport the Father, for
there was no less venture than that of
life, for any one who undertook that
business. But interest gives him cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to hazard all, who values money
more than life it self. A <hi>Chinese</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
call'd <hi>Capoceca,</hi> offer'd himself to

of his own, found an expedient to satisfy
them. He ingag'd his word, that he
wou'd not pass over into <hi>China,</hi> 'till they
had ended all their business, and were
gone from <hi>Sancian.</hi> This gave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to the <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchant, with
whom he had treated, to make a short
Voyage, under promise, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to return at a time which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd.
While these things were thus
manag'd, the Father fell sick of a violent
Fever, which continu'd on him fifteen
days. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> took occasion
from thence to tell him, that Heaven
had declar'd against the Voyage of <hi>China,</hi>
but being recover'd, he follow'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
with more warmth than ever; while
the Merchants were lading their Ships,
he entertain'd himself day and night,
with the prospect of Converting <hi>China;</hi>
and all his pleasure was to think how
happy he shou'd be, in dispossessing the
Devil of the largest Empire in the world.

up with these and such like meditations,
he often took his walk along the shore,
and turning his eyes towards that desir'd

Country, sent out ardent sighs. He
said sometimes amongst his friends, that
his only wish, was to be set down at

himself with what might happen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:

I shall not fail to implore the Divine
Goodness, to conferr on you, during your

God, to whom both the <hi>Chineses</hi>

have the merit of it, in the sight of God,

both the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who shall embrace the

the Governour to be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.
And he took this way, not
only because harden'd and scandalous
Offendours, such as Don <hi>Alvarez,</hi> ought
to incurr a publick dishonour, by that
means to induce them to a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

            <p>He desir'd Father <hi>Barzaeus</hi> in the same
Letter, to receive few persons into the
Society; and to make an exact trial of
those whom he shou'd receive. For I
fear, <hi>said he,</hi> that many of them who
have been admitted, and daily are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
were better out of our walls

            <p>You ought to deal with such people,

Companion, whom I have dismiss'd from
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:48349:333"/>

Pereyra,</hi> whom he had brought with
him from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and whom he sent
back from <hi>Sancian,</hi> with the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Vessels.</p>
            <p>Amongst those Merchants,<note place="margin">He foretels the unhappy death of a Merchant.</note> who went
off from <hi>Sancian,</hi> there was one who made
more haste than any of the rest; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving notice of his departure to
the Father, whom he had lodg'd in his
Cabin, or without waiting for a <hi>Chinese</hi>
Vessel, which he had bought at the
Port of <hi>Canton.</hi> One morning while
the Father was saying Mass very early,
this Merchant had put off from shore,
and fled, with as much precipitation, as
if the Island was ready to be swallow'd
by the Sea. After Mass was ended, he
look'd round him, and not seeing him
for whom he search'd, What is become
of my Host? <hi>said he, with the looks and

that he was already in open Sea;
what cou'd urge him, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> to so

and whither is he dragg'd by his

the <hi>Chinese</hi> Vessel was seen to arrive: as

saving only that which belong'd to the

the Governour had possess'd himself by
violence, <hi>Xavier</hi> was reduc'd to so
great a want of all necessaries, that he
had scarcely wherewithal to sustain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
'Tis certainly a matter of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they whose lives he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
by changing the salt Sea-water
into fresh, shou'd be so hard-hearted, as
to abandon him to dye of hunger. Some
have thought that Don <hi>Alvarez</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Orders, that all things shou'd be
refus'd him; but I rather think, that
Providence, wou'd try him, in the same
manner, as sometimes God is pleas'd to
prove those, whom he loves the best,
and permitted that dereliction of him,
for the entire perfection of the Saint.</p>
            <p>That which most afflicted him,<note place="margin">The means sail him, for his passage into <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> was,
that the <hi>Chinese</hi> Interpreter, who had
made him such advantageous offers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
his word, either of himself, for
fear of danger, or at the sollicitation of
those, who were devoted to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Malacca.</hi> Yet the Father did
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:48349:334"/>
not lose his courage; he still hop'd that
God wou'd assist him some other way;
and that at the worst, <hi>Antonio de Sainte
Foy</hi> might serve his turn for an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But for the last load of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
the Merchant who had ingag'd to
land him on the Coast of <hi>China,</hi> return'd
not at the time appointed, and he in
vain expected him for many days.</p>
            <p>Despairing of any thing on that side,<note place="margin">He is still in hope, and the expedient which he finds.</note>
he still maintain'd his resolution; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
expedient seem'd to promise him
success. News was brought him, that
the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> whose Dominions are
almost bordering on <hi>Malacca;</hi> and who
also was in league with <hi>Portugal,</hi> was
preparing a magnificent Embassy to the
Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> for the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Whereupon <hi>Xavier</hi> resolv'd on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Malacca</hi> by the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and to use his best endeavours,
that he might accompany the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of <hi>Stam</hi> to <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Eternal Wisdom,<note place="margin">He falls sick again, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

inspires his Servants with great
designs, does not always will the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them; though he wills that
on their side nothing be omitted for
the execution. God was pleas'd to deal
with <hi>Xavier,</hi> as formerly he had dealt
with <hi>Moses,</hi> who dyed in view of that
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:48349:335"/>
very Land, whither he was commanded
to conduct the <hi>Israelites.</hi> A Fever seiz'd
on Father <hi>Francis,</hi> on the 20 <hi>th.</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember;</hi>
and at the same time he was
endu'd with a clear knowledge of the
day and hour of his death: as he openly
declar'd to the Pilot of the Vessel, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
d' Aghiar,</hi> who afterwards made an
authentique deposition of it, by solemn
Oath.</p>
            <p>From that moment, he perceiv'd in
himself a strange disgust of all earthly
things, and thought on nothing but that
Coelestial Country, whither God was
calling him. Being much weaken'd by
his Fever, he retir'd into the Vessel,
which was the common Hospital of the
sick, that there he might die in Poverty;
and the Captain <hi>Lewis Almeyda</hi> receiv'd
him, notwithstanding all the Orders of his
Master Don <hi>Alvarez.</hi> But the tossing of the
Ship, giving him an extraordinary head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
and hindring him from applying
himself to God, as he desir'd; the day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
he requested that he might be set
on shore again. He was landed. and

of the air, and the inclemency of

He had there dy'd without relief, had
not a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> more charitable than
the rest, whose name was <hi>George Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi>
caus'd him to be carry'd into his
Cabin; which yet was little different
from the naked shore, as being open on

an accute pain in his side, and a great
oppression, <hi>Alvarez</hi> was of opinion,
that they ought to breathe a Vein; and
the Father was consenting to it, by a
blind submission to the Judgment of his
Host, though he knew before hand, that
all manner of Remedies were in vain. A
Chirurgeon of the Ship, who was awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
at his work, and of small experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in his Art, bled him so unluckily,
that he hurt the Nerves, and the Patient
fell immediately into swooning Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Yet they drew Blood from him a
second time; and that operation had all
the ill accidents of the former. Besides
which, it was attended with a horrible
nauseousness, insomuch that he cou'd
take no nourishment: at least, the little
which he took, consisted only of some
few Almonds, which the Captain of the
Vessel sent him out of Charity. The
disease encreas'd hourly, and he grew
weaker every day. But his Countenance
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:48349:336"/>
was still serene, and his Soul enjoy'd a
perpetual calmness. Sometimes he lifted
up his Eyes to Heaven, and at other
times six'd them on his Crucifix, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Divine Conversations with his
God, and not without shedding abundant
tears. He remain'd in this condition,
till the twenty eighth of <hi>November,</hi>
when the Fever mounted into his Head.
During this <hi>delirium,</hi> he talk'd of nothing
but of God, and of his passage into <hi>China,</hi>
but in terms more tender and ardent than
ever formerly.</p>
            <p>At length he lost his Speech,<note place="margin">He entertains himself with God in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his sickness.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd

Which notwithstanding he once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and having the free exercise
both of his Reason and his Speech, he
renew'd his Entertainments with his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in an audible manner. Nothing
was to be heard from him but devout
Aspirations, and short Ejaculations of
Prayer, but those full of life and of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

all he said, because he continually spoke
in Latin: And <hi>Antonio de Sainte Foy,</hi>

and lively; his Hair and Beard of a dark
Chesnut; his continual labours had made
him gray betimes; and in the last year
of his life, he was grizzled almost to

cou'd hardly perswade themselves that he

they kneel'd down by him, and kiss'd his
Hands with reverence, recommending
themselves to him, with tears in their

the occasion of it. But in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the apprehension which the Ships
Company had of drawing on themselves
the displeasure of the Governour, <hi>Don
Alvarez,</hi> had at least as great a share in
it, as the sharpness of the season. They
took off his Cassock, which was all in
tatters; and the four, who had pay'd
him those last duties, divided it amongst
them, out of devotion; after which they
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:48349:338"/>
array'd him, in his Sacerdotal Habits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Alvarez</hi> took upon himself the
care of bestowing the Body in a large
Chest, made after the <hi>Chinese</hi> fashion;
he caus'd this Chest to be fill'd up with
unslak'd Lime; to the end that the Flesh
being soon consum'd, they might carry
the Bones in the Vessel, which within
some few months was to return to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the point of the Haven, there was
a little spot of rising ground, and at the
foot of this Hillock, a small piece of
Meadow, where the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had set
up a Cross. Near that Cross they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
the Saint; they cast up two heaps
of Stones, the one at his Head, the other
at his Feet; as a mark of the place where
he was buried.</p>
            <p>In the mean season,<note place="margin">The miraculous Crucifix in the Chappel of the Castle of <hi>Xavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </note> God made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the holiness of his Servant in the
Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> by a miraculous
accident; or rather by the ceasing of a
Miracle. In a little Chappel, at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Xavier,</hi> there was an ancient
Crucifix made of Plaister, of about the
stature of a Man. In the last year of
the Fathers life, this Crucifix was seen to
sweat Blood in great abundance every
<hi>Friday,</hi> but after <hi>Xavier</hi> was dead, the
sweating ceas'd. The Crucifix is to be
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:48349:338"/>
seen even at this day, at the same place,
with the Blood congeal'd along the Arms
and Thighs to the Hands and Sides. They
who have beheld it, have been inform'd
by the Inhabitants of the Neighbourhood,
that some persons of that Country having
taken away some of the flakes of that
clotted Blood, the Bishop of <hi>Pampeluna,</hi>
had forbidden any one from hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to diminish any part of it, under
pain of Excommunication. They also

fresh colour'd, like that of a man, who

it in like manner whole, and the natural

might entirely satisfy all doubts and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he cut a little of the Flesh on the
right Thigh, near the Knee, and beheld
the Blood running from it. Whereupon
he made haste to advertise the Captain of
what he was an Eye-witness; and carry'd
with him a little piece of Flesh, which
he had cut off, and which was about a
Fingers length. All the company ran im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the place of burial, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made an exact observation of the
Body, found it to be all entire, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any putrefaction. The Sacerdotal
Habits, with which he had been vested
after his decease, were no ways endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag'd
by the Lime. And what was most
amazing to them all, was that the holy
Corps, exhal'd an Odour so delightful, and
so fragrant, that by the relation of many
there present, the most exquisite Perfumes
came nothing near it, and the scent was
judg'd to be Coelestial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="655" facs="tcp:48349:339"/>
Then those very people,<note place="margin">The body of the Saint is put on Ship-board, to be transported into <hi>India.</hi>

to comply with the brutality of <hi>Alvarez,</hi>

at the same time: for together with

to have oblig'd the Inhabitants, to have

with a Sepulcher which was worthy of
him. In the mean time, whether the
fear of their Governour with-held them,
or that God permitted it for the greater
glory of his Servant, having taken the
Body out of the Chest, they buried it
without the Church, where the common
sort of people were interr'd; and which
was yet more shameful, they made the
Grave too scanty; so that crushing the
Body to give it entrance, they broke it
somewhere about the Shoulders; and
there gush'd out Blood, which diffus'd a
most fragrant Odour. And farther, to
carry their civility, and discretion to the
highest point, they trampled so hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, which cover'd the blessed
Corps, that they bruis'd it in many parts;
as if it had been the destiny of that holy
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:48349:341"/>
Man, to be tormented by the people of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> both during his life, and after
his decease. The sacred Corps remain'd
thus without honour, till the month of
<hi>August,</hi> when Father <hi>Iohn Beyra</hi> came
from <hi>Goa,</hi> in his return to the <hi>Molucca's,</hi>
with two Companions whom <hi>Gaspar Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaeus,</hi>
the Vice Provincial had given him,
pursuant to the Orders of Father <hi>Xavier.</hi>
This man having always had a tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for the Saint, was most sensibly
afflicted for his death; and cou'd not
think of continuing his Voyage to the
<hi>Molucca's,</hi> till he had look'd upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
of which so many wonders were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
Opening himself on that Subject
to <hi>Iames Pereyra,</hi> and two or three other
Friends of the dead Apostle, they took
up his Body privately one night. The
Corps was found entire, fresh, and still
exhaling a sweet Odour: neither had the
dampness of the ground after five months
burial, made the least alteration in him:
They found even the Linnen which was
over his Face, tinctur'd with Vermillion
Blood.</p>

               </note> so wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their minds, that they thought it their
duty, not to lay it again into the

means of transporting it to <hi>Goa. Pereyra</hi>
               <pb n="660" facs="tcp:48349:342"/>
order'd a Coffin to be made, of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wood, and after they had garnish'd
it with rich <hi>China</hi> Damask, they
put the Corps into it, wrapping it in
Cloath of Gold, with a Pillow of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
underneath the head. The Coffin
was afterwards bestow'd in a proper
place, known only to the devoted friends
of Father <hi>Xavier:</hi> and it pleas'd the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to declare by a visible Miracle,
that their Zeal was acceptable to him.
For a Waxen Taper, which they had
lighted up before the Coffin, and which
naturally must have burnt out, within
ten hours, lasted eighteen days entire,
burning day and night: and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that the droppings of the Wax,
weigh'd more than the Taper it self at
the beginning.</p>
            <p>In the mean time an occasion offer'd,

Spirit, which the sight of the Saint had
inspir'd into him. But, of the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
which had been assign'd for
the Mission of the <hi>Molucca's,</hi> he left one
behind him at <hi>Malacca,</hi> to be a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:48349:342"/>
of that holy treasure, and this was
<hi>Emanuel Pavora. Peter de Alcaceva,</hi> at
the same time return'd from <hi>Iapan,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had been sent from <hi>Goa,</hi> for the
affairs of that new Christianity. And
both of them, not long after, carried the
holy Corps along with them, in the
Vessel of <hi>Lopez de Norogna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ship was so old and worn,<note place="margin">The Body is put into a craz'd old Ship, and what happens to it in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> and
out of all repair, that none durst ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to embark upon her. But when
once it was divulg'd, that it was to carry
the Corps of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> every one
made haste to get a corner in her: not
doubting but there they might be safe.
And the Passengers had no cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
them of their confidence: for, in
effect, God deliver'd them, more than
once, miraculously from Shipwrack.</p>
            <p>A furious tempest, almost at their
first setting out, cast them upon banks
of Sand, and the Keel struck so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, that they cou'd not get her off,
when against all humane appearances,
the wind coming about, and blowing
full in their faces, disingag'd the Vessel;
and that it might manifestly appear to
be the hand of God, the blast ceas'd that
very moment, when the Keel was losen'd
from the Sands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="662" facs="tcp:48349:343"/>
Not long after, at the entry into the
Gulph of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> they struck impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
against some hidden Shelves, the
Rudder flying off, with the fury of the
stroke, the Keel stuck fast within the
Rock; and it was a Miracle that the
Vessel, being so crazy, did not split a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.
The Mariners did that on this
occasion, which is commonly put in
practice, in extremity of danger. They
cut the Masts with their hatchets, but
that being of no effect, they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to throw all their lading over-board,
to ease the Ship; but the fury of the
waves, which beat upon her on every
side, and outrageously toss'd her, suffer'd
them not to perform what they desir'd.
Then they had their last recourse to the
intercession of that Saint, whose Corps
they carried. Having drawn it out of the
Pilots Cabin, they fell on their knees
about it with lighted Flambeaux; and,
as if Father <hi>Xavier</hi> had been yet living,
and that he had beheld, and heard them,
they begg'd succour of him, from that
imminent destruction.</p>
            <p>Their Prayer was scarcely ended,
when they heard a rumbling noise from
underneath the Vessel; and at the same
time, perceiv'd her following her course
in open Sea: from whence they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:48349:343"/>
that the Rock was cleft in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and had left a free passage for the

to the Ship, and at the sight of the
dead Saint, was restor'd to her health at
the same moment. Not satisfy'd with
this, she was desirous to have a little
piece of the Cope, with which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was habited: and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tis wonderful
what Cures she effected by that precious
Relique.</p>
            <p>The Ship being now within twenty
Leagues of <hi>Goa,</hi> and being unable to
make any farther way, because of the
contrary winds, the Captain went into
the Chalop, with some of his people, and
got to the Town, by the help of Oars,
that himself might have the honour of
bearing the first news to the Viceroy,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:48349:344"/>
and the Fathers of the Society, that the
blessed Corps was coming to them. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Gaspar Barzaeus</hi> was already dead,
and Father <hi>Melchior Nugnez</hi> declar'd his
Successour in his two Offices, of Rectour
of the Colledge, and Vice Provincial
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in vertue of the Letter
which Father <hi>Xavier</hi> had left seal'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, when he went for <hi>China,</hi> and
which was open'd after the death of
<hi>Gaspar,</hi> according to the Orders of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
himself.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy immediately order'd
a light Galley for <hi>Nugnez,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They come from <hi>Goa</hi> to meet the Corps.</note> upon which,
he and three others of the Society
imbarking, together with four young
men of the Seminary, they set sail
towards the Vessel, to bear off the
Body of the Saint. They receiv'd it
with the honourable discharge of all
the Cannon, not only from the Ship
of <hi>Lopez,</hi> but from six other Vessels
which were in Company, and which
had been wind-bound towards <hi>Baticula.</hi>
On the fifteenth of <hi>March,</hi> in the year
1554, the Galley landed at <hi>Rebendar,</hi>
which is within half a league of <hi>Goa:</hi>
she remain'd there the rest of that day,
and all the night; while they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
preparations in the Town, for the
solemn reception of the holy Apostle of
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:48349:344"/>
the <hi>Indies.</hi> The next morning, which
was <hi>Friday</hi> in passion week, six Barks
were seen to come, which were all illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with lighted Torches, and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pously
adorn'd; wherein was the flower
of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Nobility. Twelve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Barks attended them, with three
hundred of the principal Inhabitants,
each of them holding a Taper in his
hand: and in every of these Barks, there
was Instrumental musick of all sorts,
and choirs of Voices, which made an
admirable harmony. The whole squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
was drawn up into two wings, to
accompany the Galley, which row'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. The Body of the Saint
was cover'd with Cloath of Gold, which
was the present of <hi>Pereyra,</hi> and was plac'd
upon the Stern, under a noble Canopy,
with lighted Flambeaux, and rich Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
waving on both sides of it.</p>
            <p>In this equipage, they row'd towards
<hi>Goa,</hi> but very softly, and in admirable
order. All the Town was gather'd on
the shore, in impatient expectation of
their loving and good Father. When
they perceiv'd the Vessel from afar, there
was nothing to be heard but cries of joy,
nothing to be seen but tears of devotion.
Some more impatient than the rest,
threw themselves into the Sea, and
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:48349:345"/>
swimming up to the Gally, accompany'd
it to the shore, in the same posture.</p>

after this ensuing manner.</p>
            <p>Ninety Children went foremost, in
long white Robes, with Chaplets of
Flowers on their heads, and each of them
holding in his hand an Olive-Branch.
The Brotherhood of <hi>Mercy</hi> follow'd
them, with a magnificent Standard. The
Clergy succeeded to the Brotherhood,
and walk'd immediately before the Corps,
which was carried by the Fathers of the
Society. The Viceroy with his Court,
clos'd up the Ceremony, which was
follow'd by an innumerable multitude of
people. All the Streets were hung with
Tapistry; and when the blessed Corps
appear'd, Flowers were thrown upon it
from all the windows, and from the
tops of Houses.</p>
            <p>

their health with the bare invocation of
his name. <hi>Iane Pereyra</hi> was of this

we may believe the Testimony of those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who were Natives of the Country.</p>
            <p>The Pagans had a Custom, that in
confirmation of a Truth, they wou'd
hold a red hot Iron in their Hands, with
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:48349:348"/>
other Superstitions of the like nature:
but after that Father <hi>Francis,</hi> came to be
held in so great veneration through the
<hi>Indies,</hi> they swore solemnly by his
name; and such an Oath, was generally
receiv'd for the highest attestation of a
truth. Neither did any of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear
themselves unpunish'd after such an
Oath. And God authoris'd by many
proofs, this religious practice, even by
manifest prodigies. Behold a terrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of it: An Idolater ow'd a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
a considerable sum of Money. But
as he deny'd his debt, and no legal proof
cou'd be made of it, the Christian oblig'd
him to swear in the Church, upon the
Image of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> The Idolater made
a false Oath, without the least scruple;
but was scarcely got into his own House,
when he began to void Blood in abundance
at his Mouth; and dy'd in a raging fit of
madness which had the resemblance of a
Man possest, rather than of one who was
distracted.</p>
            <p>Neither was his Memory less honour'd
in <hi>Iapan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How much he is honour'd at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan.</hi>
               </note> than in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the Kingdom of <hi>Saxuma,</hi> kept
religiously a Stone, on which he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
preach'd; and shew'd it as a precious
rarity. The House wherein he had lodg'd
at <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> was respected as a sacred
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:48349:349"/>
place; and was always preserv'd from
ruine, amidst those bloody Wars, which
more than once had destroy'd the Town.
For what remains, the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were not the only people which
honour'd Father <hi>Xavier</hi> after his decease;
the Odour of his holy life expanded it

the Isles about it, the name of Father
<hi>Francis</hi> was in high repute, and that
those <hi>Moors</hi> never mention'd him, but
with the addition of a wonderful Man.
So many illustrious testimonies, and so
far above suspition, ingag'd the King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> anew, to sollicite the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of the Saint; and in that prospect,
there was made an ample collection of
his Vertues, of which I present you with
this following Extract.</p>

or how great soever, cou'd divert the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from the contemplation of coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things. Being at <hi>Goa,</hi> his ordinary
retirement after Dinner, was into the
Clock-house of the Church, to avoid the
int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rruption of any person, and there,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:48349:349"/>
during the space of two hours, he had a
close communication with his God. But
because he was not always Master of
himself on those occasions, so as to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his time; and that he was sometimes
oblig'd to leave his privacy, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a young man of the Seminary of
<hi>Sainte Foy,</hi> whose name was <hi>Andrew,</hi> to
come and give him notice, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the
two hours, to which he was limited, were
expir'd. One day, when the Father was
to speak with the Viceroy, <hi>Andrew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to advertise him, found him
seated on a little Chair, his Hands across
his Breast, and his Eyes fix'd on Heaven.
When he had look'd on him a while at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively,
he at length call'd him, but
finding that the Father answer'd not, he
spoke yet louder, and made a noise. All
this was to no purpose, <hi>Xavier</hi> continu'd
immoveable, and <hi>Andrew</hi> went his way,
having some scruple to disturb the quiet
of a Man, who had the appearance of
an Angle, and seem'd to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Souls in Paradise. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
nevertheless, about two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and found him still in the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
The young man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earing that he

<pb n="676" facs="tcp:48349:350"/>
and to jogg him. <hi>Xavier</hi> at length
returning to himself, was in a wonder at
the first, that two hours shou'd so soon
be slipp'd away; but coming to know,
that he had remain'd in that place beyond
four hours, he went out with <hi>Andrew,</hi> to
go to the Palace of the Viceroy. He
had scarcely set his Foot over the Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold,
when he seem'd to be ravish'd in
Spirit once again. After he had made
some turns, without well knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went, he return'd as night was
beginning to come on, and said to his
Attendant, <hi>My Son, we will take another
time to see the Governour, 'tis the Will of
God, that this present day shou'd be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walking through the
Streets of the same City, his thoughts
were so wholly taken up with God, that
he perceiv'd not a furious Elephant, who

and every man made haste out of
his way. It was in vain to cry out to
the Father, that he might avoid him, he
heard nothing, and the enrag'd beast
pass'd very near him, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea, he continu'd ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
in Prayer, from midnight even to
Sun-rising, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat regularly. From
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:48349:350"/>
thence it came almost to a Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Seamen, <hi>That nothing was to
be fear'd in the night, because Father</hi>
Francis <hi>watch'd the Vessel, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
durst not trouble them, while he held
conversation with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man of <hi>Manapar,</hi> at whose House he
lodg'd, and who observ'd him at divers
hours of the night, found him always on
his Knees before a Crucifix, and frequently
beheld the Chamber enlighten'd by the
Rays which darted from his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>While he was sojourning among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the small repose he gave to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was commonly in the Church; to
the end he might be near the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
before which he pray'd all the
remainder of the night. But in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where yet there were no Churches
built, he pass'd the night in the open
Air, and nothing so much elevated his
Soul to God, as the view of Heaven,
spangled over, and sow'd as it were with
Stars; and this we have from his own
Relation.</p>
            <p>The Pope, had permitted him, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his Employments, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
Labours, to say a Breviary
which was shorter then the <hi>Roman,</hi> and
had but three Lessons: It was call'd the
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:48349:351"/>
               <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ice of the Cross;</hi> and was easily granted
in those times, to such, who were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd
with much business. But <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
never made use of this permission,
what A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>airs soever he was press'd withal,
for the service of Almighty God: On the
contrary, before the beginning of every
Canonical hour, he always said the Hymn
of <hi>Veni Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tor Spiritus;</hi> and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
that while he said it, his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was enlighten'd, as if the Holy
Ghost, whom he invok'd, was visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
on him.</p>
            <p>He daily celebrated the Sacrifice of the
Mass with the same Reverence, and the
same Devotion, with which he had said
it, the first time, and most ordinarily
perform'd it at break of day. Those
heavenly Sweets, which overflow'd his
Soul at the Altar, spread their mild inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
even over the Assistants: And
<hi>Antonio Andrada</hi> reported of himself, that
being then a young Souldier, he found
such an inward satisfaction when he serv'd
the Father, in serving at Mass, that in
that consideration, he sought the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erforming the Clerks Office.</p>
            <p>In the midst of his Conversations
with Secular Men, the Saint was often
call'd aside of God, by certain sudden il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations,
which oblig'd him to retire:
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:48349:351"/>
And when afterwards they sought him,
he was found before the Holy Sacrament,
in some lonely place, ingulph'd in deep
Meditations, and frequently suspended in
the Air, with Beams of Glory round his
Countenance. Many Ocular Witnesses
have depos'd this matter of Fact; but
some have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>irm'd, That at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst they
have found him on his Knees immo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they have afterwards observ'd,
how by degrees he was moun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed from
the Earth; and that then, being seiz'd
with a sacred horrour, they cou'd not
stedfastly behold him, so bright and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
was his Countenance. Others have
protested, That while he was speaking
to them of the things of God, they cou'd
perceive him shooting upward, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing
himself from them, on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and his Body raising it self on high
of its own motion.</p>
            <p>These ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Glory of the Blest above, happen'd
to him from time to time, during the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

and he was beheld elevated in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

and outward ardour, they were
often forc'd to throw cold water into his
bosome.</p>
            <p>Frequently in Preaching, and in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he felt in himself such inward scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that not being able to endure it, he

wounds and of the blood of a Crucify'd

seem'd to be onely born for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the distress'd. He lov'd the sick
with tenderness; and to attend them,
was what he call'd his pleasure. He
sought out, not only wherewithal to
feed them, but to feast them. And for
that purpose begg'd from the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <pb n="685" facs="tcp:48349:354"/>
the most exquisite Regalio's, which
were sent them out of <hi>Europe.</hi> He was
not asham'd of going round the Town
with a Wallet on his back, begging lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
for the wounded Souldiers: he
dress'd their hurts, and did it with so
much the more affection, when they
were the most putrifi'd and loathsome
to the smell. If he happen'd to meet
with any Beggar, who was sinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sickness, he took him in his arms,
bore him to the Hospital, prepar'd his
Remedies, and dress'd his meat with his
own hands.</p>
            <p>Though all the miserable were dear
to him; yet he assisted the Prisoners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a more particular manner, with the
Charities which he gather'd for them.
And, in <hi>Goa,</hi> which was the common
Tribunal of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he employ'd one
day in the week, in doing good to such
who were overwhelm'd with Debts. If
he had not wherewithal, to pay off their
Creditors entirely, he mollify'd them at
least with his civilities, and oblig'd them
sometimes to release one moyety of what
was owing to them.</p>
            <p>The poor with one common voice
call'd him their Father, and he also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
them as his Children. Nothing was
given him, but what pass'd through his

hands into theirs, who were members
of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> even so far as to deprive

may call it, a Treasury of Alms, not
onely for the subsistance of the meaner
sort, who are content with little, but
for the maintenance of honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
which one or two Shipwracks
had ruin'd all at once: and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of many Virgins of good

            <p>The greatest part of the miracles,
which on so many occasions were
wrought by him, was onely for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of publick calamities, or for the
cure of particular persons: and it was
in the same Spirit, that being one day
greatly busied in hearing the Confessions
of the faithful at <hi>Goa,</hi> he departed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
in appearance out of the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and from thence out of the Church
also, transported with some inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he cou'd not possibly resist:
after he had made many turns about
the Town, without knowing whither
he went, he happen'd upon a Stranger,
and having tenderly embrac'd him,
conducted him to the Colledge of the
Society. There, that miserable creature,
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:48349:355"/>
whom his despair was driving to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands upon himself, having more
seriously reflected on his wicked resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pull'd out the Halter, which he
had secretly about him, and with which
he was going to have hang'd himself;
and gave it into the Father's hands. The
Saint, to whom it was reveal'd, that
extream misery had reduc'd the unhappy
wretch, to this dismal melancholly,
gave him comfort, retain'd him in the
Colledge for some time; and at length
dismiss'd him with a round sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
sufficient for the entertainment of
his Family. He recommended without
ceasing, his Friends and Benefactours to
our Lord; he pray'd both day and night
for the prosperity of King <hi>Iohn</hi> the
third of <hi>Portugal;</hi> whom he call'd the
true Protectour of all the Society: But
the Persecutors of the Saint had a greater
share in his devotions than any others:
and at the same time when he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so unworthily by the Governour of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> he daily offer'd for him the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Mass. He was us'd to
say, that to render good for evil, was
in some sort a Divine Revenge: and
he reveng'd himself in that very sort
on the Governour of <hi>Comori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in one of his Letters is thus attested.

               <hi>My dear Brother in Iesus Christ</hi> (thus
he wrote to Father <hi>Mansilla) I hear
uncomfortable news, that the Governour's
Ship is destroy'd by fire, that his Houses
also are burnt down: that he is retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Island, and has nothing left him,
even for the necessary provisions of life.
I desire you, out of Christian charity, to
go with the soonest to his relief, with your
Christians of</hi> Punical: <hi>get what Barks
you can together, and lade them with all
manner of Provisions; I have written ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
to the chief of the people, that they
furnish you with all things necessary, and
especially with fresh water, which as you
know, is very scarce in those desart Islands.
I wou'd go in person to the assistance of the
Governour, if I thought my presence might
be acceptable to him: but of late he hates
me, and has written that he cou'd not say,
without giving scandal, all the evils I
have done him. God and man can bear
me witness, if ever I have done him the

            <p>Behold the sequel of the Voyages, of
the <hi>Indian</hi> Apostle <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi> I
have omitted a vast number of Islands
and Regions, where we are satisfy'd he
carried the light of the Gospel; I say I
have not mention'd them, because the
time is not precisely known, when he
made these Voyages. For what remains,
I undertake not to reckon up the leagues
which he has travel'd, the supputation
would be difficult to make, and content
my self to say in general, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of our Geographers,
who have exactly measur'd the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Globe, if all his courses were to be
computed, they wou'd be found, to be
many times exceeding the circumference
of this World.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the least of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in all his Travels, was to Travel.
And they who were best acquainted with
him, report of him, what St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
said of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul, that he ran
through the World with an incredible swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and as it were on the wing,</hi> yet not
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:48349:359"/>
without labour, nor that labour without
fruit, but Preaching, Baptizing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
Disputing with the Gentiles, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Idolaters,</hi> reforming manners,
and throughout establishing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Piety. His Apostolical labours,
were attended with all the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of life, and if those people were to
be credited, who the most narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
him, it was a continual Miracle
that he liv'd. Or rather, the greatest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of <hi>Xavier</hi> was not to have reviv'd
so many dead, but not to dye himself of
labour, during the incessant sweat of ten
years toiling.</p>
            <p>His zeal alone sustain'd him; but
how painful soever were the functions of
his Ministry, he acquitted himself of
them, with so much promptitude and
joy, that by the Relation of Father <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior
Nugn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z</hi> he seem'd to do naturally
all he did. These are the very words
of <hi>Nugnez: The Father, Master</hi> Francis,
<hi>in labouring for the Salvation of the</hi> Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens
<hi>and</hi> Idolaters, <hi>seem'd to act not by
any infus'd or acquir'd vertue, but by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motion: for he cou'd neither live, nor
take the least pleasure but in Evangelical
Employments; in them he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound even his
repose: and to him, it was no labour, to
conduct others, to the love and knowledge
of his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="693" facs="tcp:48349:359"/>
Thus also, whensoever there was the
least probabilty, that the Faith might be
planted in any new Countrey of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
he flew thither in despight of all
threatning difficulties. The certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is not known of those whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
but the receiv'd opinion mounts
it to seven hundred thousand Souls.
Which notwithstanding it ought not to
be believ'd, that he instructed them but
lightly: for before he christen'd them,
he gave them a through insight into all
the Principles of Faith. According to
their different conditions, his Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were also different. He had some
which were proper to Youth, others for
Wives, for Widows, for Servants, and for
Masters. He never chang'd places till he
had left behind him a solid establishment
of Faith, and capable of preserving it
self, on its own basis. And in effect, of all
the Countries which he made Christian,
there is none to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound which relaps'd
into Idolatry, excepting only the Town of
<hi>Tolo;</hi> and not that neither, for any long
continuance. But 'tis well known, that
the people, who during the space of
fifteen or sixteen years, had not seen the
Face of any Priest, or even of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in Religion, and as fervent in the
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:48349:360"/>
practice of Good-works, as if they had
but newly receiv'd Baptism. 'Tis
known that many of those Converts
were not less firm in their belief, than
the Prince of the Isle of <hi>Rosalao,</hi> whom
<hi>Pedro Martinez</hi> protests to have heard say,
<hi>That though all the World shou'd arm against
him, they shou'd never be able to tear out
of his Heart, that perswasion, which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Francis <hi>had inspir'd into him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know farther, that some of them
having been made Captives by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
have preserv'd their Faith entire in
the midst of Heathenism; and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
rather to lose their lives in torments,
than renounce their Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
The Saint was accustom'd to desire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
of God, the Conversion of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the Sacrifice of the Altar:
and for that very end, said a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Prayer, which he compos'd in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and is thus rendred in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>OEternal God, Creatour of all things,
mercifully remember, that the Souls
of Infidels are the work of thy Hands,
and that they are created to thy resemblance.
Behold, O Lord, how Hell is fill'd with
them, to the dishonour of thy name. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> thy Son, for their
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:48349:360"/>
Salvation suffer'd a most cruel death: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not, I beseech thee, that he shou'd be
despis'd by those Idolaters. Vouchsafe to
be propitiated by the Prayers of the Church,
thy most holy Spouse, and call to mind thy
own Compassion. Forget, O Lord, their
infidelity, and work in such manner, that
at length they may acknowledge for their
God, our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whom thou
hast sent into the World, and who is our
Salvation, our Life, our Resurrection, by
whom we have been redeem'd from Hell,
and to whom be all Glory now and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

imagination, the Idea of a man who was
recollected and austere, one who never
appear'd in publick, but to discourse of
Eternity, or to work Miracles: <hi>What, in
the name of God,</hi> said <hi>Norogna, is this

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound the Father chearful, and in good
humour. The whole Company going
ashore on the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<hi>Xavier</hi> taking a walk by himself,
into a Wood, and sent after him one of
his Servants, to observe his Actions:
The Servant found the Man of God rais'd
from the ground into the Air; his Eyes
fix'd on Heaven, and Rays about his
Countenance. He ran to give notice of
his discovery to his Master; who upon
the report came thither, and was himself
a Witness of it. Then <hi>Norogn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and that his Holiness was not incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with the gaiety of his Conversation.
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:48349:362"/>
By these methods the Apostle of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
attracted the Hearts of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
to himself, before he gain'd them
to our Lord.</p>
            <p>He took almost the same measures with
the Merchants: For he seem'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for nothing more than for their
Interests: He gave his Benediction to the
Vessels which they were sending out for
traffick, and made many enquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the success of their Affairs; as if
he had been Copartner with them. But
while he was discoursing with them of
Ports, of Winds, and of Merchandises, he
dextrously turn'd the Conversation on
the eternal gains of Heaven: <hi>How bent
are our desires,</hi> said he, <hi>on heaping up the
frail, and perishable Treasures of this
World; as if there were no other life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this earthly Being; nor other riches
besides the Gold of</hi> Japan, <hi>the Silks of</hi>
China, <hi>and the Spices of the</hi> Molucca's! <hi>Ah
what profits it a Man to gain the Vniverse,
and lose his Soul?</hi> These very words, which
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had formerly us'd to <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
in order to loosen him from the
World, were gotten familiar to him,
and he had them frequently in his
mouth. In respect of the new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
his conduct was altogether fatherly.
He suffer'd their rough, and barbarons
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:48349:363"/>
behaviour. And requir'd no more from
them in the beginning, than what might
be expected then from people of base ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
and grown inveterate in Vice.
As they were generally poor, he took a
particular care of their Families, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that
the <hi>Paravas</hi> shou'd be discharg'd from
certain excessive yearly Tributes. He
protected them more than once from the
fury of their neighbouring Nations, who
made War against them out of hatred to
the Faith, and induc'd the Governour of
the <hi>Indies,</hi> to send a Royal Army to their
relief; he sav'd them even from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them of their Goods through Avarice, and
set bounds to the unjust Exactions, of
those griping Ministers, by threatning to
complain of them both to King <hi>Iohn</hi> the

was Grand Inquisitour.</p>

he apply'd himself in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to withdraw them from their volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

was to insinuate himself into
the favour, not only of the Concubinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

               </gap>r Mistresses, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
this, by the mildness of his Aspect,
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:48349:363"/>
by the obligingness of his Words, and
sometimes by good Offices. Yet we
cannot think, that the Conversions of
Sinners cost him only these Addresses. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he treated with them concerning
the important business of their Souls, he
treated with God at the holy Altars;
but to render his Prayers more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he join'd them with all manner of
Austerities. Having notice, that three
<hi>Portuguese</hi> Souldiers, belonging to the
Garrison of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> had liv'd for five
years past, in great debauchery, he got
their good Wills, by his ingaging carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and wrought so well, that these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,
as wicked as they were, lodg'd
him in their Quarters, during a whole
<hi>Lent,</hi> so much they were charm'd with
his good humour. But while he appear'd
thus gay amongst them, in his outward
behaviour, for fear of giving them any
disgust of his Society, he underwent
most rigorous Penances to obtain the
Grace of their Conversion; and us'd his
Body so unmercifully, that he was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
for a moneth of those severities.
When <hi>Xavier</hi> had reduc'd his Penitents,
to that point, at which he aim'd; that
is, when he had brought them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
they cost him not less pains than
formerly. He always begg'd of God
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:48349:364"/>
their perseverance, with his tears; and
frequently, when he had enjoin'd them
some light Penance, pay'd for them the
remainder of their debts, with bloody
disciplining of his own Body. But when
he lighted on intractable and stubborn
Souls, he left them not off, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy;
but rather sought their good
opinion; and on occasion shew'd them a
better Countenance than usual, that
thence they might be given to understand,
how ready he was for their reception.</p>
            <p>When he went from <hi>Ternata</hi> to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna,</hi>
he left but two persons, who were
visibly ingag'd in Vice: The first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
which the Vessels had of repassing
to <hi>Ternata,</hi> he writ expresly to one of his
Friends, that he shou'd salute those two
scandalous sinners with all tenderness
from him; and let them know, that upon
the least sign which they shou'd make
him, he wou'd return to hear their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</p>
            <p>But these Condescentions, and this
Goodness of the Apostle had nothing in
them of meanness, or of weakness; and
he knew well enough, to make use of
severity, when there was occasion for it.
Thus, a Lady, who had accus'd her self
in Confession, to have look'd upon a
Man, with too alluring an Eye, was thus
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:48349:364"/>
answer'd by him, <hi>You are unworthy that
God shou'd look on you; since by those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
regards which you have given to
a Man, you have run the hazard of losing
God.</hi> The Lady was so pierc'd with these
few words, that during the rest of her life,
she durst never look any Man in the Face.</p>
            <p>By all these Methods, <hi>Xavier</hi> made
so many Converts. But whatever he
perform'd,<note place="margin">The extent of his Zeal.</note> he look'd on it, as no more
than an Essay. And he wrote in the
year 1549, that if God wou'd be pleas'd
to bestow on him, yet ten years more of
life, he despair'd not but these small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
wou'd be attended with more
happy Consequences. This ardent desire
of extending farther, the Dominion of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> caus'd him to write those
pressing Letters to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he might be
furnish'd with a larger supply of Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
he promis'd in his Letters, to
sweeten the Labour of the Mission,
by serving all his fellows, and loving
them better than himself. The year he
dy'd, he writ, that when once he had
subdu'd the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> and that of
<hi>Tartary,</hi> to the Scepter of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
he purpos'd to return into <hi>Europe,</hi> by the
<hi>North;</hi> that he might labour in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Hereticks, and restoration of
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:48349:365"/>
Discipline in Manners; that after this,
he design'd to go over into <hi>Africa,</hi> or
to return into <hi>Asia,</hi> in quest of new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
where he might preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
            <p>For what remains, though he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forming new designs, as if he were
to live beyond an Age, yet he labour'd
as if he had not a day to live; and so
tugg'd at the work which he had in
hand, that two or three days and nights
pass'd over his head, without once thinking
to take the least manner of nourishment.
In saying his Office, it often happen'd to
him, to leave for five or six times suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
the same Canonical-hour, for
the good of Souls; and he quitted it with
the same promptitude, that afterwards
he resum'd it: He broke off his very
Prayers, when the most inconsiderable
person, had the least occasion for him;
and order'd, when he was in the deepest
of his retirements, that if any poor Man,
or even but a Child shou'd desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
he might be call'd from his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>

have run more dangers, both by Land
and Sea; without reckoning into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the Tempests which he suffer'd in
ten years, of almost continual Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:48349:365"/>
'tis known, that being at the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca's,</hi>
and passing from Isle to Isle, he was
thrice Shipwrack'd; though we are not
certain of the time or places: and once
he was for three days and nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
on a Plank, at the mercy of the
Winds and Waves. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> have
often shot their Arrows at him; and
more than once, he fell into the hands
of an inrag'd multitude. One day the
<hi>Saracens</hi> pursu'd him, and endeavour'd to
have ston'd him: and the <hi>Brachmans</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
sought after him, to have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
him; even to that point of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
barbarity, as to set Fire on all the
Houses, where they imagin'd he might
lie conceal'd. But none of all these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
were able to affright him; and
the apprehension of dying, cou'd never
hinder him from performing his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Functions: It seem'd, that even dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
serv'd to the redoubling of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
and that by being too intrepid, he
sometimes enter'd into the extream of
rashness. Being at <hi>Iapan,</hi> he reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King of <hi>Amanguchi,</hi> so severely,
for the infamy, and scandal of his Vices,
that Father <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> (who serv'd
him for Interpreter, as being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
than the Saint, in the Language
of the Court) was amaz'd, and trembled
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:48349:366"/>
in pronouncing what the Father put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his mouth; as we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
in a Letter written by the same
<hi>Fernandez. Xavier,</hi> one day perceiving
the fear of his Companion; forbade him
absolutely, either to change, or soften
any of his words: I obey'd him, says
<hi>Fernandez;</hi> but expected every moment,
when the <hi>Barbarian</hi> shou'd strike me
with his Cymetar: and confess my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of death were as much too
great, as the concernment of Father
<hi>Francis</hi> was too little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In effect, he was so far from fearing
death, that he look'd on it, as a most
pleasing Object.</hi> If we dye for so good
a Cause, (<hi>said</hi> Xavier <hi>on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>)
we ought to place it amongst the
greatest benefits we receive from God, and
shall be very much oblig'd to those, who
freeing us from a continual death, such as
is this mortal life, shall put us in possession
of an eternal happiness. So, that we are
resolv'd to Preach the truth amongst them,
in despight of all their threatnings, and
encourag'd by the hopes of Divine assistance,
obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the precept of our Saviour, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to preserr the Salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
above our lives.</p>
            <p>In the most hazardous undertakings,
he hop'd all things from God; and from
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:48349:366"/>
thence drew his assurance of daring all
things. Behold, what he says himself,
concerning his Voyage of <hi>Iapan. We
set out full of confidence in God: and
hope, that having him for our Conductor,
we shall Triumph over all his Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what remains, we fear not to
enter into the lists, with the Doctors
of <hi>Iapan;</hi> for what available knowledge
can they have, who are ignorant of the
only true God, and of his only Son our
Lord Jesus? and besides, what can we
justly apprehend, who have no other
aim than the Glory of God, and Jesus
Christ? the Preaching of the Gospel,
and the Salvation of Souls? supposing
that we were, not only in a Kingdom of
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> but in the very Dominion of
Devils, and that naked and disarm'd,
neither the most cruel barbarity, nor the
rage of Hell cou'd hurt us without God's
permission. We are afraid of nothing
but ossending God Almighty; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that we ossend not him, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
our selves, through his assistance, an
assur'd Victory over all our Enemies.
Since he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ords sufficient strength to
every man, for his service, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
sin, we hope his mercy will
not be wanting to us. But as the sum
of all consists, in the good or evil use
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:48349:367"/>
of his benefits, we also hope he will give
us grace to employ our selves for his
glory, by the prayers of his Spouse, and
our holy Mother the Church; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by the intercession of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and those who are well affected
to it. Our greatest comfort proceeds
from this, that God beholds the scope
of this our Voyage, that our only aim
is to make known the Creatour of the
Universe to Souls which are made after
his own Image: to bring those Souls to
give him the Worship due to him, and
to spread the Christian Religion through
all Regions.</p>
            <p>With these encouragements, we doubt
not but the issue of our Voyage will be
prosperous; and two things especially
seem to assure us, that we shall vanquish
all the opposition of Hell; the one is the
greatness of our holy enterprise, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the care of Divine Providence;
whose Dominion is of no less extent
over Devils, than over men. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that in this Voyage, I foresee,
not only great labours, but also dangers
of almost inevitable death; and this i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
is frequently presented to
my thoughts, that if those of our Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
who are endu'd with the greatest
stock of knowledge, shou'd come into
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:48349:367"/>
the <hi>Indies,</hi> they wou'd certainly accuse
us of too much rashness, and wou'd be
apt to think, that, in exposing our selves,
to these manifest dangers, we tempted
God. Nevertheless upon a more serious
reflection, I cease to fear: and hope that
the Spirit of our Lord, which animates
our Society, will regulate their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
concerning it. For my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I think continually on what I
have heard our good Father <hi>Ignati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
often say, that those of our Society,
ought to exert their utmost force in van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
themselves; and banish from
them all those fears, which usually hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from placing our whole confidence
in God.</p>
            <p>For though Divine hope, is purely
and simply the grace of God, and that
he dispenses it, according to his pleasure,
nevertheless, they who endeavour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
themselves, receive it more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
than others. As there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
difference, betwixt those, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with all things, trust in God;
and those, who being sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with all necessaries, yet bereave
themselves of them, in imitation of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ;</hi> so is there also, in those who
trust in Gods providence, when they are
out of danger, and those, who with the
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:48349:368"/>
assistance of his grace, dare voluntarily
expose themselves to the greatest hazards
which are in their proper choice and
power to shun.</p>
            <p>It was in the Spirit of this holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the Saint, writing to <hi>Simon
Rodriguez,</hi> speaks in this manner to
him.</p>
            <p>Our God, holds in his hand the Tempests
which infest the Seas of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan;</hi>
the Rocks, the Gulphs, and Banks of Sands,
which are formidably known, by so many
Shipwracks, are all of them under his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
He is Soveraign over all those
Pyrates, which cruise the Seas, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their cruelties on the <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
And for this reason I cannot fear them.
I only fear, lest God should punish me
for being too pusillanimous in his service;
and so little capable, through my own frailty,
of extending the Kingdom of his Son, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those Nations, who know him not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He speaks in the same Spirit, to the
Fathers of</hi> Goa; <hi>in giving them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his arrival at</hi> Iapan—We
are infinitely oblig'd to God, for permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us to enter into these Barbarous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where we are to be regardless, and
in a manner forgetful of our selves: for
the Enemies of the true Religion, being
Masters every where, on whom can we rely,
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:48349:368"/>
but on God alone? and to whom can we have
recourse besides him? In our Countries,
where the Christian Faith is flourishing, it
happens, I know not how, that every thing
hinders us from reposing our selves on God:
The love of our Relations, the Bonds of
Friendship, the Conveniences of life, and
the Remedies which we use in sickness: but
here, being distant from the place of our
Nativity, and living amongst <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
where all humane succou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s are wanting to
us, 'tis of absolute necessity that our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in God alone, shou'd be our aid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Saint perhaps, never discours'd
better on this Subject, than in a Letter
written at his return from the</hi> Molucca's,
<hi>after a dangerous Navigation. His words
are these:</hi> It has pleas'd God, that we
shou'd not perish: it has also pleas'd him,
to instruct us even by our dangers, and to
make us know by our own experience, how
weak we are, when we rely only on our
selves; or on humane succours. For when
we come to understand the deceitfulness of
our hopes, and are intirely diffident of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
helps, we rely on God, who alone can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us out of those dangers, into which we
have ingag'd our selves on his account: we
shall soon experiment, that he governs all
things; and that the heavenly pleasure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:48349:369"/>
which he confers on his Servants, on such
occasions, ought to make us despise the
greatest hazards; even death it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f has
nothing in it, which is dreadful to them,
who have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast of those divine delights;
and though when we have escap'd those pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
of which we speak, we want words to
express the horrour of them; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in our heart a pleasing memory of
the favours which God has done us; and
that remembrance excites us day and night,
to labour in the service of so good a Master;
we are also enliven'd by it to honour him,
during the rest of our lives, hoping, that
out of his abundant mercy, he will bestow
on us a new strength, and fresh vigour, to
serve him faithfully, and generously even
to our death.</p>
            <p>May it please the Divine goodness, <hi>(he
says elsewhere)</hi> that good men, whom the
Devil endeavours to affright in the service
of God, might fear no other thing besides
displeasing him, in leaving off what they
have undertaken for his sake. If they
wou'd do this, how happy a life wou'd they
then lead! how much wou'd they advance
in virtue, knowing by their own experience,
that they can do nothing of themselves, but
that they can do all things by the assistance
of his grace!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="713" facs="tcp:48349:369"/>
               <hi>He said,</hi> that our most stedfast hold in
dangers and temptations, was to have a
noble courage against the foe of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
in a distrust of our own strength,
but a firm reliance on our Lord: so that
we shou'd not onely fear nothing, under the
conduct of such a general, but also shou'd
not doubt of Victory. <hi>He said also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that in those dangerous occasions, the
want of confidence in God, was more to be
fear'd, than any assault of the Enemy: and
that we shou'd run much greater hazard,
in the least distrust of the divine assistance,
in the greatest dangers, than in exposing
our selves to those very dangers. <hi>He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
lastly,</hi> that this danger was so much
the more formidable, the more it was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and the less that we perceiv'd it.</p>
            <p>These thoughts produc'd in the Soul
of this holy man,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> an entire diffidence
of himself, together with a perfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
He was the onely discourse of
the new World: <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>
gave him almost equal honour; and his
power over Nature was so great, that
it was said to be a kind of Miracle,
when he perform'd no Miracle. But
all this serv'd only to raise confusion in
him; because he found nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but his own nothingness: and being
nothing in his own conceit, he cou'd not
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:48349:370"/>
comprehend, how it was possible for him
to be esteem'd. Writing to the Doctor
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> before his Voyage to the
<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dies,</hi> he told him, <hi>that it was a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
grace of Heaven, to know our selves;
and that through the mercy of God, he
knew himself to be good for nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humbly beseech our Lord, (<hi>he wrote from
the</hi> Indies, <hi>to Father</hi> Simon Rodriguez,) that
I may have power to open the door of <hi>China</hi>
to others; where I am, I have done but
little. <hi>In many other passages of his
Letters, he calls himself an exceeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
man; a great Sinner; and conjures
his Brethren to employ their intercessions
to God in his behalf.</hi> Bring to pass by
your Prayers <hi>(says he to one of them)</hi>
that though my sins have render'd me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Ministerial Vocation, yet
God may vouchsafe out of his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to make use of me.</p>
            <p>I beseech you, <hi>(says he to another)</hi>
to implore the heavenly assistance for us;
and to the end you may do it, with the
greater fervency, I beseech our Lord, that
he wou'd give you to understand, how much
I stand in need of your intercession.</p>
            <p>It is of extream importance to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
(<hi>he writes to the Fathers of</hi> Goa)
that you understand, the wonderful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
in which I am. As God knows the
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:48349:370"/>
multitude and heynousness of my Sins,
I have a thought which much torments me;
'tis that God perhaps may not prosper our
Vndertakings, if we do not amend our
lives, and change our manners: 'Tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
on this account, to employ the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of all the Religious of our Society;
and of all our Friends: in hope, that by
their means, the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which
is the Spouse of our Lord Iesus, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
her innumerable merits to us; and
that the Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur of all good, will accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
his graces on us, notwithstanding our
offences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He attributed all the fruits of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
to an evident Miracle of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, which made use of so vile
and weak an instrument as himself, to
the end it might appear to be the work
of God. He said,</hi> that they who had great
Talents, ought to labour with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for the safety of Souls; since he who
was wanting in all the qualities, which are
requisite to so high a Calling, was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unprofitable in his Ministry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As he had a mean opinion of himself, and
that his own understanding was suspected
by him, he frequently, by his Letters,
requested his Brethren of</hi> Italy, <hi>and</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,
<hi>to instruct him in the best method
of Preaching the Gospel, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="716" facs="tcp:48349:371"/>
am going, <hi>said he,</hi> to publish Iesus Christ,
to people who are part <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and part
<hi>Saracens;</hi> I conjure you, by Iesus Christ
himself, to send me word, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and by what means I may instruct
them. For I am verily perswaded, that
God will suggest those ways to you,
which are most proper for the easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of those People into his Fold: And
if I wander from the right path, while I
am in expectation of your Letters, I hope
I shall return into it, when I shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that succeeded well to his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
in the service of our Lord, he
attributed to the intercession of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
Tour Prayers, (<hi>he writ to the

for me the knowledge of my infinite offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:

            <p>But if the designs which he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

Religion, happen'd to be thwarted, he
acknowledg'd no other reason of those
crosses than his own sins, and complain'd
onely of himself.</p>
            <p>As for those Miracles, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
wrought, they pass'd in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
as the effects of innocence in
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:48349:371"/>
Children, or for the fruits of faith in
sick Persons. And when at the sight of
a miraculous performance, the people
were at any time about to give him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
honours, he ran to hide himself in
the thickest of a Forest; or when he
cou'd not steal away, he enter'd so far
into the knowledge of himself, that he
stood secure from the least temptation
of vain glory. It even seem'd, that the
low opinion which he had of his own
worth, in some sort blinded him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the wonders which he wrought,
so that he perceiv'd not they were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>It was the common talk at <hi>Goa,</hi> that
he had rais'd the dead on the Coast of
<hi>Fishery:</hi> After his return to <hi>Goa, Iames
Borba,</hi> and <hi>Cozmo Annez,</hi> his two inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friends, requested him to inform
them, for God's further glory, how those
matters went; and particularly they
enquir'd, concerning the Child, who
was drown'd in the Well. The holy
Man at this request, hung down his
head, and blush'd exceedingly; when he
was somewhat recover'd of his bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Iesus,</hi> said he, <hi>what I to raise the
Dead! can you believe these things of such
a wretch as I am!</hi> After which, modestly
smiling, he went on: <hi>Alas poor Sinner
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:48349:372"/>
that I am! they set before me a Child,
whom they reported to be dead, and who
perhaps was not: I commanded him in the
name of God to arise; he arose indeed, and
where was the Miracle?</hi>

of his Voyages, that in</hi> India, <hi>he
happen'd to meet a</hi> Iaponnese, <hi>who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him, in a discourse which they had

<hi>said he,</hi> that being in <hi>Japan,</hi> a <hi>Bonza</hi> by
profession, I was once at an Assembly of
our <hi>Bonza's;</hi> who upon the report of so
many Miracles, as were wrought by Father
<hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> resolv'd to place him in
the number of their Gods: In order to
which, they sent to him a kind of Embassy:
But the Father was seiz'd with horrour at
the proposition of their Deputies. Having
spoken of God to them, after a most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
and elevated manner, he spake of
himself, in terms so humble, and with so
much self contempt, that all of us, were
much edify'd by his procedure. And the
greatest part of us seriously reflecting, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on his carriage than his words, from
Priests of Idols which we were, became the
Worshippers of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He shun'd the Offices of the Society,
and believ'd himself unworthy of them:</hi>
               <pb n="719" facs="tcp:48349:372"/>
I cannot tell you (<hi>wrote he from</hi> Cochin,
<hi>to Father</hi> Ignatius) how much I stand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to the <hi>Japonneses;</hi> in favour of
whom, God has given me clearly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the infinite number of my sins: for
'till that time, I was so little recollected,
and so far wander'd out of my self, that I
had not discover'd in the bottom of my
heart, an Abysse of imperfections and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
It was not 'till my labours and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in <hi>Japan,</hi> that I began at length to
open my eyes, and to understand, with God's
assistance, and by my own experience, that
it is necessary for me to have one, who
may watch over me, and govern me. May your
holy Charity be pleas'd for this reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what it is you do, in ranging under my
command, so many Saint-like Souls, of the
Fathers and Brethren of our Society. I
am so little endued with the qualities which
are requisite for such a charge, and am
so sensible that this is true, through God's
mercy, that I may reasonably hope, that
instead of reposing on me the care of others,
you will repose on others the care of me.

were his Seconds; and accounted his own
pains for nothing, in comparison of theirs:
After having related, what had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Father <hi>Francis Perez</hi> in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca:</hi>
I confess (<hi>my Brethren said he,</hi>
               <pb n="720" facs="tcp:48349:373"/>
to Paul de Camerino, <hi>and</hi> Antonio Gomez)
that seeing these things, I am asham'd of
my self, and my own lazy Cowardise makes
me blush, in l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oking on a Missioner, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and languishing as he is, yet labours
without intermission in the Salvation of
Souls. Xavier, <hi>more than once repeats
the same thing, in his Letter with
profound sentiments of esteem for</hi> Perez,
<hi>and strange contempt of his own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He recommends not any thing so
much to the Gospel Labourers, as the
knowledge of themselves, and shunning
of Pride. And we need only to open
any of his Letters, to behold his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on that Subject.</p>
            <p>Cultivate Humility with care,<note place="margin">His Maximes on Humility.</note> in all
those things which deprav'd Nature has in
horrour; and make sure, by the assistance of
Divine Grace, to gain a thorough knowledge
of your selves: for that understanding of
our selves, is the Mother of Christian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility:
Beware especially, lest the good
Opinion, which Men have conceiv'd of you,
do not give you too much pleasure; for those
vain delights are apt to make us negligent:
and that negligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were by a kind
of Enchantment, destroys the Humility of
our Hearts, and introduces Pride instead
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="721" facs="tcp:48349:373"/>
Be distrustful of your proper strength,
and build nothing upon humane wisdom, nor
on the esteem of men. By this means you
will be in condition to bear whatsoever
troubles shall happen to you; for God
strengthens the humble, and gives him cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
he is proof against the greatest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and nothing can ever separate him,
from the Charity of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> not the
Devil with his evil Angels, nor the Ocean
with its Tempests, nor the most brutal
Nations, with all their barbarity. And if
God sometimes permits, that the Devil
put impediments in his way, or that the
Elements make war against him, he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that it is only for the expiation
of his sins, for the augmentation of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and for the rendring him more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>They who fervently desire to advance
Gods glory, ought to humble themselves,
and be nothing in their own opinion; being
diffident even in the smallest matters of
their own abilities; to the end, that in
great occasions, becoming much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of themselves, through a principle of
Christian humility, they may entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in God; and this confidence may give
them resolution: for he who knows that he
is assisted from above, can never degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into weakness.</p>

            <p>Take heed of your selves, my dearest
Brethren; many Ministers of the Gospel,
who have open'd the way of Heaven to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Cyprian, <hi>who preach'd the Gospel at</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liapore.

of</hi> Goa, to read frequently the Instructions
which I have left with you; particularly,
those which concern Humility; and take an
especial care, in considering what God has
done by you, and by all the Labourers of
the Society, that you do not forget your self:
For my own particular, I shou'd he glad,
that all of you wou'd seriously think, how
many things God leaves undone, because you
are wanting to him in your Fidelity, and
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:48349:375"/>
I wou'd rather that consideration shou'd
employ your thoughts, than those great
works, which it has pleas'd our Lord to
accomplish by your Ministry; for the first
reflection will cover you with Confusion, and
make you mindful of your weakness; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that, the second will puff you up
with Vanity, and expose you to the danger
of having thoughts of Arrogance.</p>

               <hi>was the Principle of a perfect sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Will of God. He never
undertook any thing, without consulting
him before-hand; and the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were his only Rule.</hi> I have made
continual Prayers, <hi>says he,</hi> speaking of his
Voyage to <hi>Macassar,</hi> to know what Heaven
requires of me; for I was firmly resolv'd,
not to be wanting on my part to fulfil the
Will of God, whensoever it shou'd be made
known to me. May it please our Lord,
<hi>said he on the same subject,</hi> that out of
his goodness we might understand what he
designs by us, to the end we might entirely
conform our selves to his holy Will, so soon
as it shall be discover'd to us: For he
commands us to be always in a readiness to
obey him at the first signal, and it becomes us
to be as strangers in this World, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to follow the voice of our Conductor.</p>
            <p>I wish, <hi>said he in another place,</hi> that
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:48349:375"/>
God wou'd declare to us his most holy Will,
concerning the Ministries, and Countries,
where I may best employ my labours for his
glory. I am ready by his Grace to execute
those things which he makes me understand
to be most pleasing to him, of whatsoever
nature they may be, and undoubtedly, he
has admirable means of signifying his good
pleasure to us; such as are our inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and heavenly Illuminations, which
leave no remaining scruple concerning the
place to which he has design'd us, nor
what we are to undertake for his Service.
For we are like Travellers, not fix'd to any
Country through which we pass: 'Tis our
duty to be prepar'd to fly from one Region
to another, or rather into opposite Regions,
where the Voice of Heaven shall please to
call us. <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West, North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi>
are all indifferent to me, provided I may
have an opportunity of advancing the Glory
of our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He says elsewhere,</hi> I cou'd wish, that
you had ever in your mind this Meditation,
that a ready and obedient Will, which is

of <hi>Iesus,</hi> a Veneration and Reverence
mix'd with Tenderness, which surpass I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination.
He himself has express'd
some part of his thoughts on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and we cannot read them without
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:48349:376"/>
being edify'd. In one of his Letters,
which begins in this manner, <hi>My only
dear Father, in the Bowels of</hi> Jesus Christ,
he says at the Conclusion, <hi>Father of my
Soul, for whom I have a most profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
I write this to you upon my Knees,
as if you were present, and that I beheld
you with my Eyes:</hi> It was his Custom to
write to him in that posture; so high
was the place which <hi>Ignatius</hi> held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <q>God is my witness, my dearest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>says he in another Letter,</hi> how
much I wish to behold you in this life,
that I might communicate to you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matters, which cannot be remedy'd
without your aid: for there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of places, which can hinder me
from obeying you. I conjure you, my
best Father, to have some little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of us who are in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
and who are your Children. I conjure
you, I say, to send hither some holy
Man, whose fervour may excite our
lazy faintness. I hope, for the rest,
that as you know the bottom of our
Souls, by an illumination from Heaven,
you will not be wanting to supply us
with the means, of awakening our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
and drowzy Vertue, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring

               <pb n="728" facs="tcp:48349:377"/>
In another of his Letters which is
thus superscrib'd, <hi>To</hi> Ignatius, <hi>my holy
Father in</hi> Jesus Christ; he sends him
word, That the Letter which he receiv'd
from his holy Charity, at his return from
<hi>Iapan,</hi> had replenish'd him with joy;
and that particularly he was most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
affected, with the last words of it.
<hi>I am all yours, yours even to that degree,
that it is impossible for me to forget you,</hi>
Ignatius. <q>When I had read those
words, <hi>said he,</hi> the tears came flowing
into my Eyes, and gushing out of
them; which makes me, that I cannot
forbear writing them, and recalling to
my Memory, that sincere and holy
Friendship, which you always had, and
still have for me; nothing doubting, but
that if God has deliver'd me from so many
dangers, it has principally proceeded
from your fatherly intercessions for me.</q>
He calls himself his Son in all his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and thus subscribes himself in one:
<hi>The least of your Children, and most distant
from you,</hi> Francis Xavier. But the high
Idea's which <hi>Francis</hi> had of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
caus'd him frequently to ask his advice
in relation to his own conduct. <q>You
will do a charitable work, <hi>said he,</hi> in
writing to me a Letter, full of spiritual
Instructions, as a Legacy bequeath'd to
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:48349:377"/>
one, who is the least of all your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
at the farthest distance from you,
and who is as it were banish'd from
your presence, by which I may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
some part of those abundant trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which Heaven has heap'd upon
you. I beseech you not to be too nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
in the accomplishment of my
desires. I conjure you, <hi>says he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi>
by the tender love of <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> to give me the method, which
I ought to keep, in admitting those
who are to be Members of our Society;
and write to me at large, considering the
smallness of my Talent, which is well
known to you; for if you give me not
your assistance, the poor ability which
I have in these matters, will be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of my losing many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for the augmentation of God's
Glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In prescribing any thing that was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

               <q>I pray
you by our Lord, and by <hi>Ignatius</hi> the

<pb n="730" facs="tcp:48349:378"/>

            </p>
            <p>With these Sentiments, both of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and esteem, he depended absolutely
on his Superiour. <q>If I believ'd, <hi>says he,
writing from the</hi> Indies, <hi>to Father</hi> Simon
Rodriguez, that the strength of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
were equal to the vigour of your
Mind, I shou'd invite you to pass the Seas,
and desire your company in this new
World: I mean, if our Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
shou'd approve and counsel such a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
For he is our Parent, it behoves
us to obey him; and it is not permitted
us to make one step without his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this manner,</hi> Xavier <hi>had recourse to</hi>
Ignatius, <q>
                  <hi>on all occasions, as much as the
distance of places wou'd permit; and the
Orders which he receiv'd, were to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Laws.  You shall not suffer
any one,</hi>(so he writ to <hi>Gasper Barzaeus,</hi>
Rectour of the Colledge of <hi>Goa) to receive
the Orders of Priesthood, who is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
learn'd; and who has not given,
for the space of many years, sufficient
examples of his good life in our Society;
because our Father</hi> Ignatius, <hi>has expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden it.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>For the same reason
he exactly observ'd the Constitutions of

of it. At the time when</hi> Xavier <hi>dy'd,</hi>
Ignatius <hi>had thoughts of recalling him
from the</hi> Indies, <hi>not doubting, but at
the first notice of his Orders, this zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Missioner, wou'd leave all things,
out of his Obedience. And on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
he wrote to him, a Letter bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
date the</hi> 28th <hi>of</hi> Iune, <hi>in the year
1553. Behold the passage which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns
the business of which we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
I add, <hi>says</hi> Ignatius <hi>in his Letter,</hi>
that having in prospect the Salvation of
Souls, and the greater service of our Lord,
I have resolv'd to command you in vertue
of holy Obedience, to return into <hi>Portugal,</hi>
with the first opportunity; and I command
you this in the name of <hi>Christ.</hi> But that
you may more easily satisfy those, who are
desirous of retaining you in the <hi>Indies,</hi> for
the good of those Countries, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with my reasons: You know in the
first place, of what weight are the Orders
of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:48349:379"/>
of Religion in the <hi>East,</hi> for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of it in <hi>Guinea,</hi> and <hi>Brasile:</hi> and
you can rightly judge, that a Prince so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
as he, will do all things necessary,
for the advancement of Gods Honour, and
the conversion of People, if one of your Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Experience, shall personally instruct
him. And besides, 'tis of great importance,
that the holy Apostolical See, shou'd be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the present state of <hi>India,</hi> by
some authentick Witness; to the end, that
Popes may issue out spiritual supplies, as
well to the new, as to the ancient Christianity
of <hi>Asia;</hi> without which, neither the one nor
the other can subsist; or cannot subsist without
much trouble; and no body is more proper
than your self for this; both in respect of your
knowledge in the Affairs of the new World,
and of your Reputation in these parts.</p>
            <p>You know moreover, of what consequence
it is, that the Missioners who are sent to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> shou'd be proper for the end
propos'd: and 'tis convenient, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that you come to <hi>Portugal</hi> and
<hi>Rome.</hi> For not only many more will be
desirous of going on those Missions, but you
will make a better choice of Missioners;
and will see more clearly to what parts
such and such are proper to be sent. You judge
your self, of what consideration it is, not
to be mistaken in these Affairs. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:48349:379"/>
relation you can send us, your Letters
are not sufficient to give us a true notion, of
what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> abourers are fitting for the <hi>Indies.</hi>
'Tis necessary that you, or some one, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
as you, shou'd know and practice
those who are design'd for those Countries.
Besides what it will be in your power to do
for the common benefit of the <hi>East,</hi> you will
warm the Zeal of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in
relation to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which has been under
consideration for so many years, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet perform'd. You will also be of no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
use to the Affairs of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Brasile,</hi>
on which you can have no influence in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
for want of Commerce betwixt them
and you. But if you think your presence
may be necessary, for the Government of
those of the Society who are in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
you may govern them more easily from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
than you can from <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Japan.</hi>
For what remains, I remit you to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Master <hi>Polanque,</hi> and recommend my
self most cordially to your good Prayers,
beseeching, the Divine Goodness to multiply
his favours on you; to the end, that we
may understand his most holy Will, and
that we may perfectly perform it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father</hi> Polanque, <hi>who was Secretary
to Father</hi> Ignatius, <hi>and Confident to all
his purposes, has given testimony, That
the intention of the holy Founder was
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:48349:380"/>
to make</hi> Xavier <hi>General of the Society.
The Letter of</hi> Ignatius <hi>found</hi> Xavier
<hi>dead. But we may judge of what he
wou'd have done, by what he writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death to</hi> Ignatius <hi>himself, who
had testify'd so earnest a desire to see
him.</hi> Your holy Charity, <hi>says he in his
Letter,</hi> tells me, that you have an earnest
desire to see me once again, in this present
life: God who looks into the bottom of my
Heart, can tell how sensibly that mark of
your tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness has touch'd me. Truly,
whenever that expression of yours returns to
my remembrance, and it frequently returns,
the tears come dropping from my Eyes, and
I cannot restrain them; while I revolve that
happy thought; that once, yet once again it
may be given me to embrace you. I confess,
it appears difficult to compass my desires, but
all things are possible to holy Obedience.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, if the Letter of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
had found <hi>Xavier</hi> alive, he had soon
been seen in <hi>Europe;</hi> for having offer'd
of his own free motion, to leave the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Iapan,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
which he had upon his hands,
and having said, that the least beckoning
of his Superiour shou'd be sufficient for
it, what wou'd he not have done, when
he had receiv'd a positive command to
abandon all, and repass the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="735" facs="tcp:48349:380"/>
His Maxims of obedience shew clearly
what his own submission was.</p>
            <q>
               <p>There is nothing more certain,<note place="margin">His Maximes on obedience, and his love for the Society.</note> nor
less subject to mistake, than always to
be willing to obey. On the contrary,
'tis dangerous to live in complaisance to
our own wills; and without following
the motion of our Superiours: for though
we chance to perform any good action,
yet if we never so little deviate from
that which is commanded us, we may
rest assur'd, that our action is rather vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than good.</p>
               <p>The Devil by his malicious suggestions,
tempts the greatest part of those who
have devoted themselves to God's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<hi>What make you there,</hi> he secretly
whispers, <hi>see you not that you do but lose
your labour?</hi> resist that thought with all
your strength; for it is capable not only
of hindring you in the way to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but also of seducing you from it:
and let every one of you, perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he cannot better serve our
Lord, than in that place, where he is
set by his Superiour. Be also satisfy'd,
that when the time of God is come, he
will inspire your Superiours with
thoughts of sending you to such places,
where your labours shall abundantly
succeed. In the mean time, you shall
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:48349:381"/>
possess your Souls in peace. By this
means, you will well employ your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time, though too many do not
understand its value: and make great
proficiencies in virtue. 'Tis far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with those restless Souls, who do
no good in those places where they wish
to be, because they are not there; and
are unprofitable both to themselves and
others where they are, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be other-where.</p>
               <p>Perform with great affection, what
your Superiours order you, in relation
to domestick discipline, and suffer not
your self to be surpris'd with the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of the evil Spirit, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to perswade you, that some
other Employment wou'd be fitter for
you: his design is, that you shou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
that Office ill, in which you are
employ'd: I intreat you therefore, by
our Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to
consider seriously, how you may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
those temptations, which give
you a distast of your employment; and
to meditate more on that, than how to
ingage your self in such laborious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
as are not commanded you. Let
no man flatter himself; 'tis impossible
to excel in great matters, before we
arrive to excel in less: and 'tis a gross
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:48349:381"/>
errour, under the pretence of saving
Souls, to shake off the Yoke of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which is light and easie, and to
take up a Cross, which without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
is more hard and heavy.</p>
               <p>It becomes you to submit your will
and judgment to your Governours;
and to believe that God will inspire
them, in reference to you, with that
which will be most profitable to you.
For the rest, beware of asking any
thing with importunity, as some have
done, who press their Superiours with
such earnestness, that they even tear
from them that which they desire,
though the thing which they demand
be in it self pernicious; or if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
them, complain in publick, that
their life is odious to them: They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not, that their unhappiness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from their neglect of their vow,
and their endeavour to appropriate that
will to themselves, which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
consecrated to our Lord. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the more such people live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own capricious fancy, the
more uneasie and melancholick is their
life.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The holy man, was so thoroughly
perswaded, that the perfection of the
Society of Jesus consisted in obedience,
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:48349:382"/>
that he frequently commanded his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in vertue of their holy obedience,
thereby to increase their merit.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I pray you, <hi>said he to two Missioners
of</hi> Comorine, to go to the Isles <hi>del
Moro,</hi> and to the end you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have occasion of meriting by your
obedience, I positively command you.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is impossible to relate, with what
tenderness he lov'd the Society, nor how
much he concern'd himself in all their
interests, though of the smallest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Being in</hi> Portugal, <hi>before his
Voyage to the</hi> Indies, <hi>he wrote not any
Letters to</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein he did not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y
his great desire to know what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
it made in</hi> Italy. <hi>Writing to the
Fathers,</hi> Le Gay, <hi>and</hi> Laynez, <hi>he says
thus:</hi> Since our rule is confirm'd, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire to learn the names of those,
who are already receiv'd into our Order,
and of such as are upon the point of being
admitted. He exhorts them, to thank the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for the design which his
Majesty had to build a Colledge, or a House
for the Society: and we ought to make this
acknowledgement to the King, <hi>said he,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reby, to begin the Building.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The news which he receiv'd from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

were at</hi> Rome, <hi>gave him infinite consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb n="739" facs="tcp:48349:382"/>
I have receiv'd your Letters, which
I expected with much impatience, and have
receiv'd them with that joy, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ought to have, in receiving some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
news from their Mother. In effect, I learn
from them, the prosperous condition of all the
Society; and the holy Employments wherein
you ingage your selves, without intermission.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He cou'd scarcely moderate his joy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he thought on the establishment of
the Society: Thus he wrote from the</hi> Indies
<hi>to</hi> Rome: Amongst all the favours which I
have receiv'd from God in this present life,
and which I receive daily, the most signal,
and most sensible, is to have heard that the
Institute of our Society has been approv'd and
confirm'd by the Authority of the Holy See.
I give immortal thanks to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that
he has been pleas'd his Vicar shou'd publickly
establish the form of life, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
has prescrib'd in private to his Servant,
our Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Xavier</hi> also wish'd nothing more,
than to see the Society increas'd; and
he felt a redoubling of his joy, by the
same proportion, when he had notice of
their gaining new Houses in the East,
or when he heard from <hi>Europe,</hi> of the
foundation of new Colledges.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he had not less affection
for the particular persons, who were
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:48349:383"/>
Members of the Society, than for the
body of it. His Brethren were ever
present in his thoughts,; and he thought
it not enough to love them barely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a continual remembrance of them.
<hi>I carry ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut with me,</hi> (thus he writes to
the Fathers at <hi>Rome</hi>) all your Names, of
your own hand-writing, in your Letters;
and I carry them together, with the solemn
form of my profession. By which he signifies
not only how dear the Sons of the Society
were to him, but also how much he esteem'd
the honour of being one of their number.</p>
            <p>The love which he bore to Gospel-poverty,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note>
caus'd him to subsist on Alms,
and to beg his Bread from door to door,
when he might have had a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made for him. Being even in the
Colledge of <hi>Goa,</hi> which was well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd,
he sought his livelyhood without
the Walls, the more to conform himself
to the poverty of his blessed Saviour. He
was always very meanly cloath'd, and
most commonly had so many patches on
his Cassock, that the Children of the
<hi>Idolaters</hi> derided him. He piec'd up his
tatters with his own hand, and never
chang'd his habit, till it was worn to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ags; at least, if the honour of God,
and the interest of Religion, did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
oblige him. At his return from
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:48349:383"/>
               <hi>Iapan</hi> to <hi>Malacca,</hi> where he was receiv'd
with so much honour, he wore on his
back a torn Cassock, and a rusty old Hat
on his head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> beholding him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so ill apparell'd, often desir'd him to
give them leave to present him with a
new habit: but seeing he wou'd not be
perswaded, they once devis'd a way, of
stealing his Cassock, while he was asleep.
The trick succeeded, and <hi>Xavier,</hi> whose
Soul was wholly intent on God, put on
a new habit, which they had laid in the
place of his old garment, without disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
how they had serv'd him. He
pass'd the whole day in the same igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the cheat, and it was not till
the evening that he perceiv'd it. For
supping with <hi>Francis Payva,</hi> and other
<hi>Portugueses,</hi> who were privy to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
'tis perhaps to do honour to our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
said one amongst them, that you
are so spruce to day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in your new ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
Then, casting his eyes upon his
Cloaths, he was much surpris'd, to find
himself in so strange an Equipage. At
length being made sensible of the prank
which they had plaid him, he told them
smiling, <hi>that it was no great wonder that
this rich Cassock, looking for a Master in
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:48349:384"/>
the dark, cou'd not see its way to some body
who deserv'd it better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he liv'd most commonly amongst
the poorer sort of <hi>Indians,</hi> who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to bestow, and who for the most
part went naked, he enjoy'd his Poverty
without molestation. All his moveables
were a Matt, on which he lay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and a little Table, whereon were
his Writings, and some little Books, with
a wooden Crucifix, made of that, which
the <hi>Indians</hi> call the wood of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He cheerfully underwent the greatest
hardships of Poverty: and writing from</hi>
Iapan <hi>to the Fathers of</hi> Goa, <hi>his words
were these:</hi> Assist me, I beseech you, my
dear Brethren, in acknowledging to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, the signal favour he has done
me: I am at length arriv'd at <hi>Japan,</hi>
where there is an extream scarcity of all
things: which I place amongst the greatest
Benefits of Providence.</p>
            <p>Mortification is always the Companion
of poverty in Apostolical persons. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
bore constantly along with him,
the instruments of Penance; Hair cloath,
Chains of Iron, and Disciplines, pointed
at the ends, and exceeding sharp. He
treated his flesh with great severity, by
the same motive, which oblig'd St. <hi>Paul</hi>
the Apostle to chastise his Body, and to
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:48349:384"/>
reduce it into servitude; least having
preach'd to other men, he might himself
become a Reprobate.</p>
            <p>At Sea, the Ship tackling serv'd him
for a Bed; on Land a Matt, or the Earth
it self. He eat so little, that one of his
Companions assures us, that without a
Miracle he cou'd not have liv'd. Another
tells us, that he seldom, or never drank
Wine, unless at the Tables of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses;</hi>
for there, he avoided singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and took what was given him. But
afterwards he reveng'd himself on one
of those repasts, by an abstinence of
many days.</p>
            <p>When he was at <hi>Cape Comorine,</hi> the
Viceroy <hi>Don Alphonso de Sosa,</hi> sent him
two Barrels of excellent Wine: He did
not once taste of it, though he was then
brought very low, through the labours

            <p>His ordinary nourishment in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
was Rice, boyl'd in water, or some
little piece of Salt-Fish: but during the
two years and a half, of his residence in
<hi>Iapan,</hi> he totally abstain'd from Fish, for
the better edification of that People.
And writ to the Fathers at <hi>Rome, that
he wou'd rather choose to dye of hunger,
than to give any man the least occasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

scandal.</hi> He also says, <hi>I count it for a
signal favour, that God has brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Country, destitute of all the comforts
of life, and where, if I were so ill dispos'd,
it wou'd be impossible for me, to pamper up
my Body with delicious fare.</hi> He perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
travell'd by Land, on foot; even
in <hi>Iapan,</hi> where the ways are asperous,
and almost impassable: and often walk'd
with naked feet, in the greatest severity
of Winter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The hardships of so long a Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
says he, <hi>so long a sojourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>in a Country parch'd
up with excessive heats, all these incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
being suffer'd, as they ought to
be, for the sake of</hi> Christ, <hi>are truly an
abundant source of consolations. For
my self,</hi> I am verily perswaded, that they
who love the Cross of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> live
happy in the midst of sufferings; and that
it is a death when they have no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to suffer. For can there be a more
cruel death, than to live without <hi>Jesus
Christ,</hi> after once we have tasted of him?
Is any thing more hard, than to abandon
him, that we may satisfy our own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
believe me, there is no other Cross,
which is to be compar'd to that. How
happy is it, on the other side, to live, in
dying daily, and in con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uering our passions,
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:48349:385"/>
to search after, not our proper interests,
but the interests of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His interiour mortification was the
principle of these thoughts in this holy
man; from the first years of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
his study was to gain an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
conquest on himself; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
always to exhort others, not to
suffer themselves to be hurried away, by
the fury of their natural desires. He
writes thus to the Fathers and Brethren
of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> from <hi>Malacca; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
present in my thoughts, what I have
heard from our Holy Father</hi> Ignatius, <hi>that
the true Children of the Society of Iesus,
ought to labour exceedingly in overcoming
of themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you search our Lord in the Spirit of
truth, <hi>says he to the Jesuites of</hi> Goa, and
generously walk in those ways, which conduct
you to him, the Spiritual delights which
you taste in his service, will sweeten all
those bitter agonies, which the conquest of
your selves will cost you. O my God, how
grosly stupid is mankind, not to comprehend
that by a faint and cowardly resistance
of the assaults of the Devil, they deprive
themselves of the most pure and sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
which life can give them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>By the daily practice of these Maxims,
<hi>Xavier</hi> came to be so absolute a Master of
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:48349:386"/>
his passions, that he knew not what it
was to have the least motion of choler,
and impatience: and from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
partly, that tranquility of Soul,
that equality of Countenance, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Chearfulness, which render'd him
so easie and so acceptable in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>'Tis natural,<note place="margin">His purity of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul and Body.</note> for a man who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
mortify'd, to be chaste. And so
was <hi>Xavier,</hi> to such a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that we have it certify'd from
his Ghostly Fathers, and amongst others,
from the Vicar of <hi>Meliapore,</hi> that he
liv'd and dy'd a Virgin. From his youth
upward he had an extream horrour for
impurity; notwithstanding, that he was
of a sanguine complexion, and naturally
lov'd pleasure. While he was a Student
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and dwelt in the Colledge of
<hi>Sainte Barbe,</hi> his Tutor in Philosophy;
who was a man lost in debauches, and
who dyed, of a dishonest disease, carried
his Scholars by night to Brothel-houses.
The abominable man did all he cou'd,
towards the debauching of <hi>Francis Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
who was handsom, and well shap'd,
but he cou'd never accomplish his wicked
purpose: so much was the youth estrang'd
from the uncleanness of all fleshly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="747" facs="tcp:48349:386"/>
For what remains, nothing can more
clearly make out his love to purity, than
what happen'd to him once at <hi>Rome.

from all conversation of Women, if cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
oblig'd him not, to take care of

he kept all imaginable measures,
never entertaining them with discourse,
unless in publick places, and in sight of
all the world: nor speaking with them
of ought, but what was necessary, and
then also sparing of his words, and with
a grave, modest, and serious countenance.

            </p>
            <p>Besides all this, he kept his senses

confess'd himself when he had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of a Priest. By these means,

               </gap> acquir'd such a purity of Soul and

In like manner, he never forgave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the least miscarriage; and 'tis incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
how far the tenderness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
went on all occasions. In that
Vessel which carried him from <hi>Lisbonne</hi>
to the <hi>Indies,</hi> a Child who was of years
which are capable of instruction, one
day happen'd to dye suddenly: <hi>Xavier</hi>
immediately enquir'd, if the Child had
been usually present at Catechism, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Ship's Company? It
was answer'd in the negative; and at the
same moment, the man of God, whose
countenance commonly was cheerful,
appear'd extreamly sad. The Viceroy
<hi>Alphonso de Sosa,</hi> soon observ'd it, and
knowing the cause of his affliction, ask'd
the Father, if he had any former know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Child came not to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism;
If I had known it, reply'd <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
I had not fail'd to have brought
him thither: But, why then, said the
Vicerory are you thus disquieted for a
thing you know not, and of which you
are no ways guilty? 'Tis, reply'd the
Saint, because I ought to upbraid my
self with it as a fault, that I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that any person, who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
with me, wanted to be taught the
Christian Faith.</p>

               <pb n="750" facs="tcp:48349:388"/>
A body so chaste,<note place="margin">His devotion to the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> and a mind so pure,
cou'd not have been, but of one who
was faithfully devoted to the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
The Saint honour'd, and lov'd her
all his life, with thoughts full of respect
and tenderness. It was in the Church of
<hi>Mont Martre,</hi> dedicated to the Mother of
God, and on the day of her Assumption,
that he made his first vows. It was in
that of <hi>Loretto,</hi> that he had his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
and conceiv'd his first desires
of going to the <hi>Indies.</hi> He petition'd
for nothing of our Lord, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of his Mother: and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which he made of the Christian
Doctrine; after addressing himself to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
to obtain the grace of a lively and
constant Faith, he fail'd not of addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself to <hi>Mary.</hi> He concluded all
his instructions with the <hi>Salve Regina,</hi>
he never undertook any thing, but under
her <hi>protection;</hi> and in all dangers, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
recourse to the blessed Virgin, as his
Patroness. For the rest, to shew that he
depended on her, and made his glory of
that dependance. He commonly wore
a Chaplet about his neck, to the end that
Christians might take delight in saying
the Chaplet; and made f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="751" facs="tcp:48349:388"/>
When he pass'd whole nights at his
devotions in Churches, it was almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
before the Image of the Virgin, and
especially, he offer'd his vows to her, for
the Conversion of notorious Sinners, and
also for the remission of his own offences,
as himself testifies in a Letter of his, which
shews not less his humility, than his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the intercession of the Blessed
Virgin. <hi>I have taken the Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for my Patroness, that, by her Prayers
I may obtain the pardon of my innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sins.</hi> He was particularly devoted
to her immaculate Conception, and made
a vow to defend it, to the utmost of his
power.</p>
            <p>In conversation, he frequently spoke of
the greatness of the divine <hi>Mary;</hi> and
attracted all men to her service. In fine,
being just upon the point of drawing his
last breath, he invok'd her name with
tender words, and besought her, to shew
her self his Mother.</p>
            <p>These are the principal vertues, which
were collected, to be presented to the

               </note> who was upon the point
of being converted, when <hi>Xavier</hi> left
<hi>Iapan,</hi> had no sooner lost the holy man,
but he was regain'd by the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> and
fell into all the disorders of which a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
can be capable. He confess'd the
Christian Law to be the better; but
said it was too rigorous, and that a
young Prince, as he was, born in the
midst of pleasures, cou'd not brook it.
His Luxury hinder'd him not from the
love of Arms, nor from being very brave,
and he was so fortunate in War, that he
reduc'd four or five Kingdoms under his
Obedience. In the course of all his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
the last words which Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
had said to him, concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the World, and the necessity of
Baptism, came into his remembrance:
he made serious reflections on them, and
was so deeply mov'd by them, that one
day he appear'd in publick, with a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
about his neck, as it were to make an
open profession of Christianity.</p>
            <p>The effects were correspondent to the
appearances: he had tow Idols in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of great value, which he worshipped
every day, prostrating himself before
them, with his forehead touching the
ground: these Images he commanded to
be thrown into the Sea. After this, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:48349:389"/>
himself to the exercises of Piety
and Penitence, he totally renounc'd his
sensual pleasures, and was finally Baptis'd
by Father <hi>Cabira,</hi> of the Society of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
At his Baptism he took the name
of <hi>Francis,</hi> in memory of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
for the Father of his Soul,
and whom he call'd by that title, during
the remainder of his life.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Bungo</hi> had hitherto been
so fortunate, that his Prosperity pass'd
into a Proverb. But God was pleas'd to
try him. Two Months after his Baptism,
the most considerable of his Subjects,
entring into a. <hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
against him, out of hatred to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and joyning with his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes, defeated him in a pitch'd
Battle, and despoyl'd him of all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.
He endur'd his ill fortune, with
great constancy, and when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that the change
of his Religion had been the cause of his
ruine, he made a Vow at the foot of
the Altar, to live and dye a Christian;
adding, by a holy transport of Zeal,
that if all <hi>Iapan,</hi> and all <hi>Europe,</hi> if the
Fathers of the Society, and the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shou'd renounce our Saviour <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> yet, for his own particular he
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:48349:390"/>
wou'd confess him to the last gasp; and
be always ready, with God's assistance,
to shed his Blood, in testimony of his
Faith.</p>
            <p>As the Piety of this Prince diminish'd
nothing of his Valour, nor of his Conduct,
having gather'd up the remainder of his
Troops, he restor'd himself by degrees,
partly by force of Arms, and partly by
amicable ways of Treaty. His principal
care after his re-establishment, was to
banish Idolatry out of his Estates, and to
restore the Catholick Religion. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
led him to send a solemn Embassy
to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, who at
that time govern'd the Church. <hi>Don Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Saint, with as much devotion as if they
had not been <hi>Mahometans.</hi> The Ships
which pass'd in sight of <hi>Sancian</hi> saluted the
place of his death with all their Cannon:
sometimes they landed on the Island, only
to view the spot of Earth, where he had
been buried for two months and a half,
and to bear away a turff of that holy
ground. Insomuch, that the <hi>Chineses,</hi>
entring into a belief, that there was some
hidden treasure in the place, set guards
of Souldiers round about it, to hinder it
from being taken thence. One of the
new <hi>Indian</hi> Converts, and of the most
devoted to the Man of God, not content
with seeing the place of his death, had
also the curiosity, to view that of his
Nativity: Insomuch, that travelling

               </note> a series of Miracles
was blaz'd abroad in all places. Five or
six passengers, who had set sail from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca</hi>
towards <hi>China,</hi> in the Ship of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
Coeglio,</hi> fell sick, even to the point
of death. So soon as they were set on
shore at <hi>Sancian,</hi> they caus'd themselves
to be carried to the Meadow, where <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi>
had been first interr'd; and there
having cover'd their heads with that Earth
which once had touch'd his holy Body,
they were perfectly cur'd upon the spot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xavier</hi> appear'd to divers people, on
the Coast of <hi>Travancor,</hi> and that of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shery,</hi>
sometimes to heal them, or to
comfort them in the agonies of death:
at other times to deliver the Prisoners,
and to reduce Sinners into the ways of
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="757" facs="tcp:48349:391"/>
His name was propitious on the Seas,
in the most evident dangers. The Ship
of <hi>Emanuel de Sylva,</hi> going from <hi>Cochin,</hi>
and having taken the way of <hi>Bengala,</hi>
in the midst of the Gulph, there arose
so furious a Tempest, that they were
constrain'd to cut the Mast, and throw
all the Merchandises over-board: when
nothing less than Shipwrack was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they all implor'd the aid of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
of the <hi>Indies, Francis Xavier.</hi> At
the same instant, a Wave, which was
rolling on, and ready to break over the
Ship, like some vast Mountain, went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on the sudden, and dissipated into
Foam. The Seamen and Passengers, at
the sight of so manifest a Miracle, invok'd
the Saint with loud voices, still as the
Tempest grew upon them; and the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
fail'd not of retiring always at the
name of <hi>Xavier:</hi> But whenever they
ceas'd from calling on him, the Waves
outrageously swell'd, and beat the Ship
on every side.</p>
            <p>It may almost be said, That the Saint
in person wrought these Miracles; but it
is unconceivable, how many were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Subscriptions of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by the Beads of his Chaplet, by the
pieces of his Garments; and finally, by
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:48349:392"/>
every thing which had once been any

            <p>The Crosses, which he had erected
with his own hand on sundry Coasts to
be seen from far by Mariners and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
were loaded with the Vows and
Gifts, which Christians, <hi>Saraceus,</hi> and
Idolaters had fasten'd to them daily, in
acknowledgment of favours which they
had receiv'd, through the intercession of
the holy Man. But the most celebrated
of those Crosses, was that at <hi>Cotata,</hi>
whereon an Image of <hi>Xavier</hi> was plac'd.
A blind man receiv'd sight by embracing
of that Cross: two sick men were cur'd
on the instant; one of which, who was
aged, had a setled Palsie, and the other
was dying of a bloody Flux. Copies
were made of that miraculous Image at
<hi>Cotata;</hi> and <hi>Gasper Gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>North-wind</hi> then blowing, and the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being almost all of Wood, the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
began with mighty rage, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
a Maid belonging to the house was
burn'd. The Neighbours awaken'd with
the cries of Fire, cast their Goods out at
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:48349:392"/>
the Windows, in confusion; there being
no probability of preserving the houses,
because that of <hi>Miranda</hi> was the highest,
and the burning Coals, which flew out
on every side, together with the Flames,
which were driven by the Wind, fell
on the tops of the Houses, that were
only cover'd with bows of Palm-trees,
dry, and easy to take Fire. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of danger, <hi>Gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself of the holy Image which he had
brought, falling on his Knees, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
by all his domestick Servants, he
held it upwards to the Flames, and invok'd
Father <hi>Francis</hi> to his assistance. At the
same instant the Fire was extinguish'd of
it self; and the Town in this manner
preserv'd from desolation, when it was
ready to be burn'd to Ashes.</p>
            <p>A Medal which had on one side the
Image of the Saint, and on the other,
that of the holy Virgin, holding the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

had been breeding many Months. The
Chirurgeons for fear of exasperating the
malady, by making an Incision in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a part, endeavour'd to dry up the
humour, by applying other Remedies.
But the Imposthume degenerated into a

Medal of Father <hi>Xavier,</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to her, and kneel'd before her.
The <hi>Chinese</hi> only touch'd him thrice, and
made the sign of the Cross over him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her Custom; and at the same
moment, the Cancer vanish'd; the Flesh
return'd to its natural colour, on the part
where the Ulcer had been formerly, and
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> found himself as well, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
had ever ail'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Dias</hi> was not only blind, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the Palsie over half her Body,
on the right-side of it; so that her Arm
hung dead from her Shoulder, and she
had only the use one Leg: despairing
of all natural Remedies, she caus'd her
self to be convey'd to <hi>Lucy</hi>'s Lodgings.
The Hospitable Widow, kept her in her
House for the space of seven days; and
washed her every of those days with the
Water wherein the Medal had been dipt.
On the seventh day, she made the sign of
the Cross over the Eyes of the Patient
with the Medal it self; and then <hi>Dias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
her sight: Her Palsie, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

his Legs for a long time, had been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Ulcers, and were become so
rotten, that Worms were continually
crawling out of them. The Physicians,
to divert the humours, put in practice all
the secrets of their Art, but without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
On the contrary, the Sinews were
so shrunk up on one side, that one Leg
was shorter than the other. And for the
last addition of misfortunes, <hi>Figheredo</hi> was
seiz'd with so terrible a Lask, that in a
man of threescore years old, as he was,
it was judg'd mortal. In effect, it had
been so, but that he had immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Medal of <hi>Xavier:</hi> he drank
of the Water, wherein it had been dip'd;
after which he was entirely cur'd, both
of his Ulcers and his Dysentery.</p>

blotted out the memory of the greatest
Prodigies, which were done elsewhere.
The Body of the Saint perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
the Flesh tender, and of a lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
was a continued Miracle. They
who beheld the Sacred Corps, cou'd
scarcely believe that the Soul was separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it: And <hi>Dias Carvaglio,</hi> who
had known <hi>Xavier</hi> particularly in his life,
seeing his Body many years after he had
been dead, found the Features of his Face
so lively, and every part of him so fresh,
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:48349:394"/>
that he cou'd not forbear to cry out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat

            <p>The Vicar General of <hi>Goa, Ambrosio Ribera,</hi>
wou'd himself examine, if the Inwards were
corresponding to the outward appearances.
Having thrust his Finger into the hurt which
they gave the Saint, when they interr'd him
at <hi>Malacca,</hi> he saw Blood and Water issue out
of it. The same experiment happen'd at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time to a Brother of the Society.</p>
            <p>The Saint was one day publickly expos'd,
with his Feet bare, at the importunity of the
people, who through Devotion petition'd to
kiss them. A Woman, who passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd,

fasten'd her Teeth in it, and bit off a little
piece of Flesh. The Blood immediately ran in
great abundance out of it; and of so pure a
Crimson, that the most healthful Bodies
cou'd not send out a more living colour. The
Physicians, who visited the Corps from time
to time, and who always depos'd, that there
cou'd be nothing of natural in what they saw,
judg'd, that the Blood which came from a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
depriv'd of heat, and issu'd from a part so
distant from the heart, as is the Foot, cou'd be
no other than the effect of a Celestial Vertue;
which not only preserv'd all parts of it from
putrefaction, but also caus'd the humours to
flow, and maintain'd them in the motion,
which only life infuses in them.</p>

<pb n="764" facs="tcp:48349:395"/>
had design'd. After a Juridical Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Virtues and Miracles, above

Xavier,</hi> Priest of the Society of <hi>Iesus</hi> by an
express Bull, dated the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> in the
year 1619.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth, who immediately
succeeded Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, Canoniz'd
him afterwards in all the forms, and with
all the procedures, which the Church observes
on the like occasions. The Ceremony was
perform'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in
the year 1622. But as death prevented him
from making the Bull of the Canonization, it
was his Successour <hi>Vrban</hi> the Eighth, who
finally accomplish'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Bull,</hi>

               <hi>bearing date the sixth of</hi> August,
<hi>in the year 1623, is an</hi> Epitome <hi>and</hi> Panegyrick
<hi>of the miraculous life of the Saint. It is there
said,</hi> That the new Apostle of the <hi>Indies</hi> has spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
receiv'd the Blessing which God vouchsafed
to the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of many Nations; and that he saw his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> multiply'd beyond the Stars
of Heaven, and the Sands of the Sea. That, for
the rest, his Apostleship has had the signs of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vocation, such as are the gift of Tongues,
the gift of Prophecy, the gift of Miracles, with
the Evangelical vertues in all perfection.</p>
            <p>The Bull reports almost all the Miracles,
which we have seen in his Life; particularly,
the Resurrections of the Dead; and amongst
other miraculous Cures, which were wrought
after his decease, it observes those of <hi>Gonsal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo

<pb n="765" facs="tcp:48349:395"/>
Figheredo.</hi> It also mentions two famous
Cures, of which we have said nothing. One
is of a blind man, who having pray'd to God
nine days successively, by the order of <hi>Xavier,</hi>
who appear'd to him, instantly recover'd his
sight. The other was of a Leper, who being
anointed, and rub'd over, with the Oyl of a
Lamp, which burn'd before the Image of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi>
was entirely cur'd. The Pope has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his Bull, <hi>That the Lamps which hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Image, which was venerated at</hi> Cotata,
<hi>often burn'd with Holy-water, as if they had been
full of Oyl, to the great astonishment of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
The other Miracles which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and which are omitted in the Bull, are
contain'd in the Acts of the process of the
Canonization.</p>
            <p>Since the time that the holy See,<note place="margin">The Veneration of the Saint is much increas'd since his Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization.</note> has plac'd
the Apostle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in the number of
the Saints; 'tis incredible how much the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Devotion, has every where been augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
towards him. Cities have taken him for
their Patron and Protectour. Altars have been
erected, and incessant Vowa have been made to
him. Men have visited his Tomb, with more
devotion than ever; and the Chamber where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was born, has been converted into a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to which Pilgrims have resorted in great
crowds, from all the quarters of the World.</p>
            <p>For the rest,<note place="margin">New Miracles are wrought, and chiefly in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> it was not in vain, that they

the year 1552, destitute of all worldly convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but accumulated with all sorts of spiritual blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings;
having first made known <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to
many thousands of those Eastern People.<note n="*" place="margin">The Reader is referr'd to the Original English, for the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; the Translatour not having the work by him.</note> 
               <hi>The
modern Histories of the</hi> Indies, <hi>are fill'd with
the excellent vertues, and miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that holy Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur Tavernier, <hi>who is endu'd with all
the probity which a man can have, without
the true Religion, makes a step farther, than
these two Historians, and speaks like a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
St. <hi>Francis Xavier, says he,</hi> ended in
this place his Mission, together with his life, after
he had establish'd the Christian Faith, with an
admirable progress in all places through which he
pass'd; not only by his zeal, but also by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and by the holiness of his manners. He had
never been in <hi>China,</hi> but there is great probability,
that the Religion which he had establish'd in the
Isle of <hi>Niphon,</hi> extended it self into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:48349:397"/>
Countries; and multiply'd by the cares of
that holy Man, who by a just Title may be call'd
the St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and true Apostle of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what remains,<note place="margin">What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ok.</note> if <hi>Xavier</hi> was endu'd
with all Apostolical virtues, does it not follow,
that the Religion which he preach'd, was that
of the Apostles? Is there the least appearance
that a man, who was chosen by God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Idolatry and Impiety in the new World,
shou'd be himself an Idolater and a wicked
man, in adoring <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> upon the Altars,
in invoking of the Holy Virgin, in engaging
himself to God by Vows, in desiring Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
from the Pope, in using the sign of the
Cross and Holy-water for the cure of the sick,
in Praying, and saying Masses for the dead?
In fine, is it possible to believe, that this holy
Man, this new Apostle, this second St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
continued all his life in the way of perdition,
and instead of enjoying at this present time the
happiness of the Saints, endures the torments
of the Damn'd? Let us then pronounce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
this Work as we began it, that the
Life of St. <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> is an Authentick
Testimony of the truth of the Gospel; and
that we cannot strictly observe, what God
has wrought by the ministry of his Servant,
without a full satisfaction in this point, that
the Catholick, Apostolick, and <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
is the Church of our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
