         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

'Tis fit indeed the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of him,

<hi>Herod</hi> was not ſmitten from Heaven, for

againſt which the Sun-Beams ſtriking,
caus'd it to reflect ſo Divine a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
(as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us) which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
that Blaſphemous Acclamation,
from the Aſtoniſht People; but becauſe
He too greedily ſwallowed down thoſe
vain Adulations, and was inebriated with
the conceit of being voted a Deity.
Princes have their <hi>Garments,</hi> as well as
their <hi>Miniſters</hi> of State, which are the
appropriate and <hi>peculiar Treaſure of Kings;</hi>
and may the eye of that Subject wax ſore,

Whether ever he had ſeen a more

on his Throne)? yea Sir, quoth <hi>Solon,</hi> I
have ſeen <hi>Woodcocks, Pheſants</hi> and <hi>Peacocks,</hi>
and theſe were graced with a natural
beauty, whereas yours is but a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Glory, which muſt vail to time, and
ſhake hands ere it be long with Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.)
He that thinks the <hi>Wardrobe</hi> too fine,
muſt traiterouſly fear the <hi>Exchecquer</hi> too

Nature, more unſeaſonably applicable to
our <hi>Engliſh-Court,</hi> when God has bleſſed

of Empyre needs the Emiſſion of
ſome Luſture to keep up its Majeſty and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93989:4"/>
Dread.) <hi>William Rufus</hi> was of another
Temper, who when his <hi>Chamberlain</hi> brought
him a pair of Hoſe of <hi>three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
(which then, might be equal to <hi>ten</hi>

<hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> both innocent and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in themſelves, and are expreſſive of

his <hi>Judges</hi> Gownes to ſit in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Judgment, and others to wear at
home in their private houſes. Our

And theſe indeed <hi>(Lampred in Alex.

We, of all other Creatures, if we were

forget God, this is no proportion at all to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
half a day for the tricking of the Body,

of the Soul. Thoſe that glitter in ſoft
Clothing, may be reſpected in Kings Houſes;
but without Faith, Repentance and true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
they are of no reckning in Gods Houſe:
And ſuch Correſpondence there is between God
&amp; the King, that I could never yet read of any,
who neglected the Service of their Maſter in
Heaven, did ever true ſervice to their Maſter
on Earth; theſe two Worſhips therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in the Tables of the Law, let them not

of Honour to whom Honour belongs, hath
as equally obliged thoſe Honuorable Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages

and fence their Native Immunityes from
all the inſolen tinvaſions of too incroaching
Uſurpations, which the affronting hand of
impudence does (but too commonly) thruſt
in to make upon them. God is ſo tender
of the great Prerogative of his Worſhip,
that he profeſſes, by no means will he part

which himſelf is ſworn ſo ſuperſtituouſly
to maintain, That he were happier to feel
it bathed in the blood of his heart, than
ignominouſly to ſurrender it with the leaſt

               <p>There are, who believe that ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity

Is there no Balm in</hi> Gilead? Nor means
to retrieve us? ſhall we not at leaſt go
hand in hand, and reconcile to prayers
and tears? ſhall we not weep together
for deliverance, without upbraiding each
others drops, as Hypocriticall? Is not
the Bleſſing, a <hi>Common Salvation,</hi> which
we all ſo paſſionately long for? do we
hate each other to that Degree, that
ſome are contented to be miſerable ſtill,
that others may not be happy? Is this
the ſpirit of Love? This the temper of
the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-Charity? This the way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
an incenſed God? who becauſe our
Spirits are burning in hatred, is ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling
the Flames of his Vengeance,
whoſe aſhes, becauſe we will not lay them
on our Heads, God (ere they are quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched)
lays them on our Habitations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and blows them up into freſh Fires,
and upon our breaſts too to encreaſe
the <hi>Coals</hi> there. Nay, ſo far are we from
thinking on <hi>Sackcloaths,</hi> or treaties with
God for forbearance, ſo far from bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtiffknee, and lifting up the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hand: That there is a danger in the

into Sedition, as a piece of <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93989:21"/>
of the Age. As if Converſion to God
were not the ready way to Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of peace. Come Reader, before we

down our pride, our inſolence, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of Judgments, our abuſe of names,
our curſed animoſities, our dreadful
heart-burnings, and bring our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a poſture, fit for Humiliation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

hope indeed; but without this, God hath
ſaid it, <hi>There is no peace.</hi> And a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Mercies it is, that at ſuch a time

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. Many complaints I heard
abroad in the World, but very little to the
purpoſe, not one of an hundred conſiders
matters aright, much leſs layes to heart
the true cauſe of that whereof they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
But ſhall I tell you the true Cauſes
of our miſery. We have made a League,
a moſt unfortunate evil League; and we
have made a War, a moſt dangerous
deſtructive War; a League with Satan,
and a War with God: theſe are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
cauſes of our deſtruction, and unleſs
rooted up, will be our confuſion. Not
long ſince we lamented a Plague that
deſtroy'd many thouſands; that ceaſed,
but our Sin, the cauſe thereof, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
therefore another calamity <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oon
followed: Then we lamented a great and
dreadful Fire, which conſumed our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93989:22"/>
City; that alſo ceaſed, but Sin ſtill
remained. Then we lamented a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
War, when our Enemies ſayled
up the River ſo near us, that it ſtruck
a Terrour into the hearts of all: they
likewiſe are gon, Our Sin ſtill remaines.
So we go on lamenting one Calamity
after another, and labour ſtill with might
and main to redreſs the preſent grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
but the neglect the cauſe, like men
in a Feaver pain'd here, and pain'd there,
we toſs from ſide to ſide to find reſt;
we call for this &amp; that Drink to quench our
thirſt, but all in vain; the Feaver of
Luſt ſtill burns in our Bowels, and till
this be cured, no eaſe, no reſt to be
had. (Again <hi>Page 20.)</hi> The luſts of the
Fleſh are moſt horribly exorbitant in
both the parts of it, Voluptuouſneſs of
Diet, and Laſciviouſneſs of body. The
buſineſs of Diet which formerly was the
care and talk of Women to their Cooks,
and Caterers, is now become the ſtudy
and diſcourſe of men, even Gentry and
Nobles, whoſe Brains is ſunck into their
Guts, and ſo are become very skillful
in the Belly-ſcience; for they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Rarities never heard of in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, and are ſo early ripe in this
Art, that before they have ſtudied Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93989:22"/>
or Gramar, they are Maſters in
the Art of Cookery. Nor are they
leſs skilful in Drinks than Meats: and
'tis a thing adds much to their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that there is not a ſort of Wine
growing in any part of <hi>France, Germany,
Spain, Italy,</hi> but they have the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
name thereof more ready than their
Creed or Pater-noſter, and will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you with a ſcore at leaſt in one
Meal. (And <hi>Page 22.)</hi> Thus having by
the luſt of Voluptuouſneſs, by curious
and exceſſive Eating and Drinking, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the luſt of Laſciviouſneſs. They
give themſelves up to work all manner
of uncleanneſs with Greedineſs; Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and Adultery, not only frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted in private, but publickly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Men in the dark formerly ſculk't
into lewd houſes, and there had their
revellings; but now men, Married men,
in the light, bring into their own houſes
moſt lewd Strumpets, feaſt and ſport
with them in the face of the Sun; mean
while their neglected, ſcorned, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated
wives, are forced to retire to
their ſecret Cloſets, that they may not
be ſpectators of thoſe Abominations. And
whoever doth not approve, yea, and
practiſe ſuch deteſtable wickedneſs, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93989:23"/>
is not a Devil incarnate, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
by theſe as a devilliſh Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:
<hi>(O incomparable Biſhop, never ſo
great a Truth ſpoken!)</hi> for they have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
quenched the light of the Spirit
in their naſty pudle of uncleaneſs, they
have ſo feared their conſciences with
burning Luſt; they have ſo Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed
themſelves into Laſcivious Goats,
as they have no more belief of God
in them, than theſe natural Bruite Beaſts,
and ſo conclude. The reſt of men have
no more conſcience or belief of God
than themſelves, and that all their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pity is meer Hypocriſy, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
deſigne for ſome advantage. <hi>(Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
thank God for ſo faithful a witneſs.)</hi>
And by ſuch ſcornful reproaches on one
hand, and enticeing allurements on the
other, they gain many Aſſociates, who
have not the courage to reſiſt the one,
nor conſtancy to withſtand the other;
by which meanes Lewdneſs and Atheiſme
are ſtrangely increaſed in Court, City,
and Country. How far ſome Grandees
of the Nation have been a Countenance
and incouragement to Inferiours, is ſo
viſible, there needs no diſcourſe to ſhew
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(Page 25.)</hi> We are grown ſo irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93989:23"/>
civil in this Age, that it paſſes
for Incivility if any one offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
or ſo much as frown; nay, if you
do not ſhew ſome complaiſance, and
ſmile at their lewd prophane diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<hi>(Page 27.)</hi> Come now you that
wou'd paſs for Noble and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd

tender-hearted women, conſider well I
pray you with me, what ſhall we think
of this our foul ſinful and hateful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards our bleſſed Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

Apparrel, all our ſplended Pomp &amp;
Vanity. And totally humble our ſelves
inſide and outſide, all Gallantry muſt
be put off, Sackcloth put on; we muſt
mortify our carnal beaſtial Luſt, and
let our Eyes brake forth into fountains
of tears, to waſh away the lothſom filth
thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But becauſe every Truth is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93989:24"/>
and is it not the caſe of us? Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!
was it only the caſe of that King of

certainly this evil is from the

Actors, and promoters (of his
late Majeſties Death) <hi>(Page 29)</hi> matters

all theſe things ſtrange and wonderful in
our Eyes? is not the hand of God to be
ſeen clearly in all this?—Let us now
ſee the National behaviour, when theſe
Judgments have been ſo many, ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
ſo viſible, have the Inhabitants of
the Land learned Righteouſneſs? have
they prevailed upon us to break off our
ſins by Repentance, or to continue in
them, and encreaſe them with a bris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and ſturdier Reſolution? Inſtead of
being a Religious and Praying people,
are we not become an Atheiſtical and
Blaſpheaming people? Inſtead of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

our hands of the Univerſal irreligion and

and it is this.—</p>
                  <p>That (as ſure as there is a God in

That if after ſo many loud Calls to

What ſhall we do that the blood of

from Ruin and Deſtruction? wherefore
let us trifle no more, let us ſin no more,

I adventure here to ſubjoyne one ſhort
obſervation of a Biſhop too, Whoſe words
will evidence for him the Integrity of his
heart towards God in the late Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he lived. The Learned Biſhop <hi>Downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
in a Sermon at the Spittle (called
<hi>Abrahams Tryal,)</hi> Thus complains.</p>
               <q>In theſe times the Godly live among
ſuch a Generation of men, As that if a

in any meaſure, although he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not with matters of State, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or Ceremonies: As for example,
if a Miniſter diligently preach, or in his
preaching ſeek to profit rather than
pleaſe (remembring the ſaying of the
Apoſtle; If I ſeek to pleaſe men, I am
not the Servant of God, <hi>Gal. 1. 10.)</hi> Or
if a Private Chriſtian make Conſcience
of Swearing, Sanctifing the Sabbath, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
Sermons, or abſtain from
the Common corruption of the times,
he ſhall ſtraitwayes be condemned for a

                  <hi>Purtian,</hi> and conſequently be leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
than either a carnal Goſpeller,
or a cloſe <hi>Papiſt.</hi> I ſhall leave the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this note to the Reader to

               <p>When <hi>Luther</hi> began to preach againſt

him thus; <hi>As good hold your tongue,
the Cuſtom is ſo ſtrong, you will do no good:
Get you into your</hi> Study <hi>and Pray, Domine

methinks while I undertake a diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Pride, and the fooleries of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

               <p>I have often wondred why the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Fathers, <hi>(Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St.

ſome other) have bent their Pens ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
againſt the Pride and Vanity
of womens Attyre, writing whole Tracts
and long diſcourſes about them, when now
'tis ſo perfectly out of faſhion to deal upon
theſe ſubjects, and our Pulpits ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93989:27"/>
ſilent, as ſcarce a Reproof can be
heard in a year: Is it becauſe this Sin
is reform'd, and our Ladyes now a dayes
grown more Modeſt and Chriſtian, and
ſo not properly taxable of the Vice?
Ah no! I trow, our Enquire will find them
ten times more guilty than ever were thoſe
in the Fathers dayes; Or what? have we
not ſo great a Kindneſs and Zeal to the
Women as they? and do we abate in care
to their Souls? I pray God we have not
too great a Kindneſs to them, for which
they will Curſe us another day. But when
I hear St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſo earneſtly proteſting
to <hi>Demetrias,</hi> that no <hi>Rayment, Ornament,</hi>
or <hi>Habit</hi> whatſoever would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Chriſt, but what ſhe made with

Exhorting her therefore that to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew

ſhe ſhall take in hand her <hi>Flax</hi>

in the Cloth of her own Spinning (and
yet this <hi>Demetrias,</hi> a Lady of Fortune and

of our women, who would huff St.

a work; the good Father muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them, theſe have ſomthing elſe to

Note of Biſhop <hi>Babington</hi> [upon <hi>Gen. 24.
13.]</hi> Where the Great <hi>Rebeccah came out
with her Pitcher upon her ſhoulder to draw
water—See (ſaith he) the ſimplicity and

Nay, <hi>Eliezer</hi> who was there arrived to

When now, poor Girles ſurpriſed in an
unperfect dreſs, or a foul pair of Gloves,
are ready to ſink down with fear and ſhame
as if that were enough to brake off the
match, not conſidering how far they impoſe
on the folly &amp; indiſcretion of ſuch Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
who ſhould reſpect more the outward

Niceties, than the inward Virtues, and
Court rather the <hi>Cloaths</hi> than the <hi>Woman;</hi>
when yet there is not the leaſt pin ſtuck
into head or heart towards a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a better Husband who has told
them beforehand that he will come when
they little think on't, and commanded
them therefore to be <hi>alwayes Ready,</hi> leſt
they be ſurprized by <hi>Him</hi> too, and found
in ſuch a pickle as will make him abhor
them for ever. Indeed <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vized
them to more wit, when he tells
them, that if they would <hi>dreſs them in the
Silk of Sincerity, the Sattin of Sanctity,
and the Purple of Modeſty,</hi> God <hi>himſelf
would not fail to be a Suitor to them.</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Moore</hi> once ſeeing a young Lady
tricked up in the moſt exceſſive Curioſity
of Attire, (and I was ſurpriz'd when I
found that <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Lapide</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on <hi>Timothy,</hi> has gotten the ſtory by

But what ſaid Old <hi>Plautus, A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

therefore, ſaid he, if any <hi>Man want work
or buſineſs for his mony, Let him get him a
Ship or</hi> a <hi>Wife.</hi> Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that
<hi>Phocian</hi> (the Athenian General) was Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93989:29"/>
happy in this, who when a great
Lady of <hi>Jonia</hi> came to <hi>Athens</hi> to paſs a viſit
on her, and ſhew'd her all the Rich
Jewels, and Precious ſtones of her Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;
But ſaith this Lady, <hi>All my Riches,
and Jewels, is my Husband Phocion.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
thoſe <hi>Athenians</hi> were a politick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and car'd very little that their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould bare away the ſpoiles of their
Eſtate, who therefore had Officers on
purpoſe who were to order the Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for women, and to take care that no
one might wear any thing unbecoming her
Place or Degree, and theſe were called
<hi>Gyneconomi.</hi> A Committee that ſate on the
Female affayrs, to keep them in due Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and Order. Very much wanted in
England. The like Power had the <hi>Ephori</hi> to
correct the <hi>Spartan</hi> Extravagancies, and I
confeſs the Laws of <hi>Licurgus</hi> (for youth
eſpecially) were ſo choice and remarkable,
that the very reading of them would make
us reflect on our own impudencies, when
(as my Author tells me) the very young
men of the City were reduced to
ſo high a degree of Civility and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
that paſſing through the Streets on
their Lawful Occaſions, they would wrap
themſelves up in their Cloaks, not ſtand
prating to every one they met, nor <hi>Gaze
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93989:29"/>
up and down,</hi> but kept their very eyes
fixt upon the ground; by which means,
in a while, the maſculine Sex excelled in
all baſhfulneſs and gravity, the very choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
perfections of the Feminine. Their
Voices were no more heard, than if they
had been <hi>Statues</hi> of Stone, neither were the
young Damoſels more chaſt in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
than were thoſe young men as they
walked in the Streets. And does not this
make thee bluſh, Reader, to conſider, the
Rudeneſs, the Incivility, the Inſolence, the
the Wild and Immodeſt Geſtures, and
Deportment not of the Males only in our
City, but the Looſneſs, the Staring and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
the Idle and Diſſolute Carriage of
the very Virgins and Young Ladies who
ſet themſelves out on purpoſe to be pick't
up, and Gaz'd on, and turn their back
upon every paſſenger, as it were to tell
him they are freely at his ſervice. Not
to ſpeak now of the ſwarmes of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
proſtitutes (the Plagues of the
Town) that have every Night their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
walks and appartments to ply in;
you may find them as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, not in
the <hi>Corner of the Streets</hi> onely, but thick in
the very midſt of them, and turning the
whole City into a Stews. It were well
if the like diſpatch of ſome Ship-Loads
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93989:30"/>
of them were made to the Forraign <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
as in the time of the Uſurper
there was. And theſe too, glittering as
ſo many Stars all over in the ſparkles of
St. <hi>Martins,</hi> the proper Lawful Dreſs of
their Trade by the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>-Law,
who allowed none of theſe Gayities to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but VVhores.</p>
               <p>Nor can I but mention another moſt
profitable Law of <hi>Licurgus,</hi> who ordain'd,
that the young men of <hi>Sparta</hi> ſhould have
frequent meetings in ſome publick place,
where they ſhould Eat and Drink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a mutual increaſe of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and love; but when aſſembled, their
chiefeſt diſcourſes were ordain'd to be
for the better contrivance and carrying
on the proſperity and wellfare of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
on purpoſe (ſaith my Author) to avoid
any idle or impertinent prattle; and when
all finiſh'd, in due Order and Civility to
depart each one to his proper home, and
betimes too, without the Leaſt Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by VVine, leſt any notice ſhould be
taken of any diſorder, in their paſſage
home through the Streets (for Night was
to be no mantle to vice, no more than
the day had been) ſo as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Excellent Government, they ſhould
take care to honour it by as honeſt a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93989:30"/>
Carriage. What, Reader, does the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi>
bring forth better fruit than the
<hi>Garden!</hi> We are every one ſtriving for
the Honour of the Church and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
Let us at leaſt take Example by
theſe Heathen, who ſurely were wiſer in
their Generation than we. Is debauchery
and ſottiſhneſs become the true methods
of Honour to ſo incomparable a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we lye under? and the roarings of
our Taverns at midnight quite drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Anthems of our Church? Alas,
when ſhall we begin with a faithful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
(with theſe <hi>Spartanes)</hi> to bring glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Miter,</hi> whoſe
Honour we ſo paſſionately contend for,
yet ſuffer its Jewels to ſwim away in our
<hi>Spew,</hi> and then only to diſpute for a Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
when we have loſt our ſences in the
draughts of intemperance, and are not
able to ſpeak a plain word.</p>
               <p>And further, they were ſo farr from
Pomp of Apparrel, that no gain or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Eſtate could tempt them to ſo
vain a Superfluity; they conſulted the
well-Ordering and Governing their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
more than any Exteriour magnificent
Clothing; and loved better to have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their Purſes, than to lay it all out
on their Backs. When thou knoweſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93989:31"/>
what a World of <hi>Byas'es,</hi> appear like
Princes among us, yet carry all they have
in the World about them, as He. <hi>Long-Coats</hi>
and a <hi>Drivelling-Cloth,</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Demonſtrative Garbe of a <hi>Natural,</hi>
and is not unbecoming for him, who dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
himſelf up in his whole Eſtate, and
has left not a peny to dine on, but is more
ridiculous than <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes
himſelf to get ſome. There was
once a Gallant in a <hi>Velvet-Coat,</hi> and a
<hi>Scarlet-Cloak</hi> over it, walking in <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
where finding himſelf very hungry, and
over-hearing ſome others diſcourſe of a
Feaſt the <hi>Ironmongers</hi> held that day in
their Hall, was glad of that News, and
reſolving to intrude amongſt them: No
ſooner appear'd, then was courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and promoted by the <hi>Stewards</hi> to
the beſt Seat at the Table, (as one they
thought, who might formerly be of the

                  </hi> or at leaſt deſcended from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

them the Honour to Grace them with His
Worſhipful Company) when Dinner was
over, and he had lay'd well about him,
and brisk'd up his Spirits with Wine:
The chiefeſt of the Company (with whom
he Convers'd) were at length ſo bold to
deſire him to diſcover himſelf, and what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93989:31"/>
Relation he had to their <hi>Society:</hi> To whom
he very merrily replyed. <hi>O a very near
affinity to your Trade, for I my ſelf am a</hi>
Monger <hi>too.</hi> They pray him to explain
what he meant. <hi>By my troth Gentlemen,
ſince you muſt know, I am a Whore-Monger,</hi>
and have waſted my Eſtate in my Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo that wanting a Dinner, I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the contiguity of our Callings might
well entitle me to the Good Repaſt I
I have found among you, and ſo I bid
you adieu. I am afraid it will endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
moſt of the <hi>Societies</hi> in the City to
provide for the mnltitudes of his Trade
and Finery, (that ſtand in as great need
of a Dinner as he) who are Breathing
Vivifications of that notorious Truth. <hi>By

               </p>
               <p>Among the Hereſies, <hi>(Auguſt. de Hereſ.)</hi>
that aroſe very early in the Church, there
ſtarted out a <hi>Sect,</hi> called [the <hi>Paterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani]</hi>
poſſibly the Spawn of the filthy <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks;</hi>
whoſe opinion was, that the upper
Parts of a mans Body were made indeed
by God, but the lower Parts from the
Girdle, they held was made by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and very fond they grew of their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which they thought gave them a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do with the Devils part what
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93989:32"/>
they pleas'd, ſo long as they reſerv'd the
reſt unto God. Who muſt excuſe them
if they imploy that (wherein he had no
title) unto the ſervice of the Devil and
luſt. 'Tis to be fear'd, this <hi>Hereſie</hi> inſenſibly
has crept in among us, and gotten too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
an hold; and it were well, if it had
not improv'd, and encroach'd beyond it's
firſt limits; but, ſure it ſeemes to battle
here in it's own Ordure, and ſport it ſelf
as in it's own Element. While it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
to invade the poor remains it has
left unto God, and hardly left him an
Eye or a Lip for his ſervice. The <hi>Tongue</hi>
(the Trumpet of his Honour) is now (as
St. <hi>James</hi> ſaid) ſet on fire of Hell, and
and belching out the Infernal Vapours,
with <hi>Aetna,</hi> as furiouſly as the Tayle is
reaking with the ſmoak and ſteames
of impurity and filth. And (which is
moſt pitteous to behold) our very <hi>Ladies</hi>
(ſo far, obeying the Apoſtle) <hi>yield the more
abundant Honour to the leſs Honourable parts</hi>
(which theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſay, were made

Univerſally careleſs of Gods, that (like

Bare to ſhift for it's ſelf as it can, and

'Tis pitty: Ladies ſhould be Hereticks

               <p>How have the the <hi>Primitive</hi> Fathers
Thundred againſt this inſufferable ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of bare Bodies, as if wholly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
to the reverence and ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Chriſtian Religion? Where is

Lay down thy Pen, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

Let that paſſion ceaſe now (holy

thy froward Spirit did ever abound
with. And why haſt thou rail'd againſt
bare Necks, <hi>As the flames that comſumed
Youth, the Incentives of Luſt, and the never

What a ſtorm wilt thou raiſe over thy
ſacred Head, and provoke thy excellent
Volumes to be doom'd to the fire, their

of Womens Pride? And what was thy

the droppings of thy ſlowing Lips, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93989:34"/>
the ſhowres of thine Eloquence, with

<hi>What, do ye come hither into the

into the Sanctuary of your Maker to make
your Conqueſts here? And here to ſatisfy

the bloud of their Hearts ſtarted
up into their Face and Necks, and all
purpled their very ſhoulders, when the

yet, why (Golden Father) waſt thou ſo

Sure thine ayme was to affright them out

do, tho they might well be ſcar'd out of
their Wits, with the very thought of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

endleſs <hi>Reader,</hi> to gather up the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Writers both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
whoſe Ardency and Zeal for the

ſeems alas, now very perfectly quench'd
by the inundation of the Sin and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
They ſo paſſionatly Damned, that
the whole <hi>Church</hi> through all the World
ſeems totally to deſpair of redreſs, or any

Souls, ſince themſelves can effect
no Good in the well and modeſt ordering
their Bodies and Habits.</p>
               <p>Yet to theſe Primitive Fathers, I ſhall
add the ſence of two or three of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Divines,</hi> and ſhew my Reader how
fully they accord with the former. <hi>How
many (ſays Reverend</hi> Downeham) <hi>do openly
profeſs their inward uncleanneſs, by laying
open to the common view, their naked Breaſts,
as tho it were a Bill affixed to the dore poſts,
to ſignify to the paſſers by, that within that place
dwells an unclean Heart, and that whoſoever
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93989:35"/>
will, may there buy Honeſty and Chaſtity at

on the ſame Text. <hi>Whores uſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their filthineſs much in their Breaſts,
either in the Nakedneſs of their Breaſts, or
in thoſe Ornaments they hang about them.</hi>
Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath powred out a
flood of Zeal, were it poſſible to drown
this madneſs. <q>The end of Attire is to
hide the ſhameful Nakedneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from the ſight of men; why then are
Garments made of ſuch a faſhion as that
the Neck and Breaſts may be left for a
great part uncovered? But ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as theſe do hereby expreſs the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and lightneſs of their Minds: What
do they elſe but even diſplay and manifeſt
unto Men and Angells their own ſhame
and ignominy? Nay, what do they elſe,
but glory in that, which is by the juſt
judgment of God reproachful unto them?
Let all thoſe that fear God and are
humbled in conſideration of their Sins,
be otherwiſe affected</q> —Reader, ſcorn
not the Teſtimony of this holy Man from
the plaineſs of his words. The name of
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> is contemptible to none but
ſuch as want his humble Spirit.</p>
               <p>Come Ladies, what is your opinion of
theſe Holy Fathers? Sure you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93989:35"/>
them as <hi>Sectaries</hi> or <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> who
conſpire to bring all the world under their
Girdle, as you think. You hear how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have declared againſt the very Sin
you practiſe and plead for: Whoſe words
believe you, will ſtand the Teſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, theirs or yours? the Vice is
the ſame now, as it was in the Ages they
lived in, and the danger from it the
ſame. What ever prejudice you may idlely
entertain (from the ſad diſtraction of a
divided Church) againſt the preſent <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God. Sure I am,
you can righteouſly harbour none againſt
theſe Eminent Perſons (the very Glory
and Flowers of Chriſtianity) whoſe Piety
and Memory all the Churches upon Earth
meritoriouſly Celebrate. Who dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
you from the ſentence they have
paſſed againſt your folly? Conſult any
worthy Divine of your acquaintance in the
preſent Age, and ſee whether he do differ
in Judgment from theſe: If I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
theſe few, He will offer you <hi>ten</hi>
times as many to corroborate the ſtrength
of the Evidence. Do but put the queſtion
home with earneſt and hearty deſire to
be reſolv'd—whether ſuch a Guiſe or
Faſhion becomes the Gravity of a Chriſtian
woman, that really hopes to be ſaved, and
would glorify God in her life to that end?
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93989:36"/>
I have ſo much confidence in the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any true ſervant of Jeſus, that in this
he will faithfully diſcharge his duty to his
Maſter, and your Souls, and deliberately
tell you, that not this curſed cuſtom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but a great many more that abound
in your ſex, are perfectly inconſiſtent with
the very temper and Holineſs of thoſe
Laws and Religion from which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the means and hopes of a future
Happineſs. The truth is, their appears
ſo Univerſal a Degeneracy (in this Age)
from the ancient foundation of piety and
practiſe that Adorned and Gilded the
Generations of old: That if mighty Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
from the firſt Auſterity, be not
granted to our preſent weakneſs, there may
be but cold hopes for the beſt of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
And how far one may prudently
venture an Eternal Soul on the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that God will allow of thoſe Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we give our ſelves (which himſelf has
no where revealed his pleaſure to Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and his beſt Servants declare that
he never will), I muſt tell you, may
make you tremble to think on what ever
other profeſſion you make, which the
greater it is, the more honour ſhould
you give it by an evangelical humility and
ſelf-denying Spirit, <hi>Adorning the Doctrine
of God your Saviour in all things.</hi> And I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93989:36"/>
direct this eſpecially to the moſt retire
and ſolemn reflections of your rational
Soul to conſider of and apply: ſure I am,
we are ſo far from the complexion of

<hi>Faces,</hi> nor our <hi>Breaſts,</hi> nor our <hi>Hearts,</hi>

conformity, to the modeſty and ſimplicity
of thoſe that truſted in God in time of
old: if thoſe under the Law ſend out
their Cryes to you under the Goſpel to
be Civil and Holy, to be Meek and Chaſt;
and you can Eccho back again to them that
you are ſo, and profeſſors under both are
found clad but in the ſame Livory, this
will be your Glory indeed, and a Bleſſed
Uniformity. But ſhould you make the
Goſpel to Vary in its Faſhions, and to
be as inconſtant in its precepts, as you
are in your fidelity to them; this will
look but very ill, and the God who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

from the want of an <hi>Neck-Lace</hi> or an <hi>Eare-Ring?</hi>
Alas no, they had put off a <hi>God</hi>

               <p>But, Ladies, why is <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſet
out in the Goſpel (the moſt notorious
Example of ſin and Grace) but to let you
know, that her new <hi>Lover</hi> (who had ſet
into Joynt her broken Soul, and cag'd

Boſome) is as ready to Act miracles for
you too, and diſcover to you the Charms
of a Saviour, which a <hi>Legion</hi> of other <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi>
can never pretend to Court you
with. And though your <hi>Innocency</hi> ſuggeſt
that you ſtand in leſs need of his favour
than <hi>She,</hi> yet if Scriptures convince you
there are <hi>Adulteries</hi> of the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> which
you repeat every day, and others of the
<hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> which you tempt your

will want little leſs weight of <hi>Sope</hi> to waſh
away your Crimes with; and while they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93989:38"/>

very Heart Blood of a God to whiten
you into Snow.</p>
               <p>And ſo far as you reſt unconvinc'd of
their Danger, ſo long are you ſtill
unhumbled for their Guilt, and by
the ſame diſtance kept from the means
of a Recovery; ſo that while the groſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and eaſe, your <hi>Dead Fleſh</hi> (for want

hopes of life; when (God knows) the
ſtaring out of your Shoulder-bones, tell all
the World how near the poor Skelleton
haſtens into Duſt, and the Spirit within
it unto Judgment.</p>
               <p>Yet (ere you go) Contemplate on Her
who ſo pittied her ſelf, that <hi>Seven Devils</hi>
could not keep her from addreſſing
a Saviour, (and if you would cover your
Necks, you might be welcome too, for

death into your ſhameleſs hearts, whoſe

as would infinitely incenſe even the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Spirit of Jeſus, who yet was condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
enough to the meaneſt of your
ſex in the decorums of decency, and due
proſtration, of humility, and a mortified
ſence of their wants. And though the
poor <hi>Syrephaenician</hi> was a little roughly

with her the whole Loaf of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory tells us of Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh,
the Son of a <hi>Peaſant</hi> (and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

brought unto him, in a Rich and Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Habit, with hopes of being more
gratefully received, by the ſplendid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
ſhe made before him; he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away his Eyes, ſaid, He could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that Woman for his Mother:
but afterwards returning in her Ruſtick
Attire, he then acknowledged her, and
yeilded her all the Rights of a good
Son. And ſurely He, who rejecting all
the glittering Ladies of the Earth, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
the low Eſtate of a poor Hand-maid,</hi>
Conſecrating her Virgin Womb, (the
dreſſing-Houſe wherein he Swath'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up into Humanity) firſt into a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93989:39"/>
for His Honour, for <hi>Nine</hi> whole
Months together, and afterwards Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Her <hi>Breaſts that gave him Suck,</hi>
hath thereby proclaim'd to all the World
how far his Sacred Heart prefers the
Humble Cells of a pure and Virtuous
Mind, before all the Tapſteries of State,
and the painted Breaſts of the Flaunting
Gallants, who, (as Father <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays)
are rather the Lodges of Devils, than a
Saviour.</p>
               <p>Alas Ladies, His Holy Eyes have
been feaſted with the Glorious Proſpects
of Triumphing Virgins, Courting the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Torturing Flames, to uncloath them
into Spirit and Immortallity, wherein
they might enjoy their Deareſt Lord,
while himſelf has kindly deſcended into
the Fiery <hi>Chariot</hi> to them, to drive with
greater eaſe theſe welcome Gueſts into their
Eternal Palaces. While alas you are ſo
far from the Ambition of being <hi>Clothed
upon with that Houſe which is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
that you will not cloath your <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tabernacle into</hi> that Decency and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Form as might invite him to mark
it up for an Habitation of his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if you will not Sacrifice a Luſt
to the Glory of his Croſs, how would
you Sacrifice your Fleſh to it? And if
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93989:40"/>
you will not throw off a vain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Cuſtome by all the Holy Saints
in the world, how would you put on
the <hi>Pitch'd-Coat</hi> of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
clapt on the backs of the more faithful
Adorers of the Bleſſed Jeſus, to make
them burn the better in; That was <hi>[Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica
moleſta]</hi> the Troubleſome Coat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
unto them. When you cry out for
the liberty of your ſhoulders, becauſe it
makes for your eaſe, They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to double their Torments, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
not to be ſcalded as well by the <hi>pitch,</hi>
as the Flames?</p>
               <p>With trembling and horrour may you
remember the Great <hi>Redeemer</hi> hanging
Naked upon the Croſs, That very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
rendering his Death doubly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
and ſhameful to him, while the
rude Souldiers were unconcernedly ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in dividing his Garments
among them, and throwing Dice for his
ſeamleſs <hi>Veſture.</hi> And muſt you Ladies,
needs <hi>Crucifie him afreſh, and put him to
a ſecond ſhame?</hi> make him bluſh to ſee
your Nakedneſs, and ſeem as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for his as your own; his ſhame and
your own ſin, but alike affecting your
inſencible hearts. And if one end of
his being Crucified Naked, was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93989:40"/>
you to the Bleſſing of a decent
Dreſs, from which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
you, why will you fruſtrate that part
of the Redemption, and leave your ſelves
Naked in ſo great a part, ſince himſelf
has purchaſed Veſtures for you, when his
own was inhumanely rent from his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
               <p>The pittiful plea of <hi>Cuſtome</hi> for it,
will drop as <hi>Adams Figg-leaves</hi> did, when
his great Maker <hi>Summon'd</hi> him to give
Account wherefore he had made himſelf
Naked and Miſerable, ſince he had Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
him ſo perfect and happy. And
(ſure I am) thoſe who prefer a Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
(the ſhameful fruit of ſin) before
the bleſſing of a modeſt clothing, (the
purchaſe of a Saviours blood) will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tremble as <hi>Adam,</hi> as well for the ſhame
they chuſe to themſelves, as the deſpite
they do to the Saviour.</p>
               <p>And had you that <hi>Scarfe</hi> of <hi>Innocence,</hi>
which graced the Breaſts of your firſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the Fathers might have ſpared their
Zeal, and rather have envied your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
but becauſe ſhe has bared your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by her folly, and brought in the
curſe of Nakedneſs upon you, 'twould be
madneſs in you to hugg the curſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
that Nakedneſs ſtill, when you
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93989:41"/>
know how contented ſhe was, to hide her,
though but with a <hi>Beaſts-Skin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Ladies, ſhall I ſend you to the

Angel, has kept open ſhop for theſe <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Hundered</hi> years and more, and has
incomparably the beſt choice of every
thing you can ask for. And becauſe he
ſells the beſt peny-worths, Himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends
to call, <hi>What do yee lack, what
do yee buy;</hi> and adviſes you to <hi>buy</hi> of him.
Lord, Haſt thou any <hi>Mantoes</hi> for Ladies,
made after thine own Faſhion, which ſhall
cover all their Naked Shoulders, &amp; Breaſts,
and Necks, and adorn them all over?
Where are they? <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. Brings
them forth. There they are, Ladies, and
cheap too, at your own Price, and will
wear for ever; with this good property,
That they thoroughly prevent the <hi>Shame
of your Nakedneſs from appearing:</hi> And if you
ſtoutly paſs away, and take them not with
you (if there be a God in Heaven) you'l
paſs Naked into Hell to all Eternity.</p>

Who might have caſt us all into the ſame

Some Hiſtorians would fain have us owe

Imperfections, where none are apparent,

waſhed off the Paint from their faces,
with the very Blood of her 450 Chaplains,
and a little reſtored them to their right

black patches with her ſelf. Nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Scantling of God, the poor 7000 that
were a little more couragious then the
whole cringing Multitude, and who had
no Knees for <hi>Baal,</hi> were fain to daub
too, and made little appearance for God,
they mufled their Faith in the dark Clouds
of obſcurity, and paſſed their viſits to
Heaven with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> by night; While
they bore <hi>a fair ſhew</hi> to <hi>Jezebel</hi> all the

               <p>What was this but <hi>Painting</hi> too? And

though <hi>Ahab</hi> was fleet enough to run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Heels could do it, whoſe Feet tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out her miſerable Guts, and ſcorned

               <p>The advices of this Father are ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Faſhion, &amp; immodiſh in theſe days
of ours, that its become even ridiculous
and impudency to preſs them; and my
deſign of inſerting them, is rather for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of the ruins of the Primitive
Piety, then from any great hopes of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Imitation, or practice of them. While
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93989:52"/>
the ſhameleſs immodeſty of too many of
our Ladies, makes me more to venerate
the memory of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sole
Daughter and Heireſs of the great Duke
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who by a fall from her horſe
having broken her Thigh, choſe rather to
dye then to expoſe her ſelf to the inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Chirurgeons; yet what that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
did from an innate Principle of baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and perfect reſpect to the honour of
Feminine Modeſty, the ſame are ours
acting too from another of deſperate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy;
for though they have long ſince
fallen from all the Ideas of Vertue and
Goodneſs, (yea from the very pretences
to it) and by that ſlip have crack'd their
Honours, wounded their reputations, diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
their peace, disjoynted their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and endangered their Salvations,
yet are they ſo far from thoughts of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
again their broken Bones, ſearching
into the bottom of their Wounds, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lenitives to aſſwage the Tumours of
their bruiſed Conſciences, or Corraſives to
eat out the dead Fleſh that is about them,
That they deſperately take up reſolutions
of dying too; even theſe will be modeſt
forſooth, and keep their Gangrenes to
themſelves, bravely bear the burning of
their feſtring ſores, running up and down
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93989:52"/>
bleeding inwardly, even to death; but ſo
they can ſet a good face on the matter
plaiſter over the Orifice of the Wound,
and daub it with the Mortar of a gawdy
Swathe, and a few fine Clouts; this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
all their projects: Their Ambition is
no higher than the Hypocriſy of thoſe
who flaunted up and down with a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Profeſſion of a ſuperficial Goodneſs,
and appeared like <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> which when
open'd yield (of all other) the moſt nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous
ſtench. And for Painted Ladies to
yield nothing elſe but Mummye and Bones,
is very Melancholy to conſider.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, for amongſt ſome of
them, the fury of the diſtemper hath ſeized
on the very Brain, and utterly deprived
them of their Sences. You may hear
them raging as Madly as ever did frantick
in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and grown into a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs
of any pain or diſtraction upon
them, as God knoweth they feel no more
Ach, and fear no more danger, than thoſe
that have reached the impeceable Eſtate:
Nay will ſwear they be the beſt Saints in
World, and have done nothing but what
they dare anſwer to their Maker; they
rail againſt others more modeſt than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and <hi>Fanatacize</hi> the whole <hi>Church,</hi>
that in pity and kindneſs to their lanugiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Souls do but offer the benefit of the
Holy Offices to them, and would apply the
moſt probable remedies, whoſe vertue
might prevail to reſtore them to their
Wits. The good <hi>David</hi> once was put to
it to counterfeit a Madneſs for the ſaving

               </p>
               <p>Firſt with the Womans Hair we have
put on her Art (not of <hi>Cookery</hi> and the

The Ladies Point, drawn together
ſerves well for a <hi>Crevat,</hi> with a Grace
while the poor Collars (to make way for a

naked Neck too) that was uſed when we

and bid us look up to Heaven, like <hi>Severus</hi>

Knights) with no other deſign but to help
to wound the Hearts of the Ladies.</p>
               <p>2. And who ſees not the happy Victory,
that we have gotten <hi>their very-Hearts</hi> in
our Boſoms; as cloſe as their Hair on our
Heads: Not their Effeminacy only, but
Weakneſs too, and have perfectly ſhav'd
away all our Virility and Proweſs (which
formerly made Earthquakes in the world,
and the now-formidable <hi>France</hi> hath
trembled at) our Swords lye dangling
on our Thighs, with the ſame Luxury, as

Character, Jer. 51. 30. <hi>The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Thouſand ſuch <hi>Perſian Women,</hi> who with
another Army of Singers, Dancers, Perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Cooks, Butlers and Tart-bakers,
came to oppoſe him? Will thoſe Eyes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93989:55"/>
Dart fire in the face of an Enemy, that are
dazl'd in the Glitters of the Theater?
Will men hope to prevail while they puſh
with the brisſles of a Woman inſtead of a

from the Shoulders of his Souldiers,
which would hinder them from fighting,
ſince the Glory of his Nation depends on
their Valour?</p>

3. And thirdly with the womans Hair,
(we may leave out the R. and find) we
have gotten her Heat, and God who
hath given us over to ſhave away our own,
to put on her <hi>Glory,</hi> hath juſtly hardened
us to glory in the ſpoiles of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as in thoſe of her Head, while ſhe with
reaſon and vaunt enough triumphs in the
Ruines of our Strength. Is it a wonder to
find our ſelves bald and weak, while we are
ſlumbering in the lap of <hi>Dalilah?</hi> Alaſs
when her Curles are twiſted about our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heart, and twind themſelves there to
inſnare us, can we marvel if our Locks are
ſheer'd off in our ſleep, to make way for
the hanging of hers, when our folly puts
the Sciſſars in her hand, and we cannot wear
hers and our own. And I wiſh, that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
may abate our <hi>Heat,</hi> when the
Mercinary Hands are ſtill at work, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the price of our Bloods, to ſtrip off
our honour and ſtrength, and ſend us poor
Slaves to the <hi>Mill.</hi> Since we have found
the women ſo kind to ſell us the Hair from
their Heads, we have encroached on the
freeneſs of their Natures, and think they
may as well, make a prize of all the reſt.
And God knows the Age hath not found
them overſhie of trading. Hiſtory tells
us, that in the time of <hi>Septimus Severus</hi> his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93989:56"/>
time at <hi>Rome,</hi> there were threethouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted

that are guilty here, the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
need not care to change place with the
<hi>Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And 'tis no leſs obſervable, that ſince
we have worn theſe <hi>Coronets</hi> on our heads,
we have forgotten our Obedience to our
Prince, and thought our ſelves his very
<hi>Peers.</hi> You cannot imagine what fancies
it creates in our Nodles by its heat. At
Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> they hatch all their Chickens
in Ovens; on purpoſe heat to the degree
of production; but who ſees not ſince our
Brains have been fired by theſe Furzes what
Serpents the Cockatrices Eggs have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
While our Gallants flant along not a
ſtep without the graceful Attendants of the
tall Yeoman with their Halberts, guarding
each ſide of their Shoulders. What can they
think themſelves leſs then Kings? The
Grand Seigniour with all his golden <hi>Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi's</hi>
gliding mutely along by his ſide, can
never raviſh himſelf in the lofty conceipts
of his Glory to that Degree, that an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
skull'd <hi>Squire</hi> does now in the dancing
of his Aubrey Treſſes about, while he
looks out here &amp; there to feaſt his eyes on
the fancied Subjects that admire him. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi>

Influence the dangerous whiſpers of
theſe whiffling Flatterers into the addle
Brains of ſo many <hi>Hot-ſpurs,</hi> may have

Jer.</hi> 2. 31, 33. Nor is <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Story any
news to us.</p>
               <p>And who conſiders the vaſt contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are collected for this Uſurper

of thoſe loads that have almoſt

former Ages (however vain enough in

whoſe open ears never valued the
coldneſs of the Winds, but which would
glow to have heard the monſtrouſneſs of
their Childrens Ell-Wiggs. To look no

of ſmelling out the old <hi>Monaſteries</hi> again;
(and ſurely <hi>Chelſey Colledge</hi> vvas pretended
to be the Shop for that execution) this <hi>brave</hi>
Prince, follovved his great Father, and
gave his <hi>Ears</hi> to his Councel and <hi>Cut</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And 'tis impoſſible but the great
influence of ſo Illuſtrious Preſidents ſhould
prevail vvith the vvhole people to follovv
the Royal Example of ſo great a King, and
ſo good a Prince, in that Age.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs the ſame had continued
till this day, had not a violation happened
to that excellent cuſtom, if I miſtake not,
from this occaſion. The <hi>Puritans</hi> in the
Reign of the Royal Martyr, to diſtinguiſh
themſelves from their Neighbours, took on
them an extraordinary ſhort Cut, and their
Neighbours in oppoſition to them eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a long one, becauſe they would not be
reputed <hi>Round-heads;</hi> and in nothing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
were the two Parties ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd
as in their Hair, and happy had it
been that the quarrel had ended in the
Barbers Sciſſars, which we all know brake
out afterwards into the long Sword, and
inſtead of plucking each other by the ears
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93989:60"/>
a little, they fell to ſtabbing one another
in the Guts. So that the miſchiefs which
the Barber might have prevented at firſt,
had he kept an even hand on both parties,
and ſheered them both to an equal Cut, all
the wit of man could not prevent from
running into <hi>Commodus</hi> his bloody ſhaving,
and cutting off ears and Noſes together
with their Hair.</p>
               <p>But as once <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> upon the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Blazing-Star which was thought
to portend his death, would needs clap the
ſignification of it on the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, <hi>for
he</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath Buſhy Locks, but I am
Bald,</hi> jeering both him and himſelf toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though afterwards it fell on himſelf.
So I pray God both Parties may take
warning by what is paſt, and take heed of
mocking each other, leaſt falling out about
even Goats-Hair, and the ſmalleſt matters
at firſt, we break not forth into Flames
which are not ſo eaſily quenched.</p>
               <p>I cannot paſs away from this diſcourſe
of Hair, without minding the Ladies of the
beſt uſe that ever was made of Hair in the
World, And that by her too, who had
made the worſt uſe of it; The never to
be forgotten <hi>Magdalen,</hi> whoſe Golden
Locks had been the Fetters that had Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
ſo many hearts to her unlawful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93989:61"/>
Love, are afterwards weaved into a <hi>Towel</hi>
to wipe her Saviours Feet, whom ſhe had
firſt bedewed with her Tears; Not that
they had need of cleanſing by any tears
that ſhe poor Creature could ſhed, but
that both water and Towel might receive
a cleaneſs from them. And <hi>Mary</hi> by
that Act did but weep her ſelf into Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
—Let the Ladies that have Curled and
Powdred their Treſſes into Nets to catch
poor Lovers in, learn (with her) to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſen
them again unto the ſame ſervice, by
waſhing the Feet of his indigent members
on Earth, and wiping away their ſorrows
by the gentle ſtroakings of their Charity.</p>
               <p>And for others of them that build <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

Meekneſs ſhould be flatted, I wiſh they
would remember, how the great <hi>Nimrod</hi>

I fear theſe will be <hi>Speechleſs</hi> too, when the

               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:93989:62"/>

from ſome apprehenſions of Fatality accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch as too lightly have aſſumed the
Faſhions of others.</p>
               <p>3. How <hi>England</hi> hath been too juſtly
Taxed in all Ages of this Levity.</p>
               <p>To the firſt I need ſay but very little,
it being generally known how moſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
have been and ſtill are devout
and ſuperſtitious Adorers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Habit. So tender are they of their
Reputations, that they will not ſuffer under
the Aſperſion of being accounted giddy
and unconſtant by their Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The very <hi>Turks</hi> as well as the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
giving us an example of an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
devotion herein. And very Remarkable
is an old Decree of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> to this
purpoſe, That <hi>[tam in Cultu Numinis,
quam in Apparatu Corporis, Moribus Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busque
uti preſentibus, etiamſi Deteriores
ſint]</hi> They were reſolved as well in the
matter of their Religion, as in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Dreſs and Apparel, to ſtick
to the Laws and Cuſtoms then in force, yea
notwithſtanding perhaps there might be
found ſome defects in both. So loath were
they it ſeems to introduce any new Faſhion
or Invention that men of mutable and new-Fangled
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93989:62"/>
Spirits ſhould preſent unto them
Yet by the Favour of this <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Edict, it
cannot be denyed, that After-Ages have
found out thoſe abſurdities both in that
Religion and Dreſs of Antiquity, as have
well enough juſtified their modeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in the Regulations of both. Till
<hi>Popery</hi> give us a better Teſtimony of its
ſuitableneſs and proportion with the grand
<hi>Pattern</hi> received from the <hi>Mount,</hi> then of
late it hath, we cannot ſo eaſily be brought
to repent of our Departure from the
ſtrange and ridiculous extravagancies of
it. And it were enough ſhould I hang out
to view one of the Suits that was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worn heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> where you
had a Dublet all jagg'd and prickt, the
Waſtband coming down but a little below
the Armholes, guarded with eight long
Skirts; to this Dublet was claſped a pair
of Breeches cloſe made to the Body, and
whoſe length muſt make up the defect of
the ſhortneſs of the Dublet, The large and
ample Cod piſs ſupplied the want of Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
which came up with two wings faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to either ſide with two points, which
unknit made way to the Linnen Bags, tyed
to the inſide between the Shirt and Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſs,
theſe Bags held every thing they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about them, except the Gloves, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93989:63"/>
ever hung very reverently at the Girdle.
Where hung a Pouch made faſt with a
Ring or Lock of Iron, weighing at leaſt
two or three Pound, whether there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
money in it or no. The like I could give
of the womens Gowns, and ſhew the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Fardingale, and other whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
—But the Galleries and Parlours of
moſt old Families are ſet out with ſuch
diſguiſing Poſtures, as better will evidence
them to the view of the Reader, then I
care my Pen ſhould do at this time. What
different Cuts have we our ſelves known
from this diſcribed? What huge Breeches,
like Petticoats? What Slaſh'd Dublets?
What guarded Breeches with ſuch huge
ſets of Points round the Knees, that were
invented to hide the <hi>French-pox,</hi> by force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to ſtraddle above a yard wide.
Theſe and many others are in freſh memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but putting them all aſide, how more
exceedingly decent and graceful is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Cut of our Gentlemen, anſwering all
the parts and members of the Body to a
more Civil and proportionable end. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
however be excepted the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tunick and Veſt, ſo very comely in it
ſelf, ſo very advantageous to the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Kingdom, perhaps the moſt
grave and manlike Dreſs that ever <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93989:63"/>
ſaw, which had the unhappineſs to
be brought in too late, and the hard Fate
to be ſent out again too ſoon. And
would have anſwered all the expectations
of publick Commodity pretended by the
Woolen Act, ſo that had our Gentlemen
pleas'd to have danc'd in them any longer,
the Farmers would very cheerfully have
paid the Fidlers. But we can never hold

               <p>I mind therefore in the next place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to the Reader the dangers of ſo
great a Levity. Neither is Scripture ſilent
in its menaces againſt ſo prodigious a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
We know who hath threatned ſuch as
Cloath themſelves <hi>in ſtrange Apparel.</hi> But
becauſe examples are more prevalent to
work upon us, I have endeavoured to
look into Hiſtory, which hath furniſhed
me with three or four not unworthy of
the Readers moſt ſerious peruſal and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> then King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
what time this humour infected his
Subjects of attiring themſelves after the
<hi>Caſtillian</hi> Faſhion, all the Noble Perſons and
Gentlemen practiſing nothing more than
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93989:64"/>
to ſpeak the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Language (which it
ſeems is very elegant and expreſſive) with
the ſame ambition as we do the <hi>French,</hi>
between whom and them there was no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
natural kindneſs neither, but a very
bitter Antipathy, <hi>hating</hi> the perſons whoſe
Language they lov'd. It pleas'd God that
<hi>Sebaſtian</hi> dying without iſſue, and the
Crown lying at Stake as the Golden Ball
for every Pretender to venture at, who
but King <hi>Philip of Caſtile,</hi> run faireſt for
it, and with an eaſy ſtretch got it ſet on
his head, to the general ſorrow, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
redreſs of the diſcontented ſubjects.
To whom afterwards he proved no very
Favourable Prince.</p>
               <p>In the year of Chriſt four hundred and
twenty, the <hi>Grecians</hi> whoſe habitations
bordered upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> took fancy to
cloath themſelves after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
they which before were wont to wear
Long Beards, which ſo very well became
them (quoth my Author) Cut off all, and
left the <hi>Muſtachioes</hi> onely, and practic'd to
follow them in all their actions, till anon
comes an Army of <hi>Muſtachioes</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
them to a perfect Slavery to this
day.</p>
               <p>Although we know their Ruine was
both Propheſied and certainly determined
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93989:64"/>
as the dreadful puniſhment for Crucifying
the Lord of Life; Yet I find too, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> (for about thirty years before the
final deſtruction of their City and Temple
by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian)</hi> had gotten a cuſtom
to impoſe no other names upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
but ſuch as were <hi>Roman,</hi> nor would
wear any Garments but after the <hi>Roman</hi>
Guiſe; their very Arms for War, and
Souldiers Caſſocks, were in all reſpect like
theirs, ſtriving to imitate their Faſhion
and Garb very intirely, whom ſo ſuddenly
after they ſo dearly ſuffered under.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries hath an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
to this very purpoſe, That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi>
and <hi>Animoſities</hi> riſing up among the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> they began to hate each other to
that degree, That one Party among them
ſeparated from the other, by the viſible
diſtinction of their Dreſs, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſome to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faſhion, ſome
to the <hi>Almaine,</hi> and left the uſe of their
own ſhort habits and cloſe Breeches. Which
was but as it were, a prediction of the
Calamity that ſoon after fell upon them
from the <hi>Arms of</hi> thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> whom
they had ſo apiſhly followed.</p>
               <p>But remarkable is the Story of the Great
<hi>Darius,</hi> whom ſeveral Authors affirm to
us, to have changed the very Faſhion of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93989:65"/>
his Sword from the Ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> into
the <hi>Macedenian</hi> Faſhion, but the very year
before <hi>Alexander</hi> invaded and ruined
him; Which his Diviners interpreted tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
into what afterwards came to paſs,
<hi>That thoſe ſhould come to be Lords of Perſia,
into whoſe Faſhion Darius had altered his
Sword.</hi> What application ſhall I make of
all theſe Stories to poor <hi>England?</hi> If not
onely our mens Swords, and Caſſocks, and
Perriwiggs, and Boots, and Breeches;
But our very Ladies Mantoes, Petticoats,
Points, Shoes, Hoods and Laces, be not
of the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion onely, but the very
Productions of the Countrey; if no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
handſome young men can be picked
from the Sons of our Yeomen and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Gentry, to make <hi>Val de Chambres</hi> to
our Gallants; if no hand but a <hi>French</hi> one
can ſerve to Trim and ſhave our Beards?
No Cut but a <hi>French</hi> Taylors to ſhape our
Cloaths; No Languge but the <hi>French</hi> to
ſerve our Tongues; no Religion but the
<hi>French</hi> to content our Souls; I pray you
what will be the end hereof? There is a
diſeaſe among us called of that Name too,
I pray God it be not too Epidemical; if
it be not gotten into our Bodies, ſure I am
'tis gotten into our Heads, while we ſet our
ſelve to ſtudy and contrive nothing more
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93989:65"/>
than to pleaſe our Fancies with the Levities of the
<hi>French.</hi> And how little did he merit the happineſs
of our good Cloth and Beef, of our good Laws and
Religion, of our Native Immunities and happy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
who declared he had rather be ſerv'd by a
<hi>French</hi> Dog than by an <hi>Engliſh-man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What care and prudence hath been uſed formerly
by other Nations for the prevention of publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
from the extravagancies, and vain exceſs of
Apparel, I have already inſtanc'd from the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and others, from the City of <hi>Venice &amp;c.</hi> To
which I will onely here adjoyn a Memoire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the
Law <hi>Sumptuaria</hi> which <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which prov'd ſo exceedingly advantageous
to the proſperity of the then <hi>Roman</hi> State, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t in
exequiis Epuliſque, &amp;c.</hi> It was provided by that
Law, that all their profuſe expence in Funerals, and
all exceſſive uſe of fine Cloths at their publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Shows ſhould be utterly laid aſide; by due
obedience and execution of which they quickly
came to find the preſent Commodity and benefit
by extirpating thoſe two voracious Gulphes that
ſwallow up the proſperity of any Kingdom that is
in the World, delicacy of fare and ſumptuouſneſs
of Attire. And to ſhew you what inconveniences
this eſpecially of ſumptuouſneſs of Apparel, hath at
all times brought to poor <hi>England, I</hi> ſhall go back
to Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, and give you a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Survey of it, drawn by a Gentleman of good
Quality and Underſtanding. Repreſenting it to
King <hi>James</hi> in his Book dedicated to him, (ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Language of that Age) wherein he thus
paſſionately deplored it to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Engliſh</hi>-men more then any Nation of the
World hath been ſhamefully branded among For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93989:66"/>
for their diſguiſed Faſhions, and ſumptuous
Habiliments beyond the bounds of Prudence, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and Hability. Some women after a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
Faſhion attired like men in Dublets, and
ſome men like women in Petticoats, this exceſs hath
ſo exceedingly diſperſed it ſelf in our Nation, that by
their exteriour new-fangled Robes the wiſeſt of our
Adverſaries in Forreign Parts have paſt their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our giddy minds, and unconſtant behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
inwardly ſaying, That in wearing <hi>Dutch</hi>
Hats, with <hi>French</hi> Feathers, <hi>French</hi> Dublets, with
Collers after the cuſtom of <hi>Spain, Turkiſh</hi> Coats,
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hoſe, <hi>Italian</hi> Cloaks, and <hi>Valentian</hi> Rapers,
with ſuch like; we had likewiſe ſtollen the vices
and exceſſes of thoſe Countries which we did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Natural. Beſides what a ſhame was it for us
to be noted for this exorbitant exceſs, that baſe
Tailors, and others which work as Hirelings, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
to that abominable and indecent ſingularity,
ſhould equal themſelves in the coſt and Faſhion
of their attire with ſome of the greateſt Barons of
this Land. <hi>A</hi> Fault not to be imputed to the
Laws, (for thoſe are preciſe and ſtrict in ſuch
comely conſiderations, but in the diſſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
affections of people, which inſtead of a
little Liberty, make a Licence at large, Tyrannizing
upon the Princes gentle diſpoſition and Lenity. <hi>Hence</hi>
it was that the Nobility to diſtinguiſh themſelves
by this outward aport of their Degrees and Riches
from the Raſcal Rabble and baſe Ruffians, were
driven to moſt extream charge, that they might
make a difference of themſelves from them, equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in proportion. Which courſe if the Queen
her ſelf had kept, anſwerable to her State above
ſome Ladies and others in the like analogy, ſhe might
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93989:66"/>
with eaſe have conſumed an unſpeakable Maſs of
Treaſure <hi>(Yet Reader, 'tis known that Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
did not ſpare for Coſt in her Clothes)</hi> By this
means the Eſtates and Subſtance of Taylors,
Craftsmen, and other Mechanicks, was daily more
encreaſed, and the Fortunes of our Gentry ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
exhauſted. VVhich Leproſy did in a little ſo
ſpread it ſelf in this Nation, that divers Livings of
very ancient <hi>Demeſne</hi> and Inheritance, which had
continued in ſucceſſion from many Grand Fathers of
one Race did hang up in Taylors Shops, and were
piled up in the Merchants Coffers. This Emulation
of exceſs having further prevailed, grew to ſuch
outrage, that when proper maintenance fayled in
ſome to ſupport ſuch <hi>Riot,</hi> they violently or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
took from others, turning open <hi>Robbers,</hi> or
ſecret <hi>Pilpherers</hi> to ſupply the ſame. VVhich
hath been the demolition and confuſion of many

               <p>Is there any Nation this day upon the face of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93989:67"/>
Earth comparable to us in this Abominable Sin of
Pride? <hi>(Mr. Teins Leproſy of Pride.)</hi> Our Exceſs in
Apparrel, will ſay no, wherein both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of all Eſtates, and degrees from the higheſt to
the loweſt, from the Courtier to the Carter do mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly
Offend. Servants are in their Apparel more
coſtly then their Maſters and Dames, Yeomen and
Yeomens Sons are herein equal to Gentlemen of
good Worſhip, Poor and mean Gentlemen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with Lords, Lords with Kings, and Ladies
with Queens. What will become hereof at the
laſt? What is now become of that Moderation in
Apparrel that formerly hath been in this Land?
When every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one went habited according to their
Orders and Degrees, whereas now Gold, Silver,
Velvet, Sattin, Fine Cambrick, and ſuch other coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things are worn by very mean Perſons, againſt
the Laws of God and man, againſt all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and contrary to all good Examples of our
Fore-Fathers; which things rather belong to Kings
and Princes, and to Peers of the Land, then to mean
Subjects. As Men and Women exceed in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Apparrel, ſo alſo in the form they daily
ſhew forth their Abominable Pride in their Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
for no Colour, Form, nor Faſhion long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth
them, One while we Imitate the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
another while the <hi>French,</hi> one while the <hi>Italian,</hi>
another while the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Every Nation is a ſeveral
Pattern for us.—Let theſe proud Peacocks but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to what end Apparel was appointed by
God at the firſt, verily for a covering to hide our
ſhame. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing a proud young fellow ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and priding himſelf in his fine Clothes, <hi>Sir,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>remember that the Sheep hath had your
Coat on his back before you.</hi> What Vanity is it for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93989:67"/>
us to be ſo curious in our Apparel, to take ſuch
Pride herein as we do, we rob and ſpoil all Creatures
almoſt of the world to cover our backs and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
our bodies withal; from ſome we take their
wool, from many their Skins, from diverſe their Furrs,
from ſundry their very Excrements, as the ſilk
which is nothing elſe, but the very Excrement of
the worm; not content with this, we come to Fiſhes,
and do beg from them their Pearles to hang about
us, we go down into the ground for Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and turn up the very Sands for Precious ſtones.
And having borrowed all this of other Creatures, we
jett up and down, provoking men to look upon us,
as if all this were now our own, when the ſtone
ſhineth upon our Finger, we fancy our ſelves to
ſhine with it, when the Silver and Silks do gliſter
on our very backs, we look big, as if all that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
came from us. It is reported of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
that when he ſaw a woman Apparrelling her ſelf in
Proud Attire with Gorgeous Array, he fell a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and being demanded why, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>all
this Preparation is for her own Deſtruction.</hi> But
our nice and Mincing Dames in <hi>England</hi> whoſe
whole Life is ſpent for the moſt part, in Study and
Care to Deck, Paint, and Beautify themſelves,
will hardly be perſwaded by that holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
that they beſtow all this coſt upon themſelves to
their own Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Becauſe theſe ſeem to be more private and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
I will yet add another, which you muſt look
on as a Singular Witneſs for God againſt the Pride
and Vanity of that Age. The moſt famous <hi>Edwin
Sands,</hi> who dyed Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and who was
ſo Faithful to the Intereſt of Religion, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>
tells you.</p>
               <p>I do not Condemn all Apparrel that is Rich and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93989:68"/>
Stately, yea ſuch as is Coſtly and Gorgeous may be fit

<hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Judeth</hi> did wear Gold, and were Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
Deckt, but if <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did live in our
days, they would not ſpare the Vanity of our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
much leſs of our men. The vain and Monſtrous
Apparrel of all other Countries and Nations, <hi>England</hi>
hath ſcraped together, and in a Bravery put it on,
the Eſtimation whereof is little, a light wavering
mind matched with a vain proud Heart, deſireth a
light, vain, ſtrange, proud, and monſtrous Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to cover and clad it, but Sobriety is content with

ſo may we not paſs over other matters, which need
redreſs Gorgeous Apparel; and ſumptuous Diet may
ſeem ſmall things, but they are the cauſes of no
ſmall evil. They eat up <hi>England,</hi> and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be repreſſed by ſtrait Laws—<hi>And elſewhere

pathetically, and it is worth your noting.</hi>

Sink of Sin) were</hi> Idleneſs, fullneſs of Bread, Pride
and unmercifulneſs to the poor. Are not theſe the
Sins of this Land, of this City, of this Court, at this
day? Half <hi>England</hi> liveth idly or worſe occupied,
we be fed to the full, and who is not puffed up
with Pride? And who relieveth his Neighbours
wants? No man is contented with his own Eſtate, but
every one ſtriveth to climb higher and to ſit aloft,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93989:68"/>
there is want of the true fear of God in all ſorts
and Eſtates and Ages, yet we pleaſe our ſelves and
walk on, as if God either ſaw not our Sin, or elſe
would not puniſh it! Surely our Sins will not ſuffer
his Plagues to ſtay long from us. What Plagues, I
dare not preſume to Propheſie, for God hath kept
that ſecret to himſelf. But I ſtand in fear that we
are the men to whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom of
God ſhall be taken from you.</hi> That we are they
whoſe Sins will bring the Scepter of this Kingdom
into the hands of an Hypocrite, [Know Reader, that
this was when the Papiſts expected ſo highly the
Return of their Religion at the Death of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
And that made the heart of this good man
ſo bleed in that conſideration; he goeth on] If

wretched men! The Loſs of the Goſpel is the Loſs
of our Souls, and the Loſs of our Soveraign, the Loſs
of our Lives. Truly when I fall into conſideration
of the wickedneſs of this world, that all ſorts of men
fall to ſinning with greedineſs, that in all conditions
Iniquity doth abound and Charity wax cold, that
the Zeal of God is utterly dried up in the Hearts
of Men, that God is ſerved for Faſhion ſake, and
not in truth, what ſhould I think but that God hath
gathered his Lap full of Plagues, and is ready to
pour them down upon us?</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee how God hath ſtirred up his
Faithful Prophets to drop down their teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this poor Sinful Land for the Pride and
prophaneſs thereof in that <hi>Age.</hi> Let us come down
to King <hi>James</hi> his time, and ſee whether the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be any whit amended, and one might juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it, becauſe they lay under the obligations of a
new mercy, in diſappointing the expectations of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93989:69"/>
Enemies of the Goſpel, by the coming in of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Prince, who ſo zealouſly by his Learned
Pen contended for the Truth. But we ſhall find
this Vanity ſtill triumphing in its full vaunt and
Glory; and I ſhall not diſparage ſo holy a Witneſs
as Biſhop <hi>Sands,</hi> by ſubjoyning a mean or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Perſon to him, but will call forth the ſweet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
and excellent Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> to give us his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt the Pride of that <hi>Age</hi> wherein he Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and beſides others (which I omit) I will ſhew
to what height the Women were grown at that time,
from a Sermon of his Preached at the <hi>Spittle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O God to what a world of Vanity haſt thou ſerved
us to? I am aſhamed to think that the Goſpel of Chriſt
ſhould be diſguiſed with ſuch diſguiſed Clients; are
they Chriſtians or Anticks in ſome Carnaval, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Puppets that are thus dreſſed? Pardon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, Men, Brethren and Fathers, this my juſt
and holy impatience. VVho can without indignation
look upon the prodegies, which this miſ-imagination
produces in that other Sex, to the ſhame of their
Husbands and ſcorn of Religion, and damnation of
their own Souls? Imagine one of our Forefathers
were alive again, and ſhould ſee one of thoſe his
Gay Daughters walk in <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi> before him, what
do you think he would think it were? Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be ſeen but a Vardingale, a yellow Ruff,
and a Perriwigg, with perhaps ſome Feathers wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the top; three things for which he could not
tell how to find a Name: Sure he could not but
ſtand amazed to think what new Creature the times
had yeilded ſince he lived; and then if he ſhould
run before her, to ſee if by the foreſight, he might
gueſs what it were, when his eyes ſhould meet
with a powdred Frizzle, a painted Hide ſhadowed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93989:69"/>
with a Fan not more painted, Breaſts diſplayed,
and a looſe Lock ſwing wantonly over her Shoulders
betwixt a painted Cloth and Skin, how would he
more bleſs himſelf to think what mixture in Nature
could be guilty of ſuch a Monſter. Is this the
Fleſh and Blood (thinks he) is this the hair? Is this
the ſhape of a VVoman? Or hath Nature repented
of her work ſince my days, and begun a new
Frame? It is no marvel if their Forefathers could
not know them; God himſelf that made them, will
never acknowledg that he never made, the Hair
that he never made theirs, the Body that is aſhamed
of the Maker, the Soul that thus diſguiſes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Let me ſay therefore to theſe Dames, as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
ſaid to <hi>Totilaes</hi> Servant—<hi>Lay down that you wear,
it is none of your own:</hi> All the world knows that no

Nature, mars it. But if our perſwaſions cannot

               <p>See Reader what a Faithful Witneſs this holy

               <p>To this famous Witneſs for God, Let us adjoin

Honour and Beauty. But why do I ſpend my time
in ſo impertinent an Exhortation? Faſhion brought
them in, and Faſhion muſt bear them out. I would
to God our Preaching were in Faſhion too, for then
we ſhould win both men and women, we uſe all
the Faſhions therein that our Commiſſion can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, we preach in Seaſon and out of Seaſon;
we bring forth old and new, and yet without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
Faſhion brought in Silks and Velvets at one

at another; Faſhion brought in deep Ruffs, and
ſhallow Ruffs, Thick Ruffs, and Thin Ruffs, Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ruffs, and no Ruffs; Faſhion brought in the
Vardingale, and carried out the Vardingale, and
hath again revived the Vardingale from Death, and
placed it behind, like a Rudder or Stern to the
body, in ſome ſo big, that the Veſſel is ſcarce able to
bear it. When God ſhall come to Judge the

have ſo defaced that Faſhion which he hath Erected.—What
