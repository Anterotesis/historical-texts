            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

into their considerations how many shippes haue beene swallowed in the waues, as what some few haue gotten by the voyage: So it is with vs, we seldome meditate of the Millions dead before vs, but of the small Remainder suruiuing with vs. They report that the birds of <hi>Norway</hi> flye faster then the fowles of any other Countrey, not because nature hath giuen more nimblenesse or agility to their wings, but by an instinct they know the dayes in that Climate to bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short, not aboue three houres long, and therefore they make more haste vnto their nests: Strange that birds should make such vse of their obseruation, and wee practically knowing the shortnesse of our liues, yet make no haste to our home, <hi>the house appointed for all liuing:</hi> This <note place="margin">Iob 30. 23.</note> God complaineth of: <hi>The Storke knoweth</hi>

Our eyes behold all things, yet see they not themselues but by reflection in a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glasse. Here are two looking glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; one vpon the Hearse, informing vs that neither Wisedome, nor Honour, nor Wealth, nor Strength, nor Friends, nor Physicke, nor Prayers, are sufficient Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to shelter vs from the stroke of death. Here is another looking glasse in the Text, expressing the miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our liues. If all the inuentions of Hierogliphicall learning (which St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>

If all of them had strained their wits for an Embleme, to decipher the wretched estate of a liuing man, they could not come neere the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in the Text.

               <hi>It is now enough, O Lord, take away my soule, for I am no better then my Fathers,</hi> and you haue life portrayed to life. <hi>Elias</hi> was the first man, vnto whom God resigned his key of life, and gaue him power to raise the dead. <hi>Elias</hi> was the sole man, whom God honoured with a Charriot for his conueiance into the other world. <hi>Elias</hi> was the second man elected to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent heauenly glory vpon earth, at the transfiguration of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and this man whilst hee was in this life, was weary of his life, and puts vp a Supplication to almighty God to take it from him.</p>
            <p>The words containe a Prayer; Good is the proper obiect of prayer, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate euill, but pray onely for that which is good. This prayer is for death, which in it selfe is neither good nor euill. That we may the better conceiue the true scope, it is fit that wee should take into our considerations these three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

            <p>A question will be asked in the Porch &amp; entrance, is <hi>Elias</hi> in earnest? would he liue or dye? If he would liue, why doth he beg death? If dye, why did he shun death by flying into the wilder nesse? One Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner from <hi>Jesabell</hi> would haue giuen him his longing. The satisfaction is easy: It is some comfort when a man is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that hee bee conquered by a noble enemy <hi>Aeneae magni dextra cadis—Dauid</hi> was vnwilling to dye by the fury and malice of <hi>Saul,</hi> contented to receiue it by the hands of his friend <hi>Jonathan.

but from the hand of God a <hi>Caduceus</hi> a wand to waft him into a better life: The hands of the spouse are fall of Rings beset with Iemmes, the <hi>Berill,</hi> and the <hi>Hyacinth:</hi> God his hands are full of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 14.</note> full of all goodnesse, death it selfe which seemes to bee a priuation of God, from his hand, must needs be good from whom no euill can descend. This may qualify his eschuing death by <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> but being past danger, and out of his Persecutors reach, what were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to desire it now? <hi>Jt is now enough.</hi> The Expositors do vary, finding not only seueral but contrary motiues: some make it the euaporation of a discontented minde, the weaknesse of a frayle man: others attribute it to the deuotion of an holy man, I will strike these seuerall flints, each of them may afford a sparke to enlighten our text.</p>

no profession of holynesse exempt men from common infirmities: where is that Heretike <hi>Pelagius</hi> belching out this contagious poyson, that a man may attayne such perfection as to bee free from all weaknesse, and when hee prayes for forgiuenesse of sinne, it is rather <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> then <hi>veraciter?</hi> Let him looke vpon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> and bee confounded. As the Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan <hi>Lais</hi> sayd, Philosophers knockt at her gate as well as others: so the best of men are ouertaken: To goe no further then our patterne. The seer is fallen blinde, the guide hath lost his way, the charmer is stung by the serpent, the man of God becomes a man of passion, fayling in the common Rules of ordinary goodnesse and wisdome, for good and wise men may pray for better times then those they liue in; but beare with patience all sinister and sad euents; whereas our great Prophet whines and repines, denoyd of hope that any alteration should better his condition, &amp; because the would will

not be guided by the Polestarre of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, hee will stay no longer in it: Oh lett the weakenesse of a Saint be our warning; greene wood will warpe and shrinke, if seasoned tymber hold not out, and slender tressells must giue way when strong pillers bend vnder the burden: Especially it behooueth vs, which is the next poynt of instruction, neuer to bee so deiected at the view of our fraylety as to forbeare our resorting to God in prayer. <hi>St. Iames</hi> to encourage Christians to that holy duty brings in this very example, <hi>Elias was a man subiect to the like passions as wee are: Elias</hi> body was a clod of earth as ours is, his minde obnoxious to the same perturbations, yet he prayed, so let vs: for God is not the God of <hi>Elias</hi> onely, but a God rich in mercy to all that call vpon him. So I passe to the second motiue as the prayer proceedes from a Zealous deuotion.</p>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> seemes to taxe <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; he doth it with a <hi>Notandum,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:20725:9"/>
               <hi>ye not what the Scripture saith of Elias, that he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 2.</note> 
               <hi>made intercession to God agaynst Israel?</hi> Good men pray for sinners not agaynst them: <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for the wicked <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and doth <hi>Elias</hi> pray against the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Jsraelits? Ieremy</hi> prayed assiduously for his nation till hee was forbidden to pray any more; and did <hi>Elias</hi> pray for the vexation of his country? The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Parable entreateth his Master to spare the vnfruitefull tree, doth <hi>Elias</hi> wish the destruction of men? vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy men haue mercifull not cruell bowells, when they call for punishments, they are medicines, not execrations, but predictions either by outward afflictions to procure their conuersion, or by death to intercept the progresse of sin, or by some wholsome example to terrifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like offence.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Elias</hi> did, and so he might pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Jsrael.</hi> And it is no maruell he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agaynst them, for he bends his Zeale agaynst himselfe: rather then he would liue to see his God dishonoured, hee is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20725:10"/>
willing to resigne his pretious life: This should bee the affection of all Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to hold nothing so deare as the honour of theyr Master. Let me parallell this story with another like it, of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome. Elias</hi> was persecuted by <hi>Iezabell</hi> a Queene, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> by <hi>Eudoxia</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <note place="margin">Chrysostomi Epist. ad Ciri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum.</note> both threatened with death: The holy Father taking it into his meditations writing to his friend, thus hee Resolues, What if the angry Empresse banish mee my natiue soile and sweete country? all the earth is the Lords, and I shall be as neare to heauen any where, as at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi> what if I bee throwne into the sea? <hi>Ionah</hi> prayed in the whales belly: say I shal bee sawne asunder, the noble Prophett <hi>Esay</hi> vnderwent that condition. What if my head bee taken from my shoulders? <hi>Herodias</hi> heeles trip't off <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head: what if I bee stoned to death? <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-martyr passed to heauen through a showre of stones: Suppose my Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke be taken away, I will remember
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20725:10"/>
               <hi>Job: Naked came I out of my Mothers wombe, and naked I will returne.</hi> Memorable is that in <hi>Josephus,</hi> when <hi>Titus</hi> had taken and <note place="margin">Iosephus lib. 6. de bello Iudaie.</note> sackt <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Priests came &amp; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their liues of him: that mercifull Prince and Darling of mankind caused them to bee slayne as degenerate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that would ouerliue their Temple and their Religion; hee is not worthy of life who will not aduenture it for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of life.</p>
            <p>To conclude this second motiue, lett vs alwayes haue that preparation of mind in the phrase of <hi>Tertullian</hi> to retaliate bloud <note place="margin">Crurorem cruore reponere.</note> with bloud: our Sauiour in great plenty shed his most precious bloud for vs, bee wee ready to spend our liues for him, and with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to ieopard them for his Gospell: although our liues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his are but stubble to Pearle; yet being the greatest oblation wee can offer, it will bee most acceptable, most reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: The losse of life for his cause is the sauing of it. <hi>Elias</hi> sute for death was neuer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20725:11"/>
granted, he neuer died at all, but was conueyed not into Earthly Paradise, the Deluge made that pleasure desolation; nor stayed he in the Aeriall Heauens, too vnquiet and disconsolate a place amongst Stormes and Thunders, Lightnings and Tempests. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saies, it affrighted the Prince of the Ayre to see him ride so gloriously through his quartér. Nor did he rest among the Spheres to be rapt and whirled about by their diurnall motion; not to the highest heauens, that Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue was reserued for the Worlds Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: no Souldier triumphs before his Generall, but God translated his enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Zelot</hi> and earthly <hi>Seraphin,</hi> into a happy and blessed estate, in the bosome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with this Priuiledge, others were there before in soule; hee both in soule and body.</p>
            <p>Now proceede wee from the Motiues forerunning the Prayer, to the Reasons attending vpon it.</p>
            <p>You haue heard of some, as of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:20725:11"/>
eloquently pleading without any Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to saue his life, before <hi>Felix, Fesius,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and by an Appeale taking truce with death: But here is one in the Text pleading for death, and finding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why he should liue no longer. His Arguments are in number two.</p>
            <p>The first is drawne from the satiety of life: <hi>It is now enough,</hi> as if hee should say thus in effect:</p>
            <p>I haue liued long <hi>enough</hi> to my selfe, long <hi>enough</hi> to my Countrey. First, to my selfe, it pleased thy diuine goodnesse, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mee an instrument of thy glory to aduance my owne, so as I shall leaue an high reputation and a venerable name to all posterity: and for my Countrey, such thy mercy, by my meanes they enioyed much good; spirituall good, I reclaimed them, (although they bee now relapsed) from Idolatry to the Seruice of thee their true and onely God: I was the Reformer of their corrupted manners; my rugged Robes and hairy Habit condemned their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20725:12"/>
proud attyre; my austere and strict life, taught them to amend their loose and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious conuersations: As a retyred Heremite I sequestred my selfe from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane society, to let them see 'twas lesse dangerous to dwell among brutes then beastiall men. And for good temporall, I turned their drought into Raine, and their famine into Plenty, hauing in my whole course equalled, nay, transcended the period of Mortality, <hi>It is now enough O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His second Argument is drawne from the common law of nature: <hi>I am no better then my Fathers,</hi> my Ancesters in time, my Predecessors in profession are all arriued at their wished Port; why shouldst thou prolong my dayes by miracle, sometimes appointing the Rauens (those vncleane birds by thy law) and vnnaturall in their kinde, to be my Caters, as at the brooke <hi>Carith?</hi> Sometimes by multiplication of the old store, or by creation of new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, turne meale barrels into Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20725:12"/>
and cruets of oyle into Fountaines, as at the Widdowes of <hi>Sareptah.</hi> I desire not the producing of my misery, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of my life by extraordinary wayes, let me passe O Lord the common way of all my Fathers, <hi>For J am no better then my Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obserue in <hi>Elias</hi> Arguments, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and modesty, how orderly hee rankes his Reasons: There goes a <hi>sufficit</hi> before <hi>tolle animam:</hi> Hee doth not aske death of God vntill hee hath performed great seruice vnto the Lord in his life; for it is a preposterous course to demand wages before the worke bee done: Rest comes after labour, no Souldier lookes for a donatiue vntill the warre bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past; no Marriner cals for a faire winde vntill his vessell bee full fraught: It is no matter how long or how short our liues be, but how good. The Morall man saw this; Life is long enough if full of good: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austins</hi> similitude expresseth this well, <note place="margin">Augustin. Epist 28.</note> As a Musitian tarrying long vpon one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20725:13"/>
string, little vpon another, his lightest touch makes not perhappes so loude a sound, but as sweet an harmony: So in God his Consort, (who, as the Prophet speakes, keepes true time,) they make as good musicke, that is, glorifie God in their calling, vnto whom he vouchsafeth a short life, it being both <hi>ornatus &amp; ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus cursus,</hi> as they who enioy the longest.</p>
            <p>The Sunne and Moone those Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of light, and guides of time, fulfill their courses in a short season. The dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Plannets are a longer while whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about. The Scripture compares our life to Hearbes and Flowers, A Flower is <hi>Res</hi>

Delighting our eyes with various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, pleasing our sense with sweete sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, but withall of a fading substance: Say they escape the browsing mouth of the beast, the pruning knife, the plucking hand, the nipping ayre, the violent winde; they will wither of themselues.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20725:13"/>
Of such mettall are wee made: Imagine wee could be free from <hi>Asaes</hi> Gowt, <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Leprosie, <hi>Jorams Iliaca passio, Jobs</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauory breath, <hi>Hezekiabs</hi> botch, <hi>Lazarus</hi> biles, the woman of <hi>Syrophenissa's</hi> dysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>Publius</hi> Feuer, and all diseases whereof the body of man is a <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> and Receptacle; <hi>Galen</hi> found in one little part of the eye an hundred seuerall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: could all these be auoyded, yet our bodies of their owne accord would moulder into earth from whence they came. Since they are Flowers, vse wee them like Flowers, which last long if they bee distilled into sweete waters: distill wee our liues into holy and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions; distill them into the works of Piety; distill them into the workes of Charity, this is the way to make a short life last long; no <hi>Babylonian</hi> Tower, no <hi>Aegyptian Pyramis,</hi> no <hi>Rhodian Colossus,</hi> no <hi>Mausolian</hi> Tombe, no Triumphall Arche, no life-counterfeiting Statua, can giue such life of memory, as a life it selfe

transacted in worthy designes, for, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (sayes the Wiseman) is the fruite of <note place="margin">Wisd. 3. 15.</note> good labours, perpetuall is the memory of the Righteous, one generation proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their vertues vnto another. So then haue wee in our allotted stations serued God in vprightnesse, and sincerity of heart, haue wee endeauoured in the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent of our ability to doe good, to our Religion, our King, our Countrey, our Brethren? is there a <hi>sufficit</hi> in our liues? Wee must hold our life in patience, but wee may put death in our prayers: when <hi>Paul</hi> may say hee hath fought a good fight, kept the faith, finished his course, then he may come to his <hi>Cupio dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solui:</hi> When <hi>Hilarion</hi> can alleadge his 70. yeeres employment in the seruice of <note place="margin">Hieronim. in vita Hilarion.</note> God, then he may say, <hi>Egredere anima mea,</hi> go out my soule, why shouldst thou feare approaching vnto him whom thou hast <note place="margin">

death is expected without feare, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with chearefull welcome; nay pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wished for with sweet deuotion.</p>
            <p>In the second Argument take notice of his modesty, he esteemes himselfe (though wonderfully qualified) <hi>no better then his Fathers:</hi> If some small portion of <hi>Elias</hi> modesty were left in the world, any blush of vertuous bashfulnesse, the vile would not, in the Prophets phrase, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume aboue the Honourable, nor the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start so highly disdaine their Ancesters, preferring the false and fading beauty of recent opinions, before the amiable wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles in the face of aged truth. St. <hi>Paul</hi> says he serued God from his elders and proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors; <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 3.</note> from whom hee receiued his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and existencie, from them hee tooke his piety and religion; and he commends the deriuatiue faith of <hi>Timothy,</hi> descending from his grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eunice;</hi> And here <hi>Elias</hi> making ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention of his Predecessors, tels vs wee owe vnto them a double me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;

First, of their liues, as Adamants to draw vs to the imitating of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Secondly, of their deaths, as moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to put vs in minde of our owne mortality.</p>
            <p>All vertues Morall and Diuine haue beene by our Ancestors most fully exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified: when a Poet would encourage a young Sparke to noble vndertakings, hee doth it by this very way:</p>

            <p n="2">2. It is very good and wholsome for them also, who spend their dayes in sinne and vanity to reflect their eye vpon theyr Predecessors: Let the couetous ayming at wealth, and doing no good with it, thinke vpon his Predecessor <hi>Nabal,</hi> who tenne dayes together lay as a block without sence, motion, or shew of life.

The life which God gaue had fiue prerogatiues; two without man; three within him; without him God and his blessed Angels to protect him; besides, Paradise the pleasing seate of his Habitation: Within him, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteousnesse, and Immortality; his knowledge exceeding ours in three particulars. First, in amplitude and extent, reaching to God, the creatures, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Secondly, in the excellent manner, not as we by coniecturall probability de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from effects, but by euident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration out of the causes. Thirdly, for duration or continuance; ours is gotten with difficulty aud easily lost, either by discontinued intermission and cessation, or the braine and fancy may be distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as in a Phrensy, or the memory dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as in a Lethargy. Secondly, man was created Righteous, that Righteousnesse was the rectitude and integrity of the whole man, whereby his soule was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20725:17"/>
vnto God, his body to the soule. This was the Crowne and Diadem of mans life. <hi>Thou hast Crowned him with glory and worshippe, adorned him with grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> An happy life was that, wherein <hi>Methusalem</hi> liuing almost a thousand yeeres should not haue offended once; whereas now the most righteous man fals seauen times, that is, often-times a day. Lastly, that was a kinde of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life; a thing is said to be incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble three wayes: First, in respect of the matter, either which it hath not, as the Angels are immortall, those pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall substances; or in respect of the matter which it hath, as the Heauens, the matter whereof they are made, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susceptible of any forme but one. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in regard of the forme; so the body of <hi>Adam</hi> was immortall as the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes oyle lasted in the cruse without diminution, so might his body haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured without corruption, and that by the third the efficient cause, not by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent quality, or disposition in the body,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20725:18"/>
but by a supernaturall dowry of the soule. God endewed the first soule with such a powerfull vertue, as enabled it to preserue the body whereto it was vnited, from corruption, as a Candle enlightens the lanthorne wherein it is contained: So the blessednesse of the soule reflecting vpon the body should haue kept it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vigour and health. That was a free, noble, innocent, liuely life; <hi>But man being in Honour, forgot his God,</hi> and lost this life. What is the life we now enioy? take a short view, of the seuerall ages, of the seuerall estates, of the inseparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts of our life, and you will finde meerely to liue is no great happinesse.</p>
            <p>First, an Infant, that's a life of pitty, <note place="margin">In the Ages.</note> tenne months close prisoner in the dungeon of the wombe, not beholding the light, which when hee comes into, how sadly he salutes it, presaging his hard welcome, shaming that hee is naked, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that hee is borne, repining that he is borne to misery: then if his cradle proues not his coffin, hee liues a child,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20725:18"/>
that's a life of folly, in his speech, thoughts and actions; youth succeedes, that's a life of sinne, reason is weake, passion strong, concupiscence itcheth, lust rageth, sinne reigneth: Manhood the flower of all, is a life of vanity, <hi>Man in his best estate is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity.</hi> Lastly, an old man, that's a life of death: The Apostles word is of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham &amp; Sarah,</hi> when they were old, they were as dead; the head is gray, the face withered, the skinne wrinkled, the limmes stiffe, the stomacke weake, the memory frayle, the body crooked, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall powers decayed, the spirits spent; this is the life in ages; what is it in callings?</p>
            <p>Man liues eyther single, and that is a free life but vncomfortable, or he takes a <note place="margin">In the calling,</note> wife, wedlock is the schoole of Patience; demure <hi>Sarah</hi> chid with <hi>Abrabam,</hi> bleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed <hi>Leah</hi> wrangled with <hi>Jacob,</hi> scornefull <hi>Micol</hi> scoffed at <hi>Dauid,</hi> stubborne <hi>Vashtai</hi> will not come at <hi>Ahasshuerus</hi> call, and tis no better in the men. Discreet <hi>Abigail</hi> lights vpon a churlish <hi>Nabal, Pilat</hi> was as vnkind a husband as an vnrighteous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20725:19"/>
Iudge, denying his wife the life of our blessed Sauiour. This life is eyther priuate or publike, the priuate is simply the best; <hi>Joseph</hi> saw it when hee aduised his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren rather to continew Shepheards, then to stay with him in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court: Old <hi>Barzillay</hi> found it refusing <hi>Dauid</hi> his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous offer, and would not exchange his priuate <hi>Roguel</hi> for tumultuary <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Oracle accounted him the most hapy man of his time, who liuing vntill hee was purely old; neuer did see any house but his owne. Whether we eate the bread of carefull industry, or the sweete vnswet-for bread of an vnacquired patrimony in the most retired, quiet, plentifull condition, something still falles out verifying that of our Sauiour, <hi>Sufficient to the day is the sorrow of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The publike life is eyther in Church or Common wealth: The Churchman whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chayre or cure leades a laborious, an enuious, a dangerous life, his labour neuer at an end. <hi>Dauid</hi> tunes his Harp to driue away <hi>Sauls</hi> Melancholy, and hee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20725:19"/>
darts his Iauelin at him; a liuely Emblem of the Pastor &amp; most people. When <hi>Elias</hi> prayers haue procured a blessing from heauen, his best reward is a Caue in the wildernesse. St <hi>Augustine</hi> wept when hee tooke holy Orders, &amp; they were Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticating teares forerunning his infinite paynes in washing Blackmores, whose sowles were more tawny then their hides; His perpetual bickerings and encounters with Hereticks, for such was God his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall prouidence, that hee and <hi>Pelagius</hi> should come into the world much about one yeare, that the Antidote might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall to the poyson; His wearisome employment in determining secular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for then very good Christians belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their suites, could not be happily end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vnlesse they came through the cleare and sinceare hands of vpright Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

In my priuate meditations vpon this Point, I purposed to describe vnto you the Actions wherewith the sinfull life of man is distained, but when I surueyed the liues of wicked men, so many sinnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselues, that I knew not where to ranke them, so vgly in shape as I durst not looke vpon them; and when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the liues of the best, and the <note n="a" place="margin">Aug veh lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabili. &amp;c.</note>woe  denounced vnto the most laudable life of men, that the whole life of a deuout <hi rend="sup">b</hi>Saint was but sinne and barrennesse; I stood amazed vntill I remembred there <note place="margin">Tota me terret aut peccatum aut sterilitas.</note> was a veyle to couer them, the Integu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ his Righteousnesse, and a Sponge to blot them out, God his meere Mercy, and mans true Repentance. What a Torment is it to a good Soule to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually strugling with his naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, neuer to haue truce with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20725:21"/>
Temptations, and to see and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, nay sometimes to bee infected with the sinnes of others? And this is our in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable condition till with <hi>Elias</hi> we haue cast off the mantle of mortality. As for Misery, as a Center in a Circle meetes with euery line in the Circumference: So Man receiues punishment from God, from Angels, Deuils, and euery single creature, the very Gnat hauing a sting to torment him. Oh blessed Lord, are all our liues in the seuerall Ages so variable, in the Callings so troublesome, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions so intollerable? what remaines but with <hi>Elias</hi> to thinke of another life, and with <hi>Nazianzen</hi> to bury the Miseries <note place="margin">Narianz, in Funerepatris.</note> of this life in the hope of future Felicity; which is the second Corollary, and last point.</p>
            <p>It must bee so that there is another life, for here they liue many times the longest liues who were not worthy to liue at all, Here the Israelites make the brickes, and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> dwell in the howses; <hi>Dauid</hi> is in want, and <hi>Nabal</hi> abounds; <hi>Sion</hi> is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi>
