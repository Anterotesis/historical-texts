         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>There hath now a great and weighty buſines bin preſented to this houſe, &amp; a Letter hath bin read importing a diceſion of the <hi>Kings</hi> naturall Subjects.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> this is a great caſe, and very worthy of the conſideration and adviſement of this great Counſell; but J am very much miſtaken, if there be not a caſe here at home, of as great a danger as that now put to be abroad, the one ſtands without the doore (for ſo dangers from thence, in all our hiſtories, have ever bin termed:) but the caſe that I would put, is a caſe of danger already upon our backs.</p>
            <p>And in thoſe great caſes of danger, which ſo much concerne the wellfare of the body politique we ought to doe in them like skillfull Phyſitians that are not led in their judgments ſo much by the outward expreſſions of a Diſeaſe, as by the inward Symptomes, and cauſes of it. For it fares with a body politique, as it doth with a body naturall: It is impoſſible to cure an ulcerous body, unleſſe you
<pb facs="tcp:157523:3"/>
firſt cleanſe the veines, and purge the body from thoſe obſtructions, and peſtilentiall humours that overcharge Nature, and being once done too, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, blaines, and ſcabs, that grew upon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies and out-ſide of the body, dry up, ſhed, and fall away of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the danger that hath now bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the houſe, it ſtandeth at a far diſtance, &amp; J wiſh heartily, that it were further off; yet as it ſtands at a far diſtance, it is ſo much the leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. But the caſe that J ſhall put, is a caſe of great danger here at home, domeſtique: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe it is home-bred, and runnes in the veines.</p>
            <p>And, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if the one ſhall appeare, to be of as great danger, as the other, J hope it will not bee thought unreaſonable at this time, to put the one aſwell as the other; And the caſe that I would put, is this.</p>
            <p>The Charter of our liberties called <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was granted unto us by King <hi>Iohn,</hi>; which was but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and a reſtitution of the ancient Lawes of this Kingdome. This Charter was afterwards in the ſucceſſion of ſeverall ages, confirmed unto us above thirty ſeverall times, and in the third yeere of his Majeſties reigne that now is, we had no more then a bare confirmation of it. For we had an Act declaratory paſt, and then to put it out of all queſtion and diſpute for the future, his Majeſty by his gtatious anſwere, <hi>Soit droit comme eſt deſire,</hi> inveſted it with the title of Petition of right,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157523:3"/>Maſter Speaker.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome may object, <hi>Parturiunt montes &amp;c</hi> I promiſed to preſent the houſe with a caſe of very great danger here at home, but the Mountain at laſt hath brought forth nothing but a Mouſe, That this caſe is not worthy the name of a caſe, and ſo not worthy the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>And truly, for mine owne part, J ſhould have bin of the ſame opinion (had not ſome expoſitors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lawes of God, and Man, and reaſon, &amp; J am ſure contrary to the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of their own Conſciences) marred the text with their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, undermining the liberty of the Subjects, with new invented ſubtile diſtinctions, and aſſuming to themſelves a power (I know not where they had it) out of Parliament, to ſupercede, annihilate and make voyd the Lawes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>What ſad effects, theſe wayes and opinions have produced, I am confident, his Majeſty hath neither ſeene nor heard, as wee have felt them. And it is now his Majeſties goodneſſe and Piety, to give us leave to ſpeake them, and to preſent them with our Greevances, which are not few.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> hath bin miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably torne and macerated, and all the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Liberties ſhaken: the Church diſtracted, the Goſpell and Profeſſors of it perſecuted, and the whole Kingdome over-run with Multitudes, and ſwarmes of projecting <hi>Cater-wormes,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars,</hi> the worſt of all the <hi>Aegyptian Plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157523:4"/>Then as the caſe now ſtands with us, I conceive there are two poinis very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is, what hath bin done any way to impeach the Liberty of the Subject, contrary to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is, who have bin the Authors and Cauſers of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the ſerious examination and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe two queſtions, doe highly concern his Majeſty in the point of <hi>Honour,</hi> and his ſubjects in the point of Intereſt: and all that I ſhall ſay to it is but the words that <hi>Ezra</hi> did to King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to the ſetlement of that State: which at that time was as much out of frame and order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ours is at this preſent; and which cured theirs, I hope will cure ours. His words were theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſoever hath not done the Law of God, and the Law of the King, let judgment be ſpeedily executed upon him, whether it be unto death, or unto baniſhment, or unto Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of goods, or to Impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>M. Speaker,</hi> it may be ſome doe think this a ſtrange text, and is't poſsible! Some may thinke it as ſtrange a caſe. As for the text, every man may reade it, that will. And for the caſe, I am afraid there are but few here, which doe not experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally know it, to be as bad as I have put it: And how to mend a bad caſe, is part of the buſines wee met about. His Majeſty hath graciouſly confirmed unto us, our great and ancient priviledge of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome af Speech: and having his Kingly word for it, J ſhall reſt confidently upon it, as the greateſt ſecurity under heaven. And whilſt J have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:157523:4"/>
to have a place here, I ſhall with humility be bound to expreſſe my ſelfe as a Free-man.</p>
            <p>The Diſeaſes and Diſtempers that are now in our body politique, are growne to that height, that they pray for, and importune a Cure. And his Majeſty out of his tender care, and Affection to his people, like a nurſing Father, hath now freely offered himſelfe to heare our prayers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot complaine that we want good Lawes; for the wit of man cannot invent better then are already made; There want only ſome Examples, that ſuch as have beene the Authors, and cauſets of all miſeries, and diſtractions in Church and Common wealth, contrary to thoſe good Lawes which be like TREAKLE to expell the poyſon of miſchiefe out of others,</p>
            <p>But my part is but <hi>oſtendere Portam,</hi> and rherefore having put the Caſe, I muſt leave it to the judgement of this houſe, whether our dangers here at home be not as great and conſiderable; as that which was even now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
