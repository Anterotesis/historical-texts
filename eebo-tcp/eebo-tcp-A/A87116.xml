            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM THE Arch-Biſhop of <hi>PARIS,</hi> TO THE Late King JAMES.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Great SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS the King is truly ſenſible of Your Majeſty's firm adherence to his Intereſt, even with the loſs of your Three Kingdoms, ſo he has redoubled his Care, and has left no ſtone unturned to reſtore Your Majeſty to the ſaid Kingdoms again; not only by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voering to reduce them, but by making War alſo againſt all the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates who oppoſed him in this his Undertaking. And although the King beyond hopes has not been ſucceſsful in the firſt, though there was a very good proſpect of it, yet he ſucceeded in the other, in having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Dominions very much, and by encreaſing the ſame ſtill by the Great Conqueſts he makes every Year, by the great and continual Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he obtains over his Enemies from time to time; but all this is not ſuch a ſatisfaction to his Generous Mind, as that would be, if he could reſtore Your Majeſty to Your Throne again. This grieves the King, and ſticks ſo much to his heart, that he does not value the ſmiles of Fortune, ſo long as it frowns upon Your Majeſty. And as good Offices claim Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſo the King not only Royally received Your Majeſty into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but maintained and Cheriſhed you too in that Grandeur to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour, beſides his Kindneſs he ſhewed to that great number of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which he Maintained, and Employed. No leſs was expected from the Holy See, whom Your Majeſty ſo highly Obliged when Reigning, who inſtead of out-doing the King's Kindneſs towards Your Majeſty, ſtands now marked with Ingratitude. But now the King ſeeing his Kingdom Exhauſted of Money, by the immenſe Charges he has been at, and his own Subjects Croaning under the Miſeries that attend a War, and then conſidering the Effuſion of Blood of ſo many Thouſands of Chriſtians, and that a Prince who will reap the Benefit of his Arms, muſt make Peace when he is the moſt Victorious. Therefore the King amidſt his great Victories ſtretches out the Scepter of Peace, to all his Enemies; which as he has done at firſt, in particular to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> out of Compaſſion to withdraw him from his Ruine: So he does now in General to all the Confederate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But Theſe, as well as He, being pufft up with great Hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting

the turn of Fortune, refuſe the King's fair Offers, and ſtand upon ſo high Terms, which amount even to the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty! A thing not to be expected from ſo Victorious a Prince, as our King is. Yet, the King being deſirous to ſee the Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> Eſtabliſhed, for the Reaſons above mentioned, is willing to grant them more ample Propoſals; ſuch as he does not doubt but would he accepted of by the Confederates; and he meets with no other Difficulty, than the <hi>Re-inthroning</hi> of Your Majeſty. Which as it is the Thing the King takes the moſt to Heart, ſo he has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for it, more than for any other thing: But it ſeems Heav'n is againſt it, and will have it otherwiſe. It lyes therefore in your Majeſty's Power to remove that Obſtacle and to further that ſo much wiſhed-for Peace; by following the Laudable Examples of that great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Caſimire</hi> King of <hi>Poland;</hi> who quitting their Empire and Kingdoms, choſe rather to live a Religious, and Retired Life, a Life which the King was a commending much t'other day: A Life, I preſume to tell Your Majeſty the advantages of, by mentioning the dangers of t'other. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was ſeated upon a Precipice, and the more you are Elevated, the more dangerous will prove the Fall. In that Retirement you will be ſafe as it were upon a Plain, from whence you may look back upon the dangerous Rocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you. Deſcending from the Throne, you mount to the repoſe of a private life. And as there is nothing to be eſteemed a pleaſure, or a happy ſtate without a perfect ſafety; ſo your Your Majeſty will find, that you will then be more contented, more happy, and conſequently more high than you was before. There you may ſecure your ſelf from the dangers of a troubleſome Kingdom, and bewail the perilous condition of Worldlings, and purchaſe an Eternity of Joys. No other Earthly condition can equal that: 'Tis a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Earth, ſeparating us from the reſt of the World, and contented with its own Tranquility, and Delights. Such a one it will be to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, if you embrace it voluntarily, and withdraw your heart from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cares and Creatures, and contemn a Worldly Diadem. Which that you may do, the Author of all good grant that Your Majeſty's Affections, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Thoughts and Deſires may be ordered by him to that end, that they may begin and end in him, who is the Abyſs of Happineſs.</p>
