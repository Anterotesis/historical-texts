            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good Brother, my love with your Siſters remembred to you and yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have been long ſilent, becauſe I determined ere this (by Gods permiſſion) to have ſeen you; but ſuch is our preſent condition, that a ſecond reſolution hath altered my former determination; And here now I intend to end my dayes with your Siſter and her Children, preparing our ſelves for death, which we daily expect; for the hand of God was never ſtretcht out more againſt Chriſtians then at this time in theſe parts againſt the Engliſh both Proteſtants and Papiſts, ſo inhumane are the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Iriſh.</p>
            <p>I preſume you will be glad to heare from us, though ſorrowfull to have ſuch tydings, for not one ſyllable of comfort can I ſend you; for when the Rebellion firſt began, we expected ayde and ſpeedy helpe from <hi>England,</hi> which might in ſome meaſure have quelled their out-rages, if ſupplyes had beene timely ſent, but being now altogether hopeleſſe of ſuch happineſſe, we are not onely daunted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, but our mercileſſe enemies hardned and encouraged to goe on in their bloody Maſſacres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35704:3"/>The laſt of December 2000. of the Rebels led on by <hi>Kilmore</hi> their Captaine, went againſt the Towne of <hi>Kilcallane,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Limſter</hi> 18. miles from <hi>Dublin</hi>; and though the Towne gave them no oppoſition, but yeelded themſelves to their mercie, hoping to have Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rtor, yet the blood-thirſtie miſcreants ſpared neither man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nor child Proteſtant and Papiſt, but after they had raviſht their wives and daughters, put them all to the ſword, ſparing not ſo much as the Iriſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they were lately diſcended of Engliſh parents.</p>
            <p>Vpon the third day of this inſtant month Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, the ſame Company of Rebels aſſaulted the Towne of <hi>Castle Dormott,</hi> nine miles from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who hearing how bloodily their Neighbours had been butchered, reſolved to give them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and to dye manfully, their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being as willing as themſelves, but in the end they fared no better then their Neighbours had done formerly, for the enemies was of ſuch force, that they were overcome, and put to the ſword, except a poore-remnant that eſcaped by Flight, and what is become of them as yet is unknowne.</p>
            <p>The like crueltie was committed the ſame day by another Company of Rebels upon the Towne of <hi>Navan,</hi> 20. miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> as laſt night I had Intelligence, and though their maſſacre there was not ſo generall, yet their behaviour was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane, as I bluſh, and my heart bleeds to write; For after they had hang'd up many womens Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands before their owne faces, Knights, Gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:35704:3"/>
and others, they put their wives to take their choiſe of one of 3. Demands:</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether they would renounce their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and marry ſuch Iriſh men as they ſhould ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto them:</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether they would freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly proſtitute their bodies to ſo many ſend all men as ſhould deſire it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether they would be kild and put to the ſword.</p>
            <p>Oh wofull conditions! Was there ever ſuch villany read upon, or heard of to be amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Nor are thoſe all the cruelties that are here committed, for in the very Fields, men, women, and children lye ſcattered up and downe, moſt of them naked, being murthered and ſterved, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them mangled and diſmembred, ſome having their hands and feet cut off, others their eyes and tongues pulld out, and ſome their very bowels ript up: And in a little Village neere unto the Towne of <hi>Lurgan,</hi> wher a worthy and religious Knight one ſir <hi>Thomas Betton</hi> lived, two of his Daughters were moſt barberouſly deflowred in the preſence of their aged parents, and after all of ſtifled and put to the ſword.</p>
            <p>And that which addes more to our miſery, is, that the Rebels Armie doe daily increaſe, and our Forces hourely grow weake, having our Forts and Townes blocked up by the enemies on every ſide, ſo that there is no hope but ere long <hi>Ireland</hi> will be totally loſt, unleſſe a conſiderable Army be ſpeedily
<pb facs="tcp:35704:4"/>
ſent over, which we exceedingly feare will hardly be done in time, becauſe we daily heare, to our great ſorrow, that there are jarres and differences among you in <hi>England,</hi> which God prevent for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake.</p>
            <p>More I have to write, but I feare I have enough unleſſe my tydings were better, and therefore I will ſay no more on this Theme, leſt it ſhould grieve you aſmuch in reading, as mee in writing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Brother, let mee deſire you and yours to pray for me and mine, as the beſt meanes to prevent thoſe Judgements which otherwiſe God may bring upon us for our ſinnes: And although we are all in danger each day of death, yet while wee live it will be a comfort to us to heare from you: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince <hi>Dublin</hi> is ſo blockt up by Land and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it is almoſt impoſſible for mee to receive any Letters there from you, be pleaſed to ſend them to your Couſin <hi>Iackſon</hi> at <hi>London-derry,</hi> and if wee live they will come to my hands. So wiſhing you all health and happineſſe, and that wee may heare better newes one from another, I reſt, and ever will remaine,</p>
