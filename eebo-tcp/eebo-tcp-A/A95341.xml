         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶Truths from Leiceſter and Notingham
<date>AVGVST I. Anno Dom. 1642.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe hereby give you ſome ſhort notion how things ſtand in theſe Northerne parts. I met His Majeſty at
<hi>Notingham</hi> this day ſeaven night (where His Majeſty was) to make Obſervation. The Major was expected to
have been Committed, for refuſing to goe to <hi>Yorke</hi> to His Majeſty, being twice ſent for, not publiſhing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
ſent to him and other things. The King accepted his Mace, and delivered it to him againe, but
gave him no hand to kiſſe. The Town preſented the Prince with a Purſe, and 50. pieces. From thence I
went to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with the Court on Friday, where the King was earneſtly put upon it, to have by force of
Blowing up, or Battering down the Magazine Houſe recovered it: for which end 3. great Ordnance was brought to the
Towne: but upon a Petition from the Grand Jury to the King, that the Powder, Match, and Bullets therein might be
diſtributed to every Town in the Country; It was approved of by the King. He diſclaiming to have intereſt in it, for it was
the Countries, which I ſaw done accordingly; the Keepers of it being allowed to goe free to their Houſes, who was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have loſt their lives there, if they had not agreed upon theſe termes. I was in the Magazine every day, which was a
place of that ſtrength, that thoſe 40. Men that were in it (all Round-heads, as they call them) would have kept out 500.</p>
            <p>On Friday night Captaine <hi>Baſtwicke,</hi> Captaine <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and a Lievtenant, were brought in, being by force of 9. Cavaliers
(whereof Sir <hi>Henry Hungate</hi> a Courtier, was chiefe) compelled thereunto without any Authority ſhewed them, being all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with 2. or 3. Piſtolls a piece. Captaine <hi>Baſtwicke</hi> only of them 3. having a little Piſtoll. The next day it was expected an
Inditement would have been preferred againſt them all 3. for which I and another Friend that morning did conſult with
them about their Anſwere thereto, which was a Proteſtation againſt the proceedings there, and an Appeale to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
there to be tryed: but I thought the Judge durſt not try them at all, and ſo the concluſion is. The King hath taken
them with him Priſoners to <hi>Yorke;</hi> Captaine <hi>Baſtwicke</hi> is wondrous couragious, and ſo are the reſt. I was dayly with them.
Captaine <hi>Ludlow</hi> is (Sonne to a Knight in Parliament) a ſtout man with whom the King is much diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> (who are Knights of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and Deputy Lievtenants, did Traine a good
part of the Trained Bands, two dayes laſt weeke; and hearing the King was coming with a great Force to bring in <hi>Haſtings</hi> to
the Aſſiſes, the High Sheriffe that he had lately made, they departed towards <hi>London</hi> for avoyding blood-ſhedding, which
would have followed (as was conceiv'd) had they ſtayed; their Traine men being reſolved to have ſtood to them, with the
loſſe of their Lives. The King came in with about 200. Light Horſe, which Guarded Him; and there came 5. or 600. other
Horſe, of all ſorts, Gentlemen, Yeomen, and meaner ſorted. The Gentry of the County are moſt of them for the King
only, and were very active with Him. His Majeſtie did on Tueſday morning laſt returne from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to <hi>Beverley,</hi> 5. miles
from <hi>Hull,</hi> where he was yeſterday to meet the Parliaments Anſwere to His Propoſitions ſent by the Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi>
which if he did not like, it is thought he will preſently ſet upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and ſo march to <hi>London, &amp;c. Hull</hi> is very ſtrong, and
feares no oppoſition; yet the Cavaliers give out it wilbe fired in 4. dayes ſpace. I beleeve it not. The Biſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> rides
about with His Majeſty. The Women of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Petitioned the King againſt <hi>Haſtings,</hi> the Copy whereof followeth:</p>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>To the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſtie.</head>
               <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat whereas your Petitioners, the Wives, and others of their Sex, Inhabitants within this Towne of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
have of late beene expoſed to great feares by the turbulent carriages of Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> (whom your Majeſty
hath lately made High Sheriffe) in aſſaulting our ſaid Towne in the dead time of the night with Troopes
of Horſe and armed men, by reaſon of which ſudden affrightments, many of the Wives then with childe,
(there and about us) have ſince miſcarried, and others thereby ſo wonderfully amazed and dejected, that at
this day they continue under great weakneſſe, this we are able to make good.</p>
               <p>In conſideration whereof, And that becauſe the like, or greater cauſes of terror and perplexity may be againe adminiſtred
by the ſaid Maſter <hi>Haſtings</hi> or his agents (wherewith our weake Natures become too ſoone affected) wee are all of us from
hence emboldned to become humble ſuitors. That out of the deepth of your Princely wiſedome ſuch courſe may be taken, as
that wee may be ſecured from theſe our after feares, that ſo the like aforeſaid wofull effects may be prevented. And as wee
have, and ever ſhall expreſſe thoſe dutifull and loyall affections which are requireable from our condition; ſo doe we daily
pray for the wiſedome of Gods holy Spirit to be powred upon your ſacred Heart, whereby all your Actions may render us
hope that we ſhall ſtill enjoy our Husbands, Children, and Friends, in godlines and peace under your Majeſties Raigne, which
the Lord long continue.</p>
               <argument>
                  <p>This Petition was preſented to his Majeſty the 24. of <hi>July</hi> at his being at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> by many women of the beſt
rancke there.</p>
