            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>No day, no night, no thought, no dreame, but of that doleful nature,</l>
                  <l>That may amaze, or sore affright a most afflicted creature.</l>
                  <l>Friends turnd to foes, foes vse their force: and fortune, in her pride</l>
                  <l>Shaks hands with fate, to make my soule the weight of sorrow bide.</l>
                  <l>Care brings in sicknes, sicknes pain, &amp; paine with patience passion,</l>
                  <l>With biting in most bitter griefes, brings feature out of fashion:</l>
                  <l>Where brawn falne cheeks, heart scalding sighs, &amp; dimmed eyes with teares,</l>
                  <l>Doe shewe, in lifes Anatomy, what burthen sorrowe beares.</l>
                  <l>Where all day long, in helplesse cares, all hopelesse of reliefe,</l>
                  <l>I wish for night, I might not see the obiectes of my griefe.</l>

                  <l>That I could wish, though to my griefe, that it were day againe.</l>
                  <l>Thus, daies are nights: which nights are daies: which daies are like those nights,</l>
                  <l>That to my passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but only sorrows sights,</l>

                  <l>Oh hart, how canst thou hold so long, and art not broke ere this?</l>

                  <l>What shall I say? but only say; I knowe not what to say:</l>
                  <l>So many torments teare my heart, and tugge it euery way.</l>
                  <l>My Sunne is turnd into a shade: or else mine eyes are blinde,</l>
                  <l>That sorrowes cloude makes all seeme darke, that comes into my minde.</l>
