            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST HOLY FATHER AND LORD, CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT the 8. Pope: <hi>W. Barclay</hi> wisheth health.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Peter</hi> to this day, had seene such Bishops as your Holinesse is (most High Father and Prelate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) there had been no place for this Question at this time. Your Moderation and Gentlenesse, answerable to your Name, either had not opened any gap to this Busines, or had barred the same by some graue Prouision, that it should not be opened. I haue here discussed the Question, touching the Temporall authoritie of your See ouer Kings and Princes; which hauing been canuassed with so great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and so much Blood, hath as oft afflicted the Church, as the Princes themselues: I haue also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the same to you, lest I might seeme either to haue shunned your Iudgement, or to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged rather the Cause of the Kings, then of the Church. If I haue not pleased euery mans taste, I desire them to consider, That no Medicine brings
<pb facs="tcp:17700:3"/>
Health without bitternesse. It is peraduenture an odious argument to such as be scrupulous, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to peruert my sense and meaning: which not withstanding, most Holy Father, I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, partly out of the loue of the Truth, partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for that, I haue been of opinion, that this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic is the fountaine of all those tempests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Heresie tosseth your ship at this day.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. being alienated with a sudden vnkindnes, did not only thunder against <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. King of <hi>France,</hi> but also depriued <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> of his kingdome, because hee assisted the French. And out of question <hi>Lewes</hi> his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune put by that Thunderbolt from <hi>France:</hi> but the Nauarrois hearing the Spaniard of one side, and being excluded on the other side by the Mountaines of <hi>Pyrene</hi> from the helpe of <hi>France,</hi> was not able to make his part good against the furie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ambition of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Being spoiled of the greater part of his kingdome, he retired into <hi>France,</hi> where he had a large and ancient Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. In the neck of this came the fire which <hi>Luther</hi> kindled, and the Heires of <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> inflamed with their priuate hatred, did very soone passe to that side, which bandied against the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore came Heresie first to be seattered thorow <hi>France,</hi> by the partialitie of those Princes, which through the fiaming fire, and after through warres, hath continued to this day. As for <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8, King of <hi>England,</hi> who doubteth, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not so much from the Religion as from the Pope, out of his Hatred against the very same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie?
<pb facs="tcp:17700:3"/>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> the 7. had denounced <hi>Henrie</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the Right and Interest of his Kingdoms: and he againe conceiued an anger, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture was not vniust of his part, but blinde and intemperate. He opened <hi>England</hi> to Heretikes by the occasion of this schisme, who afterwards grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strong vnder <hi>Edward</hi> the 6, destroyed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion. Againe, <hi>Scotland</hi> affected with the Neighbourhood and Communion of <hi>England,</hi> hauing held out vnder <hi>Iames</hi> the 5, at length was attainted in the beginning of <hi>Maries</hi> raigne, and presently after infected, when the poison had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered further strength.</p>
            <p>So what Heresie or Heretiques soeuer are in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britannie</hi> at this day (which is their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie strong hold) was conceiued and hatched by this lamentable warmth of the Temporall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as a pestilent egge. Behold, most holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how little good it doth the Church to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this Command, which like <hi>Scianus</hi> his Horse hath euer cast his Masters to the ground. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I vndertaken this worke, out of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Religion and Truth, not to the Princes, and of a sincere and humble minde haue presented the same to you the Chiefe Pastour, to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to iudge of leper and leper.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing in these writings, which you shall thinke good and profitable, I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my Old age with the most sweete remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of so great a Witnesse. But if allowing my affection, yet you shall not allow my Iudgement, it shall be to posteritie an argument of your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb facs="tcp:17700:4"/>
that vnder you the simple libertie of Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath not been preiudiciall to any. Let this be an argument of your Moderation, but neuer of my Obstinacie. For whatsoeuer is in this businesse I leaue it to your Censure, that in this booke I may seeme not so much to haue deliuered, what I thinke, as to haue enquired of your Holinesse, what I ought to thinke.</p>

               <hi>being by the helpe of God vnderstood by others or by our selues. As I my selfe am in the writings of other men, so would I haue the vnderstanding Readers to bee in mine,</hi> that they would either curteouslie admit, or with reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. But to the matter.</p>
            <p>There is amongst Catholikes, (for what others thinke I force not a whit) but those too much addicted to the Pope, a twofold opinion touching this question: one is of the Canonists, who affirme that <hi>All rights of heauenly and earthly gouernment are granted by God to the Pope,</hi> and that, whatsoeuer power is in this world, whether Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Ciuill, or Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall is conferred by Christ vpon <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors: to which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they doe easily draw any thing, so often as any dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariseth, touching the absolute power, or, as they vse to speake, touching the fulnesse of the power of the Pope. The other is the opinion of certaine Diuines, who do iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dislike this ground of the Canonists, because it is not cleerely prooued either by authoritie of Scripture, nor tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Apostles, nor practise of the auncient Church, nor by the doctrine and testimonies of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Therefore these doe by most sound reasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince their opinion, I meane of the Canonists: but yet in such manner, as that by the losse of that, the Pope loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neuer a whit the more of his temporall interest and power, but they see that safely bestowed, and doe preserue it safe and sound for him. For they hold thus. <hi>That the Pope as Pope hath not directly any temporall power, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirituall: but that by reason of the Spirituall hee hath at least indirectly a certaine power, and that verie great, to dispose of the Temporalities of all Christians.</hi> And so looke what they doe allow the Pope, by a direct course, the same doe these men giue him, by an oblique and indirect meanes, so as the meanes onely is diuers, but the effect is the same.</p>
            <p>For my part, when I consider of this question, I finde, that neither of their opinions as touching the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17700:10"/>
power, hath any certaine ground: and yet if they be compared together, that the Canonistes opinion may more easily be maintained then the Diuines: especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not contrary to the order of nature, according to which a man by his right exerciseth authoritie granted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ouer others, and therefore, it containes nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. But the opinion of the Diuines, as it is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their owne side, ouerturnes the naturall course of things, which willeth, that no man vse any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer others, which is neither by name granted to him, nor is any whit necessary to the effecting of those things which are committed to his trust. Therefore these Diuines do indeed very well refute the opinion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists, but for all that, with their leaue, they thinke not a whit the better themselues: whereby a man may see, how much more easie it is to finde an vntruth in other mens writings, then to defend a truth in his owne.</p>
            <p>There is also euen amongst themselues a contention touching this point. For many of them haue ioined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the Canonists, either for that they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a shew of truth: or that bearing too much, and that a very blind affection to <hi>Peters</hi> Sea, (which indeed is woorthy all honour) they would also grace it with this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Power and Dignitie: or being obliged by some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauors of the Popes, haue by this endeuor of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes desired to draw their good opinions close to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, I will not say, to gaine them through this vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable flattery of theirs. And amongst these is one, who being lately sprung out of the Congregation of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, hath stept foorth as a <note n="*" place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what is this to a Temporall kingdome? What is this to a crowne and scepter of a temporall Maiestie? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I haue perused all that <hi>Bozius</hi> hath deliuered to this purpose: but I haue not found any sound reason for the confirming of his purpose, nothing that was not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

with the mixture of fallaries, and sophistication, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grounded vpon ancient and approoued authorities, nothing but depraued with a glosse of a deuised interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17700:12"/>

               </note> that lawes are imposed by deedes, and not by wordes: and this letter, is in a manner, as an Ecclesiasticall law.

            </p>
            <p>But this interpretation of <hi>Bozius</hi> is refelled by this, that the Pope by these wordes <hi>as the Pagan Emperours were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the chiefe Bishops,</hi> that is, (named) did not meane an empty and a bare name, as though Emperours, were onely named Bishops, but the right, and office, because to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the names they retained all the rights, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and dignities that were incident to each power, which seeing it is most true and <hi>Bozius</hi> dare not deny it: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth certainly that either no contrary comparison, nor perfect difference between the Popes and Emperours of these and those times, is in that place designed by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, or by the name of the Emperour,</hi> that he vnderstands all the Imperiall right: that as after Christ acknowledged and receiued, the Emperours assumed not to themselues any more the rights of the Bishopricke, so neither Bishops the rights of Emperours. To conclude, if the Pope had in this place signified, that hee refused onely the name of the Emperour, but retained the right and power: might
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17700:13"/>
not the Emperour iustly reply, that he stands not so much vpon the Name, as vpon the Right? what should he doe with the Name, if another carie away his Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? hee had certainly said it, neither would he haue put vp so foule an indignitie, if hee had beleeued that any such thing might bee gathered, out of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> his wordes.</p>
            <p>But saith <hi>Bozius,</hi> he said not their powers were <hi>(wholy)</hi> distinguished. I confesse, and that not without speciall care, lest hee should giue to the Popes flatterers, or any other busie Companions an easie occasion of Cauill and Exception. For <hi>Bozius</hi> would interpret that word, <hi>(call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) as farre as belonged to Execution:</hi> therefore hee spake more and more plainly, to wit, that those powers are seuered and parted, in their proper Actions, Offices and Dignities, that he might manifestly shew, that by no meane they are ioyned together, and that one is not subiect to the other, although both of them may concurre in the same person. For the same person may bee both a temporall Prince and a Bishop: but neither as a Pope can hee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himselfe, the actions, offices, dignities and other rights of Temporall things, nor as a Prince of Spirituall. If therefore these powers be ioyned together, neither in dignities, offices, nor actions, let <hi>Bozius</hi> tell vs wherein they are ioyned? If he say, in that because <hi>one is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and subiect to the other:</hi> that is it, which we deny, and which if it were true, it would follow necessarily, that those powers are distinguished neither in dignities, nor offices, but onely in actions, and so this opinion of Pope <hi>Nicola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> should bee false, for dignitie and office, which is in the Person subordinated, cannot but be in the Person, which doth subordinate, seeing it is deriued from him into the Person subordinated. Hence it is, that the Prince takes himselfe to be wronged, while his Ministers are hindred in the execution of their offices? and the Pope thinketh himselfe and his Sea Apostolike to be contemned, if any Contempt be offered to the authoritie of his Legate, sent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17700:13"/>
by him. But all things, and Persons are proclaimed to be free, and not subiect, vnlesse the contrary be prooued. And if these things be so, it is very ridiculous, and a meere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Bozius</hi> his braine, that he saies, how it appeares by the former speeches of Pope <hi>Nicolaus. That hee doth not affirme, the Lay power to be disioyned from the Spirituall so as a Person Ecclesiasticall may not haue it: but that a temporall Person may not haue an Ecclesiasticall.</hi> For where can this appeare? seeing in that letter, there is not one word to be seene, whereby that may be gathered in any probabilitie. And hitherto haue I said enough of this <hi>Bozius</hi> his error. And I am perswaded that no man is so madde, that in the determination of this businesse, touching the distinction of these powers, will not giue credit rather to <hi>Hosius,</hi> then to <hi>Bozius.</hi>

            <p>I Would here annex other examples of <hi>Bozius</hi> his error, but that I know that this opinion which he endeuoureth to reuiue being now laid asleep, and almost extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, seemeth in these daies to the learned so absurd, and that it is refuted and ouerthrowen, with so many and so cleere reasons, that now a man need not feare least any be inueigled and ouertaken therewith. For first it is certaine, that neither <hi>Bozius</hi> nor al his abetors, although they weare &amp; wrest the sacred writings, and works of the fathers neuer so much, shall euer be able to produce any certaine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereby that same temporall iurisdiction and power of the Pope, which they dreame on, ouer Princes and people of the whole world may be plainly confirmed.</p>
            <p>Nay but not so much as any token or print of any such temporall power deliuered by hand from the Apostles and their successors can be found, from the passion of Christ, for seauen hundred, nay I may say for a thousand yeeres.

               <hi>plainly appeare by the Scriptures, or surely out of the tradition of the Apostles. Out of the Scriptures we haue nothing but that the keies of the kingdome of heauen were giuen to the Pope, of the keies of the kingdome of the earth, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the aduersaries bring forth no tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> The which matters, and with all, the great diuision about this matter between the Diuines and the Canonists, and of each of them one with another, maketh that this question of the temporal power of the Pope, seemeth very doubtfull and vncertaine, and wholly to consist without any ground, in the opinion and conceipt of men: and therefore, that the truth thereof is to be searched and sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out by the light of reason, &amp; sharpnesse of arguments: and that it is no matter of faith, as they speake, to thinke of it either one way or other: for that, those things which are matters of faith, are to be held of all men after one manner.</p>
            <p>But for mine owne part, although I doe with heart, and mouth professe, that the chiefe Bishop, and prelate of the city of Rome, (as being the <note n="*" place="margin">See the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the reader.</note> Vicar of Christ, &amp; the lawfull successor of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> yea the vniuersall and supreme pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of the Church) is indued with spirituall power ouer all christian Kings, and Monarchs, and that he hath, and may exercise ouer them the power to bind, and loose, which the Scripture doth witnesse that it was giuen to the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> ouer all soules: yet notwithstanding I am not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perswaded that I should alike beleeue, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth secular Kings and Princes with in his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iurisdiction, or when they doe offend against God or Men, or otherwise abuse their office, that he may in any sort abrogate their gouernment, and take their Scepters away, and bestow them on others: or indeed in a word, that he hath any right or iurisdiction temporall ouer any lay-persons, of what condition or order, and ranke so euer they be: vnlesse he shall purchase the same by Ciuill and lawfull meanes: For as much as I haue obserued that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17700:14"/>
opinion which affirmeth the same, hath beene assaied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and attempted by diuers, but hitherto could neuer be prooued of any sufficient and strong reason, and for the contrarie opinion much more weightie and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reasons may be brought. For my part in regard of the zeale I beare to the Sea Apostolike, I could wish with all my heart, that it might be prooued by certaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted arguments that this right belongs vnto it, being very ready to encline to that part, to which the weightier reason, and authority of truth do swaie. But now let vs come nearer to the disputation it selfe.</p>
            <p>That it is euidently false, that the Pope hath authority and rule ouer Kings and Princes, it is certaine, euen by this; that it were an absurd thing, and vniust to say that heathen Princes are receiued by the Church, in harder and worser termes, then other particular men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons whosoeuer: or that the Pope hath at this day grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power ciuill ouer christian Princes, then in times past <hi>S. Peter</hi> &amp; the rest of the Apostles, had ouer euery priuate man, that was a child of the Church: but they in those times had neuer any right or power temporall ouer chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian lay-persons, therefore neither hath the Pope now a daies any temporall power ouer secular Princes. The assumption is prooned by this: because it is most certaine that in the time of the Apostles, the Ecclesiasticall power was wholy seuered from the ciuill, (I doe not hereweigh <hi>Bozius</hi> fooleries), and that this ciuill power was wholly in the hands of heathen Princes out of the Church. In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Apostles themselues, were within the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iurisdiction of the heathen, and that both <hi>Albert Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius</hi> and <note n="m" place="margin">

               </gap> other notable Diuines doe ingenuously confesse. For Christ came <hi>not to dissolue the law, but to fulfill it:</hi> Nor to destroy the lawes of nature and nations, or to exclude any person out of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouernment of his estate. Therefore as before his comming. Kings ruled their subiects by a ciuill power, so also after that he was come, and gone againe from vs into
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17700:15"/>
heauen, they retained still the selfe same power, confirmed also, neither then any whit diminished by the doctrine of the Apostles. If therefore <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles, before they followed Christ, were subiect to the authority and iurisdiction of heathen Princes, (which can not be denied,) and the Lord hath no where expresly and by name need them from the obligation of the law of nature and of nations, it doth follow necessarily, that euen after the Apostleship, they continued vnder the same yoke, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could no way hinder the preaching, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospell. For although, they had been freed by our Sauiour his warrant, what I pray you, had this exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion auailed them to the sowing of the Gospell? or what could those few and poore men haue done more, being in conscience loosed from the band of temporal iurisdiction, then if they were left in their first estate of obedience? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that priuiledge of liberty, (if they had obtained any such thing,) had been hindred and frustrated by the seruile and vniust courses of vnbeleeuing Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But it appeareth both by their doctrine and practise, that they themselues were subiect to Princes, like other citizens: for that can not be laied in their dish, whereof Christ challengeth the Scribes and the Pharisies, that they did one thing and taught an other. Now they taught christians that the subiection and obedience, whereof we speake, is to be giuen to Kings and Princes <note n="*" place="margin">

inspired with the spirit of God, so penned his Epistles, as that he did not onely instruct them, that were conuerted to the Faith, and admonish them of their dutie, least they should thinke that they were so redeemed by Christ his bloud, as that they were not bound any longer to yeeld obedience to any Ciuill power, (which conceit was now wrongfully setled in the mindes of certaine persons, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the honor, and priuiledge of the name of a Christian) but also that hee might giue the Heathen and Infidels to vnderstand, that Christian religion doth take no mans interest from him, neither is it in any manner contrary to the temporall authoritie and power of Kings and Emperours. Therefore it is cleare, that in that place the Apostle ought to bee vnderstood, of the Temporall power onely, because at that time, as hath beene said, there was no other authoritie acknowledged: and in that sense haue the ancient Fathers euer interpreted the Apostle in this place: wherupon S. <hi>Austine</hi> in the exposition of that place, confesseth that himselfe and by consequent in his person all the Prelates of the Church are subiect to the Temporall power: whose wordes, because they bring great light to this disputation, I will set downe entier as they lye. <hi>Now for that he saith, Let euery soule bee subiect to the higher powers, for there is no power, but of God: he doth admonish very rightly, lest any because he is called by his Lord into libertie, being made a Christian, should be lifted vp into pride, and not thinke that in the course of this life that he is to keepe his ranke, neither suppose that hee is not to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to the higher powers, to whom the gouernment is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the time in Temporall affaires, for seeing we consist of minde and bodie, as long as we are in this temporall life, and vse temporall things for the helping of this life, it behooueth for that part, which belongs to this life to be subiect to powers, that is, to men, who in place and honour doe manage worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But of that part whereby we beleeue in God, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into his kingdome, wee ought not to be subiect to any man, that desires to ouerthrow the same in vs, which God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed</hi>

Therefore if any man thinke, because he is a Christian, that he ought not to pay custome or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, or that hee need not to yeeld honour due to those powers, who haue the charge of these things, he is in a great error. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if any man thinke that he is to be subiect so far, as that he supposeth, that hee who excels in authoritie for temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, hath power ouer his Faith, he falls into a greater er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.

            <p>Here <hi>Austine</hi> comprehends many things in few words which support diuers of our assertions, which are here and there set downe in this Booke. For both first he teacheth, that which we haue said, that the profession of Christian Religion exempteth none from the subiection of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power: whereof two things necessarily follow; whereof the one is, that the Apostles and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were subiect to the authoritie of Heathen Princes and Magistrates, and therefore that neither S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other Apostle, was endued with any Temporal power ouer Christians, for that it was wholy in the hands of the Heathen, as we haue shewed in this Chapter. The other, that it was not lawful for those first Christians to fall from the obedience of Heathen Princes, and to appoint other Princes and Kings ouer themselues, although they had strength to effect it, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vntruly thinketh) <note n="q" place="margin">

Thirdly, seeing he speaketh generally of that subiection, and vseth such a speech, wherein he includeth himselfe, and excepts none, he doth plainly enough declare, that Clergie-men as well as Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are in this life subiect to Temporall power: Lastly, he deliuereth vs a notable doctrine, of a twofold dutie of Subiects, both toward God and toward the King, or the Temporall power, in what manner both of them ought

to serue, and yeeld that which is right and due, which lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we haue followed in this Booke, and in the Bookes <hi>De Regno.</hi> Therefore let vs lay this downe as a maine ground, that the place of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which we spake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is ment by him onely of the Temporall iurisdiction. And yet wee confesse, that that opinion of performing obedience may very truly bee applied to Spirituall iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction also, by reason of the generall similitude, and as they say, <hi>of the identitie of reason,</hi> which holdes so iustly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them <note n="g" place="margin">L. illud D. ad leg.

            <p>If then the Apostles in those times had no Temporall iurisdiction ouer priuate men, that were regenerate and made the children of the Church, how can it be, that the successors of the Apostles should obtaine that iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer Princes, who come to the Church? Seeing it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant of the Successors part, that they should haue more interest ouer their spirituall Children, by vertue of the power Ecclesiasticall, then the Apostles had, whom they succeed. But on the Princes part, what can be spoken with more indignitie and iniustice, then that they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the faith of Christ, should bee pressed with a harder yoke, then any priuate man among the Multitude. But priuate men when they entred into the spirituall power of the Church; lost no inheritance nor any temporall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, excepting those things, which they offered of their owne accord, and conferred to the common vse, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the Actes of the Apostles, <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 5.</note> where <hi>Ananias</hi> his lye cost him his life, being taxed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in these wordes, <hi>whilest it remained, did it not appertaine to thee? and after it was sould, was it not in thine owne power?</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise therefore the Princes also after they gaue their name to Christ, retained entirely and vntouched all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall interest, I meane their Ciuill gouernment and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.

               <hi>haue I to doe, to iudge those, which are without?</hi> But that the Pope now hath that power, because they are made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and sonnes of the Church, because he is the supreme Prince and head in the earth, and the Father of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and that the right order of Nature and Reason doth require, that the Sonne should bee subiect to the Father, not the Father to the Sonne. This reason is so trifling and meerely nothing, that it is a wonder, that any place hath been giuen to it by learned men, for that spirituall subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby Princes are made sonnes of the Pope, is wholy distinguished and seperated from Temporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection so as one followeth not the other, But as a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Consul in the time while he is in office, may giue himselfe in adoption to another, and so passe into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of an adoptiue father, and into a fatherly power: whereas notwithstanding by that lawfull act, he transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not vpon the Adopter, either his Consular authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor any thing else appertaining to him by the right of that office; so Kings and Princes, and generally all Men, when they enter into the bosome of the Church, and yeeld themselues to be adopted by the chiefe Bishop, as their Father, doe still reserue to themselues whatsoeuer tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iurisdiction or Patrimonie they haue any where, free, entier and vntouched by the same right, which they had before, and so the Pope acquires no more temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by that spirituall Adoption, then he had before, which shall be prooued at large hereafter. <note n="*" place="margin">

if it had beene bestowed by the Lord vpon <hi>Peters</hi> person, or in any sort had belonged to his successors, although in truth or in deed as they speake, they had not exercised it, it had neuer beene passed ouer in so deepe silence and so long, of so many and so worthy men for holinesse and wisedome, and such as for the cause of God and the Church feared nothing in this world. Who will beleeue that all the Bishops of those times, burning with zeale and affection to gouerne the Church, would so neglect this part of this Pastorall dutie, if so be they had thought it to be a part, (wherein certaine of their successors haue placed the greatest defence and protection of the Faith) that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so many and so great occasions they would neuer vse it against hereticall Emperours?

Nay rather euery one of them as he excelled most in learning and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so he with much submission obserued the Emperor, and sticked not to professe himselfe to bee his vassall and seruant.

            <p>These, and such like fashions as these, who will they not driue into amazement and wonder at so great a change of the Popes state and gouernment? or doe they not giue to all men iust cause to enquire, wherefore the former Popes in the most flowrishing age of the Church, acknowledged themselues to be the seruants, subiects, and vassals of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and obeied their authority in temporall matters, when as they notwithstanding were ouer them in spirituall: and our later Popes professe themselues to be Lords of all Kings, Princes, Countries, and Nations?

            <p>NOw I do chiefly find two things, which seem to haue giuen vnto the Popes the opportunity to arrogate so great power to themselues. The one is, the very great honor, which (as indeed there was reason,) was giuen to the chiefe Pastor of soules, by Princes and christian

people, and yet ought to be giuen to him: and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled and setled opinion of the sanctity of that sea of the blessed Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which is conspicuous and excelleth amongst all men in all spirituall honor and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and in that respect hath been beyond all other most increased and honored with wealth and riches. By these meanes all men, were very easily perswaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that neither the Pope in regard of his holinesse would challenge to himselfe any authority, which did not appertaine vnto him: and also, that it was not lawfull for a christian man in any manner to disobey the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Whereby it came to passe, that sundry Popes, whose mindes were too much addicted to ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vaine glory, embouldned and hartned through the confidence of this so great reuerence and affection of men towards them, drew to themselues this power ouer Kings, which was vtterly vnknowen to the first successors of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The which also passed the more currant by reason of the preoccupate and now engrafted conceipt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ignorant folke, who being possessed of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holinesse, did verily beleeue that the Pope could not erre, either in word or deed: and also, by the writings of certaine cleargy men catholikes, and Canonists, who either erring through ignorance of the truth, or wholly resolued into flattery of their Prince the Pope, of whom they did depend, did heape and lay vpon his only person, all the power, which is in the vniuersall world, with these allurements and inuitations the Popes, who of their owne accord ran with speed enough toward honor and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, were now much more enflamed as it were with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine new firebrands of ambition and aspiring thoughts. For all, how many soeuer held that sea lawfully, gouerned the Church with an authority <note n="*" place="margin">See the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the reader.</note> equall to <hi>Peter:</hi> but not all of them burning with the zeale of <hi>Peter,</hi> gouerned it with equall disposition to him. Nay I can not write it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe of heart it is certaine, that many crept into that place by violence and villany, others did breake into it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17700:20"/>
and defiled the most holy Chaire with the filthinesse of their liues and behauiour: others also; who were aduanced to the height of that dignitie, burned with an ambitious desire of ruling, and out of their emulation and enuie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst secular Kings and Princes, endeuoured by all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise and cunning to enlarge the bounds of their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in the beginning was meerely spirituall, with the encrease of temporall Iurisdiction and authoritie. Which affectation, although at the first diuers supposed to be a grace and ornament to that great dignitie, which the Vicar of Christ in earth, and the successor of blessed <hi>Peter</hi> doth hold, yet when some of them grew to that insolencie, that they supposed it lawfull for them not onely to throw downe Kings from their Thrones, but also to giue away great and goodly kingdomes, for reward, nay for a pray, and to grant them to any that would seaze vpon them, then surely there was no reasonable man, but hee greatly misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that vnreasonable pride of minde, and either shed teares, or conceiued great anger at the same. Who was there at that time that did not either mourne inwardly, or gnash his teeth in his head, when that most proud Pope whom we mentioned before, presumed so arrogantly to depriue that most mightie Monarch <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire of his kingdome, and to bestow it together with the Empire vpon <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of Austria? And that for no other reason in the world, but because the King had laid his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by the heeles, for threatning him in so saucie manner as he did, as though by that Act, the King of France, (whom a little before <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3 had ingeniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <note place="margin">Cap. per vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilem. qui fil. sunt legit.</note> that he had no superiour in temporall matters) he had resigned his kingdome to the Pope as Client and Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daire to him, for so he denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth to the King by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Narbona, that <hi>the kingdome of Fraence, was esche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church of Rome for his Contumacie, and violating of the law of Nations,</hi> which speach of his, what doth it else imply, but that this kingdome, in all mens iudgement the most free and flourishing kingdome of the world, and by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17700:20"/>
example and precedent thereof, all other Christian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, are as Benefices and Feudes of the Church of Rome, and euen of the Pope himselfe? seeing they could not otherwise escheate to that Church for Contumacie &amp; felonie, (as they tearme it,) vnlesse the direct temporall Dominion and fee of those kingdomes were in the same Church.</p>
            <p>The other occasion of affecting so great a temporall Iurisdiction was presented by the sword of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the principall bulwarke of the spirituall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which was so great terror to the world, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, durst neither neglect nor contemne the Popes curses; being armed &amp; fortified howsoeuer by right or by wrong, with the thunderbolt of Excommunication: and this voice did vsually sound out of Pulpits, <hi>That euery Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, although it were vniust was to be feared,</hi> and that it belonged only to the Pope to iudge whether it were iust or vniust. Besides that also, <hi>that a man ought neither to eat, nor to haue any Commerce with Excommunicate persons</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Can. ficut Can. excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos. xi. q.</hi> 3.</note>. With which warnings and threatnings the Subiects of Princes excommunicate being for the most part terrified, did fall from their Obedience: and that which in Euils of this Nature was the worst of all, the Pope partly by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the like Curses partly by perswasions and gifts, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed other Princes against a Prince that had been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by him. For this cause those Princes vpon whom this malice of the Popes did sit so hard, being wrapped in so many dangers on euery side, and exposed to such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their estate, made choise rather to pacific an angry Pope with the submission of their Crowne and Scepter, (and to redeeme their vexations) then for their owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to embroyle all the world, and to set all a fire with sedition and armes. This short and compendious way had Popes, to exanimate and daunt Kings and Princes with feare, and almost to obtaine a victorie without striking stroke. Notwithstanding many Princes of good resolution withstood such attempts and proffers of Popes, and that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17700:21"/>
so stiffely, that the mischiefe which followed thereon tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather to the Popes hinderance then the Prince. But in this place the Reader may please to be aduertised, that this Opinion which was so rife in euery mans mouth, <hi>That euery Excommunication is to be feared,</hi> ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood with this exception, <hi>without that it manifestly appeare, that it is vniust,</hi> for then it is neither to be regarded, nor feared, so as the partie excommunicate be free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and presumption, for then it workes backwards, and hurts not him against whom it is cast, but him, from whom it is cast. Of which sort that Excommunication seemeth to be, which is charged vpon Subiects because they obey their King or Prince being excommunicate in those things which belong to temporall Iurisdiction, and doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the Commandements of God, as shall hereafter be declared in a more conuenient place. <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.</note> Besides neither is that alwaies true, <hi>That we ought not to haue commerce or eat meate with Excommunicate persons,</hi> for in this case it is not true, where the danger is apparant, least by such a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some great mischiefe arise in the Church as vsually it doth, when a Prince is excommunicate, if his Subiects forbeare to communicate with him, for there is neuer any Prince so much forlorne, who cannot finde friends and clients, by whose aide and armes hee may maintaine his cause, although it be neuer so vniust, with great hurt both to Church and common-weale, whereof both in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of our Forefathers and in our owne age, there haue beene lamentable examples in Christian countries: where I say any such thing is feared, a separation of bodies is not necessarie, <hi>But it is enough to be seuered from such in heart, to be distinguished by life and manners, for the preseruation of Peace and Unitie, which is to bee preserued for the health of those, which are weake:</hi> as S. <hi>Austine</hi> excellently teacheth, <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 3 <hi>contra Epist. Parm. c.</hi> 2.</note> whereby it seemeth to follow, that the Pope doth very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedly, who forbids the Subiects communion and soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie with their Prince so oft as no small both diuision and confusion hangeth ouer Church and Common-wealth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17700:21"/>
yea that in such a Case the Subiects are not bound, to obey the Pope commanding the separation of their bodies. But of this matter more in his place. By these and the like, it appeareth, as I said, that the Popes in the East times of the Church vsurped to themselues this temporall power ouer Princes which none of all their Ancesters did euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge neither in the first nor in the middle times. And indeed <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. being exasperated partly with the publike offence of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. the Emperour, and partly with a priuate iniurie, did first of all challenge to himselfe, that right and power to giue and take away king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, affirming that Christ did giue to <hi>Peter</hi> and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, all the kingdomes of the world: in this verse, <hi>Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Gregorie</hi> raised nothing of that action but bloudy and raging Tragedies: and was hindred by force and armes that he could not effect his vnhappy designes. Now that the Church in her first times had no such power, nay did not so much as suppose that she had any such power, it is clearely prooued out of that Epistle of <hi>Hosius,</hi> which wee alleadged to <hi>Constantius</hi> infected with the Arrian heresie: and also vexing <hi>Liberius</hi> Bishop of Rome and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Bishops with banishments and sundry other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, for in that place, that worthy man speakes, not in the person of a Christian man, nor of a simple Bishop, but in the name of the whole Ecclesiasticke order, and euen of the Pope himselfe: and hee saith either true or false: If true, it is euident, that the Church at that time concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they had no temporall Iurisdiction ouer Kings and Christian Princes, no not for heresie, which is the most grieuous and pestilent crime that is. If false, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? that he might flatter the Emperour? very like: how then could he thus say, <hi>Loquebar de testimonijs tuis in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu Regum &amp; non confundebar</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 118.</note>. Or because he knew not the truth of the matter, and the doctrine of the Church? Surely I thinke no man will ascribe that to such a man, who did not onely match the most of his age in learning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17700:22"/>
and eloquence, but also by reason of his yeeres exceeded them all in experience, who hauing often been present at Councels and Assemblies of the holy Fathers, and heard their iudgement: of the power and authoritie of the Church; could not be ignorant what was there determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I adde also that, which passeth all the rest that this iudgement of this most noble Confessort to <hi>Constantius</hi> is commended by S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but neuer mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by any of the holy Fathers either of that time, or of the ages following, that we should iustly conceiue any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate opinion of this iudgement.</p>

            <p>I Haue alreadie sufficiently discoursed of the follie of <hi>Bozius.</hi> and the Canonists who affirme that the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Empire of the whole world is giuen to the Pope by the law of God. For I need not spend much paines in resuting the same, since it is long agoe hissed out by the common consent of the Diuines. Now let vs passe ouer to the other opinion, which the Diuines, misliking that of the Canonists haue substituted in the place of this reiected fancie, and let vs see whether it agree with the truth. Now he hath propounded it thus in the first Chap. <hi>That the Pope hath temporall power indirectly, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner, that is, in respect of his spirituall monarchie: hath I say, the chiefe power euen temporall, to dispose of the temporall estates of all Christians.</hi> Which opinion if it bee true, whatsoeuer is drawen from the Bishops by the denial of direct power, the same is largely restored to him by this oblique and indirect way of ruling. But I am afraid it is not true, and that it is assaultable with the same engine wherewith that opinion of the Canonists was battered to the ground. For the Diuines, and aboue the rest <hi>Bellarmine</hi> learnedly doth for this reason reprooue the Canonists opinion, which giues to the pope the dominion of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17700:22"/>
whole world, and to Kings and secular Princes the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, and that committed to them by the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Popes themselues doe freely confesse (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in diuers of their letters) that temporall Empires and Kingdomes are giuen to princes of God: and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer either power or execution Kings and Emperours haue, that they haue it of Christ. From whence the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludes that argument very finely against the Canonists in a dilemma, or perplexed maner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning. <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib</hi> 5. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore I aske (quoth he,) either the Pope can take from Kings and Emperours this execution, as being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the supreme King and Emperour, or he cannot: if he can, therefore he is greater than Christ, if he can not, therefore hee hath not truely this Kingly power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why may not wee aswell vse an argument of the same kinde against this other opinion of the Diuines? Kingdomes and Empires are giuen by God, as many holy Popes doe witnesse: for which cause S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Epistle to <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperour <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</hi> 13. <hi>epist.</hi> 31.</note>, beginneth in these words: <hi>Our most sacred Lord, and appointed of God: and in another to</hi> Constantia Augusta: <hi>Therefore your piety,</hi> (saith he) <hi>whom with our Soueraigne Lord, Almightie God hath ordained to gouerne the world, let her by fauouring of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice returne her seruice to him, of whom she receiued the right of so great authoritie.</hi> What should I vse many words? The Scripture it selfe witnesseth, that Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours receiue power from God, whose Vice-gerents they are therein, as saith <hi>Lyranus</hi> vpon that of Wisedome, 6. <hi>Power is giuen to you from the Lord, and vertue from the Highest, who will inquire into your works.</hi> Why then should not a man vse a dilemma out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> against <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> The Pope can one way or other, that is, directly, or indirectly, take away kingdomes and empires, from Kings and Emperours, and giue them to others, or he can not: if he can, he is in some manner greater than God, because he takes away that, which God hath giuen: For one that is lesse or equall, cannot take away that, which is granted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17700:23"/>
by his greater or his equall: Nay nor the Deputie or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of him who granted, without the expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord: least any man should lay in our way, that the Pope as Christs Vicar doth it. Whereas it can be no where found, that he hath receiued any warrant touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter, either expresly, or by implication, as by those things which follow will easily appeare. If hee can not, then it is false which they say, that he hath supreame power indirectly, to dispose of all the Temporalties of Christians, and to depose Kings and Emperours from their thrones, and to suffect others in their places. I would they would consider how their owne argument doth wringe them, and not this onely, but also another of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force, which we reported aboue out of the same booke and Chapter of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> the which also in this place we will and that by good right fit to our purpose in this maner.</p>
            <p>If it be true that the Pope hath temporall power indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to dispose of the temporalties of all Christians, he hath the same either by the law of God or of man. If by the law of God, <hi>That should appeare by the Scriptures, or surely by the tradition of the Apostles. Out of the Scriptures we haue nothing but that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were giuen to the Pope, of the keies of the kingdome of earth there is no mention: as for tradition of Apostles, the aduersaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce none,</hi> neither Canonists nor Diuines. If by mans law, let them bring foorth their law, that we may be all of the same opinion with them. But if they shall say, that they neede neither expresse word of God, nor tradition of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for the confirmation of this power, since it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameth to the Pope onely indirectly and by a kinde of consequence, as a certaine and inseparable accession, and appurtenance of that Spirituall power, wherewith the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Pastor of soules is indued ouer all the sheepe of the Christian flocke: We also will require of them some te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of this accession and coniunction, either out of Scriptures or traditions of Apostles: Wee doe require I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17700:23"/>
say, that they teach vs either out of Scriptures or traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Apostles, that this is an accession and consequence necessarie and inseparable to that Spirituall power which the Pope hath, and that it belongeth to the Popes office in some manner: that is indirectly, as they speake, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all temporall matters of Christians: seeing it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnlikely, if that belongs to his office, that so great an extent of power, and which there is nothing higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men hath beene omitted in so deepe silence in the Church so many ages, both by Christ our Sauiour, and also by the Apostles, and their successors: for if each power may be seuered from other, the Spirituall from the Temporall, and contiarily, there will be some place for that opinion, which determines that that which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be done directly, cannot be done indirectly: for so haue wise men defined, as oft as any thing is forbidden to bee done directly, that the same can neither bee done indirectly or by consequence: vnlesse that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden doe follow necessarily to another thing lawfully permitted, so as the thing permitted cannot proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing prohibited, and vnlesse (as I may speake with the Ciuilians) <hi>The cause of both be so commixed, that it cannot be seuered</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">I. 5 § gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter. D. de don. inter vir. &amp; vxor.</note>. Whereby it is concluded that hee who is alone cannot alien any thing, cannot yeeld to a sute moued vpon the same thing <note n="f" place="margin">

            <p>THe former opinion of the temporall power, which they say the Pope hath indirectly, is vehemently shaken euen by this that neither practise nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor any mention of such a papall power hath been heard of the space of a thousand yeeres in the Church, when as in those times many christian Princes did abuse their Kingdomes and Gouernments impiously, cruelly, peruersly, and to the great preiudice and mischeefe of the Church: whereof one of the two must needs follow, that either the Bishops of those times were wanting to their duties, or that the Bishops of the times ensuing did and at this day doe gouerne the Church with greater power and command, because these later haue openly challenged to themselues this temporall power, and haue endeuoured to pull the same in and at their pleasure ouer Kings and Princes: but the former haue not at any time acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that any such right belongeth to them: I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, what answers haue been made by diuers to excuse those first Pastors: but I know that they are such, that if they be diligently examined they can not be allowed by the opinion of any indifferent iudge.</p>
            <p>There came foorth a booke printed at Rome the yeere of our Lord 1588. published vnder a fained name of <hi>Franciscus Romulus,</hi> with this title: <hi>An answer to certaine heads of an Apologie which is falsly intituled Catholike, for the succession of Henry of Nauar into the Kingdome of France.</hi> The author of which booke, whome <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knowes and loues very well, labours to take away this most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant obiection, by the change of the state of the Church, and by the diuerse reason and condition of times and persons which oftentime brings in diuersity of law <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note>. For
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17700:24"/>
thus he saith. <hi>And now where as the aduersarie obiecteth in the fourth place, touching the custome of our ancestors, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many hereticall Princes, as Constantius and Valens, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Anastasius an Eutychian, Heraclius a Monothelite, and others besides, it makes nothing to the matter. For the Church ought not rashly and inconsideratly to abuse her power. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it falleth out not very seldome, that the power of certaine Kings is so great, being also ioined with wickednesse and cruelty, that the Ecclesiasticall censure neither profiteth any thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them, and doth very much hurt to Catholike people, vpon whom these Princes prouoked do rage the more. For I pray you, what had it auailed the Church in times past if she had assaied to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate &amp; to depose either the Ostrogoth Kings in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the Visegothes in Spain, or the Vandales in Afrik, although she might haue done it very iustly? and the very same ought to be vnderstood of Constantius and Valens, and others aboue named, and indeed then the times were such, as that the Bishops ought rather to haue been ready to suffer Martirdome, then to punish Princes. But when the Church perceiued, that now some place was opened to her power, either with the spirituall profit of the Princes themselues, or at least without the mischeefe and hurt of the people, she was not wanting to her selfe, as the examples alleadged before doe prooue. For thus the Church iudged that Leo Isaurus was to be depriued of halfe his Empire, and Henry the fourth of the whole, and Childerike of the Kingdome of France, and indeed afterward both Leo wanted part of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Henry the whole, and Childerike his kingdome of France. Therefore the Church did not therefore tolerate those ancient Emperors Constantius and Valens and the rest, (as the aduersary dreameth,) because they succeeded lawfully into the Empire, for otherwise she had also borne with Leo also and Henry, and Childerike, who succeeded no lesse lawfully, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she could not punish them without the hurt of the people, these she might.</hi> Thus he, in which words he yeeldeth a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason of the diuersity, wherefore the Church endured <hi>Constantius, Iulianus; Valens, Valentinianus</hi> the yonger, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius Heraclius,</hi> and other hereticall Princes, but did not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17700:25"/>
forbeare <hi>Leo Isaurus, Henry IV. Childerike,</hi> and the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes of the ages ensuing: <hi>One forsooth, because then the times were such as the Bishops ought to haue been ready rather to suffer Martirdome, then to punish Princes.</hi> The other because the Church or the Pope, <hi>could not without the hurt of the people punish Constantius. Iulianus, Valens,</hi> and the rest of that sort aboue mentioned, but as for <hi>Leo, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Childerike</hi> and the others she could; therefore them she endured, these she endured not. But let vs see if both the reasons of this diuersity be not false, and grounded vpon mere and strange falshoods, and yet none hath assigned any better, nor as I thinke can assigne any, saue only that, which doth vtterly ouerthrow the cause of the aduersaries, which is that the Church did tolerate those former Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and Princes, because as yet that blind ambition was not crept into her, by which the succeeding Popes caried away with greedinesse of glory, vsurped that temporall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction whereof we speake. Therefore that the Bishops of that time being contented with their spirituall iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they exercised with indifferency vpon all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, did wholly forbeare the temporall power, which they did know that it belonged not vnto them: so recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cause of the Church to the iudgement of God, did with humility and patience expect the conuersion or confusion of wicked Princes. But I returne to the reasons giuen by this Author, that we may see, how faulty they are.</p>
            <p>And indeed to deale plainly, his former reason or cause of diuersity seemeth to me very vnworthy and vnfit to be alleadged by any Catholike, much lesse by a Diuine, which I euen for this cause haue much a doe to read without teares. For what? are we fallen into those times where in Bishops ought rather to be souldiors, then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: or to defend the law of God &amp; the Church rather by swords then by sermons? But he saith not so, may some say. What then? either he saith nothing, or all together some such thing. For his meaning is, that the difference of these and those former times, as touching the coertion of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17700:25"/>
Princes, consisteth in this, that then the Bishops ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue been fit to vndergoe Martirdome, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Princes into order. Which being so, who can not easily perceiue by his proper iudgement, and naturall logike that either this reason stands not vpon <hi>dissimilia,</hi> that is termes of vnlikenesse, or that is to be placed in the other part, which we haue set downe. And yet, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that there neuer time fell out since <hi>Constantine</hi> the great more opportune and more necessary for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to offer themselues to Martirdome. The lion euery where gapeth for his pray, the wolfe stands watching at the sheepfolds; most mighty Kings and Princes, many Nations and people, buckle themselues and arme against the flocke of Christ, and doth this man thinke, that the time doth not require, that the Bishops should not expose themselues to Martirdome, and lay downe their liues for the sheepe? what when the Church flourished, and was spread, thorough the whole world, the Bishops ought to hope and looke for nothing but Martirdome: and now, when matters are come to this passe, that the Church is grieuously tossed and tumbled, and as it were crouded into a corner of Europe, may the Bishops bend their mindes without all feare of danger to punish Princes and not rather to suffer Martirdome? what, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in these daies, they maintaine great traines and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and troopes of horse and foote, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their liues, and Persons, and by force and armes to deliuer the Church from the iniurie of so many Princes and people that spoile her? Or rather because now adaies, very few vndertake the Bishoprickes with that minde and condition that they should be encombred and vexed with those troubles either of minde or bodie, which good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors ought to suffer * <hi>in Persecutions and Confession of the Faith:</hi> but that they may passe their life with case and pleasure: and that they may aduance and magnifie their owne house and bloud by the goods of the poore and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie of Christ? Or lastly, because that being hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17700:26"/>
and mercenarie Pastors, they doe beleeue that it is very lawfull for them, when the Wolfe comes and teares the Flocke, to take their heeles, and to auoide Martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? I doe not bring forth these things to cast iniurie or enuie vpon the Ecclesiasticall order, which I euer reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and honoured from a child. Neither doe I doubt but there are many who doe keepe most carefully and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the flocke committed to them, being ready vpon all occasions euen with their bodies to defend the sheepe committed to their keeping, and with their bloud to seale the confession of Christ. But I speake all this in reproofe of the former answere, and with all to their shame, who now in euery place affect the dignities of the Church, without any purpose of life fit for the Church, but that they themselues may liue brauely and gallantly, and that they may consume that wealth, which the puritie of an Ecclesiasticall life doth well deserue, vpon vses either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, or surely not necessarie, very dishonestly and to the great scandall of the Church. <hi>O the times! O the manners of men!</hi> The greatest part of the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, within these hundred yeeres, or there abouts, is vtterly perished. Euen by this very meane that many Bishops and Priests, being more forward to armes then to Martirdome, haue vnaduisedly followed the meaning of the former answere: supposing forsooth that which was not so, that Heresie might easily bee oppressed by armes, while themselues in the meane time held their owne course of life, that is, cherished their owne former pleasure and slothfulnesse. <hi>Therefore they saw the Wolfe comming and fled away</hi> and many of them fled to the Wolues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. <hi>I speake no secrets now,</hi> Scotland and England are my witnesses, and other Countries which are slipped into* heresie, wherein although many resisted manfully, yet the <note place="margin">See the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Reader.</note> greatest part of the Church-men did not endure so much as the first assault, but presently in shamefull manner put in practise their treason and defection, partly that they might enioy the fauour to liue freely which was both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17700:26"/>
and permitted vnto them by the Nouators, partly, least that, they being depriued of all their present meanes, should fall to beggerie: whereas, if like those first Fathers in times past, they had bent themselues to Martirdome, they had in the very infancie destroied that most horrible Monster. It may bee, that the Author of that booke, wrote such things of a good minde, and without any fraud: but surely it cannot bee, that as the state of the Church affaires doth now stand, they should be thought to be of any weight or moment. For when as all the world almost, was bound to the catholike Church, <hi>velut nexu Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ipioque</hi> as the Ciuilians say, that is, by the straitest bands of seruice and dutie, euen then saith he were those times such, as wherein the Bishops ought to haue beene more ready to haue suffered Martirdome, then to haue enforced Princes to order: and now, when partly Infidels, partly Heretikes haue spread ouer all Asia, Afrike, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, one or two kingdomes onely excepted, and that the Church is reduced almost to so great straites as euer it was, he is not of the minde that the Bishops are required by the same necessitie to performe this dutie. But surely this is too much either negligence in searching, or indulgence in iudging and aduising; neither ought a learned man and a Diuine as the Author seemeth to be, to open to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church, who are as it were by a certaine storme caried into the same licence of liuing, I say to open them so easie a way to forsake their dutie, that they may suppose, that they ought not to be so ready in these daies to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome, as to raise warre against euill Princes, who it is certaine that without warres, they can neuer be reduced into order, and depriued of their kingdomes. How much righter were they (who whether they were the first of the Iesuites, or of some other Order, for I haue it onely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) presented themselues to the Cardinals at Rome, and euen as they passed in state according to the manner, did very sharpely reprooue their effeminatenesse, their ryot, &amp; their carelesnesse, because that the most turbulent tempest
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17700:27"/>
of the Lutherane heresie being risen a little before, that time taught the Prelates of the Church an other manner of life, and required other fashions at their hands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by these it is plaine, that the Author of the answere is much deceiued, in laying the reason of the difference in the dissimilitude of those ancient and these times, as far as concernes the dutie, state and condition of the Bishops and Prelates of the Church.</p>

            <p>THe other reason which he brings in, is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That the Church forsooth did not therefore beare with <hi>Constantius Valens</hi> and others, for that they lawfully succeeded in the Empire, no more than they did with <hi>Leo, Henrie,</hi> and <hi>Childerike,</hi> which no lesse lawfully succeed, <hi>but because she could not without hurt of the people correct them, these she could.</hi> For this is most false, and I woonder that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> followed this reason else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib</hi> 5 <hi>de Rom. Pont. ca.</hi> 7.</note>. I say, it is most false, that the Church could not coerce and chastise them as easily as these, I will not say more easily, and without the hurt of the people, whether she would haue attempted the matter by armes, or vse some policie, and the meane of some deuout person, for at this time the whole world was Christian, vnder <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> (as is euident by a letter of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, to the Church recorded by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,)</hi> and the greatest part of it orthodoxe: so as they wanted not strength to oppresse the Emperour, if they had held it lawfull or godly to take vp armes and contend against a lawfull Prince. And truely it is credible that God would honour with a victorie both easily and not very costly for bloud, his owne souldiers who should vndertake such a warre, not of hatred or ambition, but of a meere zeale to preserue the Church from ruine. Moreouer there was a great multitude of monkes in Egypt and Lybia, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable companie of other godly men of all sorts swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17700:27"/>
all ouer Asia and Europe: amongst whom no doubt there were many of no lesse zeale, then that wretch who murdered <hi>Henry</hi> the 3 king of France, but furnished with more knowledge and grace, whereby they prescribed a meane to inconsiderate, headlong and rash zeale. These men if it had beene lawfull, might easily haue dispatched the Emperour, without tumult of warre, and noyse of armes, and if so be the Church had had any power ouer him, they might haue put the same in execution, without any harme to the people.</p>
            <p>What should I speake of <hi>Iulianus</hi> the successor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius?</hi> Could not the Church thinke you chasten him without any harme at all to the people? when as being a shamefull Apostate, and such a one as neuer was found amongst Christians, he had his whole armie which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whether the Church seconded with so great power, had not been able with ease to take that Emperour away, without any harme of the people: especially seeing the Emperors were at that time created by the souldiers alone, who amongst those first times of Religion, and hope of Martyrdome, esteemed nothing more honorable, then to beleeue and obey their Prelates: deliuering to them the law and will of God. Now if they had learned in those Schooles of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17700:28"/>
most holy Fathers, that it was lawfull for the Church to depriue a wicked Prince of his gouernment, and that it is lawfull for such subiects to take away and murder such a Ruler, either by open force, or secret practise, there was nothing more easie for them then to depriue <hi>Iulian</hi> of his empire, or take away his life, and without any tumult, or danger, or publike losse to suffect an other at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his place. For now the right of nominating the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, was by long custome supposed to belong to the armie, as also in very deed, <hi>Iouinianus</hi> first, and after <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinianus,</hi> both confessors of Christ, after the death of of <hi>Iulianus,</hi> were both aduanced to the Empire by the same armie. Nay what will you say, that although the whole armie would not haue conspired against the enemy of Christ: yet those souldiers alone whom we mentioned out of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in our books <hi>De Regno</hi>

What may we thinke? that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of that time did heare the famous trumpets of the Gospel, <hi>Athanasius, Basilius,</hi> both the <hi>Gregories, Cyrillus, Epihanius, Hilarius, Hosius,</hi> and many other Bishops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in vertue and learning, who by reason of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning could not be ignorant what interest the Church had ouer Princes, and if they had knowen and vnderstood the same, by reason of their great sanctitie of life, and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in aduersitie, would not haue held their peace, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled the same, in so importunate a businesse to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17700:28"/>
Christian common-weale. What may wee thinke that those diuine Prelates taught the people, that there was no remedie against that Apostata, but in patience and teares? for so saith <hi>Nazianzenus.</hi>

               <hi>These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>did Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus intend,</hi> (he speaketh of those things which the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta meditated against the Church) <hi>as his minions and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his counsels did publish, notwithstanding he was restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the mercy of God, and the teares of the Christians, who were in great abundance, and by many powred out, when as they had this onely remedie against the Persecutors.</hi> I beseech you Reader, that you would obserue &amp; consider <hi>Nazianzenus</hi> well in this place. He affirmeth that the Christians, that is, the Church had no remedie besides teares, against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of <hi>Iulianus,</hi> when as notwithstanding it is certaine, that they had at their seruice the whole armie of <hi>Iulianus.</hi> Therefore surely this Pope, who for his singular excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, was called the Diuine, did not thinke that the Church hath any power ouer a most vngodly Emperour; to raise the Christian army against him: otherwise it were false, that Christians or the Church had no other remedie but teares against a persecutor: for they had an armie, which being commanded by the Church, would easily for the cause of God haue fallen away from <hi>Iulianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which we said of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Iulianus,</hi> that without great difficultie they might haue beene brought into order by the Church, and depriued of Scepters and life, without any harme to the people: the same is much more apparent in <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the yoonger. For the chiefe Commanders and Captaines of <hi>Valens</hi> his armie were good Catholikes, by whom hee managed all his warres, being himselfe an idle and slothfull Prince: and those were <hi>Terentius, Traianus, Arintheus, Uictor</hi> and others, who constantly professed the Catholike faith, and boldly vpbraided the Emperour to his face with his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and impietie against God: but in so religious a libertie they held their hands, neither did their heate and anger proceed beyond the bounds of admonition: because they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17700:29"/>
knew it was their dutie onely to tell the Prince his faultes, but not to punish the same. Therefore in all matters which belonged to temporall gouernment, they yeelded obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this heretike, whom they might easily haue remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to the great good of the afflicted Church, haue reduced backe againe the whole Monarchie to <hi>Ualentinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Catholike Prince, from whom it came. Could not these Commanders of his forces conclude a league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues, against their Prince, being an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, if it had beene lawfull for them so to doe? Was it not more profitable for the Church that an heretike Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should not gouerne Catholikes? Or did the Church all that time want learned and watchfull Pastors, and by that meanes either neglected or did not vnderstand her temporall interest? for what, which onely remaines to bee said, no age did euer beare Christians more obedience and dutifull to their Prelates, then that did: that if so bee the Church had wanted not the power to sway Princes in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, but the execution onely of that power, the people and armie would not haue beene long before they had deliuered her from the tyranny of <hi>Constatius, Iulianus,</hi> and <hi>Valens.</hi> To which, the worthy testimonie of S. <hi>August<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> giues faith, registred among the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <note n="h" place="margin">In Psal. 124.</note> 
               <hi>Iulianus</hi> (saith he) <hi>was an Infidel Emperour: Was he not an Apostata, vniust, an Idolater, Christian souldiers seruedan Infidell Emperour: when they came to the cause of Christ, they acknowledged none but him that was in heauen: When he would haue them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idols, to sacrifice, they preferred God before him. But when he said, draw foorth the Companies, get you against that countrey, presently they obeied. For they distinguished their eternall from the temporall Lord: And yet for their eternall Lord his sake, they were subiect euen to a temporall Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who doth not see in this place, that it was the easiest matter in the world for the Church euery maner of way to chastise <hi>Iulianus,</hi> if the had had any temporall power ouer him? For then the cause of Christ had come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, in which case the souldiers would preferre Christ
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17700:29"/>
before the Emperour, that is, the eternall Lord, before the temporall Lord, for the Churches cause is the cause of Christ. Therefore either the Bishops of Rome, or the Popes, and euen the whole Church, did then beleeue for certaine that they had no temporall iurisdiction in any sort ouer secular Princes, or surely they were wanting to their office, nor did they so carefully prouide for the flock committed to their charge, as now after many ages our last Popes haue done, who maintaine very earnestly that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a part of their Pastorall office, to chastise all Princes and Monarches, not onely for heresie or schisme, but also for other causes, and that with temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and euen to spoile them of their Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, if it shall please them. Whereas otherwise neither they are to be compared with those first Bishops for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life and learning, and the Christian people in these times is not so obedient, as in those first times they were. Wherefore if we loue the truth, we must confesse, that no man can either accuse or excuse the Bishops of both times in this point, without preuarication or calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation, the praise of each will turne to the dispraise of the other.

I omit that <hi>Maximus</hi> comes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into Italie with a great armie gathered out of the parts of Britaine and France, to prouide, as hee pretended, that Catholike religion should receiue no further harme: and that the Churches now corrupted by <hi>Ualentinianus</hi> might be restored to their former estate; the which also he signified by letters to <hi>Ualentinianus</hi> himselfe, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding was not his onely end: but (that which in our age hath beene practised by diuers) with this colour of Pietie he couered his burning desire of raigning, for he was determined hauing now killed <hi>Gratianus</hi> at Lyons, to inuade <hi>Ualentinianus</hi> his Empire.

Let the Aduersaries vnfould the memorie of all Records, and turne ouer and peruse as long as they will writings Ecclesiasticall and prophane, beleeue me they shall neuer finde that the Church in those times (wherein it was much more powerfull than now it is) did euer endeuour any thing to the mischiefe of Princes, although they were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or euer went about to disanull their gouernment, as hath beene plainly and plentifully prooued by vs in our bookes <hi>De Regno</hi>

            <p>But cleane contrary by these things which we read in the writings of the holy fathers, of the power of secular Princes, it is most certaine that all in that age did thinke that no temporall power did in any manner, nor for any cause appertaine either to the Bishop of Rome, or cheefe Bishop, or to the whole Church, but that for temporall punishments, they were to be left to the iudgement of God alone. And this as it seemeth was the cause, why those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did so seldome and that by the way make any men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the liberty and impunity of Princes: because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in those times there was no controuersie about it, but one iudgement of all men, which euen from the preaching of the Apostles they receiued in a manner by hand: that a Prince in temporalities hath God only his iudge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            </p>
            <p>I can call in more, and that very many to testifie the truth of this matter, but what needs any more? <hi>In the mouth of two or three witnesses, let euery word stand</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 18.</note>. If the assertors of the contrary opinion can bring forth so many testimonies of ancient fathers, or indeed but any one, wherein it is expresly written, that the Church or the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head thereof, the Bishop, hath temporall power ouer secular Kings and Princes, and that he may coerce and chastise them by temporall punishments any way ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly or indirectly, or inflict any penalty either to the whole Kingdome or any part of it: I shall be content, that the whole controuersie shall be iudged on their side without any appeale from thence. For indeed I desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much, as that a certaine meane might be found, by which the iudgement of the contrary side might be clearely confirmed. But while I expect that in vaine, in the meane time the truth caries me away with her, conquered and bound into the contrary part.</p>
            <p>Therefore I demand this now of the aduersaries: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be likely, that those ancient and holy fathers, who haue written of the great power and immunity of Kings and Emperors, were so negligent, that of very carelesnesse they did not put in mind the Princes of their time of this temporall power of the Pope, or that they left not this remembrance, if they made any, consigned vnder their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17700:32"/>
hands in writing. To the end that Princes should feare not only the secret iudgements of God, but also the temporall iurisdiction of the Church and Pope, by which they might be throwen downe from their seates, so oft as the Church or the Pope, who is the head thereof shall thinke it fit in regard of religion and the common weale? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be silent, and to haue concealed so great a matter, if it was true, was to abuse Kings and Princes, whom they had perswaded both by writings, and preachings, that they could be iudged by God only in temporall matters. Or shall we imagine, that they were so vnskilfull and ignorant of the authority of the Church, that they knew not that it was indued with such a power? Or in a word, that they were so fearefull, and narrow minded, that they durst not tell the Princes that which they knew? If none of these things can be imputed and charged on those ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why I pray you should we now embrace any new power which is grounded vpon no certaine either autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or reason, but in these last ages deuised, and thrust vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, by certaine fellowes, who are seru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Haue already plainly shewed that the last part of the second reason of the Aduersaries is most false: which is, <hi>That the Church therefore tolerated Constantius, Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Ualens, and other heretike Princes, because she could not chastise them without the hurt of the people.</hi> Now will I prooue, that the latter part is euen as false, to wit, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the IV.

If they knew not this before, let them learne now at the last out of this graue writer, that that is false which they igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly giue out for true: and I wish them to consider, and iudge vnpartially, if it had not been better for that <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Pope, should haue suffered the wils &amp; desperate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Henry</hi> like to <hi>Constantius, Iulianus, Valens,</hi> and other Emperours who vexed the Church, and with teares and praiers to intret the goodnes of God either for his recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or destruction, rather than by one insolent and strange act, and that very vnnecessary to stir vp so many schismes and murders, so many sackings of people and Cities, so many disgraces shamefull against the Sea Apostolike, so many warres against the Popes, and other furious Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with the destruction of all the people, and to nourish and continue these being stirred vp, to the exceeding mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of the Church.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17700:33"/>
good minde, (let <hi>God</hi> iudge of the intention) but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that he did it rightly, wisely, and according to dutie, nor but that he erred very wide, according to the manner and counsell of a man, when he assumed that to himselfe, which in truth was not his: that is to say, the office of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing an Emperour, and the power to substitute an other in his place, as though the fee of that humane kingdome had belonged to him, which that verse doth sufficiently declare, which is reported by <hi>Otto,</hi> and aboue is transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by vs.</p>

            <p>Therfore in my opinion, there was a great fault in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> about this businesse, because he did not obserue, that it belonged to the dutie of the cheefe Pastor, rather to let passe one mans wickednesse vnpunished, then tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a desire to correct the same, to wrap the innocent and harmelesse multitude in danger.

               <hi>Gregorie the VII.</hi> saith he, <hi>who then held the Bishoprike of the Citie of Rome, decrees, that the Emporour as one forsaken of his friends, should be shaken with the sword of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. The noueltie and strangenesse of this action did so much more vehemently affect the Empire already mooued with indignation, because before that time neuer any such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was knowen to haue been published against the Princes of the Romanes.</hi> Now he declares the iniustice and iniquitie of the fact, in diuers respects: First, because amongst those euils and mischiefes which did spring out of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Pope, he reckons the mutation and defection both of Pope and King: <hi>that Pope was set aboue Pope, as King aboue King</hi> by which wordes he shewes that both of them by a like right, or ratherby a like wrong was made, that as Pope was set vpon Pope by the Emperour vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so also was King vniustly set vpon King by the Pope. Then, in that he saith, <hi>Because therefore the kingdome in his Prince,</hi> &amp;c. what doth that imply other, then that by reason of the Empire violated in the Prince, the Church was violated in the Bishop, or else, for the kingdome woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Prince, the Church was wounded in the Bishop. Betweene which seeing he makes no difference of right or wrong, and both of them could not be done iustly, it followeth that hee thinketh both of them was done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly.</p>
            <p>Moreouer hee calleth as well the defection of <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> whom the Pope had created Emperour, as the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17700:35"/>
of <hi>Henrie</hi> his sonne of the Excommunicate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I say he calleth them both openly and simply plaine Rebellion, which surely he would neuer haue done, if hee had beleeued that <hi>Henry</hi> was lawfully depriued of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for there can bee no rebellion, but against a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therefore it could not be against an Heretike, who if he were justly depriued and deposed was no more a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. Therefore he thus writeth of Rodolphus <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>BY this, as I suppose, it is euident enough, that the Church in times past did not tolerate <hi>Constantius, Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Ualens,</hi> and other wicked Princes, because she then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted her might and strength; nor because she could not reduce them to order without the great hurt of the people: for indeed she might with more ease, and lesse hurt to the

Then not onely <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, from whose businesse so lasting a schisme did spring, but either <hi>Otho</hi> the fourth, or <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, or <hi>Philip Pulcher,</hi> or <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth, or <hi>Iohn Nauarre,</hi> or others, against whom the Bishops, being puffed vp with the successe of their affaires, drew foorth their Sentences of Excommunication and depriuation of Kingdomes, not for heresie, nor for the euill gouernment of State, nor at the request of the subiects, but euen infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and maliciously carried with their proper affections, I meane their priuate hatred. To conclude, not for that the state of the Church in that age would haue her Bishops more readie than in this time to suffer martyrdome: for then the Church was in very safe estate, and as we say, sailed in the hauen, as hauing been now anciently founded vpon the Apostolike constitutions, and sufficiently established by the labour and blood of martyrs. Yea, such then was the state of the Church, that there was much lesse need for Bishops to be readie for martyrdome, than at this time: for that so great a multitude, then being as it were sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fresh blood of the martyrs, did in a maner sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of nothing but martyrdome, that the Pastour was no lesse admonished of his dutie by the example of the flocke, than the seuerall persons of the people by the example of the Pastour.</p>
            <p>But now, ô lamentable case! the case is quite otherwise: the Church is tossed with most grieuous tempests, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ouerwhelmed as yet with the furie of heretikes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, euen of those who desire to be called Catholikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so affected, that they are not willing to suffer any great troubles, much lesse vndergoe death, for true religion: wherefore, that life and heat may be giuen to that luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse, and that men might be stirred vp to the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way, and as it were the shortest cut, for their health, who seeth not that there is need of Bishops, to shew the way both by word and example? and both to compose them themselues, and to exhort others rather to martyrdome,

For if this be not an act of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, as I may speake, I know not surely, what it is to be superior, or if to condemne a King vnheard, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him as farre as his regall dignity comes to, be not to be the Iudge of a King, we must confesse that no motion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a iudgement or of a Iudge hath beene deliuered and lest vs by our Elders. For in that they place the difference in the words, <hi>Directe &amp; indirecte,</hi> that belongs not to the power of iudgeing, and to the effect of the iudgement, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17700:39"/>
onely to the manner and way, of acquiring so great a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For the Canonists doe say, that the Pope hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued directly of Christ the temporal dominion of the whole world. But these men, I meane the Diuines, deeme that he receiued such a dominion directly, as if you should say, by it selfe, simply, and without consideration of another thing: but onely indirectly, that is, by consequence, in regard of that spirituall power, which he hath receiued directly from the Lord. Therefore this difference out of these words ought to be referred to the beginning and meane of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a temporall power but not to the force and effect of the same. For whether you say, makes nothing for the strength and power of the Popes iudgement ouer Kings: vnlesse peraduenture some may say, that the Pope if he be an ill man, may tyrannize ouer the Parsons and Estates of Kings more freely indirectly, then directly.</p>
            <p>But if the opinions of the aduersaries should take place, Christian Kings and Princes shall not only be Clients and Vassals to the Pope in temporalities, but that which is more base, they shall hold their Kingdoms and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as it were at his courtesie. And this I doe easily prooue euen out of the very principles and grounds of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. The Pope may take from any man his kingdome, and giue it to another, if so be that it be necessary for the health of soules: But to iudge and determine, if it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, belongs to the same Pope, of whose iudgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right or wrong, none can iudge, <note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>The Proposition in this argument, is the very opinion of the aduersaries: and the Assumption is without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie amongst all Catholikes: for none but an Heretike will deny that the charge of soules belonges to the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of Peter and Vicar of Christ. Lastly, the conclusion followes necessarily of the premisses because if the Pope wil transferre any kingdome from one to another, he may say that he iudgeth it necessary for the health of soules, and

that the Pope, should iustly exercise any temporall iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ouer secular Kings and Princes, vnlesse it be certaine that the same is giuen him either by the law of God or of Man. But neither in diuine, nor humane lawes is any such place found, which confers any such power vpon him, whereas on the contrary part, the domination and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of kings is openly commended and allowed by many testimonies of sacred Scriptures, as when it is said: <hi>By mee Kings raigne. All power is giuen to you. The Kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rule ouer them. The heart of the King is in the hand of God. I will giue them a King in mine anger.

            <p>Lastly, seeing this temporall power and Iurisdiction of the Pope, whereof we speake, is not found to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed neither in the expresse word of God in the Scriptures, nor by the tradition of the Apostles receiued as it were by hand, nor practised by vse and custome in the Church for these thousand yeeres and more, or exercised by any Pope: nor allowed and commended, nay not so much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ancient Fathers in the Church, I pray you what necessitie of faith should force vs to admit it? or with what authoritie can they perswade the same vnto vs? Our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion say they, is prooued by reasons and examples: how glad, say I would I be, that that were true. But wee ought chiefely to know this, that onely those reasons are fit to prooue this opinion of theirs, whereof euident proofes and demonstrations are made, which none of them hath hitherto brought, nor as I thinke could bring. For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching reasons onely probable, and likely, whereof Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike syllogismes doe consist, their force is not such, as can conclude and giue away from Kings and Princes their soueraigne authoritie from them, seeing that euen in daily brables about trifling matters, nothing can be concluded, vnlesse the Cause of the Suiter, bee prooued by manifest and euident proofes and witnesses: <hi>and therefore the Actor not proouing, he that is conuented, although himselfe performe</hi>

And therefore he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere, by his Pontificiall censure, to the great hurt of the Church to haue abolished all the writings of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, which do oppugne heresie with great <note n="*" place="margin">See the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Reader.</note> successe at this day: as the Fathers of that order, whereof <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was then, did seriously report to me. Which matter comforts me, if peraduenture, that which I would not, any Pope pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the like ambition shall for the like cause forbid Catholikes to read my bookes. Let him doe what he will, but he shall neuer bring to passe that I euer forsake the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, Apostolike, and Romish faith, wherein I haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from a Child to this great age: or dye in another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith then which was prescribed by <hi>Pius</hi> the 4.</p>
            <p>We will then bring their reasons hither out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for they are fiue in number: leauing others, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bozius</hi> his fancies, which are vnworthy that a man of learning should trouble himselfe to refute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:17700:41"/>
The first reason is, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> propounds in these wordes. <hi>The ciuill power is subiect to the spirituall power, when each of them is a part of the Christian common-wealth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a spirituall Prince may command ouer temporall Princes and dispose of temporall matters in order to a spirituall good, for euery superiour may command his inferiour.</hi> And least any peraduenture elude this reason by denying the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the next he labours to strengthen the same, by three reasons, or <hi>Media,</hi> as they call them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that ciuill power, not onely as Christian, but also as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is subiect to the Ecclesiastike, as it is such, first it is pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ends of them both, for the temporall end is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the spirituall end, as it appeares: because temporall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie is not absolutely the last end, and therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the felicitie eternall. Now it is plaine out of</hi> Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Lib. 1. Eth. cap. 1. <hi>that the faculties are so subordinate, as the ends are subordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Kings and Bishops, Cleargie and Laitie, doe not make two common wealthes, but one, that is one Church, for we are all one bodie.</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>and</hi> 1 Corinth. 12. <hi>But in euery bodie the members are connexed and depending one of another: but it is no right assertion, that spirituall things depend on tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; therefore temporall things depend of spirituall, and are subiect to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, if a temporall administration hinder a spirituall good, in all mens iudgement the temporall Prince is bound to change that manner of gouernment, yea euen with the losse of a temporall good: therefore it is a signe that the temporall power is subiect to the spirituall.</hi> Thus he.</p>
            <p>Which that I may satisfie in order, I answere: that it is very false, which in this first reason is thrust vpon vs, for a true, certaine, and sound foundation, false, I say, that the Ciuill power is subiect to the Spirituall, since both of them is a part of the Christian common weale: vnlesse they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it thus, that it is subiect in spirituals, and againe that this ought to be subiect to that in temporals, since these two powers are so parts of the Christian common-weale,

as neither hath authoritie ouer other; as which when they were free and of themselues absolute, out of a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue closed together. Therefore each of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth and reuerenceth the other in his order and office, and each doth exercise her function at her pleasure: only there is between them a certaine consent and fellowship conspiring in the conseruation and maintenance of the Christian common-weale: for by both the powers, or (to vse <hi>Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THerefore touching the first: I doe constantly deny, that there is any such ordination or subordination of the endes of their powers, so farre as their powers are such.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17700:43"/>
               <hi>hath her Princes, Lawes, Iudges, &amp;c. and likewise the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astike her Bishops, Canons, Iudgements. That hath for end a temporall peace; this eternall saluation.</hi> Neither doth this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power proceed further, and is referred to none other end, as it is such. For in that it aspireth to eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it hath not that of hir selfe: not I say so farre, as it is Politike doth shee direct hir indeuours thither, as to hir last scope: but in respect that shee is spirituall, or else is furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the societie and Counsels of the Ecclesiastike power, As appeareth by innumerable both peoples and Cities, in whom the Ciuill power was strong and powerfull by seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of lawes, although they had very slender or no notion at all of this euerlasting happinesse, whereof we speake. This also the Apostle declares <note n="a" place="margin">1. ad Titu:.</note> when he willes vs to pray for Kings, and all that are in authoritie, <hi>that we may liue a peaceable life in all pietie and chastitie:</hi> ascribing peace and tranquillitie of life to the Politike gouernment, but pietie and chastitie to Christian discipline. Therefore to speake in one word we must know, that the ends of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in the intention and not in the vnderstanding, that is to say, not that which the vnderstanding can inuent by discourse of reason, is the end of the Action, but that which the will doth desire to attaine by doing, while the minde meditates on the Action, that is the end of Action.

Wherefore so oft as the spirituall power, standeth in need of the assistance of the temporall sword; she is accustomed to intreat the fauour and friendship of the Ciuill power, her friend and companion. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that Ecclesiastike Princes and Prelates, are subiect to ciuill Princes in temporalities, and ought to obey them in all things, which belong to their ciuill gouernment, in no other manner, then the Ciuill are bound to obey them commanding spirituall things, so as they bee such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne neither the Catholike faith, nor good manners. Yea that not so much as the Pope himselfe, is excluded and free from this temporall subiection for any other reason, but because that by the bountie of Kings he hath been made a King himselfe, I meane a ciuill Prince, acknowledging no man for his superiour in temporalties, and thus much

               <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and most true, that all men ought altogether to obey the supe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riour power. But because power is twofold spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Ecclesiastike and Politike, of which one belongeth to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, the other to Kings: the Bishops must bee subiect to the Kings in temporall matters, and the Kings to the Bishops in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, as</hi> Gelasius <hi>the first in his Epistle to</hi> Anastasius, <hi>and</hi> Nicolaus <hi>the first in his Epistle to</hi> Michael. <hi>And because, the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>is not onely a chiefe Prince Ecclesiastike, to whom all Christians are subiect by the law of God, but is also in his Prouinces a Prince temporall, nor acknowledgeth any supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in temporalties; no more than other absolute and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes doe in their kingdomes and iurisdictions, hence it commeth to passe; that in earth he hath no power ouer him.</hi>

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe declareth excellently well; adding also a reason, secondly, <hi>for that Cleargie men, besides that they are Cleargie men, they are also Citizens, and certaine ciuill parts of the common wealth. Cleargie men,</hi> (saith he) <hi>are not any way exempted from the obligation of ciuill lawes, which do not repugne the sacred Canons, or the clericall dutie.</hi> And although he saith, that he speakes not of coactiue obligation, yet is it more true, that they may be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a temporall iudge to the obedience of the lawes, where the cause doth require, that in that case they should not enioy the benefit of their exemption, which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine enough, that they receiued from the lawes of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Princes.

            <p>Hence it is, I meane out of this society and fellowship of clerkes and laikes in the common weale, that in publike assemblies the Cleargie, if they be to consult of temporall affaires, doe fit in the next place to the Prince. Therefore spirituall power, (by the word of power, it is vsuall to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the persons, indued with power) doth both command and obey politike power, and the politike her againe. And this is that indeed, whereof <hi>B. Gregorie</hi> the Pope, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth <hi>Maurice</hi> the Emperor, <note n="*" place="margin">

And this course and vicissitude of obeying and commanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both the powers, is by a singular president decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <note n="e" place="margin">3. <hi>Reg cap</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Salomon,</hi> who feared not to pronounce <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Priest guilty of death, because he had a hand in the treason of <hi>Adoniah.</hi> For the story saith, <hi>The King also said to Abiathar the Priest. Goe thy waies to Auathoth, to thy house, and surely thou shalt die: but to day, I will not slay thee, because thou hast caried the Arke of the Lord, before Dauid my father, and hast endured trouble, in all those things, wherein my father was troubled. Therefore Salomon dismissed Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar, that he should not be a Priest of the Lord.</hi> Behold how <hi>Salomon</hi> shewes, that in a ciuill and temporall businesse he had authority ouer the Priests, whereas notwithstanding it is euident that in the old law the Priests were ouer the Kings, and vsed to command, and also to withstand them, in all things which belonged to the worship of God and the Priestly function.</p>

For in that place, there is no mention made, neither of any commandement specially giuen by the Lord, nor of any extraordinary power delegated vnto him, but rather the cleane contrary, <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe declareth openly enough, that he executed this iudgement as King accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary power of the gouernment which he en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And indeed the whole businesse was not spirituall or Ecclesiastike but temporall and politike only, wherein <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> knew very well that the King as King was the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ordinary iudge, and therefore we do not read, that by one interest he gaue iudgement vpon <hi>Adoniah,</hi> and by an other vpon <hi>Abiathar.</hi> Againe where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to strengthen his interpretation takes hold of those words, <hi>vtim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore such kind of words are wont to be added in the Scriptures, to shew the truth of the prediction and prophecie so as to draw an argument from hence to gather an other matter, must seeme very ridiculous and childish. Indeed <hi>Salomon</hi> in that case, was the executer of the diuine iustice. I allow it: he was a Prophet also, it is true, and what then? And yet we read that he did that, by his kingly authority, and common or ordinary power, and none, not the least men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17700:47"/>
made of any speciall commandement. Neither is there any place in Scriptures, where we may read that this iurisdiction, was by speciall name committed to him. Moreouer it is not likely, that the author of the story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inspired with the holy ghost, would without any touch or warning passe ouer so different causes of so great a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and of so great weight, if so be the King had passed his iudgement by vertue of one power and authority, against <hi>Adoniah</hi> being a lay person, and another against <hi>Abiathar</hi> a Priest.</p>
            <p>In like sort the same learned man is deceiued, when he saith. <hi>That it is no wonder, if in the old testament the soueraigne</hi>

               <hi>power, was temporall, in the new spirituall, because in the old testament the promises were only temporall, and in the new spirituall and eternall.</hi> For neither in the old testament was the soueraigne power altogether temporall, neither is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall in the new. But each in his owne kingdome, that is, in the iurisdiction of his owne power, as is most meet, did then beare sway, and at this time ruleth: euen then, say I, both of them contented with their owne precincts, abstained from that, which was not their owne, that neither the temporall power, inuaded the spirituall iurisdiction, and Priestly function, nor the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pressed vpon the temporall as in their owne right. Now that right which <hi>Salomon</hi> did shew at that time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Princes temporall ouer the Cleargie, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and retained by Kings in the new law and in the christian common wealth.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is plaine, that they conceiued too peruersly of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi> who affirmed that he vsurped any Iurisdiction ouer the Laikes, wheras they are to giue him very great thanks, that he was the first of the Emperours, who exempted the Cleargie, (being before that time altogether subiect to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrates) from secular iudgement in ciuill Causes. Which things being thus, it is plaine enough, that secular Kings and Princes, are indued with soueraigne power tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and that the Cleargie is subiect vnto them in Ciuill
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17700:49"/>
affaires. Otherwise truly, neither could Kings haue gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those priuiledges: nor holy and wise men, would haue prouided so ill for themselues and the whole Church, that being of them selues absolute and free, and loose from the bands of temporall power, would suffer themselues to be brought into Obligation for these manner of Courtesies and Priuiledges, for they plainly acknowledged that they were in their power and iurisdiction, by whom they could be endowed with such a manner of libertie, for that cannot be loosed and exempted, which was not bound or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before. Besides, the Princes thorough out the world, were at that time of so great pietie and deuotion, that if they had either found out by themselues, or vnderstood by the Bishops or Princes of the Priests, that by the law of God, the Clerikes were free from secular Iurisdiction, they would forthwith haue prouided and enacted lawes and Edicts for the same, nor haue challenged any title or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest either to their persons or goods. For if out of an only zeale of deuotion they gaue away so frankely and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusely, euen those things which they conceiued to be their owne, how much more would they haue abstained and held their hands from those things which by no title or right were due vnto them.</p>
            <p>Therefore the exemptions and priuiledges, which chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes haue granted to Ecclesiastike persons, for honor and reuerence vnto them, do sufficiently declare, yea conuince, that those Princes are greater then all Priests in temporall power, nor that the chiefe Bishop and Prince of Priests, and euen the Vicar of Christ is exempted for other reason, and reputed as a priuiledged person, but that he is a temporall Prince also, and sustaines a two fold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the one of <hi>Peters</hi> succession in the gouernment of the Church, the other of asecular Prince in a temporall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which he hath receiued by the liberality of other Princes.</p>

Therefore as before the law of Christ men were subiect to Emperours and Kings, so also they were after. But when Princes became Christians, and of their accord receiued the lawes of the Gospell, presently they subiected themselues to the President of the Ecclesiastike Hierarchy, as sheepe to the Pastor and members to the head, and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ought to be iudged by him, and not to iudge him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an exceeding great fault in disputing, to take those things which are enunciated of any one subiect, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cause: or are remoued from one subiect for a certaine cause, and to attribute or detract them to, or from another thing diuers and vnlike, and to which the same cause doth not agree: or indistinctly and confusedly to shuffle those things together in the conclusion, which ought to be seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and parted by some distinction. Which fault who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plainely deprehend, in this former reasoning of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine?</hi> in which that is indefinitly and generally concluded of both the kindes of power and iudgement, which ought truly and rightly to haue beene enunciated of one of them alone.</p>
            <p>For that Princes conuerted to Christ, <hi>submit themselues as sheepe to the Pastor, and members to the head,</hi> that cannot without wilfull cauill be vnderstood but of Spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection: since they were not made his children or sheepe in other respect, then for that they were by the same spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in Iesu Christ, and gouerned by the faith of the Church. Therefore in all matters, which belong to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17700:50"/>
iurisdiction, it is true that they ought to be iudged by him, and not he by them. But this submission what is it to Ciuill iudgement and temporall iurisdiction? Was it fit to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>I pray you tell me, when <hi>Constantinus Magnus</hi> came to the Church, did the Romane Empire, which before his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was his, did it by and by passe into the hands and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Siluester</hi> the Pope? and the Emperour, who was a man that affected glory so much, did he acknowledge the temporall power of that Pope ouer him?

But it must appeare that Princes wittingly and knowingly did descend and giue themselues into the dition and authoritie temporall of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17700:50"/>
Pope; or we must confesse, that as much as concerned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignitie, they remained after Baptisme in the same power and condition, wherein they were before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued holy imitation of Christianitie, for as he witnesseth himselfe, <hi>the law of Christ depriues no man of his right and peculiar fee.</hi> But before they gaue their name to Christ, <hi>of right and in fact,</hi> as he saith, they exercised ciuill authoritie ouer the Pope, and might lawfully iudge him in temporall Cases: therefore they might likewise doe it lawfully after Baptisme. Which if it be so, it cannot be by any meanes, that they should be iudged by him in temporall matters, seeing it is impossible, that any man should bee superiour and inferiour in the same kind of authoritie, and in respect of one and the same thing. It is true that those christian Princes, for the reuerence they bare not onely to the Pope, but also to all other Bishops, yea and Priests also, did very seldome put that iudgement in practise: But this argues a want of will onely, and not of power also. Wherefore as a Consul or President when he yeelds himselfe to adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, transferres none of those rights, which belong to him by his office, into the familie and power of his adoptiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither can transferre them, but reserues them all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to himselfe; so Princes in the beginning hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered themselues into the spirituall adoption of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastike Hierarchie, could by that act loose none of those things, which belonged to the right of a kingdome, and their publike ciuill estate: for that the nature of these powers is deuided, so as although being yoaked and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together they did very htlv and handsomely frame together in the same christian Common-wealth: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them as it is such, is subiect or master to the other, and neither doth necessarilie follow and accompanie the other, but each may be both obtained, and also lost or kept without the other.</p>

            <p>In the very same manner the Pope, who is the spirituall father of all Christians, by his fatherly Ecclesiastike power as the Vicar of Christ doth command Kings and Princes, as well as the rest of the faithfull: and in that respect, if Kings commit any thing against God or the Church, he may sharply chastise them with spirituall punishments, cast them out of the house and family of God, and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit them of the kingdome of heauen (most fearefull and terrible punishments for christian hearts to thinke on) because all these things are proper to his fatherly power spirituall.

               <hi>he, who in the time of Henry the second were appointed by the common consent of all the Almans, and others who were subiect to the Empire, haue a radicall power from that common consent of all men, who might by the law of nature constitute an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ouer them: not from the Bishop of Rome, who hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to giue a King or Emperor to any Prouince in the world, without the consent of the same.</hi> The same Cardinall, being himselfe, both a great Diume and Philosopher, addeth many other things in that place, by which he confirmes our distinction and declares, that Emperors and Kings are both ouer and vnder the Popes.

            <p>THe second reason followes, which is concluded by two fould arguments. <hi>The second reason,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Ecclesiastike Common-weale ought to be perfect, and in it selfe sufficient in order to her end. For such are all Common-weales, rightly founded: therefore ought shee to haue all power necessary to attaine her end. But the power to vse and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of temporall matters, is necessary to this Spirituall end: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise wicked Princes might with impunity nourish He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and ouerturne religion: therefore shee hath this power also. Againe, euery Common-wealth, because it ought to be perfect and sufficient in it selfe, may command another Common-wealth, which is not subiect to it, and constraine it to change the Gouernment, yea euen to depose hir Prince, and to appoint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when it cannot otherwise defend it selfe, from hir in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inries: therefore much more may the Spirituall Common-weale command the Temporall Common-weale, being subiect to hir, and force it to change the Gouernment, and to depose the Princes and appoint others, seing she cannot otherwise maintaine hir Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that heere are so many faults in this place, as it seemeth that the Author did either idlely and carelesly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17700:52"/>
transcribe all this out of some other, or if it be all his owne, that he did not very well remember those things, which he had said before. For a little before, when as he laboured by another argument to prooue, that the Ciuill power is subiect to the Ecclesiastike, he affirmed that these powers were parts only of one Common-wealth, and that they did constitute only one Common-wealth. <hi>The first reason,</hi> saith he, <hi>is thus: The Ciuill power is subiect to the Spirituall power, because each of them is a part of the same Christian Common-wealth.</hi> And againe, <hi>secondly Kings Bishops, and Clerikes and Laikes do not make two Common-wealthes but one.</hi> But in this place he quite changes these two Powers into two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealthes, which therefore ought to be so seuered and disioyned, as that Kings and Laikes doe make a Politike and Temporall Common-wealth: Bishops and Clerikes a Spirituall or Ecclesiastike: then which nothing could be spoken more absurdly or vnfitly for the present purpose. For either he speaketh in this place of an Ecclesiastike po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which is wholy seuered from the Ciuill power, as it was once in the time of the Apostles, and now is in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where Christians laie amongst Heathen and Infidesl: in which case it is euident that the Power or Common-wealth Ecclesiastike, as he calles it, or the Prince and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch thereof hath no authority at all, not so much as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ouer the Ciuill Prince: because he is not a child of the Church. <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>ad Corin.</hi> 5.</note> Or he speakes of the power Ecclesiastike ioyned with the Ciuill, as in a Christian Common-wealth, and then hee doth wrong to make hir two Common-wealthes, one Ecclesiastike and the other Politike, when as they be onely two powers of one Christian Common-wealth, and parts and members of one Church and Misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Christ, as himselfe deliuered before.</p>
            <p>Further it is fals which he assumes. That the power to vse &amp; to dispose of temporall matters, is necessary to a spiritual end, &amp;c. For the Prince of the Apostles himselfe openly teacheth, that he had no such manner of authority ouer the temporalities of Christians except those, which themselues
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17700:53"/>
of their owne accord, did confer and offer to the Church, when he saith, <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou shouldest lie to the holy Spirit, and defraud of the price of the field? Whilest it remained, did it not belong to thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sould was it not in thy power?</hi> If the Apostles had had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to dispose of the temporalties of Christians, <hi>Peter</hi> sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had not said, <hi>Did it not?</hi> &amp;c. and when as <hi>Ananias</hi> might presently haue replied: yes, you had power to dispose of my goods, and therefore fearing least you would take from mee more then was cause, I concealed part of the price. But because the Church had not this power, therefore without cause did he lye to the holy Ghost. And how, if out of this foundation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it should follow, that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church had not all necessarie power to attaine vnto her end? for, for the space of 300 yeeres and more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she liued vnder heathen Princes, after the passion of Christ, she neuer had this power to dispose of Christians temporalties: in which time notwithstanding, it is most certaine, that an infinite multitude of men and almost the greatest part of the world, had giuen their names to Christ, and that a more seuere and strict discipline raigned in the Church, then at any time beside, that it is impious to say, that the Church was not then furnished with all necessarie meanes of Right and of Fact to attaine her end, <hi>for the workes of God are perfect.</hi> And surely he should doe Christ no small iniurie, who thinkes that the Church is by him left and deliuered to the Apostles, destitute of necessarie meanes for her preseruation. Whatsoeuer was necessarie for the Church to attaine her end, was abundantly and plentifully bestowed by Christ on his Apostles when he said: <hi>Ego dabo vobis os, &amp; sapientiam, cui non poterunt resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere, &amp; contradicere omnes aduersarij vestri</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk</hi> 21.</note>. Therfore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer conceiues that Christ recommended his Church to <hi>Peter,</hi> and willed him thrice to feede his Lambes and Sheepe, and supposeth that for the feeding of those sheepe, and to the accomplishing of the end of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did not grant them all things necessarie both in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17700:53"/>
Right and in Fact, hee seemes to me no better then an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and to doubt of the prouidence, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God. Let vs imagine that he did not giue all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er necessarie for the execution of so great a charge; can any other reason why he did not, be assigned, then for because either the Lord knew not what was needfull, or had no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in him to giue it, or (which is a point of extreame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,) he meant to deceiue his seruants and friends, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning that dutie vnto them, which hee knew very well that they were neuer able to performe. By these things, it is cleare, that the temporall authoritie and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Princes, is no way necessarie for the Church to attain her end: although in humane consideration, it may seeme sometimes to be profitable. For God, who <hi>hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise, and hath chosen the weake things of the world, to confound the strong</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note>, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Church only stood in need of spirituall armes, did so from the beginning furnish her with them, that she ouercame all humane power and might, so as it might be said truly: <hi>a Domino factum est illud &amp; est mirabile in oculis nostris</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 117.</note>. S. Bernard writeth excellently, (as hee doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,) to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note>: <hi>This is</hi> Peter, <hi>who was not at any time knowen to walke clad in silkes, or adorned with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, not couered with gold, nor caried on a white steed, nor waited on with a guard of souldiers, nor compassed with troups of seruants attending on him: and yet he thought that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these, that wholesome Commandement might be discharged</hi> Siamas me, pasce oues meas: <hi>heerein thou hast succeeded not to</hi> Peter <hi>but to</hi> Constantine. Therefore although the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power whereof we speake, may seeme to men to be necessarie for the Church, yet to God it seemed neither necessarie, nor profitable, peraduenture for that reason, which the successe of matters and experience it selfe hath taught the posteritie, least the Apostles and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors trusting on humane authoritie, should more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently intend spirituall matters, and should chiefly place their hope in armes and in a temporall authoritie and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17700:54"/>
might, which they ought to settle in the power of the word of God and in his singular helpe. And indeed if a man would take a view in Storie of the state of the Church from the passion of Christ to this day, he shall see, altogether that she grew very soone, and flourished very long, vnder Bishops that were content with their owne authoritie, that is, with spirituall iurisdiction: who being the Disciples of the humilitie of Christ, iudged, that the onely strength to defend the Church, did consist in the power of preaching the Gospell, and the diligent obseruation of Ecclesiastike Discipline, without any mention of temporall power. And againe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om the time that certaine Popes went about to annex and adioine a soueraigne temporall gouernment to that spiritual soueraigntie which they had, that the Church decased euery day, both in the number of beleeuers, and behauiour and vertue of gouernours; and that same seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ancient discipline being either remitted, or to speake more truely, being omitted, that many Ministers of the Church discharged their places more slothfully and carelesly then before.</p>
            <p>I omit that if these mens reasons were good it would follow by contraries: that the temporall common wealth, as they speake, hath power to dispose of spirituall matters, and to depose the soueraigne Prince of the Ecclesiastike common wealth: <hi>because, It ought to be perfect and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in it selfe, in order to her end, and to haue all power necessary to attaine to her end:</hi> But the power to dispose of spirituall matters, and to depose the Prince Ecclesiastike is necessary to the temporall end, because otherwise wicked Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Princes, may trouble the state and quiet of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall common wealth, and hinder the end of the ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as indeed diuerse Popes haue been causes of much vnquietnesse. Therefore the temporall Common-wealth hath this power. The consecution is vtterly false and absurd, (for a temporall Prince, as he is such a one hath no spirituall power) and therefore the other is false too, to which this by analogie is a consequent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:17700:54"/>
But as we vse to speake, <hi>dare absurdum non est soluere ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum:</hi> Therefore I doe answer otherwise to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this second reason. That here be not two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales as he supposeth, but one only, wherein there be two powers, or two Magistrates: the Ecclesiastike and the Politike, whereof each hath those things, which he doth of necessity require to attaine his end: the one his spirituall, the other his temporall iurisdiction: and that neither this iurisdiction is necessary to that power, nor that for this. Otherwise we must confesse, that each power is destitute of her necessary meanes, then when they were seuered, as sometimes they were: which I haue already shewed to be very false, as well out of the end of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or ciuill gouernment, at it is such <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Su. c.</hi> 14.</note>, as by the state of the Church, being established vnder heathen and infidell Princes <note n="i" place="margin">Sum hoc Capite.</note>. According to this manner, in one and the same ciuill policie I meane, in one City or kingdome, many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are found inuested with diuerse offices, power and authority, who gouerne the common weale committed to them in parts, euery one of whom receiueth from the King or common wealth necessary power to attaine the end of their charge, so as none of them may or dare, inuade and arrogate to themselues, the iurisdiction and rule of an other. If the Consuls want any part of the Tribunes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, or the Tribunes any of the Consular iurisdiction, it can not be said therefore, that both haue need of an others power to compasse their ends: for each office according to the ground of the first institution is perfect and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with all necessary authority for the execution of his charge.</p>
            <p>Or to bring forth more known examples. As in one kingdome and vnder one King there are two great offices, whereof the one the Chancellor, the other the Constable hath by commission from the King, (the one hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the speciall charge of the law and iustice, the other the managing of armes, and the gouernment of all military discipline committed to him,) and each of them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17700:55"/>
according to the quality and condition of his office is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and receiueth from the King all authority necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the execution of his charge, and the compassing of his end. Neither, if peraduenture one of them either of negligence or iniury doe hinder the course of the other, may he that is so hindred by his proper authority disanull his office, or vsurpe his iurisdiction, or to be short enforce him to amend his fault, but by lawfull meanes granted him by commission from the King: but it is requisite that each complaine to the King of others abuse, of whom they haue receiued their authority so distinguished in offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and function, that he may right him that is wronged and determine by his owne power and iudgement the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the whole cause. Now so long as these officers doe agree in the kingdome, the one maintaines an others authority, and vseth of his owne to supply that which is wanting in the other.</p>
            <p>But if a Country-man, to auoid iudgement of law doe depart into the Campe to the Army, the aide of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall at armes being required, he is wont to be sent backe to the place, from whence he fled: and of the contrary, if one that forsakes his Coloures shall slip into the City, the City Magistrate being requested by the Magistrate at armes, will by and by see him conueighed to the Campe to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for his misdemeanour. But where they doe disagree, they giue those wounds to the Common-wealth, which the Prince onely can helpe and cure: because it is not lawfull for them to vse another mans authority, and is fitting for the one onely to meddle in matter of armes, and for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with matter of iustice. In the same manner two soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Magistrates of the Christian Common-wealth, the King and the Pope, doe receiue from the common King and Lord of all, the great God of Heauen and Earth; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers power, each perfect in his kind, and gouerne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by different iurisdictions and offices. And these sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so long as they agree together in concord of mindes, doe naturally assist one another, to the maintenance and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17700:55"/>
conseruation of each power and authority, so as both the Ecclesiastike power, doth with the Heauenly and Spiritual sword, strike such as be seditious and rebellious subiects to their secular Prince, and in requitall the power Temporall and Politike doth with an armed hand, pursue Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and others falling from the faith, or otherwise cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues stubbornly toward their holy Mother the Church, and doth sharply chastice them with temporall punishments and ciuil corrections: and Mulctes. But when they are rent into contrary factions, and oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues one against the other, the whole Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth either wholly fales to ground, or at least is most greeuously wounded: because there is none but God alone, who can lawfully deuide that cause, and redresse the wrong offred of either side.</p>

            <p>BEing desirous to passe on to other matters, I was a little staide, by a doubt which did arise touching the sense of the late argument of the second reason, which was conceiued by the author in these words. <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. proximo sum.</note> 
               <hi>Also euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, because shee ought to be perfect and sufficient in hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, may command another Common-wealth, not subiect to hir, and inforce hir to change her gouernment, yea also to depose hir Prince, and to ordaine another, being shee cannot otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend hirselfe from hir iniuries.</hi> For to confesse the truth, when I first read these words in him, I paused awhile, that I might throughly vnderstand the meaning of these words, and what the moment and waight of this argument might be. For he seemed not plainly and expresly to approue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did lay open to vs certaine meanes of forceing a Neighbour Common-wealth, and deposing the Prince thereof. And when I had a long time skanned and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same, I resolued that either it was a riddle, or that his words doe admit this sence and interpretation. Euery Common-weale may denounce and wage a iust war against
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17700:56"/>
another Common-wealth, which beares both hatred and armes against her, when as she cannot otherwise deliuer hir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe from hir iniurie, and if shee be the stronger may by force and armes force hir to conditions of peace: and if she suppose that by that Caution shee hath not yet prouided sufficiently for hir security (because peraduenture shee hath to do with a people that is by nature false and treacherous) may reduce the whole Country into her power and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and giue her lawes and orders, remooue hir Prince, take away hir authority, and at hir pleasure alter the whole administration of the Common-wealth into another form. But if this be the true sense of these words, as I suppose it is, that argument surely was to small purpose brought of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> for that is not gathered from hence, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes forsooth. <hi>Much more may the Spirituall Common-wealth, command the Temporall Common-wealth, being subiect vnto hir, and force hir to change hir administration, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Princes, and ordaine others, &amp;c.</hi> Because in this case there be not two Common-wealthes, but onely one Christian, resting on two powers, whereof neither is subiect to other, as we haue aboue sufficiently demonstrated: as also, for that if we grant, that they are two Common-wealthes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, the Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall, and the Temporall, he must of force confesse, that in the one all Bishops and Clerikes only are comprised, in the other all secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Laikes; or that this is compounded of onely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastikes, that of onely Laikes. For although the Laikes and Clerikes together, doe constitute one Church and one christian Common-weale, yet they doe not make together one Ecclesiastike and spiritual Common-wealth, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the temporall: nor one temporall and secular Common-wealth, but according to the diuision and separation aboue named, the Laikes make the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the Ecclesiastikes the spirituall: in the case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the temporall is distinguished from the spirituall after this manner. But now seeing the Ecclesiastike common-wealth, containes onely Clerikes, whose weapons ought
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17700:56"/>
to be none other, but Praiers and Teares, how can it be, that she being weake and vnarmed can compell (but by Miracle) a temporall Common-weale armed, to change the manner of her administration?</p>
            <p>Therefore there is nothing more fond then this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison and consequution of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> since in reasoning he proceeds: from Common-wealthes well prouided for exercise and furniture of armes, to Common-wealthes, the one whereof is vtterly disfurnished of armes. For as oft as one State either repelleth the iniuries, which another would offer, or reuengeth them, being offered, she fighteth with those armes, which are allowed her, and which by law of armes she may vse: that is to say, Corporall and Visible, by force whereof she ouerturnes the bodies of her enemies, inuades their holds, battereth townes, and ouerthrowes the whole state of the enemie Common-wealth. But the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Common-weale, which he calles, is quite destitute of this kind of armes, and because it is composed of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes onely, it is lawfull for her, to fight with spirituall armes onely, which are, Prayers and Teares, <hi>for such are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of Priests: in no other manner neither ought they, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they resist</hi>

How then can the spirituall Common-wealth constraine the temporall Common-wealth, which contemnes the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thunder-boltes, that she should change the manner and forme of her <hi>Administration or depose her Prince, and ordaine another?</hi> Now if any peraduenture doe propound, that the Ecclesiastike Common-wealth should bee assisted in the execution of so great a matter, by the humane forces of secular men, (for Princes and all other Christians ought to be Nurses and defenders of the Church) he will be answered out of hand, that in that case the Ecclesiastike Common-wealth, doth not constraine the temporall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, but is onely the Cause, wherefore an other State temporall, by whose helpe that spirituall one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and protected, doth reuenge the wrong done vnto
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17700:57"/>
the Church. In no other manner than if the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth should reuenge an iniurie or a slaughter recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the person of one Citizen.

To vse few wordes: although we grant them their comparison and conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there can nothing bee made of it, but that the Pope hath such a power to dispose of temporall matters of Christians, and to depose Princes, as either the King of <hi>France</hi> is knowen to haue ouer the <hi>English, Spaniards,</hi> or other neighbour people, who doe him wrong, or any of these vpon the State and Kings of <hi>France,</hi> if they haue offended them, which power in what manner, and of what proportion it is, can onely be determined and decided by the sword.</p>

            <p>THese although they may suffice for the refuting of the second reason, yet least in these writings of this most learned man, I should passe ouer any thing, which because it is either vntouched, or negligently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, might beget any error, or cast any scruple into the Reader, it is a matter worth the paines to examine and sift, what that might be which for the strengthning of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he brings out of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> in the bookes <hi>de Consid. ad Eugen</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3</note>. Bernard indeed aduiseth that the materiall sword is to be exercised by the souldiers hand at the becke of the Priest and commandement of the Emperour, which we surely confesse, for warres both are vndertaken more iustly, and discharged more happily, when the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call holines doth agree &amp; conspire with kingly authoritie. But we must note, he attributeth only to the Priest a Becke, that is, the consent and desire to wage warre; but to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the commandement and authoritie. Whereby it is euident, that hee speaketh in no other respect, that the Materiall sword belongeth to the Church, then for that in a Christian estate, although the authoritie and command for warre be in the power of Emperours, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet warres are with more iustice waged, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Ecclesiastike power comes in, which being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the spirit of God, can more sharpely and truly iudge between right and wrong, godly, or vngodly. But what if the Emperour will not draw his sword at the becke of the Priest? nay what if he shall draw it against the Priests beck and assent? doth <hi>S. Bernard</hi> in this case giue to the Priest any temporall power ouer the Emperour? (for this is it which we seeke in this place, and whereon our whole dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation turneth) surely none at all. But he rather teacheth, that none belongeth to him, whenas he saith, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall sword, (by which sword the soueraigne power tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall is signified) may not bee exercised by the Church:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17700:58"/>

            <p>If these of <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> bee true, it can by no meanes be, that the Pope should with any right exercise temporall power vpon the Emperour, or other secular Princes: for it cannot be exercised but by the sword, and the sword cannot be by the souldier drawen, but by their commandement: and so this temporall power, would prooue vtterly vaine and vnprofitable in the person of the Pope, when as the execution thereof should bee denied him.

and defended from iniury.</p>
            <p>But because we are fallen into this notable place of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> I would wish the reader by the way, diligently to consider with me, that which I know not, whether any hath obserued heretofore. What is the reason that he, writing to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope of the temporall sword, first saith, <hi>tuo forsitan nutu, etsi non tua manu cuaginandus.</hi> Then a few lines after, doth adde, that the same sword is to be vsed <hi>nutu sacerdotis:</hi> and addes not <hi>forsitan?</hi> Doth that same, <hi>forsitan,</hi> either abound in the former sentence, or faile in the latter: The truth is, that the godly and wise man did it of purpose: that he might with some finenesse distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the person of the Pope, from the pontificall or sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall authority and office, and teach, that it importeth very much, whether the Pope or <hi>Eugenius,</hi> although both Pope and <hi>Eugenius</hi> were the same, doe bid or forbid any thing. I meane whether the Pope, as a man obnoxious to the perturbations of the mind, would haue the sword drawen, not for the Church according to the duty of his function: but by the instigation of a corrupt affection: or as a Priest, that is, a good and holy man, doe command or refuse that the sword should be drawen and war waged, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not his owne turne, but the profit of the Church. As if he should say ô <hi>Eugenius,</hi> cheefe Bishop, the temporall sword is not absolutely and simply to be drawen at thy commandement, but peraduenture; euen then, when as for the euident commodity of the Church, you shall aduise them with wise and sound counsell who haue the sword in their power: but not then, when as out of the desire you haue, either to practise ancient enmity with any, or to powre out any new conceiued hatred, or to satisfie any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious desire to rule, you shall purpose to set christian Kings, and people by the eares, or to wage and bring any was upon them. <hi>For that is a point of a Priest, this of a Man.</hi> For that is a meditation and action of a Priest, this of a man; that of a Bishop, this of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> or some other that holds the Bishops sea. That this was <hi>S. Bernards</hi> meaning
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17700:60"/>
in those words, the actions of certaine Bishops who haue beene beyond measure transported with anger and pride, haue plainly declared. But let vs returne to our purpose.</p>

and Dignitie, is indeed to forbid that no man should stand to his iudgement. Therefore the Church hath not that power. And let any man, who will, peruse all Stories, he shall finde no where, that euer the Church assumed to her selfe that authoritie, to iudge Princes infidell or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.

                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 29.</note> that the Apostles and all other Christians were as well subiect to heathen Princes, in all Ciuill causes, as other men, his words are these: <hi>I answere first it might be said that</hi> Paul <hi>appealed to</hi> Caesar, <hi>because indeed hee was his Iudge, although not of right, for so doth</hi> Iohn de Turrecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata <hi>answere:</hi> lib. 2. cap. 96. summae de Ecclesia. <hi>Secondly, it may be said and better, with</hi> Albert Pighius lib. 5.

Ecclesi. cap. 7. <hi>that there is a difference betweene Heathen and Christian Princes: for when the Princes were heathen, the Bishop was not their Iudge, but cleane contrarie, he was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to them in all ciuill Causes, no lesse then other men, for it is plaine that the Bishop was not Iudge of them: because he is not a Iudge but of the faithfull</hi> 1. Cor. 6. What haue I to doe, to iudge of them which are without. <hi>And that of the contrarie he is ciuilly subiect to them, both of right and indeed, as it is plaine. For the Christian law depriueth no man of his right and dominion, Therefore euen as before the law of Christ men were subiect to Emperours and to Kings: so also after. Wherefore</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>euery where exhort the faithfull, to be subiect to Princes, as appeareth,</hi> ad Rom. 13. ad Titum 3. &amp; 1.

            <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
            <p>I Said that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vsed a threefold argument for the confirmation of his third reason: which is, <hi>That it is not lawful for Christiant to tolerate an Infidel or Heretike King,</hi> whereof I haue already noted the faults of the first. Now we must examine in this and the next Chapter what maner of arguments they are, and what strength they haue. Therefore the second argument is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To tolerate an Infidell or Heretike King, labouring to draw men to his sect, is to expose religion to manifest danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christians are not bound neither indeed ought they to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate an infidell King with the manifest danger of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for when there is difference and contention between the law of God and the law of Man: it is a matter of Gods law to keepe and obserue the true faith and religion, which</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:17700:67"/>
               <hi>is one onely, and not many: but it is a point of mans law, that we haue this or that King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these things I answer, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others from whom he had these, doe not reason rightly, nor according to arte, but doe propound two arguments together confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly and commixtly without forme. For, for that which he assumes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christians are not bound, yea they ought not, without euident danger of religion, to tolerate an Infidell King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Insteed whereof should haue beene placed in good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike this Assumption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christians are not bound, yea they ought not to expose religion to euident danger:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Conclusion might follow thereof:</p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>It is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate an Infidell or Heretike King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the assumption which he setteth downe is almost iust the same, with the Proposition that is in question. But to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him somewhat, let vs grant that he hath fall ioned and disposed his Reason in excellent good forme, and let vs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the force of the argument. I say then that his Proposition is false. I say againe, that it is not true that, <hi>To tolerate an Heretike or Heathen King, endeuouring to draw men to his sect, is to expose Religion to manifest danger.</hi> But it is onely to suffer Religion to lie in danger into which it is fallen by the fault of an Heretike or Infidell King, to which it is now exposed without the fault of the people: seeing now the people hath no iust and lawful remedy left them to deliuer Religion, but onely Constancy and Patience. And this can not be imputed as a fault to Christians, vnlesse we will by the same exception sharply accuse all those ancient fathers and Christians, who did without any shrinking or tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, or without the least token of rebellion submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey <hi>Constantius, Iuliaenus, Valens,</hi> and other renouncers of Christian religion, because they came lawfully to the Empire, and whom they might most easily haue remooued
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17700:68"/>
or deposed, they honoured them with all honour, duty and reuerence, euen because they were their Emperours and Kings. These holy fathers then, and worthy Christians in that age, did tolerate Heretike and Infidel Kings, although if we onely looke at their temporall strength, they were furnished with excellent meanes and opportunities to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them: and yet none that is in his wits will euer say that they exposed Religion to most euident danger, thorow that manner of Christian patience and tolerancy. Now I speake of tolerating that King, who either being a Heathen is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Heathen, where Christians doe not rule: or who when he was admitted and enstalled into his Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was accounted a Christian. For to elect a King ouer themselues, no law nor religion enforceing, whom they know to be either an Heretike or an Infidell, is indeed to expose Religion to most euident danger, and in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, it were a greeuous sinne in the Christians: and they that doe it, are worthy miserably to perish therefore.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Why should we not in like manner, and with much more reason, hould the same iudgement of Kings? Seeing that they also, by the testimony of the same <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Rom.

Because the Church is euer gouerned by the spirit of God, nor doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing rashly. And the Pope being often times mooued and tossed with the windes and tempests of sedition enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth many things wickedly, cruelly and vniustly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counsell and iudgement.</p>
            <p>But it is a hard matter to tolerate a wicked King, and to retaine true Religion, will some reply. I grant indeed it is so, but it is not vnpossible. Impossibilitie (I must craue pardon to vse the word) excuseth from the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Commandements, but difficultie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth not. But that he saith, <hi>That it is of the diuine law to keepe true faith and religion: but of humane law, that we haue this or that King.</hi> This surely is all true, but take heed Reader for all this, least you be deceiued. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> omitted that which was principall, for he ought to haue added:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But where we once haue this or that King, it is of the diuine law, that in Ciuill causes we obey him with all honor and reuerence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this adiection which no Catholike can denie, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his is crusht. For in the maner propounded by him, the law of God and Man doe not concurre, nor fall a crosse one of another, as hee imagineth, (which if it should fall out, it were reason that the humane should
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17700:69"/>
yeeld to the diuine) but in truth there concurre two heads of the Diuine law, the one, to obserue faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other, To honor the King and to obey him in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill matters. Both which may and ought to be fulfilled, <hi>By giuing to Caesar,</hi> as is said, <hi>the things which are Caesars, and which are Gods, to God,</hi> as we haue learned out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> doctrine in the person of the Pope, endeuouring to destroy the Church.</p>

            <q>Why may not a faithfull People be freed from the yoke of a King faithlesse, and drawing others to Infidelitie, if a belieuing wife be free from the yoke of an vnbelieuing husband.</q>
            <p>Now if it please the Reuerend <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to turne that his Argument into this, that it may haue more moment and weight, then I will answere the same after an other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And thus. That either he speakes of those maried persons who contracted Mariage, when they both were beleeuers, and one of them fell into heresie or infidelitie afterwards: or of heathen and infidell Couples, of whom the one conuerted to the faith, the other continuing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately in his Pagan superstition. If he vnderstand his argument of the former, he doth slander his Author <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius,</hi> who speakes neuer a word of such a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the said <hi>Cap. Gandemus:</hi> and besides it should bee false, which he obtrudes to vs for an argument, that the beleeuing husband is free from the yoke of his vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wife, when he will not continue with his Christian wife, without iniurie to the faith, as the same <hi>Innocentius</hi> expresly teacheth, <hi>in cap.

            <p>And againe the same <hi>Innocentius</hi> in <hi>Cap. exparte extra, De conuers. coningat.</hi> rescribeth to the same purpose: That <hi>Matrimonie contracted between lawfull persons, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by carnall Copulation,</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Behold the argument drawen from maried Persons, doth not onely not strengthen these mens Opinion, but also weakneth, and euen oppugneth the same, as if a man should in this manner propound the argument <gap reason="foreign">

            <q>
               <hi>Why should a beleeuing People be freed from the yoke of a King vnbeleeuing or hereticall, endeuouring to draw his subiects to his sect, if a maried person beleeuing bee not free from the yoke of the other Mate vnbeleeuing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he will not continue with the beleeuing yoke-fellow, without inturie to the faith and contumelie to the Creator.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>As Innocentius III. openly teacheth, in cap. Quanto. §. si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vero. De Diuort. &amp; in cap. ex parte. De conuers. coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. adeo vt Panorm. in illum. §. Si verò. doth say, out of the reason there laid, That the Church cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue such a Mariage, and free the beleeuing yoke-fellow from the yoke of the vnbeleeuing, when as notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a beleeuing yoke-mate may much more easily be peruerted by a yoke-mate vnbeleeuing, then the whole people by a King. But the bond of the subiection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the people is tied to the King, since it proceeds both from naturall and diuine Law, seemeth much more hard to be dissolued, then that of maried Persons between themselues: that from thence a man may easily prooue, that the Church can doe no more in one then in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:17700:70"/>
But if he vnderstand his argument of the later maried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the answer is easie, out of the same Decretall Epistle of <hi>Innocent,</hi> to wit. That betweene such couples the Mariage is not good, as much as appertaines to the indissoluble <note n="*" place="margin">This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cardi. Bellar. own doctrine in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de matrimoni. cap.</hi> 12.</note> bonds of Matrimony. And therefore such kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried parsons haue full liberty to dissolue the matrimony, that they may depart either with consent and good likeing, or with mislike and displeasure, and the one of them, euen against the liking of the other, may by refusall and diuorse at his pleasure dissolue that knot of mariage: for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may as wel send letters of diuorse to the man as the man to the wife.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>although the Matrimony among Infidels be true</hi> (because they goe together according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the lawes) <hi>yet it is not firme. But amongst the beleeuers it is both true and firme, because the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith being once admitted is neuer lost, but makes firme the Sacrament of mariage, that it continues in the maried persons, while that continueth.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>It is no wonder then if the maried persons brought to the faith, be free from the fellowship and power of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, remayning in Infidelity, when as although both had continued in Infidelity, it had beene euen as free for each of them to depart from the other, &amp; by diuorse to dissolue mariage because in the beginning there passed no forme and rate bond of Obligation betweene them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle doth not command but aduise, that the beleeuing wife should not depart from the vnbeleeuing husband if he be willing to stay with hir, as <hi>S.

            <p>Which matters since they stand thus, surely it followeth, that the aduersaries do to small purpose fetch an argument from maried persons to shew that people may be freed from the Regall yoake, whether they regard the mariages of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17700:71"/>
Beleeuers, or of the vnbeleeuers: Because they are coupled with a most straight and indissoluble knot of society, whose band cannot be broken, no not by the Church it selfe, neither for Infidelity nor Heresie of the one part. So as from hence he doth furnish vs with an argument ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rather to maintaine the strength and perpetuity of Regall authority, then to dissolue and destroy the same; And these are tyed by no necessity of Obligation in the face of the Church, but the husband conuerted to the faith if his fellow will not follow without scandall, may at his pleasure take to him another: And againe, the woman brought to the faith, if the husband refuse may in Christ marry with whom shee will. Seeing therefore there is no firme mariage betweene these and the politike subiection, and Kingly domination and rule, is ratified and approued amongst all Nations, and in euery law, as well by diuine as humane power, what can be more vnreasonable or fond then to compare and sute them together, and to deduce any argument from the society and yoake of vnbeleeuing maried persons, which may be shaken of at pleasure, to breake the yoake of Regall power and authority, and to make the same iudgement of them both, as if they were as like as might be.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIV.</head>
            <p>I Tould you in the xxiij. Chapter, that there were fiue reasons in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whereby he would proue, that the Pope hath temporall power ouer all secular Kings, and Princes Christian: of which reasons we haue run thorow three, and obserued how weake they are, and of what disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they labour, it remaineth now, that we make our suruay of the other two, which are not a whit better conditioned. The first whereof is by him laid downe in these words.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>When Kings and Princes come to the Church to be made Christians, they are receiued with a Couenant, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:17700:71"/>
               <hi>or secret, that they should subiect their Scepters to Christs, and promise that they will obserue and defend the faith of Christ, yea vnder the penalty of losing their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Ergo. <hi>When they prooue Heretikes, or hurt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they may be iudged by the Church, and withall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from their gouernment, neither shall any iniury be done them, if they be deposed.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I answer this reason, by denying the consequent. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true that Princes comming to the Church, do submit themselues and their scepters to Christ, and euen of their owne accord doe make those promises either secretly or expresly which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reporteth; yet it is not true, neither doth it follow thereof, that they may be iudged and deposed by the Church or Pope if they breake their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or neglect to keepe their Couenant and Oath. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that soueraigne iurisdiction and temporall power of Christ ouer all Kings and the whole world which he hath as the sonne of God, doth not appertaine to the Church or Pope: but that power onely which Christ assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he was conuersant amongst men after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, according to which the Pope is Christs Vicar. Whereupon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe writeth <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 4.</note> excellently well:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>We say,</hi> quoth hee, <hi>that the Pope hath that office which Christ had, when after the maner of men he liued amongst men in the world. For we may not giue the Pope those offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Christ hath as God, or as animmortall and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, but onely those, which he had as a mortall man.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>But Christ vsurped no temporall dominion and power when he liued as a man amongst men in earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the Church as the Church, nor the Pope as head of the Church and Vicar of Christ, can haue any temporall power, as the same learned man declareth and prooueth at large, in that Chapter, Wherefore although Kings and Princes when they come to the Church, do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect their Kingdomes to the Lord Christ, and haue Christ their iudge from whom they haue also their Kingdome:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17700:72"/>
but because the iudgement is of a temporall affaire, when the businesse is touching a kingdome forfeited, they haue him onely their Iudge, and not the Church or the Pope. Whereby it doth easily appeare how captious those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and conclusions are which <hi>Sanders,</hi> from whom <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> hath receiued this stuffe of his, doth deduce out of those manner of promises, made either secretly or expresly. For as concerning those formes of asking and answering, which he with many idle words and falsely deuiseth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and the Princes which come to the Church: we must answer, that they are fondly conceiued by him, and that they neither ought, nor are accustomed to passe in the admittance of Heathen Princes, which come to the Church, least the Church should seeme either to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them, or to diuine and conceiue ill of them for the time to come. Therfore their burning loue towards Christ, and present confession of their faith, whereby they in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tearms promise, that they wil giue there names to Christ and become children of the Church, and will renounce the diuel and his works, and keep the commandements of God and the Church, and such like, are cause sufficient enough, that they should be receiued. All which matters they doe indeed promise to Christ, the Church receiuing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as his Spouse, in whose boosome they are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; or the Bishop himselfe, not as a man, but as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, God himselfe discharging a Deputies office heerein, and therefore the obligation is principally taken to Christ himselfe, by the Church or the Pope. Whereby although they haue also promised all other things, which <hi>Sanders</hi> hath comprehended in that forged forme of his, and shall afterwards neglect, or wholy contemne that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant agreed on, they can be punished by him onely, into whose words they did sweare, and who is the Lord of all temporall estates, and whom they haue for their onely Iudge ouer them intemporall matters, but not by him to whom the care onely of spirituall matters and to take the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17700:72"/>
promise is committed.</p>
            <p>And to these spirituall matters are those things most like, and most resemble them which we see daily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the ciuill Gouernment. They who aspire to the succession of Feudes or Fees, whether they come in by hereditarie right or by any other title, cannot enioy them, vnlesse they first be admitted into his clientele and seruice who is Lord of the Fee, that is, vnlesse they in words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued doe take the oath of fealtie to the Lord, which they commonly call <hi>Homagium</hi> or <hi>Hominium.</hi> But if it be the Kings fee to which they succeed, the King doth seldome in his owne Person take the oath of fealtie, but executeth that businesse for the most part by his Chancellor, or soem other Deputie especially assigned for that purpose. Therefore the Chancellor when hee admits to Fees and Honors great Personages swearing into the Kings wordes, he dischargeth the same office vnder the King in a Ciuill administration and iurisdiction, which the Pope doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ, in the spirituall gouernment of the Church, when he receiues Princes comming vnto her, by taking the oath of their faithfulnesse and pietie towards God: And the Chancellor, the Tenant once admitted, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though after he breake his oath, and commit the crime which they call Felonie) may in no cause take away the Fee, which is the proper right of the King alone, and not granted to the Chancellor at all: So neither can the Pope depriue of Kingdomes and authoritie, or any way tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally punish Princes receiued into the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they offend grieuouslie afterward, or forsake the faith: Because that is reserued to God onely. Therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christian Kings and Princes be in the Church, and in respect that they are the Children of the Church, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the church and the Pope, notwithstanding in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they doe beare a soueraigne rule temporall in the world, they are not inferiours, but rather superiours: and therefore although they haue forfeited their kingdome
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17700:73"/>
by secret or expresse couenant, yet neither people, nor Pope, nor church canne take it away from them: But onely Almightie God alone, from whom is all power, and to whom aloue they are inferiour in Ciuill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. And neither shall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor any other be euer able to bring, or as I may say, to digge out of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of any age, any forcible argument, whereby he may make it plaine vnto vs, that secular Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when they were receiued to the Faith by the Church, did in such manner renounce their interest, as both to lay downe altogether the temporall authoritie which they had receiued of God, and also to subiect themselues to the Church, to be iudged in Ciuill affaires, and to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised with temporall punishment. And if none of them can demonstrate this, they must needs confesse, that Kings and Princes did after the faith receiued, retaine their Kingdomes and Empires, in the same Right, the same Libertie, and Authoritie, wherein they possessed them, before such time as they came to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as the Aduersaries doe confesse, <hi>Lex Christinemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem priuat iure suo.</hi> If therefore, before Baptisme they had no Iudge aboue them in temporall matters, but God alone: neither ought they to haue any after Baptisme. But we haue spoken more of this matter in the refutation of the first reason. In this place I stand not much vpon <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> his dotages.</p>
            <p>Now for that he vnderlaies after this fourth reason, in the words following.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>For he is not fit to receiue the Sacrament of Baptisme, who is not ready to serue Christ, and for his sake to loose whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he hath. For the Lord saith, Lu.</hi> 14. <hi>if any man come to me, and hateth not father and mother, and wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea and euen his owne life, he cannot be my Disciple.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I cannot tell, to what end he vseth these words. Surely no man denies it. But what of it? Such a reason belongs no more to the purpose, then that which is furthest from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17700:73"/>
the matter, nor that neither which followeth in the same place. <hi>Besides</hi> saith he, <hi>the Church should grieuously erre, if she should admit any King which would with impunitie cherish euery manner of sect, and defend heretikes, and ouerthrow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> This is most true: But as I said, it belongs nothing to the purpose, for now the question is not of that matter: but of the temporall power of the Church, or of the Pope, who is the substitute head thereof vnder Christ: I meane, whether he haue that power, whereby he may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise with temporall punishments Kings and Princes duely receiued, if after they shall breake the faith, and forsake the dutie, vndertaken by them in the lauer of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or no. Now neither part of this question is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or disprooued by these correllaries and additions, and for this cause we passe them ouer.</p>

            <p>THe fift and last reason is drawen, from his Pastorall charge and office: in these wordes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>When it was said to</hi> Peter, <hi>Feed my sheepe,</hi> Iohn the last, <hi>all the power was giuen him, which was necessarie to maintaine the flocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But a shepheard hath a threefold charge, one about Wolues, that hee driue them away by all meanes he can: the other about the Rammes, that he may shut them vp, if they hurt the flocke with their hornes: the third about the rest of the sheepe, that he giue euery one conuenient food:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Pope hath this triple charge.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Out of this principle and foundation are drawen three strong arguments as he surmiseth. But not to goe farre, first I answer to this very fundamentall proposition: that it is all true, and maketh for me, and that the very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that which he affirmes may very handsomely be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from thence, I say, gathered, that the Pope hath no temporall power at all, or may exercise any vpon Christian Princes, as he is the Vicar of Christ, and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17700:74"/>
of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> seeing such a manner of power is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the Pope, for the discharging and fulfilling of his Pastorall dutie.</p>
            <p>And that is euidently concluded by this argument: Christ by commending his sheepe to <hi>Peter,</hi> gaue him all power necessarie to defend the flocke: But he gaue him no temporall power: Therefore temporall power is not necessarie to defend the flocke. Secondly, we will proceed in this manner. It is a thing vnreasonable, that the Pope, who is the successor of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> should haue more power then had <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe: But <hi>Peter</hi> had not any temporall power ouer Christians; Therefore, Neither the Pope as he is his successor.</p>
            <p>The proposition of the former reason, is without all controuersie true. And the Assamption is prooued by the testimonie and confession of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe. For lib. quint. de Rom. Pontif. where he endeuours to establish his opinion of this thing by a similitude of the flesh and the spirit, he writeth thus. <hi>For as the spirit and flesh stand one toward the other in Man: so doe the two powers in the Church; for the flesh and the spirit, be as it were two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealthes, which may be found both separated and toyned together, flesh is found without the spirit in beasts: spirit is found without flesh in the Angels:</hi> and a little after. <hi>Euen so the Ciuill power hath her Princes, Lawes, Iudgements, &amp;c. Likewise the Ecclesiasticall, her Bishops, Canons, Iudgements: the one hath for her end a temporall peace: the other, euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting saluation: sometimes they are found seuered, as once in the time of the Apostles, sometime toyned as now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these powers were seuered in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as in trueth they were, both in Right and in Deed, it followeth necessarily, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had no temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, otherwise it should be false, that they were seuered, for it there be place to the similitude propounded by him, it will follow, that as there is nothing fleshly in Angels, and nothing spirituall in beasts: so in the time of the Apostles, there should be no temporall power in the Church, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17700:74"/>
in the Ciuill state. Therefore we must confesse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that temporall power is not necessarie for the chiefe Pastor of the Church: or that the Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles himselfe, and cheefe Pastor <hi>S. Peter,</hi> was not furnished and accomplished with all things necessarie for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Pastorall dutie. And this is as contrarie, as contrarie may be, to that which he had already said in his fundamentall reason, as I may call it: to wit,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>That all abilitie necessarie to defend the flocke, was giuen to</hi> Peter.</q>
            <p>The same also is prooued by this, that all ciuill and temporall power at that time depended of heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, witnesse <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Rom. Pont. ca.</hi> 29.</note>, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the head of the Church and Vicar of Christ, was subiect in temporalities, both by Right and in Deed. Wherof it followeth, that either <hi>S. Peter</hi> was induced with no temporall power, or that he receiued it from heathen Princes: otherwise as we said before, it should be false, that those powers were then separated. But it is certaine that he receiued none of them, and therefore that he had none at all. And certainly these reasons are more plaine, then any man without fraud and cunning can gainesay: that it is a wonder to see that learned men and otherwise godly, should so be blinded with an inconsiderate and vnaduised heate, that they should not sticke to embrace and follow doubtfull things for certaine, obscure for euident, crooked for straight: for plaine and easie reasons, those which be perplexed and intricately bewrapped with many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies and contradictions. But they take care, you will say, to amplifie and adorne the Sea Apostolike with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and accession of this power and authoritie. And is there any Catholike, who doth not commend their minds that are affected to that Sea, which is the foundation and strength of our faith? That they doe grace and aduance by all meanes that Sea, which no man can sufficiently commend according to her worth, I doe much commend them: but that they attribute more to it, then is fit, and

that with the great scandall of many, that I doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, for we our selues also do no lesse honour the same Sea, we no lesse loue, reuerence, admire it: as that which is the true seate of <hi>Peter,</hi> and being placed in the rocke which is Christ, hath ouercome all heresies, and obtaineth by good right the chiefe place in the Church. But the truth forbids, that we should aduance her with this increase of Power: our Conscience bearing vs witnesse, before God, and the Lord Iesu, before whom in the day of the reuelation of the iust iudgement, both these our writings, and theirs shall appeare, consigned with their owne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Therefore, there is small cause, why they should bring this former reason for themselues. For Christ when hee said to <hi>Peter, Pasce oues meas,</hi> appointed him indeed Pastor of his flocke: but a Spirituall Pastor not a Temporal: and gaue him all ability necessary for that office, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that Temporal power is not necessary for the Pope, because Christ gaue it not to <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe. Neither haue we heard any where that either <hi>S. Peter</hi> or any other of his Apostles, did practise any temporall power or authority, by vertue whereof he did either directly, or indirectly (that no man may suppose any force in words) punish the forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Christian faith with Ciuill punishment after the manner of Magistrates. It is true indeed that sometimes it hath come to passe, that Temporall punishment as death or Torment hath followed a spiritual sentence: the church at that time standing in need of miracles and wonders to confirme the faith, which kind of punishments, did strike a farre greater feare into the mindes of Christians, then if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men they had suffered punishment at the hands of Ciuill Magistrates. And this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle writeth to the Corinthians: <note n="3" place="margin">1. Corin. 4.</note> 
               <hi>What will you? shall I come to you with a rod or in loue and in the spirit of meekenesse?</hi> The rod he calleth that spirituall power, which by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull working of God, did at that time produce wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects, as euen at this day sometimes, he vpon the like

            <p>Therefore the Popes might doe this, but they ought not. <hi>Non omne quod licet, honestum est.</hi> Very well saith the Apostle <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. &amp; 10.</note>, <hi>omnia mihi licent, sed non omnia expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</hi> Therefore the first part of the conclusion is true, that the Pastor of the Church, may driue away heretike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by excommunication.</p>
            <p>But that which followeth, <hi>(and withall command the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they follow him not)</hi> hath two eares to hold by, as I may say with <hi>Epictetus,</hi> the one sound, the other broken. I meane a twofold vnderstanding, the one true, the other faulty. For if he speake in this sense, that it is the duty of the Pope, to command the subiects, that they follow not an heretike Prince in his heresie, that they run not with him in his madnesse, nor admit and swallow downe his damnable errors; for that they suffer not themselues, to be infected and defiled with his filthy and corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners it is as true, and is deriued very truly out of the same principle and fountaine, and this is the best sense of those words. For there is nothing so conuenient and comely for the pontificall dignity, and the whole order Ecclesiastike, nothing so profitable and necessary for Christian people, as that according to the patterne of the ancient fathers of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17700:76"/>
the Church, the principall Bishop himselfe first, and the rest of his brethren, all of them, should preach the word, should be instant in season, and out of season, conuince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, rebuke, in all patience and doctrine <note n="f" place="margin">.2 Timoth. 4.</note>. That like Faithfull witnesses and good seruants whom the Lord hath set ouer his family, they may so worke both by word and example, that the people follow not the errors of their King, nor either dissemble, nor forsake the Catholike faith, thorow any either threatnings or allurements of the King, which because most of them either do not all at this day, or at the least much more slackly then they ought, and that duty, which it becomes them to performe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they put ouer to certaine begging Friers: what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is it if many in our age, haue been caried away as it were with a whirle wind of errors from the Lords sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, into the toiles of the diuell. This, as I haue said, is the best sense: But notwithstanding that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not speake in this sense, both the cause, which he hath in hand, and this clause following, <hi>Ac proinde prinare eum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio in subditos,</hi> doth plainly declare. Therefore he giues vs the broken care of the pot, I meane the corrupt, and the very worst sense of those words: forsooth, that the pastor of the Church may command the subiect, that they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute no commandement of such a Prince, and that by any meanes they yeeld him no reuerence, obedience, honor, in those matters which belong euen to a temporall and ciuill authority. <hi>And therefore depriue him of his dominion ouer his subiects.</hi> But this is false, and flat contrary to the law of God, and precepts of the Apostles.

either he deceiues of purpose, or is deceiued, by shuffling together true and false points into the same conclusion. For it is true, that a Pastor of the Church, may driue away an heretike Prince by excommunication: but it is false that he may depriue him of his dominion ouer his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

            <p>For they that with more diligence, and exact care doe search the scriptures, doe obserue a too fold kind of the precepts of <hi>Paul:</hi> one is of those, by which he publisheth the law of God, which he was sent to preach, and doth both propound, and expound the will of God, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the old and new law. Of which precepts almost infinit his Epistles are full, wherein are these also which he deliuers touching obedience and reuerence to be giuen to Kings and Princes. And the other kind is of those things, which doe not depend of the law of nature or the expresse word of God, but which the Apostle himselfe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per authority ordaineth by humane wisedome assisted by the grace of God, for the ordering and setling of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, as that a <hi>Bigamus</hi> or a quarreller, be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a Bishopricke <note n="k" place="margin">1.

            <p>THerefore it is the opinion of many learned men that the Pope cannot giue power to a religious Person to breake his vow, that he may haue the property of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goods or a wife, according to the true and simple sence of <hi>Innocentius</hi> his words. And yet if we will diligently search and consider how much some things differ from other, and with a right iudgement to compare them together in the points wherein they properly agree or differ: there will because to confesse that the Pope hath far lesse power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

him to absolue a People from the Religion-of their oath, by which they haue willingly and frankely obleiged their faith to their Prince, then to dissolue the vowes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Persons, that although in this last point peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in some mens opinion, he may seeme to haue power to doe something <hi>deplenitudine potestatis,</hi> yet in the other we must thinke that he is able to doe iust nothing. Both for that the whole Order Monachall, and other Orders in the Church (as certaine thinke) haue proceeded from humane Constitutions, and the positiue law, ouer whom in that consideration the Pope hath full and all manner of power that may be, as we haue said a little before. But the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and obedience due to Kings and Princes and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and superiours is grounded vpon the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of God, being confirmed by both the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For although it be a matter of humane law and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to vse this or that forme of Common-wealth or Gouernment, or to haue this or that Prince; but to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him, whom we had once receiued, and submisly to obey him in all things, which are not contrary to Gods commandements, it is a matter not onely of humane, but also both of Naturall and Diuine institution.

            <p>As also, because by the vow of religiont, he obligation is taken only to God and the Church, whereof the Pope is the Vicar, or deputed head: and therefore if the Pope, to whom the free procuration and dispensation of all the buisnesses of the Church is permitted, shall as it were in a fashion of renewing a bond, transfuse and change the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, taken to the Church, into another Obligation, and also doe interpret and consture that by the promise of a great good, (or performance) there is satisfaction

Therefore the Obligation remaineth yet, to which this Oath was added: which because it consists vpon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and diuine Law, doth no lesse straitly hold the mindes and consciences of men before God, then if it were supported with an Oath, <hi>quia Dominus inter iur amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; loquelam nostram, nullam vult esse distantiam</hi>

of the contempt of God; and notwithstanding that in the externall Court Periurie is more grieuously puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by reason of the solemnitie of the promise, then the faith neglected of a mans single promise and bare word, as we say.</p>
            <p>But if the Pope would also cancell this Obligation <hi>de Apostolicae potestatis plenitudine,</hi> and deliuer and discharge the Subiects from the Oath of the King: and enioyne them <hi>that they should not dare to obey his requests, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and lawes vnder paine of Excommunication:</hi> Shall not the expresse commandement of God seeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traueene this warrant of the Pope, I meane the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the honoring of Kings with all obedience? Is it not lawfull in such a businesse and in a cause the greatest almost that may be, to doe that which the Popes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters are accustomed to doe, in Controuersies of lesse moment? And that is, to make diligent and carefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition into this same <hi>plenitudinem Potestatis,</hi> whether it extend it selfe so farre, as that by it should expresly be forbidden, which God doth expresly command? or that which God directly forbids to be done, the same may lawfully be commanded by it? God commandes mee by <hi>Salomon</hi> to feare the King: by his Apostles to honour the King, to be subiect and obedient to him. This surely is a commandement both of naturall and diuine Law: that the inferiour should obey the superiour, as long as hee forbiddeth not, who is superiour to them both, in the same kind of power. And he in this businesse betweene the people and the Prince, when the question is about temporall authoritie and subiection, is God alone, then whom alone the King is lesse in temporall matters, as in spirituall the Pope.</p>
            <p>Seeing then all men doe ingenuously confesse, that this fulnesse of the Apostolike power is not so great, that the Pope may in any sort dispense in those things, which are bidden or forbidden by the expresse word of God (which

            <p>NOw the errour of these men, whereby they giue to the Pope all power both humane and diuine, was bredde partly out of the Apocryphall writings, as hath beene said; partly out of certaine rescripts of Popes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceiued more darkly then was cause, and wrong vnderstood, according to the letter, as they say.

            <p>And lest any man should obiect, If God haue reserued to his owne only iudgement the dissolution of both the mariages, both carnall and spirituall, and the spirituall bond is stronger then the carnall: how can it be, that the Pope, who is surely but a man, can dissolue that spirituall bond? <hi>Innocentius</hi> answereth in that place, that it is done in that regard, because they are separated, not by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but by diuine power, who by the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome <hi>are remooued from the Church, by transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deposition, or cession.

whatsoeuer is done by the Pope, is done by God himselfe, because the words of <hi>Innocent</hi> seeme to carrie this meaning.

               </gap>, that is, that the mind of this good Bishop, and the sense of the wordes doe differ; which oft times fals out in the writings of Law-makers, when as either they doe vse words not so fitte for to expresse their meaning, or do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some necessary particle, or exception, for to make the constitution plaine, and entire; for otherwise it is not likely, that hee who denieth, that the Pope may graunt licence to a Moncke, that he may haue propertie of goods, or marry a wife; would affirme, that the Pope
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17700:84"/>
may dissolue the Sacrament of mariage, I meane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony ratified and consummate. What is the matter then? I will speake what I thinke: I haue obserued, that <hi>Innocentius</hi> hath with that subtlety and finenesse tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his doctrine, that although hee compare each ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this, that they are dissolued by the iudgement of God onely: yet, where he speakes of the power of the chiefe Bishop, and Vicar of Iesu Christ, he conioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them together no more, nor makes mention of carnall matrimony, but onely of spirituall: which not deemed to be separated by man, but by God himselfe; then when as the Bishop of Rome <hi>dissolueth the same, the necessity or commodity of the Church well considered, not out of humane, but rather out of diuine authority by translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deposition or cession;</hi> by which silence, and omission of carnall Matrimony, he doth sufficiently implie, that in the manner of separation, it doth differ, and is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly excepted from the spirituall matrimony: that the Pontificiall authoritie doth not extend to the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, viz. the carnall, as if hee had spoken more plainely in this manner. God hath reserued to his own iudgement, the dissolution, as well of the carnall, as of the spirituall matrimony: notwithstanding, the Bishop of Rome, who is the Vicar of Christ, and successor of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the necessity or commoditie of the Churches, &amp;c.</hi> may dissolue them: which when he doth, <hi>not man but God doth separate,</hi> whose Person the Pope beareth in earth. Now, why the Pope may dissolue a spirituall mariage, and not a carnall also, the reason is plaine and easie: because the spirituall matrimony of it selfe, and euerie way doth belong to the ordination, gouernement, and oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomie of the Church, which Christ hath wholy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors.

And therefore there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to permit to <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors, the power to dissolue the same. They haue inough to discerne &amp; iudge, if it be a mariage, that they may know if it bee a sacrament. Therefore, although the Pope may auaile very much in the contracting of a mariage, viz by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing all impediments, which doe arise out of the positiue law, and ecclesiasticall constitutions, and giue order, that it may duly and rightly be contracted, which otherwise were neither lawfull nor firme: yet when as either through the common law permitting, or the Pope dispensing in cases prohibited, it was contracted, hath no power for any cause in the world, to relaxe and dissolue the same. Neither doth it belong to the matter, that in Courts and iudgements Ecclesiasticall, we see often that separation is made of those persons, as haue liued a long time together, vnder the conceit and shew of mariage. For neither the Pope in that case, nor the Iudge delegated by the Popes authority, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue any matrimony: but by his iudgement declareth, that the matrimony, which indeede was contracted <hi>de fasto,</hi> or was falsly supposed to be a mariage, was no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage at all: &amp; enioyneth persons that are not lawfully coupled together, because without sin they may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine that societie together, to depart one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17700:85"/>
and to forbeare their accustomed acquaintance. But this is not to dissolue Matrimony, or to separate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lawfully ioined, as concerning the bond of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Whereby it is euident, that both <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Interpreter, who afterward was the IIII. Pope of that name, and also <hi>Ioh, Andr.</hi> (who is called the fountaine and trumpet of the Canon law) hath very foolishly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this part of the rescript of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the III. <hi>Whome God hath ioined, let no man separate. Of their owne authority</hi> say they: <hi>but man doth not separate carnall matrimony, when the Bishop or the Archdeacon doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue it by the Constitutions of the Pope, but God himselfe, by whose authority those constitutions were made.</hi> As though Matrimonie might be dissolued by the constitutions of the Pope? Indeed the constitutions of the Pope may hinder, that mariage may not bee lawfully contracted betweene certaine persons, and make a nullitie in the law, because it was not contracted by the disposition of the same constitutions. But to distract and diuide a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which is lawfully contracted, &amp; to breake or loose the band, no constitution either of Pope or church can do.

naturall and diuine law; or, as we vsually speake now a dayes, cannot dispense against the law of nature, and of God: and grant that that may bee done without guilt, which God and nature haue forbidden; or forbid lest that should be done which God hath expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done; and this not onely the Diuines, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Canonists of the better sort, doe very earnestly maintaine. Therefore this is a most grounded Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ome, whereon the weight of this whole disputation doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and whereon is grounded the solution of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which wee haue transcribed out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aboue in the beginning of the 25. Chapter. Surely, we do admit his proposition, which is, <hi>That it is necessary for a Pastor to haue power about the Wolues, that hee may driue them away, by all the meanes he is able.</hi> Wee admit also the Assumption. <hi>That the Wolues which destroy and waste the Church of God, are heretickes.</hi> Where hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in this manner. <hi>Ergo, If a Prince, of a sheepe, or ramme, turne Wolfe; that is to say, of a Christian turne an hereticke, the Pastor of the Church may driue him away by excommunication, and also may charge the people, that they doe not follow him, and therefore may depriue him of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer his subiects.</hi> Surely, a very vnsound collection. In stead whereof, in good Logicke, should bee put this conclusion: <hi>Ergo, If any Prince, of a sheepe, or a ramme, turne Wolfe, the Pastor of the Church may driue him away by all the meanes hee can.</hi> For this ariseth rightly out of the former Propositions, and therefore if we grant them it cannot bee denied. Therefore all this is true; and wee grant it all: but yet that which hee annecteth and knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to this conclusion, is neither agreeable nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, which is, <hi>that the Pastor may enioine the people, &amp;c.</hi> For to be able, or not to be able <hi>(posse)</hi> where the right and equity is disputed, ought to bee vnderstoode not of the mere act, but of the power, which is lawfully permitted, and which agreeth with law and reason.

which hee is able to doe iustly and honestly <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note>. And so the matter is brought about, as we are enforced to enquire, <note place="margin">Id posse.</note> whether the Pope by the plenitude of his Apostolicke power, as they speake, can command &amp; enioine subiects, that <hi>they dare not be so bold as to obey the edicts, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, lawes of their Prince vnder paine of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And if he shall <hi>de facto</hi> commaund the law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Subiects are bound to obey any such comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Pope. Surely, as I touched in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for the Affirmatiue, I could neuer in my life, either my selfe find a waighty argument, nor light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any inuented by an other: But the contrary propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is strongly maintained, being built vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which we spake of ere while; viz. That the Pope cannot in any sort dispense against a law of nature, and of God. Vpon which ground is raised a most firme ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in my opinion, which is concluded in this forme.</p>
            <q>The Pope can commaund or dispense in nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law Naturall and Diuine.</q>
            <p>But to commaund or dispense in the matter of subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience due to Princes, is against law natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Diuine.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ergo, The Pope cannot commaund or dispense in the same: and by consequence cannot commaund the subiects, that they doe not obey their temporall Prince, in that wherein the Prince is superiour to him: and if he shall</hi> de facto <hi>commaund, it shall be lawfull for the subiects to disobey him with safety and good conscience, as one that presumes to giue lawes without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of his territory or iurisdiction.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Both the Propositions are most certaine. Out of which the Conclusion is induced by a necessary consecution. He that shall weaken the force of this Argument, shall doe mee a very great pleasure, and make me beholding to him. For my part, that I may ingenuously confesse my slender wit, I doe not see in the world how it can bee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17700:86"/>
checked by any sound reason; for though it may bee said, that obedience due to a superiour may bee restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hindered by him who is superiour to that supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and that the Pope who is Father of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is superiour to all Kings and Princes Christian, in this, that he is Father, and therefore that hee may of his owne authority inhibite and restraine, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects doe not performe the reuerence and obedience due and promised to the Prince; yet this reason is like a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ordinance, not able to beat down the strength of the former conclusion. Seeing this which is said, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence du to a superiour may be diminished or restrained, or taken away by his commaundement, who is superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to that superiour: this is true onely then, when he who forbiddeth it is superiour in the same kind, and line of power and superiority; or in those things, wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is due. As for example, the King may take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lieutenant of his Armie his commaund, and giue charge that the Armie obey him no more; and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant may vpon cause commaund that the souldier o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the Tribune, nor the Tribune the Centurion, nor the Centurion the Decurion. For that all these in the same kind, I meane about militarie gouernment &amp; discipline, but one aboue an other, are superiour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of dignity. The same is true in the orders of the heauenly warfare, and of the ecclesiasticall Hierarchie. But the obedience of the subiects towards the Prince, whereof wee speake; consisteth in temporall matters, wherein the Popes themselues confesse, that there is none aboue the Prince <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. per Venerabilem. qui fil. sunt legit.</note>. But if none bee aboue him in temporalities, surely it followeth, that there is none that may forbid or hinder the subiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is due to him from his subiects in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities.</p>
            <p>I haue shewed aboue that these powers the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall, are so distinct, that neither, as it is such, doth commaund or serue the other. And
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17700:87"/>
that they are not to be regarded, who flie to their starting holes of distinctions and quirkes, or rather those snares, of verball captions, by these words, <hi>directè &amp; indirectè.</hi> For it is most sure, that hee hath a superiour in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties, whome an other may in any sort commaund a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about temporall matters: or who in temporall causes may bee iudged directly or indirectly by an other.

And indeed, for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and issue of the matter, there is no difference at all; whether one haue authority and power ouer an other, directly or indirectly. For in those wordes, <hi>directè &amp; indirectè,</hi> or if you please, directly, and oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the difference is propounded to vs onely in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way, or order of obtaining and comming by the former, but not in the liberty, force and effect of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising, and executing the same. But good God? what can bee said more vnreasonably, or more contrary to the selfe then this: that a King hath no superiour in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties; but is free from all bands of offences, nor is brought to punishment by any lawes, which all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and the whole Church hath euer held: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the Pope vpon cause, or in some manner, that is to say, Indirectly, is superiour to the King in temporalties, and may punish him with temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, that is, with losse of kingdom &amp; rule, yea &amp; life also? For after that he is once defected &amp; thrown down from his throne by the Pope, and reduced to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a priuate man, what remaineth, but that he should vndergoe the last issue of this malice? and that is, either to prouide for his safety by speedy flight, and so liue a miserable life out of his Countrey; or if hee doe not in this manner prouide for himselfe, bee will forthwith bee arraigned and conuinced in publike iudgment, and then fall into the hands of a Gaoler, or an Executioner, and so there will be an end of him. Now there is in this power,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17700:87"/>
which these good fellowes doe attribute indirectly to the Pope, a soueraigne, free, and vncontrolled libertie to oppresse, and to exercise tyrannie, euen ouer good and innocent Kings. For first of all they ordaine, <hi>That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Pope to iudge, if a King be to be deposed or not to be deposed.</hi> Secondly, that there is no appeale from his iudgement, <hi>Because he alone iudgeth all men, and is iudged of no man.</hi> And so should it be in the power and pleasure of a malitious Pope, whensoeuer he conceiueth and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with any priuate hatred against any King, though he be neuer so good, to pretend some occasion or other of an indirect prerogatiue, that hee may turne him out of his Kingdome, and reduce him to the estate of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man. Which J would not speake in this place, (for I would not presage so hardly of the Gouernours of the holy See) but that all the world doth vnderstand, that the same hath in former ages beene practised by diuers Popes. And it is not yet aboue the age of a good olde man, since <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. did most wickedly and vniustly take from <hi>Iohn</hi> King of Nauarre, his Kingdome by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> of Aragon, by this very pretence of the Papall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, the same <hi>Iohn</hi> being not guiltie, or conuinced of any crime, but onely because he fauoured <hi>Lewes</hi> the French King. And if to doe matters of this nature, is not to be superiour in temporall affaires, I would gladly learne of these great Masters, what it is to be a superiour. One thing I know (if this opinion of theirs bee true) that the Pope is able to doe more against Kings indirectly, then if he should haue directly any command ouer them. Of which point we haue spoken something before <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. The answer of the people to the Pope commanding to disobey their King.</note>.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Pope, <hi>de Apostolicae potestatis plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> shall goe about by his Decree or Bull, to forbidde them to obey their King, may not all the people againe, or some in the peoples behalfe, answer the Pope in this manner: Holy Father, You are not aboue our King in temporalties; and in that respect, you cannot hinder the temporall obedience which wee performe vnto him.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17700:88"/>
Why doe you forbidde vs to doe that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs to doe? Is it because it is at your pleasure to interprete the will of God, comprehended in the diuine Law, and in the Scriptures? But notwithstanding there must no such interpretation bee made, as doth wholly make the law void, and vtterly doth destroy and dissolue the commandement. If there be any thing doubtfull or darke in the Law of God, wee presently flie to the See of <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, to the See which you now doe hold, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the interpretation of the truth: but that which is cleere and manifest of it selfe, that needeth no light of any interpretation. Seeing then our Lord and Sauiour commands vs, <hi>to giue to Caesar those things which are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars, and to God those things which are Gods;</hi> and after by his Apostle, <hi>to be subiect to Princes and Powers, and to bee obedient to them:</hi> It is your part to declare vnto vs what things be <hi>Caesars,</hi> that is to say, what things belong to our King, and what be Gods; that both of them may haue that which belongeth to them: and in this distinction of things we will willingly heare your voice. But when you say, I will haue you giue nothing to <hi>Caesar,</hi> or to your Prince, you contradict Christ, and therefore wee heare not your voice. Wee doe indeede confesse, and professe also, that the exposition and interpretation of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse should take place touching the obseruation of the diuine Law: but we affirme absolutely, that that is not to be receiued, which maketh a scorne both of the Law of God, and of Nature, and bringeth the same into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. As for example, not to digresse from the matter we haue in hand: We are commanded to obey our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magistrates: in the obseruation of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, we as obedient children, doe willingly embrace your expositions and restraints, which doe not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and extinguish the Commandement it selfe: as when you say, that from hence there growes no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey Kings, but in those matters which belong to their temporall iurisdiction: that all spirituall things
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17700:88"/>
are to bee reserued to the Vicar of Christ, and to the Church. Also, when as you doe aduertise vs, that wee ought not to yeeld obedience to the King in that which he commands against the Law of God, or Nature, or which otherwise is repugnant to good manners. But when as you simply and absolutely command vs, <hi>that we doe not in any sort obey our lawfull Prince, or any of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, commandements, and lawes:</hi> wee may not obey this commandement of yours, because this is not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the Commandement of God, which is granted to your Holinesse, but vtterly to abrogate and ouerthrow the same, which you cannot doe by any meanes. Christ when he deliuered to <hi>Peter</hi> the keies of the kingdome of heauen, did not giue him power <note n="h" place="margin">

How much lesse then ought the subiects of Kings to giue eare to the Pope, going about to withdraw them from the obedience which is due to their King by the law of God and Nature, and confirmed with the most straight obligation of an oath? If you will vs to withdraw our neckes from the yoke and seruice of our King for this cause, because a spirituall good is hindred by our obedience, which is giuen to him by vs: wee answer,

that this mischiefe, whatsoeuer it bee, chanceth to fall out by some accident: for simply and of it selfe, euill cannot grow out of good, nor good out of euill.

by the law of God and Nature; and that your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse can neuer, no not by vertue of the fulnesse of your power, dispense with any in the law of God and Nature. Therefore wee will obey you in spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the King in temporall matters. God commands both: wee will performe both. To be short, the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and threatnings, which you insert in your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, we doe wonder at surely, and in some part we feare them: but yet we are not altogether so fearefull, as to bee more afraid of them then we ought, or that we should be so terrified with them, as for feare of an vniust Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to denie to our King the iust and lawfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is due vnto him.

            <p>These and such like, are the reasons which haue so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the faith, as well of the Clergie as Nobilitie, and euen of the whole Commons of <hi>France,</hi> toward their Kings, that they haue resolutely withstood certaine Popes, who haue earnestly laboured to withdraw them from their loyaltie, and obedience of their Kings; and haue scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Popes Bulles, and the sentence of deposition and depriuation from the kingdome: nay more, that they haue not beleeued therefore, not without reason, that they are bound by any Ecclesiastique Censures, or may iustly bee enwrapped in any bonds of Anathema or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. For my part, surely I doe not see what may iustly bee blamed in the former answer and defense of the people, vnlesse it be imputed to them, and be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17700:90"/>
to conuince them of contumacie, because they doe not by and by put in execution, without all delay, or examination of the equitie, euery commandement of the Pope, as though it were deliuered euen by the voice of God himselfe; which I thinke none in his right wits will iudge. As for the other points, they are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on most firme demonstrations, most sound reasons and arguments, and reasons of diuine and humane law: viz. <hi>That it is the commandement of God, that honour and obedience should be yeelded to Kings and Princes, no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or distinction of good and wicked Princes in that point being propounded:</hi> That all the authoritie of the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in spirituall matters: That temporall affaires are left to secular Kings and Princes. That the Pope is not superiour to Kings in temporall matters, and therefore that he cannot punish them with temporal punishments. Lastly, that the Pope can in no sort dispense against the Law of Nature and of God, whereby this obedience is commanded the subiects toward the Prince: and for that cause can neither absolue and discharge the subiects from that obligation, nor by iust excommunication censure them, who doe not obey him when he forbiddeth them to giue lawfull obedience to the Prince. Al which points are seuerally and distinctly concluded before with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, testimonies, and arguments, which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be answered; which notwithstanding I will leaue to the iudgement of the Church.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17700:90"/>
by the continual and solemne obseruation of the ancient Fathers, and the whole Church. For although they had great opportunit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and meanes to pull downe and to defect from their gouernment wicked Christian Princes, by whom they had beene wronged with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and publike iniuries, yet in no maner did they moue any question against them touching their authoritie and rule: they denied them no parcell of humane obsequie and obedience. Only they wisely, freely, and stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted their errours. And so holding the multitude in their dutie towards God and their King, they obserued both precepts, of fearing God, and honouring the King. And in very deede this is the principall remedie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue mens mindes from slipping, and reuoke them from errour; and the most ready way and meane to reduce Kings and Princes, being furiously caried headlong with a frenticke heresie, from immanitie and fiercenesse, to courtesie and mildnesse; from errour to truth, from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie to the faith: which course the ancient Fathers euer held in such like cases: which if the other Popes had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in these latter ages, and had not arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that same insolent, and proud, and hatefull domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ouer Kings and Emperours in temporall matters, it had gone better then at this time it doth with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Common-wealth: and peraduenture those heresies wherewith wee are now sore pressed, might haue beene strangled in the very cradle.</p>
            <p>For euen the issue and the euent of businesse to this day, doth sufficiently teach, that the Popes doe little or nothing auaile, while they hold this high, slipperie, and steepe headlong way; but that they doe more times raise troubles, schismes, and warres, by this meane in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Countries, then propagate the faith of Christ, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the profit, and enlarge the liberty of the Church. How vnprofitable and hurtfull to the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that assault was of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the VII. vpon <hi>Henrie</hi> the IV. (which <hi>Gregorie</hi> was the first of all the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17700:91"/>
Popes that euer aduentured this high course) wee haue sufficiently declared before. But who is ignorant how that same furious aggression and censure of <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII. vpon <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, how little it profited, nay how much it hurt the Church? Likewise that of <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. against <hi>Lewes</hi> the XII. both Kings of France? of <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. and <hi>Paulus</hi> the III. against <hi>Henrie</hi> the VIII. and of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> against <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Kings of England? Did not all these Princes, not onely not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but also contemne and laugh to scorne that same papall imperiousnesse, carried beyond the bounds of a spirituall iurisdiction, as meere arrogation, and an vsurped domination? For the two last Popes, I dare bee bold to affirme vpon a cleere ground, (for the matter is knowne to all the world) that they were the cause that Religion was lost in England: for that they tooke vpon them to vsurpe and practise so odious and so large a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer the Prince and people of that kingdome. Therefore how much more iustly and wisely did <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. who chose rather by a spirituall and fatherly charitie, and a vertue agreeable to his name, to erect and establish the state of the French Kingdome, which began to stagger and sway in religion, then to contend by this same haughty and threatning authority of a temporall iurisdiction? because hee knew that seldome or neuer it had happie issue.</p>
            <p>Out of doubt, for Kings and Princes, who glory not without cause, that they are beholding onely to God, &amp; the Sword for their Kingdomes and principalities, it is proper to them of a naturall greatnes of mind, to desire rather to die with honour, then to submit their scepters to an others authority, and to acknowledge any iudge &amp; superiour in temporall matters. And for that cause it seemeth not to be good for the Church, and Christian common-wealth, that the Pope should be inuested in so great an authority ouer secular Princes, by reason of the manifold slaughters, miseries, and lamentable changes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17700:91"/>
of Religion, and of all things besides, which dospring from thence. In which consideration, I cannot but wonder at the weake iudgement of some men, who take themselues to be very wise, who to remoue from the Pope the enuie of so hatefull a power, and to mitigate &amp; allay the indignation of Kinges whome it offen deth so much; are not afraide to giue out, and to publish in bookes scattered abroad <note n="a" place="margin">Ju libello qui Gallicè inscribitur, Le veritè difendue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

An excellent reason surely, and worthy of them, who put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene Princes and priuate persons, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all with one foot. Surely, these men reach so farre in vnderstanding, that they vnderstand nothing at all. As though that feare wich falles vpon priuate persons, is wont to possesse also the minds of Princes: who hold themselues sufficiently protected and armed with the onely authority of their gouernment against all power and strength, and impression of any man. That reason ought onely to be referred to them, whom the terrour of temporall authority, and the seuerity of ordinary iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, do reclaime from offending with feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; for these kind of people (because they are sure that if they offend, they shall be chastised with some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniarie or corporall mult) doe for the most part ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from doing hurt, not for conscience, but for the displeasure, and feare of the losse of temporall thinges. But Kings haue not the same reason, but being placed on high aboue all humane constitutions, and all positiue lawes, doe giue vnto God onely the account of their administration, whose punishment the longer it is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the more seuere it is like to bee. Against priuate persons the execution of punishment is ready, which they cannot auoid without the mercy of the Prince. But what execution can bee done against Princes, seeing they are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17700:92"/>
not tied by any sanctions of humane lawes, <hi>nullisque ad poenam vocentur legibus, tuti imperij poteslate?</hi> For that it is expressed in the law, <hi>That the Prince is free from the laws:</hi> that both the Latine and the Greeke Interpreters do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, as of all lawes, so especially of poenall, that the Prince although he doe offend, may not be chastised by them, or as the Graecians doe speake, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which is the cause, that Kings being assured, both the greatnesse of their authority, and confidence of their Armes, feare not the losse of any temporall estate, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is not one among a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of them so froward and friendlesse, but that he can find many friends to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his party, by whose helpe and aduice, whether he be to vse sleight or strength, hee supposeth he can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Crowne and scepter. And for this very reason it is so farre, that they will be terrified with these imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lording minitations, to take their Kingdomes away, that they are rather inflamed, and set on fire by them against all pietie and religion. And it is verie certaine, that this temporall power, which the Pope some ages past doth challenge ouer all men, is so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to princes, that euen they, who doe much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the seate of <hi>Peter,</hi> and do acknowledge the great power of his successors in spirituall causes, yet they cannot without indignation endure to heare the speech of this temporall domination. The reason is, because neither in the sacred scriptures, nor traditions of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or any writings of ancient fathers, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any testimony, nay, no token or print of footing of any such authority of the Pope: and that a matter of so great weight, I meane so great a commaund and power of raigning, should bee euicted or wrested from them without the manifest word of God, or pregnant proofe of reason; neither can they endure any reason of law, or indifferencie of equity can admit.</p>
            <p>Wherfore wise men haue euer been of this mind, that the Popes should with much more case procure the peace
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17700:92"/>
of the Church, if according to the custome of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters, they would quietly rest themselues within the bounds and compasse of the spirituall iurisdiction; and that according to their Apostolicke charity they should humblie entreat wicked Kings, requesting, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, protesting with praiers and teares, that they would returne into the way, rather then that they should goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout through this hatefull intermination, to strip them of their temporall authority, as it were through force and feare (wherby they profit nothing or little,) to extort and wrest from them amendement of maners and faith. And if these Princes bee so obstinate and stiffe in their wicked courses, that they can be moued with no teares, nor bended with no praiers; the assistance of God must be implored, and they abandoned to his iudgement. But now let vs goe forward.</p>

But the Church wanteth this temporall aide, when as he is the soueraigne Prince himselfe, who commits that for which hee may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily excommunicate, because he hath no superior, &amp; by no law can be challenged to punishment, being free and safe through the Maiestie of his gouernment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although the Pastor of the Church, or the Pope, may by Excommunication exclude him from the flocke, and so depriue him of all his spirituall benefites: yet can hee take away from him none of those things which he possesseth and enioyeth by vertue of a temporall and humane interest: because goods of that nature are not subiect to Ecclesiastique, but to Politique lawes, which are in the power of Kings. And as no Christian, whether Prince or priuate person, can auoid the Popes iudgment in spirituall Causes: so neither may any subiect of what ranke or place soeuer he be, decline the iudgement of his King or Prince in temporall affaires: for in that the causes of Clergie persons are committed to other then to ciuill Iudges, that was granted them by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular grace and priuiledge of Princes, whereas by the common law, Cleriques as wel as Laiques are subiect to the temporall authority of secular Princes. And this is grounded on that reason, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17700:93"/>
viz. <hi>That Clergie persons, besides that they are Clergy persons, are also Citizens, and certain parts of the common wealth politique.</hi> Hence it is, that vnder the best and holiest Christian Princes, all the causes of Clergy men, as well ciuill as criminall, so as they were not Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticke, were wont to bee debated before ciuill and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magistrates <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide S. cap.</hi> 15.</note>. Therefore the Clergy did owe to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes this their liberty, which in this point they enioy, as we haue declared before in the 15. Chapter. Whereby I maruaile that the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the Pope might simply by his owne authority exempt Clergy men by the Canon Law, from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of temporall Princes. For (that I may speake it with the reuerence of so great a man,) it is as false as false may be. Because the law of Christ depriues no man of his right and interest: but it should depriue, if it should take away against their wils that temporall right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest which Princes before they became Christians had ouer Clergie men. Againe, seeing the Pope himselfe hath obtained this exemption of his owne, by no other right, but by the bounty and grace of Princes (For as the aduersaries confesse, hee was both <hi>de iure,</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> subiect to heathen princes, as other Citizens) it is an absurd thing to say, that he could deliuer others fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same subiection. Otherwise that might agree to him, which the wicked blaspheming Iewes did vpbraid to our Sauiour Christ, <hi>He hath saued others, himselfe he could not saue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this point the authority of the Fathers in Councels, could not be greater then the Popes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place requireth that wee also conuince an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errour which hath sprung &amp; spread very wide out of the decrees of Counsels, not diligently and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly considered, and which reacheth at this day I know not how farre, and to what persons: viz. That Councels haue freed Clergy men from the authoritie &amp; iurisdiction of Magistrates. Which is as far from all truth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17700:94"/>
as may be, for it is no where found in any Councell, that the Fathers assumed to them so much authority, as to depriue secular Judges of their authority and iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the Clergy, or in any sort forbid them to heare and determine the causes of Clergy men being brought before them, vnlesse it were after that by the singular bounty of Diuines, which began from <hi>Iustintanus,</hi> that priuiledge of Court was granted to Church men. For when as these graue Fathers themselues which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and presidents in Councels, were subiect to temporal authority (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth <hi>in expositione cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Epist. ad Rom.)</hi> it could not bee that they should by their proper authority exempt themselues or others from that subiection. Therefore wee must vnderstand that those ancient fathers of the church, amongst whom the Ecclesiasticall discipline did flourish with much seuerity and sincerity (which at this day is too much neglected) vsed all the care and diligence that might bee, that the Clergy should carry a light before the people, not onely in doctrine, but also in inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rity of manners and innocency of life: and for that cause that they admonished all Clergy men, and decreed and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Canons of their councels, that none of them should bring against another any ciuill or criminall complaint before a secular Iudge, but that either they should compose all their controuersies among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the arbitration of friends, or if they would not or could not, that at least they should end them by the iudgement of the Bishop. And surely, they ordered their matters in this manner out of the same, or surely the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like aduice which <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the 1. Epistle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, gaue the Christians, forbiding them, that they should not draw one an other before the iudgement seates of insidell Iudges, and there contend about their differences (which we spake of a little before:) I say out of the same aduice these fathers ordained, that if any thing sell out among the Clergy, after the manner of men,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17700:94"/>
which might be a scandall to the Laitie (as are the faults which are committed of humaine frailety) that the same might with more secresie and closenes be amended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their proper Ordinaries, nor should not come to the eares of the rude and barbarous multitude, which oft times measureth the doctrine by the manners, and is accustomed either to disdaine or to scorne and laugh at these maner of slippes in the Clergy. And moreouer, lest the Cleriques, who ought to bee carefull and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to maintaine peace and concord, and both in word and deede to giue example of charity and patience, should seeme by their often haunting and frequenting of secular Courts, to shew the way to all manner of strifes and contention.</p>
            <p>Then by these decrees of Councelles, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing detracted from the authoritie of the Laickes, but that they may heare the causes of the Clergie men. For the Fathers did not, neither indeed could they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that secular Iudges should not iudge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of Clergie mens causes, being brought before them; (for that had beene to take from Princes and Magistrates that right and authoritie, which the law of Christ doth not permit them to doe) but indeed they did forbidde that one Clergy person should not draw an other before those kind of Iudges, appointing canonicall or ecclesiasticall punishments against them which did not obey. Now this they might appoint iustly and lawfully without wrong or preiudice to any: euen as a good Father that hath many children, may commaund his children, and also forbid them vnder a priuate and domesticke punishment, that they doe not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before a Iudge about any controuersies amongst themselues, but that they cease and lay downe all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and differences vpon the iudgment of their father or brethren: and by giuing his children this charge, he doth not preiudice at all the authority of lawfull Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Euen so the Fathers of the councels haue inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17700:95"/>
their sonnes, that is, the Clergy men, that they should maintaine no action, nor question amongst them selues before secular Iudges, not by taking away from the Laiques their power to heare and decide of their causes, but by abridging the Clergie of their ancient liberty of going so freely vnto them as they vsed to do. And this is not to exempt the Clergie from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and iurisdiction of temporall Magistrates, but only to take a course, by which the Clergie hauing businesse with the Clergy, may easily attaine their right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much noise and stirrings in Lay-mens courtes. And lest any man should doubt whether these things stand thus or no, I thought it worth my pains to set down the very decrees of the Counsels: from which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not well vnderstoode, this errour hath sprung, that from thence the Reader may vnderstand the truth of our discourse.</p>
            <p>The first then which decreed any thing touching this point, was the 3. councell of Carthage, held the yeare of our Lord 397. at which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and subscribed the same. In the 9. can of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it is thus written. <hi>Also wee haue ordained that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Bishop, Priest and Deacon or Clerke, when as a crime is charged vpon him in the Church, or a Ciuill controuersie, shall bee raised against him, if he leauing the Ecclesiastick iudgement, shall desire to be cleared by the publique iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although the sentence passe of his side, that hee shall lose his place, and this in a criminall iudgement. But in a Ciuill, that he foresee that which hee hath wonne, if he: desire to hold his place still. For hee that hath free liberty to chuse his Iudges where hee will, hee doth shew himselfe to be vnworthy of the fellowshippe of his brethren, who concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meanely of the whole Church, sueth to the secular iudgement for helpe. Whereas the Apostle commaundeth that the causes of priuate Christians should bee brought to the Church, and be there determined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any word here, whereby it may be gathered by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17700:95"/>
any probable reason, that the Councell meant to exempt the Clergie from the iurisdiction of secular Magistrates? or doth declare that the Laickes are not competent Iudges for the Clergie? Nay it sheweth the direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: viz. that they doe confesse, that the secular Iudges may by good right heare and decide the causes of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie persons, and that they doe not disallow their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as giuen by an incompetent Iudge; but that they only endeuour this, to restraine the giddinesse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of those Clerickes, that when as a cause hath alreadie beene begun to bee debated in the Church, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking and contemning the Ecclesiasticke Iudges, doe submit themselues to the order and iudgement of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ickes: in which case the Councell doth not disallow the sentence giuen by a secular Iudge, nor pronounceth him to be no competent Iudge, but a penaltie depriueth that Clerke of the fruit and benefite of such a sentence, by reason of his lewdnesse and disorder. Now in that the Fathers of that Councell did at that time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Ciuill Magistrates to bee the competent Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Clergy men; by that it may bee vnderstood suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, that they restrained this their decree to that case, wherein a crime is raised vpon a Clearke in the church, or a ciuill controuersie set on foot against him. Therfore out of these cases, it was by this Canon lawfull for the Clergie without offence to prosecute their sutes in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill court, and to debate their businesse before a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Iudge.</p>
            <p>After followed the famous Councell of Chalcedon, Ann. Dom 451. which also in the 9. Canon decreeth on this manner: <hi>If any Clergy person haue businesse with a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie person, let him not forsake his proper Bishop, and runne to temporall iudgements: but first let the businesse be sifted by the pr per Bishop, or at least by the counsell of the same Bishop; they shall receiue iudgement and order from them by whom both parties were content to be iudged. If any shall doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he shall be subiect to the Canonicall consures.</hi> Obserue
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17700:96"/>
how this Councell directeth her speech to the Clergie, that they should not leaue their owne Bishops, to goe to secular Iudges; but not to temporall Magistrates and Iudges, that they should not heare Clergie men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them; and after the cause debated, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence, &amp; according to the course of law, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to performe the iudgement. Therefore by this Canon there is nothing taken from the authoritie of the Laitie. For those words of the Canon or Decree, <hi>Sedprius actio ventiletur apud proprium Fpiscopum,</hi> doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shew, that the Fathers of the Councell doe only require, that all the causes of Clergie men bee at the first hand examined by the Bishop: secondly, if there bee cause, that they bee carried to the examination of the temporall Iudge. For it is not likely or credibl, that that word, <hi>Primum,</hi> was idly and super fluously set downe by so many worthy and wise men: and so that Canon doth wholly accord with the Nouell Constitution of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi> 82. made in fauour of the Clergie men: <hi>That Clergie men should first bee conuented before their owne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and afterwards before Ciuill Iudges.</hi> Therefore the Ciuill Iurisdiction of secular Iudges ouer the Clergie is not weakened by this Canon, but rather confirmed.</p>
            <p>Likewise in the Councell of Agatha, vnder King <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke.</hi> Ann. Dom. 506. the Fathers which allembled in the same, decreed Can. 32 <hi>That no Clergie man should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to molest any man before a secular Iudge, if the Bishop did not giue him licence.</hi> The which Canon <hi>Gratian</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred into his <hi>Decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um,</hi> not without very foule dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both changing the reading, and wresting the sense; for whereas the Councell had said, <hi>Clericus ne quenquam praesumat, &amp;c.</hi> that he hath drawne to his owne opinion, depraued in this manner: <hi>Clericum nullus praesumat apud s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17700:96"/>
before a Secular Iudge; whereas it is made only for Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men, without any mention at all of the Laitie. Besides, the second part of that Canon doth manifestly shew, that the Councell is thus farre offended with the Laickes which draw the Clergie before Secular Iudgements, and propoundeth Ecclesiasticall punishments against them, if so bee they shall doe it wrongfully, of a purpose to vex and molest them. For it followeth in the same Canon: <hi>But if any Secular man shall attempt wrongfully to torment and vex the Church and Clergie men,</hi> (by moouing of sutes before Secular Iudges) <hi>and shall be conuicted let him be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from entrance into the Church, and from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholikes, vnlesse hee shall worthily repent.</hi> but <hi>Gratian</hi> hath corrupted not only the sentence of this Councell, but also of the Epistle of Pope <hi>Marcellinus, in eadem Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Can. 8. is written in this manner: <hi>That no Clericke presume, in what place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, to accuse any other brother of the Clergie, or draw him to plead his cause before a Secular Iudge but let all matters of the Clergie be determined in the presence either of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bishop, or Priest, or Arch deacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the third Councell of Toletum, which was celebrated Ann Dom. 589. In the raigne of King <hi>Reccare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in the 13. Can there is a decree touching Clergy men thus: <hi>The continuall misgouernment, and accustomed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of libertie, hath so farre opened the way to vnlawfull attempts, that Clerickes leauing their Bishops, doe draw their</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:17700:97"/>
               <hi>fellow Clerkes to publike iudgements. Therefore wee ordaine, that the like presumption be attempted no more. If any shall presume to doe it, let him lose his cause, and be banished from the Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the solemne, and almost the sole decrees of the Canons, whereon they ground their errour, who falsely supposed that Councels could, or in fact did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Clergie from the power of the Laitie: whom the Canons themselues notwithstanding doe so euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conuince, that wee neede not bring any thing else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them, for to represse that conceit of theirs. And these matters haue beene thus discoursed by mee, not with that minde and intent, to rippe vp the priuileges of the Clergie, or because I either enuie that they enioy them, or wish that they were taken from them. They who know mee, know very well in what account I haue euer had, and haue Ecclesiasticall persons. I doe honour the Priests of God, as my parents, and esteeme them worthy all honour: but as an humble childe I aduise them, that they be not vnthankfull, nor disdaine their benefactors, from whom they haue receiued so many priuileges. They are bound to reuerence and honour their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes, as their Patrons, and Protectors, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their libertie; and not (as many of them at this day vse) to denie that they are beholding to Princes for those fauours, but to ascribe all their liberties, and exemptions, and immunities, to Pontificiall and Canonicall Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; which is the most vnthankfull part which can proceede from vnthankfull mindes. For what tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall libertie soeuer they haue, they haue receiued the same, not from the Popes, but from secular Princes; nor from the Canons, but from the Lawes.</p>

            <p>I Will say more, and I will speake the truth, although peraduenture it purchase me hatred of them to whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17700:97"/>
all things seeme hatefull, which are neuer so little against their humour and disposition. Therefore I will speake, and I will speake a great word, which peraduenture ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no man hitherto hath remembred, or if any haue, hee hath not at the least put any in minde as hee ought, whom it concerned to know the same. And that is, that the Clergie thorow the whole world, of what order or degree soeuer they be, are not to this day in any manner exempt and freede from the temporall authoritie of secular Princes, in whose Kingdomes and countries they liue; but are subiect to them in no other manner then other Citizens in all things which belong to ciuill and temporall administration and iurisdiction: and that the same Princes haue power of life and death ouer them, as well as ouer their other subiects; and therefore that the Prince (I speake of him who acknowledgeth no superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in temporall affaires) may either of his clemencie forgiue, or punish according to the Law, a Clergie man, committing any fault whatsoeuer, so the fault bee not meerely Ecclesiasticall. This although it seeme hard, and halfe a paradoxe, to them who being possessed with the errour of the contrarie opinion, doe thinke that they liue within the authoritie and iurisdiction of the Pope only, and that they are not bound to any Constitutions of humane lawes besides: notwithstanding I shall bring to passe in few words, that they may plainly vnderstand, that there is nothing more true then this proposition of mine, so as they be onely willing to open their eares to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare the true reason thereof with indifferencie. The truth thereof dependeth of those things which we haue set downe and prooued before, out of the iudgement of the Diuines of the best note, and shall presently bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by necessary and euident conclusion drawne from thence. First of all therefore, this is set downe, and granted, and also confirmed with most firme reasons and testmonies, that all, both Clerickes and Laickes, were in the power and authoritie of Kings and Emperours, so
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17700:98"/>
long as the Church serued vnder heathen Princes. And this is the ground of our demonstration; with which I will iorne that which hath in like manner beene set down and granted: that is to say, <hi>That the Law of Christ deprs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no man of his right and interest, because hee came not to breake the Law, but to fulfill the Law.</hi> And therefore after that Princes were brought to the faith, it is certaine that all Clergie men continued in the same order and ranke, as farre as concerned temporall subiection, wherein they were before, when their Princes liued in their infidelitie: because the Law of Christ depriueth no man of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interest, as hath beene said. And in that regard, priuileges and exemptions were granted to the Clergie, which they should not haue needed at all, if the Clergie had not remained, and that by absolute right, as before, vnder the authoritie and iurisdiction of Princes. These things are so cleere and plaine, and so witnessed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by so many testimonies and monuments, that it may be thought a needlesse paines, to remember them in this place, or to adde any thing to them. Therefore let vs see that which followeth: I meane, let vs see how our former sentence doth grow out of these principles, by a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest demonstration and necessarie conclusion. It is in no place recorded by any Writer, that the Princes who haue endowed the Clergie with these priuileges and exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did set them so free from themselues, that they should not be further subiect vnto them, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Maiestie, or obey their Commandement. Reade those things which are written of those priuileges: you shall not finde the least testimonie of so great immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie amongst them all. They only granted to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that they should not bee conuented before secular Magistrates, but before their proper Bishops, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iudges. Now this is not to exempt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie from the authoritie of the Princes themselues, or to offer preiudice to their iurisdiction and authority, if they shall please at any time to take knowledge of Clergie
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17700:98"/>
mens causes, in cases which are not meerely spirituall. Nay Princes could not, nor at this day cannot grant to the Clergie, liuing in their kingdomes, that libertie and immunitie, that they should not bee subiect to them in their temporall authoritie, and when they offend, bee iudged and punished by them, but that they must by the same act renounce and abandon their principalitie and gouernment. For it is a propertie inseparable to Princes, to haue power to correct offenders, and lawfully to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all the members of the Common-wealth, I meane, all his Citizens and subiects, with punishing and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. And as in a naturall bodie, all the members are subiect to the head, and are gouerned and directed by it, so as it must needs seeme a monstrous bodie, where are seene superfluous members, and such as haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie of the head: euen so in this politicke bodie, it is very necessarie that all the members should bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Prince, as to the head, and bee gouerned by him, that is, to receiue reward or punishment from him, according as each of them deserue in the state. But the Clerickes (as the aduersaries confesse) <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarm. l. 1. de Cleric. c.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>besides that they are Clerickes, are also Citizens, and certaine parts of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Common-wealth:</hi> which is true, and in that regard they are reckoned amongst the orders of the kingdome, and obtaine the first place. Therefore as Citizens, and parts of the ciuill Common-wealth, they are subiect to the Prince; neither can they, although the Prince would, but be subiect to him in temporalties: and otherwise either were he no Prince, or they no Citizens. Therefore it is a foolish thing to suppose and imagine, that a Clergy man, being conuented for any cause whatsoeuer, (so it be not meerely spirituall) may auoid the Palace of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince, or of him to whom the Prince, vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, hath specially committed the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and decision thereof.

may constraine the Emperor to set and dismisse the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie free out of his power, because the libertie of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie belongeth to the authoritie of the Church. For euen by this we may discerne that this is false, that the Church neuer had greater authoritie then shee had then, when all the Clergie did in temporall subiection obey Christian Princes, and Officers of Princes. Neither was this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption and immunitie granted to the Clergy to increase the authoritie of the Church, for that was no lesse before, but to set them free from vexation and trouble which often times the rigour and seueritie of secular iudgments did bring.</p>
            <p>Hence arose that question, whether it were lawfull for Princes, euery one within his territories, without any iniurie to the church, in some case to reuoke the priuiledge of the exemption of the Clergie, from the intermedling of secular Iudges, and to reduce the whole businesse to the common law, and to the state wherein it stood at the first? Whereof when I was asked not long since, I answered nothing as then, but that it seemed to mee a strange question, and of a hard deliberation to resolue. For although it haue beene propounded by diuers, yet hath not beene handled by any according to the worth of the subiect.</p>
            <p>The mouers of this question were moued by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vsuall reason of taking Priuiledges away, which the Pope himselfe, and all Princes are accustomed to obserue; that is, if either they beginne to be hurtfull to the Common-wealth, or the cause hath failed, and is gone, for which they were granted at the first, or the priuiledged Persons themselues doe abuse them to a wicked and vnlawfull end. And they said indeed that the cause of granting this exemption, doth continue, and is like to continue for euer; that is to say, the reuerence which all men ought to exhibite to that kind of men; but that the abuse thereof was so frequent in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the great scandall of the whole Ecclesiasticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17700:100"/>
that that benefite may seeme deseruedly to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them. Thus much they. But wee will more largely and plentifully decide this matter in our bookes <hi>de corruptione saculi,</hi> if God giue mee life and strength.</p>

            <p>NOw therefore I returne to the argument, which is propounded in the beginning of the 32. Chapter: and J answere, that it nothing belongs to the taking away of any temporall goods whatsoeuer, much lesse of a kingdome. For it is as certaine as certaine may be, that Excommunication, by which only froward &amp; stubborn Christians are separated &amp; excluded from the fellowship of the faithfull, and communion of the Church, doth take from no body their inheritance, and temporall goods. Vnlesse it proceed from such a cause, which the Prince hath by his lawes, especially ordained to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the publication or losse of goods. In which case, not the Pope, but the Prince, not the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, but the constitution of the ciuil law, doth take goods away from the person excommunicate. The Pope surely cannot take any Patrimoniall right, no not from a Clergy man, though hee bee excommunicated and deposed, or degraded by himselfe. <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> non ab homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. de iudic.</note> And indeede the case were very hard of Christian people, if so be that a person excommunicate should forfeite his estate of all his lands and goods, by excommunication alone, being once passed against him, either by the law, or by any man, seeing that his goods being once seased into the Kings hands, doe scarse euer returne againe to the true owner. And so excommunication, which was appointed for a remedie and a medicine to helpe, should proue a mischieuous disease to ouerthrow. For that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son excommunicate, although hee shall bee restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into his former estate of Grace, by washing his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17700:100"/>
fault away with due repentance, should neuer or very hardly recouer his goods againe, being once returned into the Fiske or Exchequer, &amp; peraduenture wasted or giuen away to some body, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore the censures Ecclesiastical, amongst which Excommunication is the most grieuous, doe worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the soules, not vpon the goods and estates of the Laitie: as on the contrary, the bodies of men, and not their soules are afflicted with temporall punishments. Seeing therefore that offenders are punished with the losse of their goods by the auhority, not of the Pope, but of the Prince: Seeing I say, it is not the Pope, that taketh temporall goods from any priuate person, by the power of his Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and by the force and vertue of excommunication, or other censure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the same bee iust and grieuous; but the ciuill Prince onely, who to pleasure the Church, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the wrong done vnto her, is accustomed by lawes enacted of himselfe, to ordaine sometime one punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, sometime an other, at his owne pleasure, vpon the contemners of the Church; how then can it be, that the Pope can by his sole Pontificiall, and Ecclesiasticke authority take away from the Prince himselfe, kingdom, principality, iurisdiction, authority, and all dominion; who hath no iudge ouer him in temporall matters, and is not subiect to any ciuil pains? Is it so sure and certaine, that the Pope hath giuen him by the law of God more authority ouer Princes, then ouer priuate persons? or are Princes tied to liue in harder tearmes in the world, then priuate persons, so as the Church may practise that vpon a Prince, which shee cannot doe vpon a priuate man?</p>
            <p>But that the truth of this matter may as yet appeare more plainely by an other meane, I demaund of these men, if the Pope haue greater authority ouer Kings and Emperours at this day, then hee had in times past, before that he was aduanced to a temporall honour by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17700:101"/>
the bounty of <hi>Constantine</hi> and other Princes? or that his authority at this present is onely like equal altogether: I mean that which Christ conferred vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; which no mortall man can either straighten or enlarge, and which he shall retaine neuer the lesse, although he should lose all temporall principality and gouernment? And if he haue greater authority, whence I pray you should he haue it: from God or from men? surely, neither of both can be affirmed without a manifest vs truth. For will any man euer say, that is in his right wits, that any new authority was giuen of God to the Pope ouer Christian Kings and Princes, from the time that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to raigne, and to exercise a ciuill gouernment in certaine places, and to shew himselfe in mens eyes both with a Crowne and Miter on his head? or if he should say it, were he able to make it good by any reason or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? much lesse hath any such authority accre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And although Christian Kings and Emperours, who haue and doe submit their neckes in spirituall causes to the Vicar of Christ, (such as only professe the orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall faith) yet none of them all passed into the temporall iurisdiction and authoritie of the Pope; none of them, but reserued to himselfe free and vntouched his secular iurisdiction. But if peraduenture it bee found that any hath done otherwise, the same is to be reckoned as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, by which the rule in <hi>non exceptis,</hi> is more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confirmed. Out of this foundation, which is laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most certaine reason, a very good argument may bee framed in this manner:</p>
            <list type="syllogism">
               <item>The Pope hath no greater authoritie ouer Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes temporall, then hee had before hee was a temporall Prince himselfe.</item>
               <item>But before he was a ten porall Prince, he had no temporall authoritie ouer them any way.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Neither hath he now any ouer them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:17700:101"/>
The truth of the Proposition is so plaine, that I neede not vnderset it with other arguments: but the Aslump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proued thus:</p>
            <list type="syllogism">
               <item>No inferiour and subiect hath authority ouer his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and Lord, that he may iudge him in that wherein he is subiect.</item>
               <item>But the Pope before he was a temporall Prince, was inferiour and subiect to Kings and Emperours, as concerning temporall matters.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee had no temporall authority ouer them, that hee might iudge them in temporalties.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The proposition also of this Svllogisme is out of all question, seeing no man can be iudged but by his supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: a superiour I meane in that very point, whereof the iudgement is made. For as we haue often said, <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium.</hi> And in nature it cannot be, that one and the same person should be both inferiour &amp; superiour; in the same kind of authority, in respect of one and the same matter, no more then that the same man should be Father and Son in respect of one and the same. And the same reason doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vse to proue that the Pope <hi>cannot submit himselfe to the coactiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Councels</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">

The Assumption is confessed by the aduersaries, when as they affirme, and clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by reasons, <hi>That the exception, (vnlesse you wil say, exemption) of Cleriques in ciuill causes, aswell concerning their persons, as Gods, was brought or by the law of man</hi>

                  <hi>Bell. b.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cler. cap. vlt.</hi>
               </note>. <hi>For,</hi> (as Augustine witnesseth) <hi>humane lawes be the lawes of Emperours, because God hath distributed to mankind the humane lawes themselues by the Emperours and Kings of the world.</hi> Therefore the Clergy haue from Emperours and Kings whatsoeuer exemption and immunity it is, which now they enioy all the world ouer in ciuil causes, as we shewed in the last Chapter before. And that euen of their meere and free bounty; for they could not bee enforced in any sort by the Church, to grant the Clergy those priuiledges, seeing it is not found to be expressed &amp;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17700:102"/>
prouided by no law of God. And the law of Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth no man of his proper right &amp; interest, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selus confesse, &amp; we haue often signified. And therfore as their owne learning carieth; <hi>Bishops ought to be subiect to Kings in temporalties, and Kings to Bishops in spiritualties.</hi> By all this discourse it followeth, that Clergie men were bound by the common law of other Citizens in ciuill and temporall matters, and were alike subiect to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of secular Iudges, as well as the other inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Cities, before that they were by godly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces endewed with these Priuiledges, of exemptions: and many holy Popes haue honestly confessed, that in this case there is no difference betweene the Bishop of Rome or the Pope, and other Clergie persons. Therefore that which might be done, let vs suppose it was done, that is, that the Pope being as yet inuested in no temporall principalitie, or priuiledge, doth liue vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of an other prince, as his fellow Bishops, and Brethren in France, Spaine and Britanie, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes doe. Would it not be euinced by the necessity of the former argument, that he cannot iudge and punish Princes in temporalties, to whome hee is temporally subiect? Therefore he hath either purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a greater authority ouer Kinges and Emperours, then he had before, through the exemptions and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges granted euen by them; or else he cannot as yet iudge them in temporalties.</p>
            <p>But if any bee so fond perhaps to say, that the Pope hath alwaies had this authority from the first beginning of the Church, viz. to iudge and depose euill princes, but through the iniurie of the times hee hath by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent been hindered, that he could not exercise it: so long as hee was subiect to them touching the temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But now, after that hee hath withdrawne his necke from the temporall yoake of princes, &amp; made himselfe a temporall princes, there is nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that hee may freely put in vre that iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17700:102"/>
I say if any shall vse this vaine ostentation, I must answere him nothing else, but that the things he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth are not onely false, but also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, vnpossible: setting those things downe which the aduersaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and which is most true, that is to say, that the Popes before such time, as they were by godly Princes clearely exempted from temporal iurisdiction, were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to them both <hi>de iure</hi> and <hi>de facto.</hi> For it is impossible that at that time they should haue that power; for that it is not competent, but by right of superiority. Now it implieth a contradiction, that the Pope was by right superiour, and by right inferiour, at the same time, &amp; in the same kind of authority, in respect of one and the same; and the naturall order of things doth not permit that the inferiour, or subiect should commaund his superiour and Ruler. Seeing therefore it is both absurd and impious to imagine that our Sauiour Christ, <hi>qui non venit soluere legem sed adimplere;</hi> should constitute and appoint any thing against the law of nature, and the most holy rule of life, they must needes bee in a great error, who affirme that this soueraigne authority, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we speake, was by Christ conferred on <hi>Peter,</hi> and in his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the rest of the Bishops who succeeded him, when as they bring nothing to proue the same but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine farre fetched reasons, and full weake, patched vp together; of similitudes, comparisons, allegories, and such like stuffe, as you may see by that which wee haue refuted. All which are to be reiected and little esteemed, when as by the position and granting of them, some ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie doth follow, as in this point, or when as more probable and strong reasons grounded vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scriptures and Fathers do maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion.</p>
            <p>The last argument of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is behinde, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation whereof we shall not neede to take much paines. <hi>The third argument</hi> (saith he) <hi>is this: A Shepheard may and ought so to feede his sheepe, as is conuenient for them. Ergo,</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:17700:103"/>
               <hi>the Pope may, and ought, command Christians those things, and inforce them to these things, to which euery one of them in his condition is bound: that is, constraine euery one to serue God in that manner, wherein they ought according to their state and condition. But Kings ought to serue God by defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Church, and by punishing heretickes and schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. Therefore he may and ought to command Kings that they doe it, and vnlesse they doe it, to enforce them by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and other conuenient meanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely I see not what is contained in this argument, which either confirmes or infirmes the temporall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Pope. For the beginning thereof is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be vnderstood of spirituall foode. Now the Popes reuenewes, although they be great, would not suffice to feede all sheepe with corporall pasture; and so the end also and conclusion must be vnderstood of spitituall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion and compulsion: for hee saith, <hi>to enforce by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and other conuenient meanes,</hi> (meaning) <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> For the Pope is an Ecclesiasticke, not a temporall Shepheard, but only so farre as at this day hee hath temporall rule in certaine places. Therefore wee grant the whole argument and freely confesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the Pope by his spirituall authoritie may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all Princes, and enioine them to doe those things which appertaine to their safetie and theirs; and vnlesse they doe it, <hi>also to enforce by excommunication, and other conuenient meanes.</hi> But the conuenient meanes are all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meanes, and not temporall, vnlesse they bee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by a temporall Magistrate. The which point <hi>Iohn Driedo</hi> obseruing in his bookes of Christian libertie, after that he had declared that these two authorities and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were by the Law of God distinct in the Church, and <hi>that all secular authoritie in spirituall matters was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Popes authoritie, so as the Pope, in regard of his pastorall charge, hath authoritie ouer a Christian Emperour, euen as a spirituall Father ouer a sonne, and as a Shepheard ouer his sheepe; that he may iudge and correct him, if he should</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:17700:103"/>
               <hi>fall into heresie, or denie publike iustice to the poore and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or should enact Lawes to the preiudice of the Christian faith.</hi> (all which things we also affirme) he setteth downe no other paine or punishment against Emperours so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, but excommunication alone, because he knew that the Popes authoritie and iurisdiction was content with spirituall punishments, and could goe no further, vnlesse shee would runne out in the borders of temporall authoritie, and inuade a forraine iurisdiction, which by the Law of God is distinct and separate from his. Now this is no conuenient meane, which the aduersaries vse, of deposing ill Princes from their gouernment; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all other meanes inconuenient: both for that it hath scarce euer succeeded happily to the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or the Church, but is accustomed to bring into the Church and Christian Common wealth, infinite ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, by intestine discords, schismes, and ciuill warres: as also, because in respect of the Pope, to whom spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matters onely are committed, such a meane must needes seeme very strange, and to proceede from an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped authoritie.

I shall not doe amisse, if I shall bring into light those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Sanders</hi> which are behinde, lest the curious and obseruant of our writings, should complaine, that any reason of the contrarie side hath beene omitted; and also should imagine, that it is of purpose omitted, because it is so strong, that it cannot bee answered. All the world doth know, especially they who haue with any care and attention perused <hi>Sanders</hi> his bookes, that he spared no paines, and aboue all other men gathered together most arguments to prooue that the Pope was inuested in this temporall authority ouer all Christians, whereof wee speake. But yet it is very likely, that that man was so farre blinded, either with a bitter hatred which hee bare against Queene ELIZABETH, being banished out of her Kingdome; or with too great affection towards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. to whom he was many waies bound; or else with some other, J know not what smoke of humour and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he did not see, how that for certaine and sound arguments, he vsed many shewes, which were not onely false and farre fetched, but euen dissenting from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, and the iudgement of naturall reason. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I transcribe into this place, very compendiously, the rest of his arguments, which as I thinke were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose omitted by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>

By which figure,</hi> saith hee, <hi>what other thing was signified, then that many Magistrates were for this end raised and set vp in the Church of God, that what was not executed by one of them, might bee executed by the other: of which powers, the last and most principall was in the Prophets, that is, in the Pastors and Doctors of the Church of God? For as the sword of Eliseus was reckoned in the last place, which none could auoid, although hee had escaped the sword of Asael and Iehu: so the censure of the spirituall power can by no meanes be shunned, although a man escape the sword of the secular power. For the spirituall power doth not vse a corporall or visible sword, which may bee hindred by certaine meanes, but vseth the sword of the spirit, which passeth thorow all places, and pierceth euen to the very soule of him whom it striketh.</hi>

            <p>First then, <hi>Sanders</hi> is mistaken, and is very farre wide in this, that he imagineth that the Synagogue had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stroke in the abdication of <hi>Saul.</hi> For it is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the whole businesse was commanded, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and in the issue accomplished and executed by the extraordinarie iudgement and commandement of God, from whom is all raigne and power, without any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie iurisdiction of the Priests, or of the Synagogue: whereby it is cleere, that the comparison of the Church of Christ &amp; the Synagogue, or of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the Pope, is very impertinently and ignorantly made by him in this point. For although we confesse that which is the truth, that the spirituall power of the Church of Christ is no lesse, yea that it is faire more, then of the Synagogue: yet therfore, I meane out of the comparison of the power &amp; authoritie of each Church, it doth not follow, that the Pope may depriue a King neglecting or contemning the Commandements of God, of the right of his Kingdome, &amp; instal another in his place, because the Synagogue was neuer endued with that power.

            <p>I let passe, that <hi>Samuel,</hi> although he were a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet hee was not the chiefe Priest, nay not a Priest at all, but onely a Leuite, <note n="a" place="margin">

Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> in the execution of this businesse, did onely performe a bare ministerie, almost against his will, and striuing both with praiers and teares against the same: and hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a speciall charge, he discharged an extraordinarie embassie, being sent from the Lord as the Messenger of his diuine iudgement. And that appeareth by this, that when he came to the King, he said, <hi>Giue me leaue, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath spoken to me by night.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may forbeare this argument, which is to small purpose drawne from the extraordinarie ministery of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> and the reiection of <hi>Saul,</hi> in regard that the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie authoritie of the Christian Church or Pope, hath no comparison or proportion, no conueniencie or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the same.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17700:106"/>
neither to the Church, nor to the Ruler thereof the Pope, by an absolute libertie, and after the maner of God to determine of all kingdomes and businesses, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all things at their pleasure. That onely is lawfull for them, which is comprehended in the holy writings or traditions of the Apostles, teaching their authoritie. Which seeing it is so, there is none that hath any skill in reasoning, but may plainly see, that the argument deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from those things which <hi>Samuel</hi> did, can by no meanes be concluded to establish the Popes authoritie: vnlesse it be deduced either from the ordinarie power of the Synagogue (wherein notwithstanding <hi>Samuel</hi> was not the chiefe) to the ordinarie authoritie of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, or from the extraordinarie ministerie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> to the extraordinarie ministerie likewise of the Pope: whereof the former, from the Synagogue to the Church, although it may be rightly concluded in forme as they say, yet it commeth short for the purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it offendeth in matter; because the Synagogue hath neuer had any temporall power ouer Kings. And the latter is not of force, but in that case, that the same may befall to the Pope now, which befell to <hi>Samuel</hi> in those times: viz. that as the Lord spake to <hi>Samuel</hi> touching <hi>Saul,</hi> so he should speake to the Pope by name, about the abdication of some certaine King, and of substituting an other in his place. For in this case it cannot bee denied, but that the authoritie of the Pope is equall to <hi>Samuels,</hi> and his Ministerie alike in executing the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. But if not, I meane if the Lord hath not expresly spoken to the Pope in his eare, I pray you how can it be, that when he desires by his owne proper autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to thrust any King out of his Throne, that he should maintaine, that hee doth it by the example of <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom God did delegate by a speciall charge, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie mission, to signifie his decree touching the abdication of <hi>Saul? Samuel</hi> knew certainely, that God had reiected <hi>Saul</hi> and all his race, that they should not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17700:107"/>
raigne; for the Lord told him so much. But the Pope knowes not, whether God haue reiected that Prince whom he desires to depose, vnlesse God hath specially reuealed it to him. Seeing there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by the Scriptures, then that God doth for diuers causes tolerate wicked Kings, and contemners of his word, and doth cause them to raigne for the time, <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 34.</note> whom when it pleaseth him, he either conuerteth to him, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth and ouerthroweth. And it happeneth often, that they whom the Pope, who iudgeth according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, pronounceth vnworthie to raigne by their present conditions and state of life, those the Lord, to whom all things are present, declareth to be most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to raigne, their mindes being conuerted to holinesse and grace: whereof not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ong agone we haue seen a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable example now in our age. For who knoweth not (I speake it to the honour and glorie of this great King) that HENRY the IV. who now most happily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth the sterne of the Kingdome of France, and I pray God he may gouerne long, was not onely excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Sixtus</hi> Popes, but also was so reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abandoned, and depriued of all right of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that by their censures they declared him vncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any kingdome or gouernment whatsoeuer; whose iudgement the Lord indeed did laugh to scorne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated that the King, which was reproued by them, was most worthie of a worthie Kingdome. Seeing then these things stand thus, and are altered and changed at the pleasure of God, how can the Pope know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the pleasure and will of God, vnlesse like vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> he be aduertised before? Therefore that which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> saith, <hi>That King who shall refuse to heare the Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the mouth of the Pope, &amp;c.</hi> is true in the case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pope is supposed to excute those things which the Lord shall command him by speciall reuelation. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise what shall we say? <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, did he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disdaine to heare the Lord speaking by the mouth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17700:107"/>
of the Pope, because he would not heare <hi>Boniface,</hi> swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a most proud ambition? that it should bee thought that he might bee by <hi>Boniface</hi> depriued of the right of his crowne, and an other to bee substituted in his place? What say you to <hi>Lewes</hi> the XII because he would not heare <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. being complete armed, and playing the souldier rather then the Pope? did hee seeme to haue contemned God, speaking by the mouth of the Pope, so farre, is both he and his fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To belieue such matters, good Lord, should I tearme it ignorance, or madnesse? But this is enough touching the first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Sanders</hi> propounded by vs.</p>
            <p>His second argument, (to confesse plainely the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my witte) I doe not well vnderstand to what purpose it aimeth. For that it may haue some strength and force to proue the point which is in hand, and to bee consequent and agreable to that which is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we must of force admit two most false suppositions as true and necessary. Whereof one is, That they who either did foretell any thing that should come to passe by reuelation from God, or by his commaundement, willed any thing to bee done, might by their own right, I meane, by their proper authority, and ordinary vertue of then office, without any speciall reuelation, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement from God, commaunde the same, whatsoeuer it was to be done, or otherwise might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and discharge the same by themselues. As though <hi>Ahias</hi> the Silonite, whome God had sent to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> with a speciall charge, that hee should tell him, that he will giue him ten Tribes out of the Kingdome of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> in these words, <hi>Thus saith the Lord the God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: Behold I will rent the Kingdome out of the hand of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and will giue theeten Tribes.</hi> As though, I say, <hi>Ahias</hi> without any such expresse commaundement of God, &amp;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17700:108"/>
without any speciall reuelation, might haue called <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> or any other into <hi>Salomons</hi> Kingdome, or into part thereof. Then which nothing can bee said more falsly, or foolishly. And the other supposition is, that all Priests and Prophets of the old law, had authority to bestow &amp; to take away kingdoms, so farre forth as they thought it expedient for the safety of the people, which also is most false, neither is there to bee found in all the scriptures any example, or steppe, or taken of the same. Seeing then the whole force of this second argument is so grounded on these two false suppositions, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee rightly concluded, except they be granted, &amp; that it is euident enough, that there is no firme conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>ápotestate delegatia Principe, ad potestatem ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The third argument also is euen of the same stuffe; for what relation hath the extraordinary mission of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> for the speciall execution of certaine busines to the ordinary office of the Pope? or what coherence and connexion of these two Propositions can there be? <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> at the Lords commaundement by name; (for that <hi>Sanders</hi> omitted, which notwithstanding could not be omitted without blame,) <hi>annointed Asael King ouer Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and Iehu King ouer Israel, and Eliseus a Prophet for him: Ergo</hi> the Pope may take away and giue kingdoms and principalities as hee shall thinke good?

But as touching the sword of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> whereof hee speaketh: First, hee doth with much learning and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty discourse of the same. That it may bee vnderstood of the same. That it may be vnderstood of the spiritual sword, which is in the Church, &amp; in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Pope, whome no man whatsoeuer hee be, either King or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour can auoide: and which is placed by the Lord in the last place; both for that it is ineuitable, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more to bee feared then the other; as also for that the bodies onely are killed by them, but the soules by this. But afterwards, when hee proceedes after his manner, and by interpretation transferreth that place of scripture, and an other of the reuenge of <hi>Elias</hi> vpon the two companies of 50. &amp; their souldiers, to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authority of the Pope, he slideth into that shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full errour which wee noted afore, which is, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets without speciall commission, or diuine reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might by their owne authority and pleasure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise euen with capitall punishments all those whome God had decreed by a secret dispensation to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon either by miracle, or otherwise, either to manifest the glory of his maiesty, or to vindicate the iniuries of his seruants; and that which God had commaunded to be done onely by one meane, that they may execute by other waies, and meanes as please them; that hereby he may proue as by a necessary conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the Pope (whose authority is no lesse, yea greater in the new law then was the authority of the Prophets and Priests in the old) may doe full as much by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke authority.</p>
            <p>But who doth not know, that God hath granted many things to the praiers of his seruants, and for their takes hath wrought many thinges wonderfully, euen without their prayers, which it was not lawfull for them by any way or meane to attempt, much lesse to execute, if hee did not commaund it first? The reason whereof is plaine and euident in the persons of the Prophets. For
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17700:109"/>
it is cleare amongst all men, that none of the Pro phets had any authority and gouernment ouer the Hebrewes, besides a very few, who were both Prophets and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people and Iudges together, as <hi>Moses, Iosue, Samuel, Dauid.</hi> But the rest, although they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired from God, yet they liued priuately without any temporall gouernment, declaring and executing those things onely, whereof they were aduertised by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God; and all their prescience and fore knowledge was so tempered and moderated from heauen, that they might know and foretell neither all things, for at all times, but so farre as was imparted vnto them by the spirite of God; whereof the Prophet <hi>Iadon</hi> is a witnesse, who being deceiued by the false Prophet, affirming that the Angell of the Lord had spoken with him, did not vnderstand that hee lied, and thereby was cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore, whereas <hi>Sanders</hi> asketh, whether <hi>Elias</hi> could not say to some principall man or magistrate, if hee had beene present; <hi>runne vpon these Souldiers and kill them? and if so bee that Prince bad offended, if vpon Elias his word, he had slaine the Kings subiects;</hi> that cannot be resolued but by the tenor of Gods pleasure known in euery businesse. And therefore as concerning <hi>Elias</hi> in this case; if God did giue him commission to punish such offenders, either specially by the sword, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by any meane whatsoeuer: no man doubts, but that hee might without sinne commit to any man the authority and execution of the sword, and any man without offence might vndertake to execute that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. But if, as it is likely, the Lord had only reuealed so much to him, that he would destroy with fire from heauen those wicked desiders and scoffers:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17700:109"/>
he was onely to expect that, and to practise nothing else against them, after the guise and fashion of men, or giue order at his pleasure to execute any ciuill punishments vpon them, which he might not doe without impietie, because he had receiued neither from God nor man any ordinarie, nor warranted &amp; delegated iurisdiction to do it. And for that cause he had sinned grieuously, if he had willed or perswaded any Prince or Magistrate any such thing; and these also had sinned, if vndertaking his commaundement, they had slaine the Kings subiects <note n="i" place="margin">

Now the reasons he vseth for the strengthning of this opinion of his, are friuolous, and vtterly vnworthy to bee brought by a man of a sharpe iudgement, especially a Diuine for the dicision of such a question. <hi>That seruice, which the sire from heauen did, saith he, could not the earthly sword haue performed the same?</hi> Yes surely could it, and not onely a sword, but also any other weapon, if it had beene vsed by Gods commaundement; neither did any euer doubt of that.

            <p>His other errour is, that he thinketh there is no ods nor difference, if wicked men be strooken with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine thunderbolt from God, or with force of weapons by the power of men: because he saith, that they haue both one weight; for although there be one effect of all extreme punishments, that is, the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the condemned, yet there is much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to bee had, by what manner and meane the same is executed vpon the guilty, because there bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as of crimes, so of paines: and hereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

            <p>HItherto haue I bent the sharpenesse of my best vnderstanding, to enquire with diligence into all the reasons, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Sanders</hi> haue touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temporall authoritie of the Pope. Therefore now it remaineth that with the like care and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I conuert my mind and hand to examine the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples propounded by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which truely is but a poore and a weake kind of proofe. For he pretends that his opinion is proued two manner of wayes, by reasons and by examples; I could haue wished with all my heart that hee had brought forth stronger reasons: the affection which I beare to the Sea Apostolique, doth so affect and possesse me, that I doe very earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire that all the authority which this author doth attribute vnto her, may bee also allowed by the best right that can be. But wee haue heard his reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, now let vs heare his examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is,</hi> saith he, 2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 26. <hi>Where we read that Ozia the King when hee vsurped the Priests office, was by the high Priest cast out of the temple and being stroke by God with a leprosie for the same offence, was forced to goe out of the City, and to leaue his kingdome to his Sonne. For it is plaine, that hee was put out of the City and gouernement of the Kingdome, not of his owne accord, but by the sentence of the Priest. For we reade in the</hi> 13. <hi>of Leuit. Whosoeuer saith the Law, shall bee desiled with the leprosie and is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the iudgement of the Priest, hee shall dwell alone without the Campe. Seeing then this was a law in Israel. &amp; withall wee read,</hi> 2 <hi>Paralip.</hi> 26. <hi>that the King dwelled without the City in a solitary house, and that his sonne did iudge within the City the people of the land; we are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to say, that he was separated by the iudgement of the Priest, and consequently depriued of the authority of raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

            <p>I haue often wondred, and yet cannot leaue wondring, that men famous for the opinion of learning, should commit their thoughts to writing in so sleight and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a fashion, that a man would thinke they had not read the Authors which they commend, or haue not fully vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood those they haue read, or that of set purpose they would corrupt their meaning; which fault is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our age: wherein most of the Writers following the credit of other men, doe draw the testimonies and authorities of their assertions, not from the Fountaines themselues, but from the Riuers and Pipes, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly deriued by the negligence and fault of other men; so as looke what the first haue either malitiously or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently detorted and wrested to another sense, that others trusting to their search and iudgement, doe transcribe into their bookes, for certaine and vndoubted testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Which although it be very seldome found in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> being a faithfull and a cleere Author, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that hee following vnaduisedly <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and others, hath not erred a little in the three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the affirming the Popes temporall authoritie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in propounding the former example, and this following.</p>

               </note> in that storie; <hi>Ioatham the sonne of the King gouerned the palace, and ruled the house of the King, and iudged the people of the Land.</hi> Marke, I pray you, that <hi>Ioatham</hi> is called the sonne of the King, in the life and sicknesse of his Father, and Gouernour of the Palace, and Ruler of the House of the King. Now hee iudged the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause iudgements could not come to the King, through the force of his disease, and the separation by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of the Law of God: as <hi>Lyranus</hi> teacheth in that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17700:112"/>
place. To be short, the Scripture saith: <hi>And Ozias slept with his Fathers, and they buried him in the Field of the Kings Sepulchers, because he was leprous; and Ioatham his sonne raigned in his stead.</hi> Marke againe, that <hi>Ioatham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth not to raigne, but after the death of his Father. Therefore although it bee true, that <hi>Ozias,</hi> by reason of his leprosie, was separate by the iudgement of the Priest, because it was expresly prouided by the Law of God: yet it is not true, that hee was depriued of the authoritie of raigning or enforced to renounce his Kingdome to his sonne, as these men falsely doe auerre. The authority of raigning, and the administration of a Kingdome, doe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very much, and no lesse then in the ciuill Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie and possession. The authoritie is alwaies in the person of the King, and is ioined with the right of the Crowne: but the gouernment and procuration, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, may fall into other mens hands; so as one may be King, and another the Gouernour. Whence they who in the minoritie or diseases of Kings, doe beare the highest place of gouernment in the Kingdome, are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the title of Gouernour, Regent, Tutor, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, or some such like; and they propound nor han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle any publike affaire in their owne name, but in the name and authoritie of the King, being either infant, or sicklie.</p>
            <p>Therefore this example of <hi>Ozias</hi> is so farre from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anything to this temporall authoritie of the Pope ouer Kings, as it maketh very much for to impugne and ouerthrow the same. For if (as he reporteth out of the Apostle, and wee confesse) that all things befell to the Iewes in figures, and if the corporall leprosie, for which a man was separated from the multitude of the children of Israel, and dwelt alone without the campe, was a figure of the spirituall leprosie, that is, of heresie, by <hi>Augustine</hi> his testimonie; to bee short, if the Priesthood of <hi>Aaroa</hi>
was a figure of the Priesthood of the new Law; out of these figures two arguments are appositely drawne to this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17700:113"/>
question: whereof the former doth notably confirme the spirituall authority of the Pope ouer Christian Kings and Princes; the other prooueth, that this temporall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his, whereof we speake, is altogether commenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and forged, vsurped, and contrarie to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>The former argument is framed thus: As the Priests in times past banished out of the Temple King <hi>Ozias,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strucke with the leprosie, that he might dwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citie; so at this day the Pope may iudge, and by excommunication separate from the communion of the faithfull, a King infected with heresie, which is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all leprosie, and so constraine him to dwell without the Citie, that is, without the Church Catholike, vntill hee be cleansed from his leprosie, that is, vntill hee haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured his heresie. But if such a leprosie sticke by him till death, hee is not to bee buried in the Sepulchers of the Kings, that is, in the Church, but in the field, because hee is leprous, that is to say, an hereticke. Now that I said, that the Pope might separate an hereticke King by excommunication from the communion of the faithful, it must bee vnderstood of the spirituall separation of soules, and not of bodies. For subiects ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie their obedience to an excommunicate King.</p>
            <p>The second argument may rightly bee concluded in this forme: As the iudgement of the Priest of a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall leprosie, in the old Law, wrought nothing but the separation of the leprous, and relegation without the Campe or Citie; and as the iudgement of the Priest tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the leprosie of <hi>Azaria</hi> or <hi>Ozia,</hi> could not take from him the right of his Kingdome, but onely imposed on him a necessitie to dwell by himselfe without the Citie, (for in that he did not actually, as they say, gouerne the Kingdome, that fell out, not through the sentence of the Priest, who iudged of the leprosie, but the force of the continuall disease of his bodie) so also at this day the censure and sentence of the Pope, whereby hee iudgeth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17700:113"/>
and declareth a King to bee an hereticke, although it cause a King to remaine without the Citie of God, that is, without the Catholike Church, as hath beene said; yet it cannot take from him the right and authority to raigne: and so the figure doth very fitly conuene with the figured. For in these figures of the old Testament, the image of the authoritie of the Pope ouer Kings is not onely drawne in lineaments, but fully expressed to the life; that if any fit argument may be drawne from the shadow to the body, from the figure to the figured, none can more euidently or assuredly bee fitted then these, from the constitution of the old Law, to the obseruation of the new. But if the aduersaries out of all the figures of the old Law, can shape any one like to this for the strengthening of their opinion, they shall haue my voice for the bell: surely they shall neuer finde mee against them. Therefore now let vs see the second example.</p>

Now that the high Priest did not counsell, but command, it appeareth by those words,</hi> 4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. <hi>And the Centurions did according to all which Ioiada the Priest commanded them: also by these words,</hi> 2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 23. <hi>But Ioiada the oigh Priest going out to the Centurions and Captaines of the Army, said vnto them, Bring her out, meaning Athalia the Queene, without the doores of the Temple, and let her be slaine without by the sword. And that the cause of this deposition and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Athalia, was not only her tyrannie, but also, for that she maintained the worship of Baal, is plaine out of those words which follow immediately after her death: Therefore, saith the Scripture, all the people went into the house of Baal, and</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17700:114"/>
               <hi>destroied it, and brake down the Altars and Images thereof. They slew also Mathan the Priest of Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely I doe not know what mooued <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to thrust vpon vs this example, so remote and farre off from the matter and controuersie: vnlesse because hee had obserued that it was propounded by others before him, fearing peraduenture, lest if he had omitted it, hee should be accused by some emulous aduersaries, of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and preuarication to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. who being beyond all measure imperious and haughty, and not greatly fauouring the societie of the Iesuites, determined to reduce that whole Order to a straighter rule and habit of life, which should bee distinguished from the Secular Priests in colour, forme, or some other outward marke. Therefore I doe muse with my selfe, how they obtained of him that Bull, that they might occupie the perpetuall Dictature of the Vniuersitie of Pontimussa, that is, that they should for euer bee Rectors, or Presidents, against the forme and statutes of that foundation, made by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the XIII. There be that thinke, that the Bull was supposititious, that is, deuised and counterfait. Surely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were true and granted by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> yet it ought not to bee of force, because it was obtained presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his creation: at which time, whatsoeuer the Popes doe grant, is iudged not so much to be obtained of them, as to be extorted from them. <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>That the example touching <hi>Ioiada</hi> and <hi>Athalia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long nothing to this disputation, it appeareth by this, that all our controuersie standeth in this: Whether the Pope bee endued with so great authority ouer lawfull Kings and Princes Secular, that hee may for certaine causes cast them downe from their Throne, and depriue them of the right of their Kingdome, and anoint and inaugurate others in their places. But the example of <hi>Athalia,</hi> is of a woman which held the Kingdome by no right, but by most cruell and sauage tyrannie, by force and villanie, and by the bloudy murder of the Kings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17700:114"/>
house; who stood therefore in that case, that shee might iustly be slaine of any priuate person, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Priest <hi>Ioiada.</hi> But for that such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seemed dangerous to attempt, and hard to compasse against her, who was mother to <hi>Ochozias</hi> the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased: therefore there was great neede of the counsell and helpe of <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high Priest, or surely of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who likewise either by the greatnesse of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or the opinion of holinesse, might assemble, and euen stirre vp the Souldiers and the people to vndertake so noble and worthy an action.</p>
            <p>And that this was done, not so much by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as aduice of <hi>Ioiada,</hi> it is plaine by that which is said: <hi>Ioiada the high Priest sent, and taking to him the Centurions and Souldiers, caused them to bee brought into him into the Temple of the Lord, and hee strooke a Couenant with them.</hi> And that the Interpreters doe note in that place, but the words <hi>iubere,</hi> or <hi>praecipere,</hi> are wont to be spoken of euery man, who hath the chiefe place in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Societie. Therefore there is nothing found in this example, which hath any the least similitude or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the assertion which is vndertaken by the aduersaries to prooue. The assertion is, that lawfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is to say, they who obtaine Kingdomes and Principalities, by right either of Election or Succession, may for certaine causes be deposed from their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Pope. And then what doth it helpe for the proofe of this proposition, to propound an example of a Tyrant, or the killing of a Tyrant? Doe they thinke that there is no difference betweene the true Lords and lawfull possessors, and the spoilers and inuaders of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions which belong not to them? Now whether there were or no any other cause or reason to depose and slay her, besides her tyrannie, it maketh no matter: it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that she was a Tyrant, and a violent vsurper of the Kingdome, insomuch as there was of her part no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance nor barre in Law, but that she might be cast head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17700:115"/>
out of the seat, and bee slaine by any of the people. Which cannot in like manner be said of a lawfull King; whose person, although it be wicked, the Law of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the authoritie of rule, ought alwaies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend, from all iniurie and humane punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as wee haue prooued otherwhere, out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the holy Fathers.

               <hi>THe third example,</hi> saith hee, <hi>is of S Ambrose, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishop of Millan, and by that the spirituall Pastor and Father of Theodosius the Emperour, who ordinarily did reside at Millan, did first excommunicate him for the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which by his commandement was done at Thessalonica: secondly, hee enioined him to make a Law, that the sentence giuen of the slaughter and of the publication of goods, of them who were slaine, should not stand good, till after thirty daies from the pronouncing of the sentence, to the end that if hee had through anger and precipitation of minde, commanded any thing, hee might reuoke it within the space of so many daies. But Ambrose could not excommunicate Theodosius for that slaughter, vnlesse hee had first vnderstood and iudged of that cause, although it were Criminall, and belonged to an externall Court: but hee could not vnderstand and iudge a cause of that nature, vnlesse also he had beene a lawfull Iudge of Theodosius in an externall Court. Besides, to constraine the Emperour to make a ciuill Law, and to prescribe vnto him a forme of a Law, doth it not manifestly declare, that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop sometimes doth vse a temporall authority euen ouer them who haue receiued authoritie ouer others? And if any Bishop may doe that, much more the Prince of Bishops.</hi> Thus he.</p>
            <p>And this example also is very farre from the matter in question, wherein appeareth neither mention, nor so much as any token of a temporall authority of a Bishop ouer an Emperour, or any thing else, whereby it may be concluded by any probable argument, that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17700:115"/>
such an authority doth belong to a Bishop: but wholy belongeth to that spirituall authority of a Bishop which we both in heart acknowledge, and confesse with the mouth, that the pope hath ouer all Christians, of what order or place so euer they be. <hi>Ambrose</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Emperour for an offence committed by the iniust slaughter of many men: doth not this belong to the spirituall iurisdiction of the Church, which at this time <hi>Ambrose</hi> did exercise by his Episcopall authority? But he could not excommunicate, saieth he, vnlesse he had vnderstood and iudged of that cause before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were criminall, and belonged to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Court. Yes, he might <hi>de facto</hi> (as vnaduised Priests doe, whome I haue seene sometimes send out an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, without tendring of the cause;) but <hi>de iure</hi> he ought not, otherwise he should haue beene an iniust iudge, if he had punished the delinquent, party without hearing of the cause. But let it be so: he vnderstood the cause, and iudged him worthy of censure, and therefore did excommunicate the Emperour; what then? <hi>But he could not vnderstand and iudge of such a cause,</hi> (saith hee) <hi>vnlesse also hee had beene a lawfull Iudge of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius in an Externall Court.</hi> Alas, wee are catched in a snare, vnlesse wee beware this peece of sophistry: there lurketh in this assertion, an exceeding cunning deceit, by these words, In an Externall Court. A Court is twofold, Politique or Ciuill: and Ecclesiasticke or Spirituall. The ciuill Court is wholy externall, the Ecclesiasticke is subdiuided into externall and internall. The externall Court Ecclesiasticke is, wherein the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses belonging to the notice of the Church, are openly handled and iudged; and if they be criminall, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken of them by Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, interdiction, suspension, depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or by other means, and oftentimes both the temporall and spirituall or Ecclesiasticall Iudge doe heare the same crime, euen in the externall Court: but each of them in his proper Court, and to impose
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17700:116"/>
diuers penalties, as the ciuill Iudge taketh knowledge of adultery, <hi>vt sacrilegi nuptiarum gladio feriantur.</hi>

But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by <hi>forum externum,</hi> vnderstand the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Court, it is most false which he propoundes; for as the powers ecclesiasticke and ciuill are distinguished of God, so are their Courts dictinct, their iudgements distinct. <hi>For the same Mediator of God and men, Christ Iesus, hath seuered the offices of each power</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17700:116"/>
the Emperour with any temporall punishment. But you will say, <hi>Ambrose</hi> heard and iudged of the slaughter. It is true, but not as a ciuill and temporall Iudge; J say, I did not take knowledge of the crime for the same end, for which the secular Iudge doth: that place out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is very good, <hi>that</hi>

               <hi>many may take knowledge of one and the same subiect diuersly, and after a diuers manner, end and intention.</hi> Jt is the same right angle which the Geometrician searcheth to vnderstand, and the handicrafts man to worke by it. So it is the same crime whereof the Laicke Iudge taketh notice, that hee may punish the offender by death, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, the purse, or by some other temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; and which the ecclesiasticall Iudge know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that for the quality of the offence, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioine spirituall punishment and Penitence.</p>

               </gap>est. If hee constrained him, by what power, by feare of what did hee constraine him? The summe of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will teach vs that, which is thus. <hi>Ambrose</hi> had cast on <hi>Theodosius</hi> the band of excommunication, from whence when the Emperour desired to be deliuered, the graue Prelate denies to doe it, before such time as hee see in him some fruit of repentance; <hi>what paenitence,</hi> saith he, <hi>haue you shewed after so hainous a crime, or with what medicine haue you cured your grieuons wounde?</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour answered, that it is the office of the Bishop, to temper, and lay a medicine to the wound, that is to say, to enioine poenitencie to the sinner: but of the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, to vse those medicines which are giuen him, that is to say, to performe the poenitency enioined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>Ambrose</hi> hearing this, for poenitence and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he imposed vpon the Emperour the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to make this law whereof we speake: which being made and enacted, (for presently the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

            <p>Therefore in this case <hi>Ambrose</hi> vsed no temporall authoritie against <hi>Theodosius;</hi> but whatsoeuer it was he commaunded by vertue and power of his spirituall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; neither did the Emperour obey this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for feare of any temporall punishment: for if hee would not haue obeied, but (as wicked Princes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe,) had contemned both the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the absolution, <hi>Ambrose</hi> could goe no further at all <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. cum non ab homine. de iud.</note>. But because the godly Prince was carefull for his soule, lest hee beeing bound too long with this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall chaine, might through the long imprisonment gather filthinesse and vncleannesse, hee obeied the will of the Bishop, and that hee might obtaine of him the benefite of absolution, hee performed at the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishop, a temporall office, which seemed to bee profitable for the common wealth. Vpon which occasion the Author of the history saith; <hi>For this so great vertue both the Emperour and the Bishop were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. For I admire both; the liberty of the one, the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the other. Againe, the burning of the zeale of the one, and the purity of faith in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> then constrained <hi>Theodosius,</hi> iust as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessaries at this day doe constraine their Poenitents, to whome they often deny absolution of their crime, where they seriously promise that they will performe that office or burden, which in place of Poenitence they lay on them: when as yet they haue no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iurisdiction ouer them. He forced him likewise, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as any of vs vseth to force his neighbour, or fellow Burgesse, when we deny that to him, which hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be done or giuen him by vs, vnlesse hee first do that which wee desire for our friends sake or our own. To be short, it is a common thing that a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained or enforced by reason, by loue, by griefe, by anger, and by other affections and passions of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17700:117"/>
mind, without any authority of temporall and spiritual iurisdiction.</p>
            <p>These things standing thus, it is worth the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this example, that the Ecclesiasticall power doth often with feare of spirituall punishment enforce men to performe temporall duties, as in this place, <hi>Ambrose</hi> did the Emperour; and of the contrary, that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power doth many times, by feare of temporall paines, driue others to performe spirituall offices, as when a Prince compelleth heretickes or schismaticks to returne to the Church, for feare of bodily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or losse of goods: and yet neither can the one impose temporall punishment, nor the other spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but by accident, as they say. The fourth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth,</hi> saith he, <hi>is of Gregory the first, in the Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he granted to the Monastery of S. Medardus, and is to bee seene in the end of the Epistles. If</hi> (saith he) <hi>any King, Prelate, Bishop, or person whatsoeuer, shall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the decrees of this Apostolicke authority, and of our commaundement of what dignity or honour soeuer he be, let him be depriued of his honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Bishop <hi>Gregory</hi> should liue at this day, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that these words of his are taken in that sense, as though he had authority to depriue Kings of their honour and dignity, hee would surely cry out, that it is a calumnious, and a wrested interpretation, and that he neuer so much as dreamed of any such matter; and indeed those things which in other places are left writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, doe vtterly discredite this exposition. These then are the words, not of a commaunder, but of a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, whereby he chargeth and adiureth all kind of men, that they doe not violate the priuiledge granted by him, which if they shall doe, that God will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger to depriue them of honour: which kind of admonition and imprecation is at this day wont to bee added to the ends of the Popes Bulles, and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17700:118"/>
in this manner. <hi>Therefore it may be lawfull for no man to in fringe this page, &amp;c. or of presumption to contrary the same: but of any shall presume to attempt it let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the indidgnation of Almighty God, and of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul; (or that which is the same) let him know that he shall incurre.</hi>

            <p>BY that which hath beene said, the Reader will easily see, that it is true, which before I set down; that there cannot bee found, either in the holy Scriptures, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of holy Fathers, any printe or example of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authority of the Pope: and therefore that they do not well, nay, that they offend very greeuously, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to strengthen an opinion most false in it selfe, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and examples so remote and impertinent. By these meanes they deceiue the vnlearned, and are derided by the learned. I haue already proued very plainely, that there is no force in the former examples, to proue that, which the aduersaries affirme. And for the examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I take lesse thought to answer: For although some of them doe fit the purpose of the aduersaris, and shew that Popes did sometimes vse temporall authority, in the last ages of the Church; notwithstanding because they containe nothing but the singular actions of Popes, who, no man denieth but that they were men, and might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit faults and slippes, after the manner of men, (in so much as it is now celebrated by a common Prouerbe, which we remembred before out of Sotus: <hi>Factum Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficum non facit fidei articulum;</hi> (that is, The act of the Popes doth not make an article of faith:) therefore touching their acts, wherin they haue endeauoured to exercise such an authority, the question and disputation is behinde, touching the lawfulnesse thereof, whether they were done lawfully, yea or no? Neither ought that to moue vs at all,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17700:118"/>
the writers of the stories, who haue in their writings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the acts of the Popes, haue added no note or touch of reprehension, but rather haue allowed and commended them. For I see that there were many reasons for that. First, because all the writers of that time were either Monkes, or at the least Clergy men, who tooke most care, to increase and amplifie the dignity of the Popes: and therefore they were very wary and heedfull; not to reprehend, or checke any actions of the Popes, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them of iniustice. Secondly, for that in those times so great was the opinion of the Pope, that the multitude receiued and embraced in estimation all his actions, as if they had beene done by God himselfe, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Iohn Gerson</hi> said not without reason, <hi>That the common people doth imagine the Pope as a God, who hath all authority in heauen and in earth.</hi> My selfe haue seene aboue fifty yeares agone in Scotland, when as that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did as yet stand sound in faith and religion, that the name of the Pope of Rome, (for so they spake Scotishly, the Pape of Rome,) was had in such reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the multitude, that whatsoeuer was told them to haue beene said or done by him, was esteemed of all men as an oracle, and as a thing done by God himselfe. Lastly, for that a present danger did hang ouer their heades, which danger to this day bindeth the hands, and mussles the mouthes of many, lest, if they should write any thing which was harsh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Pope, or should taxe and find fault with his actions, as well the writer as his writing, should forth with be stricken with the Popes curses; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seeme strange to those, who doe know that the anger and arrogancie of Pope <hi>Sixtus V.</hi> did burne so farre, that as I touched before, hee had determined to destroy, and quite extinguish the trim and goodly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> because hee thought that that excellent Diuine, had not sufficiently inough satisfied his ambition, when as notwithstanding hee had giuen
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17700:119"/>
him a great deale more then he should haue done. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these reasons, this is somewhat, that the chiefe dutie of a story writer, consisteth in reporting, not in iudging, in which regard, many who excelled more in remembrance of things done, then in iudgement of them, applied their thoughts to the historicall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and contenting themselues with the paked and simple relation onely of all occurrents, did leaue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different the equity thereof to all mens censures.</p>
            <p>Therefore although wee owe to those men the true knowledge, and faithfull report of matters passed, which they in their writings reserued and conuaied to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: yet we apprehend and receiue the equity and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of those actions, not from the commendation of the writers, but either from the authority of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or traditions of the Apostles, or the ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church, or lastly from the right rule of naturall reason. And so here will be the point alwaies to enquire and examine the equity of euery action, and to search diligently, not what the author of a story hath praised or dispraised, but what ought to bee praised or dispraised by good right and desert <note n="a" place="margin">

Therefore I stand not much vpon examples, which neither are found and commended in the Scriptures nor are not proued to be worthy commendation, by some of those waies at the least, which we haue set downe. For assuredly, it is a very dangerous matter, for a man to propound to himselfe examples to imitate, being not before weighed in this ballance, and by these waights, seeing that they that apply themselues to reade monuments of antiquity shall more often light vpon more euill examples then good and vertuous.

            <p>These considerations aduise me, not to dwell verie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17700:119"/>
long vpon the prolixe and exquisite discussion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the rest of the Examples, produced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> vnlesse I shall obserue peraduenture, that there is somewhat couched in them, whereby the vnwary Reader may be ensnared, vnder a pretence and opinion of a truth. Therefore for some of them let vs see which, and what they be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fift is of Gregory the II.</hi> saith he, <hi>who forbad tribute to be paid by the Italians to the Emperour Leo the Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker, being excommunicate by him, and by that meanes cut a part of his Empire from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely I thinke in this example the truth of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as it passed is not set downe, although I know it is so reported by certaine Writers of storie. And that which induceth me to thinke so, is both the excellent learning of that Pope, ioined with a speciall integritie of life, and also the testimony of <hi>Platina</hi> in this matter; who amongst all the worthy actions of that Pope, reporteth this, that by his owne authoritie hee withstood the Italians, being willing to fall away from that impious Prince, and to chuse another Emperour ouer them. For so writeth <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina. But then the Emperour Leo the Third, when hee could not openly inueigh against the Pope, publisheth an Edict, that all they who were vnder the Roman Empire, should dispatch and carrie cleane away out of the Churches, the Statues and Images of all Saints, Martyrs, and Angels, to take away Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, as he said: and he that did otherwise, he would hold him for a publike enemie, or Traitor But Gregorie doth not onely not obey so great impietie, but also admonisheth all Catholikes, that they would not in any sort commit so great an errour, through the feare, or Edict of the Prince. With which cohor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the people of Italie was so encouraged, that they went very neere to chuse another Emperour: but Gregorie labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all the power he could, that it should not be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Platina</hi> addeth, that this Pope, <hi>as a most holy man, often admonished the Emperour by Letters, that he would let goe the errours of some ill disposed persons about him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:17700:120"/>
               <hi>the true faith at the length; and that he would forbeart to destroy the Images of the Saints, by whose memorie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample men might be stirred vp to the imitation of vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe giue credit to this Author in this point aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ancient Writers, especially strangers: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that he by the Commandement of <hi>Sixtus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> a Pope, hath written the Popes liues, and that at Rome, where he was furnished with many helpes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Monuments, to finde out the truth of matters that passed in the Citie, and in Italie: which others wanting, as appeareth, did receiue nothing but vncertain reports, and scattered rumours of men, (who many times report that to be done, which they would faine haue done) for a certaine and cleere truth. If <hi>Platina</hi> had in silence passed ouer the former part of the storie, surely hee had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as it were by a secret consent, the opinion of these men, who haue otherwise written of <hi>Gregorie.</hi> But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee was not ignorant that they had written so, (being a man much conuersant in those stories) and yet notwithstanding doth with a plaine contradiction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne their opinion, it is very probable, that hee had farre better and more assured testimonies in the relation of those things which were done by this Pope. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemeth more reasonable, and more agreeable to the truth, to follow <hi>Platina</hi> in this matter, and to note a lie in the writings of <hi>Zonaras,</hi> (seeing it is prooued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they are deceiued many times, who from the relation of others doe commit to writing the sayings and doings of people that liued farre from them) then to blot the innocent life of an excellent Pope, with a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie spot of iniustice and rebellion. For albeit it bee true, that according to his spirituall authoritie ouer all, hee might worthily excommunicate this Emperour; yet he might not prohibit, that the people, being subiect to the Romane Empire, should not giue tribute to Cesar, or pay their customes to the Emperour, so long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Emperour, without the manifest breach of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17700:120"/>
Law of God, and of the Doctrine of the Gospell. And it is certaine that this <hi>Leo,</hi> although impious, continued <hi>Cesar</hi> vnto his death, not deposed from his Empire either by the people, or by the Pope. Therefore I say, that it is false which the Magdeburgers Centuriators doe write, that this Pope, who was famous both for Doctrine and life, was a Traitour to his Country. I say also, that it is false which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> propounds in the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Pope did set a Fine or Mulct vpon <hi>Leo Isau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Iconumachus,</hi> to a part of his Empire: for hee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed no mischiefe, as appeareth by this storie of <hi>Platina,</hi> neither against the Country, nor against the Prince. Now followeth the sixth.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe sixth is of Zacharie,</hi> saith hee, <hi>who being desired by the Nobilitie of France, deposed Childerique, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Pipine the Father of Carolus Magnus, to be created King in his place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I speake any thing of this example, it is worth my paines, to vnfold the darke storie touching the same, and briefly to describe the whole action of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> ioining the circumstances on both sides, together with the opinion, for proofe whereof it is brought: and by this meane it may more easily appeare to the Reader, how small strength it hath to confirme the proposition of the aduersaries.</p>
            <p>First of all therefore, in that story it is worthy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, that <hi>Childerique</hi> and diuers other Meroningi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that were Kings before him, raigning without any authoritie at all in their Kingdomes, had nothing but the vaine and idle name of a King. <hi>For the treasure and power of the State were in the hands of the Officers, who were called the Maiors of the Palace, and who indeede swaied the whole gouernment of the Kingdome:</hi> who were so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Kings, and ordered and gouerned them, as the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17700:121"/>
King <hi>possessed nothing of his owne, besides the idle name of the King, and some allowance assigned him for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance during life, which the Maior of the Palace made him in his discretion, but one poore Lordship in the Country, of a small reuenew, and in that a house, where hee kept a few ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to attend him for his necessarie seruices, and to wait vpon him:</hi> as <hi>Eginhartus</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any then doe looke more neerely into the matter, he shall finde, that in those times there were after a sort two Kings in France: one, who like the King in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hesse, <hi>had onely the name of a King, but no kingly authoritie,</hi> as <hi>Atmoinus</hi> speaketh: but the other, who was called the Maior of the Palace, <hi>in whom consisted the whole authority of the kingdome.</hi> He in name onely was vnder the King, but in authoritie and power ouer the King; so as he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but the name, for the full and absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of ruling and raigning, which also at the last was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by the people, that the soueraigne gouernment which he swaied, might be signified by the title of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne honour. Therfore <hi>Atmoinus</hi> speaking of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> father of <hi>Pipine,</hi> who ouerthrew a huge Armie of Saracens, rushing into France out of Spaine: <hi>King Charles</hi> saith hee, <hi>hauing beaten and ouercome the armies of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vnder Christ the Author and Head of Peace and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, returned home in safetie into France, the seat of his gouernment.</hi> Marke how he calles the Maior of the palace a King, by reason of that royall authority which he bare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that storie is to bee obserued, that the Nobilitie of France, being weary of the slothfulnesse of their idle Kings, did with a wonderfull consent conuert their eies and hearts to <hi>Pipine</hi> Maior of the Palace, sonne to <hi>Charles;</hi> which did so animate him to the hope of the Kingdome, <hi>that hee openly, without nicenesse, affected the name of a King:</hi> which that hee might more easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, without mislike and displeasure of the Commons, he resolued, that the Pope was first to be dealt withall by an Embassadour, and his assent to be required; iudging
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17700:121"/>
indeede, as the truth was, that if the Pope should giue his assent, that the Commons would easily rest in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reason of the holinesse and reuerend opinion of the See Apostolique.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must vnderstand, that <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Pope was generally aduised withall <hi>in the cause of the Kings, which raigned at that time in France, whether ought to bee called King, he who had only the name of a King, and no royall authoritie, or he who by his industrie and wisdome did manage and gouerne all the affaires of the State:</hi> and that hee the same Pope answered generally againe, <hi>that it were better that he should be called King, in whom the soueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie did reside; by which answer the Nobilitie being induced, doe elect Pipine King.</hi> There is no question, but that the Pope was truly acquainted in <hi>hypothesi,</hi> that is, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that <hi>Childerique</hi> was to bee abandoned, <hi>who carried onely the false name of a King,</hi> and that <hi>Pipine</hi> was in his place to bee aduanced to the Crowne. But I suppose that hee answered so generally, for that the proposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered in generall tearmes, carried no note of any certaine person, and left to the Nobilitie of France their iudgement entire and free, to collect from thence that which they desired And so the Pope did not simply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Childerique,</hi> but gaue his assent with the Deposers. But because his consent was especially regarded, therfore certaine Historians doe precisely say, that hee deposed <hi>Childerique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, in that storie it must be seriously and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie weighed, that <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Pope, hauing heard <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> his Embassadours, touching the change of the Kingdome, and deposition of <hi>Childerique,</hi> iudged it to bee a matter of such noueltie, and difficultie also, <hi>as at the first hee durst not entertaine the thought of so great an enterprise,</hi> although that by this time he had vnderstood sufficiently, that the sloth and idlenesse of the Merouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians did greatly endammage the Church and Christian
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17700:122"/>
Common-wealth, vntill such time as hee was certainely perswaded and saw, that the whole nobility of France did fauour <hi>Pipin,</hi> and desire him for their King, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that <hi>Childericque</hi> was the last of the race of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouingians</hi> without children, so dull and blockish, <hi>That he could not tell how to grieue for the losse of his kingdome, as was fit for him, neither was there any that would mone his case.</hi> These were the inducements, which being ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a speciall loue &amp; affection, which the Pope did beare to <hi>Pipine</hi> (for that he and his father <hi>Charles,</hi> had with many good offices deserued well of the Church of Rome and Apostolicke Sea,) did moue <hi>Zacharie</hi> to essent to the French, who desired this change of their Kings.</p>
            <p>These things although they be in this manner writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten touching this businesse, yet haue we great cause to doubt of the iustice of that fact. I know that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in other places out of too much good opinion of the equity of this fact of <hi>Zachary,</hi> doth boldly affirme, that no sober man wil deny that that Act was iust. But he alledgeth nothing, but that the wisest man liuing may affirm for all that, that it was iniust. I say he brings no probable and forcible reason, whereby a wise man may perswade himselfe, that the Pope did iustly assent to the French men in the deposition of <hi>Childericke,</hi> since that in no case, we ought to doe ill, that good although it be very great may come thereof. Now wee haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienly declared, that for a lawfull King to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by his owne subiects, or to consent to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, seeing hee hath God onely aboue him, to whome onely he is bound to yeeld account of his actions, is by it selfe, and simply euill. And the two reasons which he vseth to iustifie the iustice of that deposition, are so vncertaine and friuolous, that I wonder that they were ouer propounded by him. For first, in that he measures the equity of this fact of <hi>Zachary</hi> by the euent of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17700:122"/>
businesse, as though the action must be accounted iust, because that change of the Kingdome had prosperous and happy successe, <hi>(especially,</hi> saith he, <hi>since the euent doth teach, that that change was most happy.)</hi> it is so triuiall and childish, that it was not to be conceiued, much lesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in writing by such a man,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Careat successibus opto,</l>
               <l>Quisquis ab euentu facta not anda putes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For what I pray you? Was not afterwards in the same Kingdome of France the change from the Carolouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Capeuingii made with great iniustice? <hi>For Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Capet a man of a great mind, and might in the state, when none was able to represse or encounter his practises, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped the Kingdom by force &amp; arms, &amp; obtained the crown, taking the true heire, and casting him into prison.</hi> For which fact <hi>Gaguinus</hi> calleth him an vsurper of the Kingdome. And yet all the world doth know that that change was most happy, and as some thinke, done by the secrete iudgement of God, that <hi>Pipine</hi> who had wrongfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Kingdome from the <hi>Merouingij,</hi> should at the last suffer the like wrong in his posterity. Therefore the <hi>Carolouingians</hi> did not so long hold the Kingdome, if they bee compared with the <hi>Capeuingians.</hi> And the <hi>Capeuingians</hi> haue the gouernement much longer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in their house, and as J hope will haue for euer.</p>
            <p>The second reason also, is no whit stronger which he draweth from the holinesse of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Bishoppe, who at the commandement of <hi>Zacharie</hi> anointed and crowned <hi>Pipine</hi> King. <hi>Adde,</hi> saith he, <hi>to these, that hee who anointed and crowned King Pipine by the Popes commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a most holy man, viz. B.</hi> Boniface <hi>Bishoppe and Martyr, who surely would neuer haue beene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of iniustice, and of a publicke offence.</hi> This I say is a very light argument, and of no waight. For in that businesse <hi>Boniface</hi> was onely a Minister of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17700:123"/>
commaundement, and therefore it was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to his holinesse, which he executed at the Popes commaundement: for he was bound to execute the Popes sentence, <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap. Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> §. <hi>quia vero de off. tud. del g.</hi>
               </note> although he knew it to be iniust: and therefore <hi>although the iniustice of the commaundement had made Zacharie guilty, yet Boniface had beene declared to bee innocent by the order of seruing, and necessity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

But this <hi>Zacharie</hi> was a good Pope. It may bee so, wee denie it not, so was <hi>Dauid</hi> a good King, and holy, and <hi>Theodosius</hi> a good Emperour: <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Liberius</hi> were both good Popes, and yet not one of these but committed some things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of blame. Why then might not <hi>Zacharie</hi> also serue his owne malice or loue, and after the manner of men in some part violate iustice? It is well knowne that <hi>Zacharie</hi> in those times did stand in extream need of <hi>Pipines</hi> aid, against the iniuries of <hi>Aistulphus</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardes;</hi> and was not that a strong engine to batter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, thinke you? loue, hatred, and a proper gaine, make that a Iudge many times doth not know <note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>But to striue no longer about the equity of this act of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> let it bee as they would haue it, let vs grant that that Act was most iust: what strength doe they winne by this, to make good the temporall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they giue to the Pope ouer Princes? is it any more, then that by the patterne of that action, the Pope may now doe, as then <hi>Zacharie</hi> did? which is, that hee may giue his consent to a people for the like causes &amp; respects to put down their king? that is to say, if he bee a King, that hath onely the Name, and not the authority or power of a King, who also hath no issue, like to die in orbitie, and of mind so slothfull and so blockish, that hee may bee deposed without any

bloudshed, and of a Prince may bee made a priuate person, no man moaning his fortune, no man follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his party. For an argument from an example is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vnlesse the cases and causes be alike in each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. Therfore this example of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> What maketh it to establish that infinite authority, wheron the Popes relying in the following ages, haue attempted, and sometimes gloried that they could vndertake mighty Kings, abounding in all manner of wealth, excelling in strength both of mind and body, not at the request of the people, nor by consent onely, but of their proper motion, by warres, by murther, by Schismes, by great miseries of the Christian common-wealth, to depriue them of their Kingdomes, and to spoile them of their crownes and scepters? Will any wise man iudge that this is lawfull for them to doe, by the example of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> his Act? But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough.</p>
