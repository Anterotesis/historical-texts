            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Parochial Session</hi> is constituted of
One <hi>Minister,</hi> or More, with a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Number of <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> (their <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri
non Docentes</hi>) and <hi>Deacons.</hi> It meets
once a Week, or oftner, if there be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and takes Cognizance of all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Cases</hi> concerning <hi>External Order,</hi>
and <hi>Censure.</hi> If there be but One Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57301:5"/>
they can agree upon't; and they are all
of them Equal in Honour, and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
There passes no Act without the
Joynt Consent of the <hi>Minister, Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and <hi>Deacons;</hi> or <hi>Plurality of Votes;</hi>
and Note, that the <hi>Minister</hi> has no <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Voice.</hi> The Power of <hi>Binding,</hi> or
<hi>Loosing;</hi> of <hi>Censures Ecclesiastical;</hi> and of
<hi>External Order,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> is Radically,
and Equally in All: So that the <hi>Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and <hi>Deacons</hi> have as much <hi>the Power
of the Keys,</hi> as the <hi>Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To support this Jurisdiction, they have
their <hi>Four Sacred Orders,</hi> which they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to be of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> First. Their
<hi>Preaching Elders.</hi> (whom they call <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>)
Secondly. Doctors (or University
Professors.) Thirdly. <hi>Lay,</hi> or <hi>Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
who have as much Authority in
the Debate, and Decision of Matters of
Faith, Worship, Polity, Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
as the <hi>Preaching-Elders.</hi> Fourthly.
<hi>Deacons.</hi> Take notice that their <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi>
and <hi>Deacons</hi> are <hi>Annual,</hi> and Consequently
one Year Sacred, and Another Profane.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Session</hi> meddles only with things

and <hi>Peculiar Service;</hi> the <hi>Censure</hi>
of <hi>Lesser Scandals;</hi> as Fornication, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
Scolding, Sabboth-breaking,

themselves to the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their <hi>Censures,</hi> they impose <hi>Civil
Punishments,</hi> and <hi>Fines;</hi> they Emprison
Offenders at pleasure; Cart them through
the Town; set them in Pillories; Shave
one Half of their Heads; Cut off their
Beards: Nay, they take upon them by
their own Authority to <hi>Banish</hi> whom
they <hi>please</hi> out of the Bounds of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
which is a Direct Usurpation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power:</hi> In Case of a Pecuniary
Mulct inflicted, or of a Child born in
Fornication, they will not allow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
to be Baptiz'd, if either of the Parents
have not paid the Fine, or secur'd it, or
satisfi'd the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbytery</hi> is next; and it is made
up in some places, of <hi>More,</hi> in others,
of <hi>Fewer Parishes,</hi> and the King himself
is not Exempt from the Power, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction

is Compos'd of all the <hi>Parochial
Ministers</hi> within its Compass, and a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi>
for <hi>Each Parish:</hi> so that the <hi>Lay-Elders</hi>
are Equal to the <hi>Preaching Elders</hi>
both in Number, and Power; and a
Botchers Vote goes as far under that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
in Divine Matters, as the Voice
of the most Reverend, and Learned of
the Clergy; only a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> cannot

from every <hi>Individual Parish.</hi> 2. Of all

They meet commonly once a Week,
or a Fortnight; at which Meetings, all
the Ministers, in their Turns, <hi>Exercise</hi>
(as they call it) in the expounding, and
applying of Texts of Scripture: In these
<hi>Exercises</hi> they have a sort of People which
they call <hi>Expectants</hi> of such or such a
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> who are Licensed to Preach
in any Parish-Church within its Bounds.
These <hi>Expectants</hi> have usually some smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in Divinity; as Country-School-Masters,
or the like: and they are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd
to do all <hi>Ministerial Acts,</hi> except
<hi>Baptizing,</hi> or Administring the <hi>Lord's
Supper;</hi> without <hi>Holy Orders, Imposition
of Hands,</hi> or any Qualification for the
Sacred Function. There are more or
fewer Presbyteries in a County, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Number of Parishes; but all
of them Independent One from Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If the King himself be Cited, he
must <hi>Appear,</hi> or be <hi>Excommunicate</hi> for
<hi>Contempt;</hi> and submit his Earthly Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to their <hi>Scepter of Christ,</hi> as they term
it, and from thence, receive <hi>Christ's Laws,</hi>
and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> As no <hi>Person</hi> is Exempt,
so neither is any <hi>Crime</hi> whatsoever that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57301:7"/>
is either Committed, or suspected to be
Committed within the Limits of their
Jurisdiction; but they hook it in, as <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to a Christian Profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Provincial Synode</hi> is an <hi>Associate Body</hi>
of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> chosen out of all the
<hi>Individual Presbyteries,</hi> within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
of the Province: they meet twice or
thrice a year, and Exercise an Over-ruling
Power over all the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> within that
Province, in such manner as the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
superintends the <hi>Parochial Session.</hi>
In this <hi>Iudicatory</hi> the Leading men of the
Faction lay their Heads together; form
their Projects; and when the <hi>Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
return from hence to their several
<hi>Presbyteries,</hi> they intimate to the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ministers what Points they are to
Preach upon, for the Advancement of
those Designs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>General Assembly</hi> is <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and
<hi>Independent:</hi> Hither lies <hi>the Last Appeal,</hi>
and the Jurisdiction of it is Universal in
what concerns <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> and

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57301:7"/>
They look upon themselves as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
Entrusted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and to
Him only do they hold themselves Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable.
Whosoever does not obey
this Sovereignty, (tho' the King himself)

They Vote, (tho' against the Kings Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and Conscience) he is bound to
see it put in Execution, upon pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Excommunicate,</hi> and <hi>Depos'd</hi> from his
<hi>Government.</hi> And if any thing be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in this Assembly, as <hi>Spiritual,</hi> (tho'
never so hazzardous to the Crown) if
they tell you that it is for <hi>Christ's Glory,</hi>
there's no opposing of it in favour of
the Publick Peace, or State. The Proper
<hi>President</hi> is a <hi>Preaching Elder,</hi> and this
<hi>Iudicatory</hi> they accempt as <hi>Christ's highest
Tribunal upon Earth,</hi> from whence there
lies no <hi>Appeal.</hi> They are oblig'd to meet
once a year, and they Indict, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
themselves by their own Power,
without allowing the King to appoint ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Time, or the Place, only if there
be any Occasion of meeting before the

Accompt of it to the King.</p>
               <p>The steps by which they mounted to
this Arbitrary Jurisdiction were, A <hi>Dislike,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57301:8"/>
First, Of the <hi>Church-Government.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Of the <hi>Church-Governours.</hi> Thirdly,
They propos'd a <hi>Reformation</hi> after the
<hi>Geneva</hi>-Copy; which not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
Fourthly, They fram'd a Model
of their Own. And lastly; by Fraud,
Violence, and Rebellion they Impos'd
it upon the Nation.</p>

it was order'd, <hi>That the</hi> Comitial

who so proper Instruments as They, for
the Promoting of another Rebellion in
<hi>England?</hi> Their Book of <hi>Discipline</hi> was
review'd, and put in Practice, in 1587.
In 1589 it was Perfected, and in the Year
following, the Conspiracy was detected;
when, upon Examinations of <hi>Littleton,
Edmunds, Iohnson, Barbon, Holms, Brown,
&amp;c.</hi> it appear'd, that the Discipline was
Fram'd, Subscrib'd, and Carry'd on, in

               </p>
               <p>By Publique Justice upon some of the
Principal Incendiaries, and King <hi>Iames</hi>
his Vigilance, and Care afterwards, the
<hi>Consistorians</hi> were for a long time kept
within some tolerable Compass. Their
Mouths were stopt, upon the Conference
at <hi>Hampton-Court, Anno</hi> 1603, with a
strict Proclamation for the Observing of
an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in the <hi>Church: Episcopacy</hi>
was restor'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1610, and an
Act pass'd in a General Assembly at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen</hi>
in 1616, Authorizing the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57301:10"/>
and Framing a Publique Form of
Liturgy, or Book of Common Prayer
to be first presented to the King, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Approbation, to be Universally
receiv'd throughout the Kingdome:
Which Book, pursuant to the Act, was
by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> sent
up to his Majesty, and by himself, and
his Order, Examin'd, Corrected, and
Return'd: But his Majesty dy'd before it
could be put in Practice. And this was
the Book, which with very little Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and That too, in favour of their
pretended Scruples, was by the late King's
Proclamation in 1637, commanded to
be publickly Us'd in all Counties of that
Kingdome. There were also diverse
of the <hi>English</hi> Rites and Ceremonies
settled in 1618, by Five Articles that
pass'd the Assembly at <hi>Perth;</hi> Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
cost King <hi>Iames</hi> an Expensive Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Year before; where
he was forc'd to tell them plainly, in a
Speech at St. <hi>Andrews, That it was a Power
belonging to all Christian Princes to order
Matters in the Church;</hi> and that <hi>he would
never regard what they Approv'd, or Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57301:10"/>
except they brought him a Reason
which he could not Answer.</hi> To which,
upon Consideration they made his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
this Return, <hi>That if he would grant
them a Free Assembly, they would therein sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his Majesty in all the Points he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</hi>
The King depending upon it,
return'd into <hi>England,</hi> and the day of
the Assembly being come, and nothing
done according to their Promise; his
Majesty went a short way to Work with
them, and took away their <hi>Augmentations,</hi>
that he had formerly allow'd them out
of the Exchequer, which brought down
their Stomacks, and made Way for the
passing of the aforesaid Articles.</p>
               <p>It is not my Intent to write any thing
more of the History of the Times, than
what I find pertinent to my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpose:
so that passing over the Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
and Mutinous Dispositions that
appear'd in the Remainder of King
<hi>Iames;</hi> and the First Seaven or Eight Years
of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign; I shall only
tell you, by way of Introduction to what
follows, that the late King (having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
order'd a Convention of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57301:11"/>
Estates) upon the 13th of <hi>May,</hi> 1633.
began his Journey towards <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in order to his Personal <hi>Coronation,</hi>
where he was receiv'd with a Pomp, and
Acclamation, befitting the Dignity, and
the Solemnity of the Occasion. His first
Work was to ratifie the Laws, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of his Predecessour, in Relation to
<hi>Church-Government;</hi> which pass'd not
without some Opposition: but the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Surrenders</hi> went yet nearer
them, tho' both the <hi>Owners of Lands,</hi>
and the <hi>Ministers</hi> were so abundantly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd,
that <hi>the Former</hi> (as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
says in his large Declaration, <hi>pag. 9.)
acknowledg'd it as a Deliverance from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Bondage, under which They and
their Ancestours, ever since the Reformation
of Religion, had grievously Groan'd; and
the Other, with Infinite Gratitude Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Majesty, as the Father, and Founder
of their Churches.</hi> The Case was this,
(as <hi>Heylin</hi> renders it in his <hi>Cyprianus
Anglicus, pag. 224.) In the Minority of
King</hi> James, <hi>the Lands of all</hi> Cathedral
Churches, <hi>and</hi> Religious Houses, <hi>which
had been settl'd on the Crown by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57301:11"/>
were shar'd among the Lords, and
Great Men of that Kingdom, (by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
of the Earl of</hi> Murray <hi>and some
other of the</hi> Regents,) <hi>to make them sure
unto that side: and They, being thus pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
of the Lands, with the Regalities,
and Tithes belonging to these Ecclesiastical
Corporations, held the Clergy to small Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
and the Peasantry in Vassallage.</hi>
His Majesty was advis'd by Council, to
take them into his own hand, <hi>the present
Occupants having no other Title to them,
than the Vnjust Vsurpation of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi>
And this was carri'd in such a
Manner too, that the very <hi>Nobility,</hi> and
<hi>Lay-Patrons</hi> could not open their Mouths
against it; for they were satisfi'd for
their Tithes, to the Uttermost Farthing,
only they lost the Dependency of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> upon them, by Virtue
of these Tithes, and Consequently the
Power of making a Party to Embroil the
Government. They contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within the Bounds of Libels, and
Clamours, till that Rebellious Outrage
in the great Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> on the
23 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1637. Which was no more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57301:12"/>
than the Emprovement of an Occasion
to put the Principles of the <hi>Consistory</hi> in
Execution. I'le make some amends for
the length of this Digression, by Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self upon the <hi>Discipline</hi> which was
afterward Erected in <hi>England,</hi> after the
<hi>Scotch Pattern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be a hard matter to pass from
1637, to 1648 without taking some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Horrid Distempers in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval:
I shall only tell you that after three
or four Years spent in Dissolving the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Government, and Debating what
we should have in the Place of it; Out
comes the <hi>Directory, Ian.</hi> 3. 1644. with
an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi>
for the Authorizing of it. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>Aug.</hi> 23. 1645. another <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
for the more effectual Execution of it;
which was follow'd, <hi>Iun.</hi> 5. with an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>
for the present Settling of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further Delay, and <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. 1646.
with <hi>Directions for the Chusing of</hi> Ruling-Elders
<hi>in all the</hi> Congregations, <hi>and in
the</hi> Classical Assemblies <hi>for the Cities of</hi>
London, <hi>and</hi> Westminster, <hi>and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57301:12"/>
Counties of that Kingdom, in order to
the speedy settling of the</hi> Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
There pass'd also an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
for <hi>the manner of</hi> Ordination <hi>of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
with Rules for Examination, and
Suspension from the Holy Supper,</hi> &amp;c.
And Another of <hi>Ianuary 29. 1647. for
the speedy dividing, and settling the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Counties of this Kingdom into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
Classical Presbyteries, <hi>and</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational

Government, <hi>to be us'd in the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>agreed upon by the
Lords and Commons assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after Advice had with the Assembly
of Divines.</hi> And all This, toward the
Promoting of an Union with the Kirk
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I should have told you of
the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Iun.</hi> 12. 1643. for the
calling an <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Learned,</hi> and <hi>Godly
Divines,</hi> to be consulted with by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for the settling of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church: The Knights of
every Shire to make Choice of Two, that
should serve as Members for That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and These, in Conjunction with so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57301:13"/>
many of the Members of Both Houses,
as might serve to inspect their Actions,
took upon them the Powers, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Convocation.</p>
               <p>The Form of their Government was
the same with That of <hi>Scotland:</hi> They
had their <hi>Congregational, Classical, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,</hi>
and <hi>National Assemblies;</hi> with
the same degrees of <hi>Subordination,</hi> and
Vested, in Proportion, with the same
Powers. They had their <hi>Expectants</hi> too,
and the Constitution of their several <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories</hi>
was the very same; only the
Lords, and Commons (under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Committee for judging of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal)
were so wise as to reserve the <hi>Last
Appeal</hi> to <hi>Themselves,</hi> which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lodg'd in the <hi>General Assembly;</hi> by
which Device, the <hi>Schism</hi> was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> whereas in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it was the clear contrary. And they
had also another Hank upon them, in
appointing that the <hi>National Assembly</hi>
should meet upon a Summons by <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and then sit, and continue, as the
Parliament should order, and not Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
for they were not able to consent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57301:13"/>
(they said) in a Declaration of the House
of Commons, <hi>Apr.</hi> 17. 1646.) to their
<hi>Granting of an</hi> Arbitrary, <hi>and</hi> Unlimited
Power, <hi>and</hi> Jurisdiction, <hi>to near</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Judicatories, <hi>to be Erected in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which could not be consistent with the
Fundamental Laws, and Government of it;
and which, by necessary Consequence, did
Exclude the Parliament from having any
thing to do in That Iurisdiction.</hi> But the
Nation is never the better yet for This
Caution, so long as the <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and the
<hi>Slavery</hi> is still the <hi>same.</hi>

for Subjects not to Obey the Wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Princes, but they must Resist them;
and Deliver the Children of God out of the
hands of their Enemies, as we would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Sheep that is in danger to be devour'd
by a Wolf. If the Magistrate shall refuse to
put Mass-Mongers, and false Preachers to
Death, the People (in seeing it perform'd)
shew that Zeal of God which was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57301:16"/>
in <hi>Phineas.</hi> Subjects do promise Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that the Magistrate might Help
them; which if he does not, they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
of their Obedience. If Magistrates
without Fear transgress God's Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and Command others to do the like,
they are no more to be taken for Migistrates,
but to be Examin'd, Accus'd, Condemn'd,
and Punish'd, as Private Transgressors. Evil
Princes ought by the Law of God to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and Inferiour Magistrates ought chiefly
to do it. <hi>And now hear</hi> Gilby <hi>to the same
Tune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kings, Princes, and Governours have
their Authority of the People, and upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
the People may take it away again,
as men may revoke their Proxyes, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Atturney. It is Lawful (<hi>sayes he</hi>)
to kill wicked Kings, and Tyrants; the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
did kill the Queen's Highness <hi>Athalia:
Jehu</hi> kill'd the Queens Majesty <hi>Jesabel:
Elias,</hi> being no Magistrate, kill'd the Queen's
Majesty's Chaplains, <hi>Baal's Priests:</hi> These
Examples are left for our Instruction, where
Iustice is not Executed, the State is most
Corrupt. If neither the Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
(<hi>says he</hi>) nor the greatest part of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57301:16"/>
the People will do their Offices; (in Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Deposing, or Killing of Princes) then
the Ministers must Excommunicate such a
King. <hi>It would be Endless to follow these
Instances as far as they would carry me;
so that I'le back now again into</hi> Scotland;
<hi>and you will find them much of the same
Opinion under</hi> Charles <hi>I. as they had been

Refusal (<hi>to give them the Power

the People, and ought to be Obey'd by the

This Proceeding,</hi> Both Houses <hi>pass'd this

Votes. <hi>First;</hi> That it appears, That
the King (Seduc'd by Wicked Counsel) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make War against the Parliament,
who, (in all their Consultations, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
have propos'd no other End unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but the Care of his Kingdoms, and
the Performance of all Duty, and Loyalty
to his Person. <hi>Secondly;</hi> That whensoever
the King maketh War upon the Parliament,
it is a Breach of the Trust reposed in Him
by his People, Contrary to his Oath, and
tending to the Dissolution of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Thirdly;</hi> That whosoever shall Serve,
or Assist him in such Wars, are Traytors, by
the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom,
&amp;c. <hi>And Persuant to these Votes,</hi> Iuly 12.
<hi>they</hi> Resolve, That an Army shall be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Rais'd for the Safety of the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
Defence of Both Houses of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and of Those who have Obey'd their
Orders, and Commands; and preserving
of the True Religion, the Laws, Liberty, and
Peace of the Kingdom. <hi>pag. 457. All these</hi>
Votes, <hi>and</hi> Declarations, <hi>they cause, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57301:21"/>
all Solemnity to be Printed, and Publish'd:
but at the same time,</hi> his Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,

Contrary to Law. <hi>pag.</hi> 449. And all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

Proclaim the same. The King's Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Disturbers of the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<hi>pag. 478. And again, pag.</hi> 576.
All such Persons as shall, upon any Pretence
whatsoever, Assist his Majesty in this War,

you will find Maliciously enough
Defus'd in their <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of <hi>May</hi>
the 26. 1642. <hi>pag.</hi> 263. And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of That Declaration summ'd up
with great Exactness, in his Majesties
Answer to it, contracting the Venome
of it into These <hi>Six Positions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> That they have an Absolute Power
of Declaring the Law; And that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57301:21"/>
ever they declare to be so, ought not to be
question'd, either by King, or People: so
that all the Right, and Safety of the
Prince, and Subject, depends upon their
Pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> That no Presidents can be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to Bound their Proceedings; which, If
so, <hi>The Government of the</hi> Turk <hi>Himself
is not so Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That a Parliament may dispose
of any thing, wherein the King, or Subject
hath a Right, for the Publique Good;
(<hi>speaking all this While of the Remnant
of the Two Houses</hi>) That they, without
the King, are This Parliament, and Iudge
of This Publique Good; and that the King's
Consent is not Necessary. So that the Life,
and Liberty of the Subject, and all the
Good Laws made for their Security, may be
dispos'd of, and Repeal'd by the Major Part
of Both Houses, at any time present, and
by any Wayes, and Means Procured so to
be, and his Majesty has no Power to Protect
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> That a Member of either
House ought not to be troubled, or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with, for Treason, Felony, or any Other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57301:22"/>
Crime, without the Cause first brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Them, that they may judge of the Fact,
and their Leave obtained to Proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> That the Sovereign Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in Both Houses of Parliament. The
King has no Negative Voice; and becomes
Subject to their Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly;</hi> That the Levying of Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Personal Commands</hi> of the King,
(tho' accompany'd with his <hi>Presence</hi>) is not
Levying War against the <hi>King:</hi> But to
Levy War against his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi>
(which they have Power to Declare, and
Signifie) is Levying War against the <hi>King;</hi>
And that Treason cannot be Committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Person,</hi> otherwise than as he is
Entrusted with the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and Dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that Trust; and that they have a Power
to judge, whether he discharges it or no.
<hi>And to justifie their Usurpations, they do
maintain,</hi> pag. 270. That the Kings of This
Realm are Oblig'd to pass all such Bills as
are Offer'd unto them by Both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>It would be superfluous to tell you of
their <hi>Proclaiming Fasts,</hi> and Assuming to
themselves other <hi>Rights of Sovereignty,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57301:22"/>
under the specious Pretence of a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But to shew you that it was All
an Imposture: If the <hi>King</hi> will not Agree,
the <hi>Two Houses</hi> (they say) may Act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him: If the <hi>Two Houses</hi> Differ, the
Sovereignty rests in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
As in the Case of a Bill they sent
up to the Lords for Directing a <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which they had Fram'd, to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taken throughout <hi>England.</hi> This
Bill the Lords Rejected; Whereupon,
the Commons pass'd this <hi>Vote, That</hi> That
House <hi>did conceive that the Protestation
made by them is fit to be taken by every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is well Affected in Religion, and to
the Good of the Common-Wealth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth declare, That what Person soever
shall not take the Protestation, is Vnfit to
bear Office in the Church, or Common-Wealth.</hi>
And so they order'd the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Burgesses to send down to the
several Places for which they serv'd,
Copies of that Vote of the House con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Protestation,</hi> and that the <hi>Vote</hi>
should be Printed. They began with a
<hi>Contempt</hi> of the Lords; they Lay'd them
quite <hi>Aside</hi> at last; and in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57301:23"/>
they <hi>Themselves</hi> were, upon their
Own Arguments, Confounded by the
<hi>Rabble.</hi> You see the Dominion these
People Challenge over their <hi>Master;</hi> and
it cannot be expected that they should
give any better Quarter to their <hi>Fellow
Subjects;</hi> But it is <hi>Their Way</hi> of making
<hi>Kings Glorious,</hi> and <hi>Patronizing the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the</hi> Imposing <hi>of it; and Secondly, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable</hi>
Fraud <hi>in the</hi> Construction <hi>of
it. The</hi> Matter <hi>of it was so Plausible,
that it went down without much Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
into the</hi> Authority <hi>of it; but upon
the Commons declaring, that</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England had no
Regard to the Maintaining of the</hi> Desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<hi>and</hi> Government <hi>of it: And After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that the</hi> Sovereignty <hi>was Virtually

<hi>they were Oblig'd to serve</hi> That
Interest, <hi>Mens Eyes came then to be

they were call'd upon according to their</hi>

Maintain</hi> Horse, Horse-men, <hi>and</hi> Arms,
<hi>for the Defence of the</hi> King, <hi>and</hi> Both
Houses of Parliament. <hi>In</hi> York-<hi>shire
there was a</hi> Neutrality <hi>Propounded by

Declar'd against it,</hi> pag. 629. <hi>as a

               <p>You have here from their own Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Acts, (for I cite none of their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets)
a Breviate of the Powers they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to themselves over King, and
People: And this so Early in the War
too, that the Faction was not as yet sure
in the Saddle. (For This was all before
1643.) You shall now see the <hi>Execution</hi>
of these <hi>Arbitrary Principles</hi> by the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi>
of <hi>Both Kingdoms</hi> in their Turns,
and you shall Confess that tho' the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
of the <hi>Kirk</hi> may serve as a Foil to
any <hi>Other Tyranny,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> have yet
had the Honour to out-strip their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>According to the Common Method
of <hi>Innovatours,</hi> their First Work was, by
<hi>Press</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to <hi>Defame</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
their Next, was, by Popular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57301:25"/>
to stir up the Multitude by <hi>Tumults</hi>
to <hi>Reform</hi> it; and Lastly; (if they found
their Party strong enough to Depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to Enter into a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and Set
up for themselves. This was the Course
that <hi>Knox, Willock,</hi> and their Followers took
in <hi>Scotland</hi> under the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> in
1555. and afterward, under King <hi>Iames</hi>
VI. And <hi>Cartwright</hi> with his Complices
went the same way to Work also under
Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> only the Conspiracy
of <hi>Arthington, Hacket, Coppinger, Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
&amp;c.</hi> was Discover'd, and the Plot
Disappointed. But the Libels, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 1637. which led to
that Impious <hi>Bond,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> in 1638.
had better success. (See his Late Majesties
<hi>Large Declaration</hi> upon That Subject.)
And after their Pattern, so had the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
in <hi>England</hi> in 1641. when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was so Over-aw'd by <hi>Tumults</hi> that
the Vote of the <hi>Two Houses</hi> was no other
in Effect than the Sense of the <hi>Rabble</hi> in
the <hi>Lobby.</hi> It was but their Bawling for
Justice upon the Noble Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi>
their Crying down of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Popish
Lords,</hi> and the thing is Done. The Riots
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57301:25"/>
were so Great, that the Lords press'd the
Commons at a Conference, to Joyn
with them in a Declaration for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of them. But it was Answer'd,
saying, <hi>We must not Discourage our Friends,
This being a time we must make use of All our
Friends. God forbid</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Pim) that
the House of Commons should proceed in any
way to Dishearten People to obtain their just
Desires in such a way;</hi> Exact Collections,
<hi>pag.</hi> 532. The <hi>Kirk</hi> would have said,
that <hi>they did not know with what Spirit they
were Over-Rul'd,</hi> as they told King <hi>Iames</hi>
in the Case of <hi>Gibson,</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
Treason in the Pulpit. The next
thing that follow'd in Course, was a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination;</hi>
and That shall be the first Point
we'l handle in the Common <hi>Practices</hi> of
the Party; which in One Word amounts
to no less than <hi>the Dissolution</hi> of a <hi>Legal,</hi>

               <p>So soon as ever they had by these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Appearances decoy'd an Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Part of the Nation into the Net,
they Emprov'd the Fraud by Expounding

Contrary to the Common Intent, and

way thereby to the Destruction of all
those Interests which the People thought

These Letters came to his Hand in <hi>May.</hi>
And in <hi>September</hi> following (with the
Privity, and Encouragement of <hi>Calvin</hi>)
he left <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Octob.</hi> 24. arriv'd at
<hi>Diepe,</hi> (with Intent to Embarque for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
where he met with other Letters,
disswading his Return. (See his <hi>History
of Scotland, Fol.</hi> 107.) The Faction was
now ready to give up the Cause; and had
undoubtedly so done, but for <hi>Knox</hi> his
Letter to some of the Nobility upon
That Occasion; which re-Confirm'd
them in their Resolutions. <hi>Your Brethren</hi>
(says he) <hi>are Oppress'd (Fol. 109.) and
you ought to Hazzard your own Lives, (be it
against Kings, or Emperours) for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</hi>
(So that here was <hi>Violence</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57301:29"/>

By the Instigation of this Letter,
they enter'd into their <hi>first Covenant</hi> at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>Decemb. 1557. (Fol.</hi> 110.)
and Immediately after the Subscribing
of it, <hi>they Order'd the Common Prayer (of</hi>
England) <hi>to be read weekly on Sunday,
and other Festival Days, in all the Parish-Churches
of That Kingdom, with the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Old and New Testament, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the Book of Common Prayers.</hi>
(Fol. 111.) Soon after This, they Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the Queen and Council for the
Use of the Common Prayer in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

with an Exception only to <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi>

to the Day, and Place appointed:</hi>
that is; to <hi>St. Iohnston;</hi> where they had

the Ministers were Proclaim'd Traytours,
and the Multitude fell to the Demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Rifling of <hi>Religious Houses;</hi>
where they found great Booty; and so
they Proceeded to the fortifying of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

their Assistance; Maintaining their Ground
by Force, notwithstanding <hi>A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all of them to avoid the Town, under

after was Deliver'd up upon Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
From the Pretence of <hi>Defending</hi>

shortly after, to the <hi>Assaulting</hi> of it; and
so the Burning of <hi>Scone;</hi> the Seizing of
the <hi>Minting-Irons</hi> for the Coyning of their

Whereupon (says <hi>Spotswood</hi> in his <hi>Church-History,</hi>
Fol. 175.) <hi>there ensu'd a Pitiful
Vastation of Churches, and Church-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
No Difference was made, but all the
Churches either Defaced, or Pull'd to the
Ground. The Holy Vessels, and whatsoever
else Men could make Gaine of, (as Timber,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57301:31"/>
Lead, and Bells) were put to Sale. The
very Sepulchers of the Dead were not spar'd.
The Registers of the Church, and Libraries
cast into the Fire: And All This, colour'd
with the Warrant of Publique Authority.</hi>
Take Notice here, that after the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was Dissolv'd, their Book of <hi>Polity</hi>
was Subscrib'd, notwithstanding the
<hi>Postponing</hi> of the Question. And we shall
see now, that they treated the <hi>Queen her
Self</hi> no better than they had done the
<hi>Queen Regent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Nice Juncture of Affairs,<note place="margin">The <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had no better Quarter than the <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </note>
the Queen was Invited Home. And
<hi>Aug.</hi> 20. 1561. She arrived at <hi>Leith;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
upon her Entrance, That <hi>there
should no Alteration be made in the Present
State of Religion, only for her Self, and
Family she would have a Mass in Private.</hi>
But the Preachers decrying that Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their Pulpits, produced a Dangerous
Tumult against the Freedom of her own
Chappel.</p>
               <p>After several Riots, and Open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
which were still promoted, and
seconded by the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> In <hi>Iuly</hi> 1564.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57301:31"/>
the Queen was Marri'd to the Lord <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
And <hi>Iune</hi> 19. 1566. brought to bed
of a Son (afterward <hi>Iames</hi> VI.) in the
Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> In 1567. they sent
the Queen Prisoner to <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> and
pass'd an Act of Assembly for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and Disposing of the Person of the
Infant-Prince; with Direction to move
the Queen to a <hi>Resignation</hi> of her <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the Appointing of a <hi>Regent,</hi>
during his <hi>Minority;</hi> which by Force, and
Menaces, her Majesty was compell'd to
do; and her <hi>Renunciation,</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi>
Publish'd at the <hi>Market-Cross</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
the Prince being Crown'd, and Anointed
King, in the Church of <hi>Striveling</hi> the
Third day after the Publication, being
<hi>Iuly</hi> 29. On the 20th of <hi>August,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was Elected <hi>Regent:</hi> King
<hi>Iames</hi> being as yet but Thirteen Months
old. At the Beginning of the Spring, in
1568. the Queen made her Escape, and
was convey'd to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where several
Lords meeting in Council, her <hi>Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was declar'd <hi>Void,</hi> (as Extorted by
Fear) and <hi>Proclamation</hi> issu'd against the
Rebels that had Usurped her Authority.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57301:32"/>
The Dispute, in short, was brought to a
Battle, <hi>May</hi> 13. the Queens Army De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and She her self fled into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for Protection; where the Faction
never left the Persute of her, till they
brought her to the Scaffold. But here
you'l say there was a <hi>Foreign Interest,</hi> and
<hi>Popery</hi> in the Case. If That were All,
how came it that they handled the Young
King at as Course a rate every jot as they
had treated his Mother? tho' their <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prince,</hi> and afterward, the Celebrated
<hi>Champion</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been
Administer'd by Four Regents,<note place="margin">They treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King <hi>James</hi> as ill as they had done his Mother.</note> when,
upon the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>'s desire to be
Discharg'd of his <hi>Regency,</hi> the King (not
twelve years old as yet) accepted of it;
and his Acceptation thereof was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
at <hi>Edinburgh, March</hi> 12. 1577.
where the Regent himself was Assisting.
As an Earnest of the Respect they bare to
his Majesties Authority, <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi>
presented a Form of <hi>Church Government</hi>
to the Parliament at <hi>Striveling,</hi> in 1578.
which they referr'd to certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57301:32"/>
                  <hi>who agreed to such General
Heads as did not touch the Authority of the</hi>
King, <hi>nor prejudg the Liberty of the</hi> State.
<hi>But this did not content Them; so that they
resolv'd to put their Conclusions in Practice
the next Assembly, without staying for a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
(Spotswood</hi>'s <hi>Hist.</hi> Fol. 302.) In
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> the next Spring, the Ministers
put the Magistrates of the City upon
Demolishing the Cathedral, but the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Interpos'd, and Defended it. In
1582. <hi>Montgomery</hi> was Process'd for
Preaching at <hi>Glasgow:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> by his
Warrant commanded the Assembly to
desist, which the Moderatour perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
refus'd, and thereupon, the Officer
pull'd him from his Seat, and Clap'd him
up in the <hi>Tolbuyth;</hi> for which, they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
him to be <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> tho' the
King himself earnestly perswaded them to
the Contrary.</p>
               <p>After this Contempt of the Kings <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
they made a Violent Seizure of
his <hi>Person,</hi> and carri'd him Prisoner to
the Castle of <hi>Ruthen,</hi> where they kept
him Close <hi>Nine Months;</hi> forcing him by
a Writing under his hand, to command
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57301:33"/>
the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> to Depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Imposing upon him what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
they pleas'd, under pretence of <hi>Zeal
to Religion, and Care of his Person.</hi> They
did also Petition the next General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to give their sence of
the Action: Who made themselves
Judges; and did so highly approve of
it, that <hi>they appointed all Ministers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the Actors of it, as good Christians,
and Patriots,</hi> pretending, <hi>that there was
no other way to preserve their Religion,
and Freedoms.</hi> And yet this Duke dy'd
soon after, in <hi>France,</hi> of the Reformed
Communion. For the Countenance of
this Proceeding, they force the King (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but Seventeen years of Age) to emit
a Proclamation, <hi>commanding all those that
had Levy'd any Forces upon Pretence of his
Restraint, to Disband within Six hours, upon
Pain of Death;</hi> and <hi>Declaring that he was
at Liberty, and had only his Friends about
him.</hi> In the Summer following, under
Colour of Viewing the Castle of <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
It was contriv'd, that the Gates
should be shut upon his Followers, and
so he deliver'd himself from his Guard.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57301:33"/>
It would be but the same thing over
again, to Enumerate the Repeated Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
of their Government, and the
Contumacy of their Ministers: their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Practises at <hi>Striveling, Glasgow, &amp;c.</hi>
and that Horrid Outrage against the <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi>
in <hi>Edinburgh, Decemb.</hi> 17. 1596.
When the King appoints a <hi>Feast,</hi> they
Indict a <hi>Fast;</hi> the Council Orders the
Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to give <hi>Thanks</hi>
for his Majesties Deliverance from <hi>Gowry's
Conspiracy:</hi> Their Answer was, That
<hi>they were not acquainted with the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
And when it was urg'd, that they
were only to affect the People with the
Sence of his Majesties having scap'd a
great Danger, they Reply'd, That <hi>nothing
should be Vtter'd in the Pulpit, but That
whereof the Truth was known.</hi> Nay, they
would not so much as pray for the Kings
Mother, when her Death was Resolv'd
upon, tho' the very Form was prescrib'd
in the most Innocent Terms Imaginable.
viz. <hi>That it might please God to Illuminate
her with the Light of his Truth, and save
her from the apparent Danger wherein she
was cast.</hi>

               <p>

they made use of from first to last.
Upon his Majesties <hi>Proclamation</hi> for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving

they did not only <hi>Protest,</hi> and <hi>Refuse to

Void Six General Assemblies;</hi> tho' Two of
them Wholly, and the Other Four, in
Part, were Ratifi'd by Acts of Parliament.
<hi>In Another Hour, they Damn'd all the</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian

were. In Another Hour they Depriv'd One
Arch-Bishop, and Two Bishops.</hi> And <hi>in
One hour more, they Abolish'd Episcopacy;
Deposing Four Bishops, barely upon a Libel

These are the men that <hi>bind their Kings in

Methode</hi> too, <hi>they Rifled Winchester-Church</hi>
in 1642. <hi>Burnt the Communion-Table in
an Ale-House; brake open several Leaden
Chests, wherein the Bodyes of some of the</hi>
Saxon Kings <hi>were Deposited; Casting the
Dust into the Air; and throwing the Bones
of them at the Windows: Hacking with
their Swords the Crown that was there upon

Thus was this <hi>Glorious Prince Betray'd,
and Sold, according to the</hi> COVENANT.
Here's the True <hi>English</hi> of it, and the
Divinity of that <hi>Moloch,</hi> to which this
Nation has offer'd up so many Noble
<hi>Sacrifices.</hi> Are not our Fundamental

meanly have we Prostituted the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Land, and of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Lusts of these Imperious,
Shameless Ravishers! Take Notice here
of some of the <hi>Kirks</hi> following <hi>Resolves</hi>
upon the Main Point in Question. First,
<hi>That the Kings Taking of the</hi> Scotch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>and Passing</hi> Some <hi>of the</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>does not Warrant</hi> Scotland <hi>to Assist
him against</hi> England. Secondly; <hi>That
upon bare Taking the</hi> National Covenant,
<hi>they may not Receive him.</hi> Thirdly; <hi>That
the Clause in the Covenant</hi> for Defence of
the Kings Person, <hi>is to be understood</hi> In
Defence, and Safety of the Kingdom.
Fourthly; <hi>That his Majesty shall Execute
no Power in</hi> Scotland, <hi>without satisfying
every Point.</hi> Fifthly; <hi>That Refusing the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57301:39"/>
Propositions, he shall be dispos'd of according
to the</hi> Covenant, <hi>and the</hi> Treaties.</p>
               <p>Nor would the <hi>Two Houses</hi> Probably
have Us'd him any better if he had gone
to Them.<note place="margin">The <hi>Two Houses</hi> as bad as the <hi>Scotch.</hi>
                  </note> For, upon his First withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, they Voted it <hi>Treason, and
Death without Mercy, for any Man to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and Conceal the Kings Person,</hi> (upon
a Supposition that his Majesty was then
in <hi>London.</hi>) This was the 4th of <hi>May;</hi>
and on the 6th, the <hi>Commons</hi> Voted him
to <hi>Warwick Castle,</hi> which was Unvoted
again, upon the 9th; and in <hi>Iune,</hi> they
Voted <hi>the Kings going to the</hi> Scots, <hi>a Design
to prolongue the War.</hi>

               <p>Let me not appear to Confound the

for the Justification of the Rebellion in

               <p>1. I do Acknowledge, and Declare, that
the War undertaken by Both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in their Defence against the Forces
rais'd in the Name of the Late King, was
Iust, and Lawful; and that Magistracy,
and Ministry are the Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Resolv'd</hi> that All, and Every Person,
who have Advised, or Voluntarily Aided,
Abetted, Assisted, in any War against the
Parliament, (since the First day of <hi>Jan.

They, have since manifested their Good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to This Parliament) shall be Vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to be Elected, to serve as Members of

Feud <hi>against</hi> Kings, <hi>is</hi> Implacable, <hi>their</hi>
Aversion <hi>likewise to all those that</hi> Love
their Prince, <hi>descends from Generation

               <p>How Inconsistent <hi>Presbytery</hi> is with

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57301:41"/>
notwithstanding Three Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
that is to say, of 1584. 1597.
and 1606. expresly to the Contrary. And
did they not pronounce the Acts of the
Assemblies of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>Perth</hi> to be

by what Authority they do these things,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<hi>against Acts of Parliament, Acts of
Council,</hi> and <hi>Acts of General Assemblies.</hi>
They Answer, that <hi>Those Acts of Assembly
were unduely Obtain'd; and that now they
have Rescinded them. For Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>Acts of Council, they Express
great Wonder that any man should Question
their Authority over Them: For if Christ
be above the King, Christ Council must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be Supreme; Parliaments being only
the Council of the Kingdom. And for the Kings
Privy Council, and Iudges, they must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Councellours, and Iudges under
Christ, who is the King of Kings.</hi> Nor is
it all that they assume to themselves an
<hi>Arbitrary Rule;</hi> but whoever refuses <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi>
and <hi>Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Acts,</hi> and
<hi>Decrees,</hi> stands <hi>Excommunicate</hi> without

Mercy. And Then (if he persist) follows
<hi>Out-Lawry; Forfeiture</hi> of his <hi>Goods;</hi> his
<hi>Revenue for Life; Letters of Caption</hi> for
the Seizing of his <hi>Person;</hi> and <hi>Close Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment</hi>

Appear, they take out Letters of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communing;</hi>
making it Treason to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
or hold any <hi>Correspondence</hi> with
him. This is Executed by a Warrant
to the <hi>Civil Iudge</hi> from a Commissioner
of the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> and upon his Refusal,
to see the Sentence put in Execution, he
himself incurrs the same Danger.</p>
               <p>And the same <hi>Tyranny</hi> was Exercis'd

Table.</hi> And There, Effectually,
was lodged the last Result of Counsel.
It was Compos'd of Men of <hi>Brains, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity,
Boldness,</hi> and such as were most
Obstinately Engag'd to the <hi>Faction;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Preaching,</hi> or <hi>Ruling-Elders.</hi> The
Acts of <hi>Assembly</hi> were but the Dictates
of the <hi>General Table;</hi> as in <hi>England</hi> the
<hi>Two Houses</hi> still agreed to the sense of the
<hi>Close Committee.</hi> There it was, that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57301:45"/>
Abuses of Government were Inspected;
Reformations Modell'd; Court-Offices
dispos'd of; all Conspiracies Form'd, and
Digested; And the Preachers Expresly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
what Points to Press, and which
Nail to drive. There can be no better
Accompt given of their <hi>under-hand deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
than they give of Themselves, in
their <hi>two Private Papers of Instructions</hi>
(Printed in the Late Kings <hi>Large Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Fol. 282. &amp;c.</hi> with his Majesties
Notes upon them) toward the Securing
of a <hi>General Assembly</hi> (which was to
meet at <hi>Glasgow, Nov.</hi> 21. 1638.) The
One of them being directed to one <hi>Lay-Elder;</hi>
and the Other, to <hi>some One Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
in <hi>every Presbytery,</hi> for the Packing of
their Party. In the Former of them you
have in terms these following Particulars
in Charge.</p>
               <p>That some one Minister,<note place="margin">Their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</note> and Gentleman
in every Presbytery meet oft together, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon the Particular Commissioners to
be Chosen, and use all diligence with the rest
of the Ministers and Gentlemen, that such
may be Chosen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57301:46"/>
                  <hi>And</hi> Because nothing will avail so much for
our Purpose, where the most part of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are disaffected, as that the Gentlemen
be present to Vote in Presbyteries, it would
be presently try'd whether this be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
and if the Minister be slow in ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it, the Gentlemen themselves to urge it,
and put themselves in Possession.</p>
               <p>That they linger not, they would be urged
again to send their Commissioners to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
before the First of <hi>October:</hi> by this
we shall know our strength the better at
our Meeting.</p>
               <p>And the Gentlemen (at least the greatest
part of them) would be warned to be at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
Septemb.</hi> 20. And that only the
Gentlemen who are nam'd Commissioners
to the Presbytery for chusing their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
for the Assembly, with some to assist
them, that day stay at home, and those
to come away immediately after the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>That in every Presbytery there be a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Care taken of the Informations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prelates, for Instructing our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>

               <head>The Other Paper of Private Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Aug. 27. 1638. runs as

               <p>THese Private Instructions shall be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to none but to Brethren well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Cause.</p>
               <p>Order must be taken that none be Chosen
<hi>Ruling-Elders,</hi> but <hi>Covenanters,</hi> and Those
well affected to the Business.</p>
               <p>That where the Minister is not well Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>Ruling-Elders</hi> be Chosen by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi>
of the <hi>Shire,</hi> and spoken to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for that Effect.</p>
               <p>That they be careful no <hi>Chapter-men,
Chappel-men,</hi> or a <hi>Minister, Justice of the
Peace,</hi> be chosen, although <hi>Covenanters,</hi>
except they have publiquely renounc'd, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
the Vnlawfulness of their Places.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Ruling-Elders</hi> come from every
Church in equal Number with the <hi>Ministers,</hi>
and if the <hi>Minister</hi> Oppose, to put themselves
in Possession, notwithstanding any Opposition.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Commissioner</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi>
cause Convene before him the <hi>Ruling-Elder</hi>
of every Church, Chosen before the day of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57301:47"/>
the Election, and enjoyn them upon their
Othe, that they give Vote to none, but to
those who are Nam'd already at the Meeting
at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That where there is a <hi>Nobleman</hi> within
the Bounds of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> He be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen:
And where there is none, there be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
a <hi>Baron,</hi> or one of the Best Quality, and
he only a <hi>Covenanter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King observes (Fol. 315.) that</hi> This Assembly
of <hi>Glasgow</hi> had not so much as the Face of an <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Meeting;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Medly of their Assembly.</note> not a Gown worn by any Member of it,
unless it was by one or two Ministers that liv'd in the
<hi>Town:</hi> The Appearance of it was in a manner, wholly
<hi>Laical.</hi> Among the Members of it, were <hi>Seaven Earls,
Ten Lords, Forty Gentlemen, One and Fifty Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,</hi>
many of them in Colour'd Cloths, and Swords
by their Sides; all which did give Voyces, not only in
very high Points of Controversie, but also in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of <hi>Excommunication</hi> pronounc'd against the
Bishops, and Others. Nay, and all things in the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>
carri'd by the Sway of these <hi>Lay-Elders;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that it was a very rare thing to hear a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Speak there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now let any man Judg whether this be a</hi> Church-Assembly,<note place="margin">The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is but the Embryo of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note>

Conscientious Consultation <hi>for the</hi> Reforming of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>or a</hi> Seditious Practice <hi>for the</hi> Embroiling <hi>of
the</hi> State. <hi>How applicable is that Invective against</hi>
Popery (<hi>in the Libel concerning the Growth of it)
to the Case of</hi> Presbytery? The Power of it is Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57301:47"/>
(<hi>says the Author of it</hi>) and the Decree is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
It can change the very Nature of things; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what is Iust, to be Vnjust, and what is Vice, to be
Virtue. All Laws are in the Cabinet of its Breast, and
it can dispose of Kingdoms, and Empires as it pleases.
It makes it a Mortal Sin even to doubt of any part of
its Religion; and demands, under pain of Damnation,
the Subjection of all Christians to its Authority. That
Word of <hi>Reformation</hi> misappli'd, has serv'd it to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
all the Executions, Assassinations, Wars, Massacres,
and Devastations, whereby the Discipline hath been
Propagated. It is almost Vnconceivable how Princes
can yet suffer a Power so Pernicious, and Doctrine so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to all Government. Their strict Othes, and
Vows of Obedience to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> Evacuate the
Fealty due to the Sovereign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What difference now (more than in the</hi> Name)

                  <hi>as he has set it forth,

Words, <hi>and</hi> Deeds? <hi>What</hi> Power <hi>can be more</hi> Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
<hi>Or what</hi> Decrees <hi>more</hi> Infallible, <hi>than That
of the</hi> Presbytery; <hi>Which challenges</hi> Obedience <hi>to all
its Dictates, both from</hi> Prince, <hi>and</hi> People, <hi>under pain
of</hi> Life, Liberty, Dominion, <hi>and</hi> Estate? <hi>It Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules</hi>
Laws; <hi>sets up</hi> Othes <hi>of</hi> Treason <hi>against</hi> Othes <hi>of</hi>
Allegiance; <hi>and covers the Crime of</hi> Rebellion <hi>with
the Title of</hi> Virtue. <hi>It takes upon it self the Office
of</hi> Christ Vicar; Deposes Kings; <hi>and under the
Masque of</hi> Religion, <hi>dissolves the</hi> Order, <hi>and</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>of all Governments.</hi> The King in his <hi>Declaration</hi>
before-Mention'd, (<hi>Fol.</hi> 404.) among other of their

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57301:48"/>
because he had not Subscrib'd the <hi>Covenant;</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Unchristian Rigour</hi> of this <hi>Discipline</hi> is such
