            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MEthinks we live in an Age of Wonders, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
like, every day producing <hi>aliquid novi.</hi>
But few Months since Suspension, Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
Imprisonment, was too little pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for refusal to read the King's (as 'twas stil'd) Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Declaration for Liberty of Conscience. And now I
am as much Disaffected to the Protestant Cause, for making
some Objections against the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, the wonderful Revolution of a few days
is so unfathomably Stupendious, that an ordinary Capacity
may easily be induc'd to believe, that Miracles are not yet
ceased. Such signal Methods compassing such an unthought
of Rescue, loudly declare they are more than common.
And your obstinate refusal of a Deliverance written in such
legible Characters, your voluntary depriving your self of a
share in so great and unparallel'd a Blessing, is a second won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to me incomprehensible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not (I protest) from an affected singularity, or
a too high conceitedness of my own Opinion, that, like
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> I oppose the whole World by my self. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reason is, that I may <hi>keep a Conscience void of offence both
toward God and Man.</hi> I acknowledge the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49977:4"/>
has been the great Instrument of our Deliverance from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Arbitrary Power, and more highly deserves of the
Nation than can be expressed; yet I cannot forget those
Tyes and Obligations that fix and river our Allegiance to our
Dread Sovereign <hi>James</hi> the Second.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The Dictates of Nature bind me to Natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
being by Birth a Natural Subject to the King of Great
<hi>Britain,</hi> my Duty is to pay Homage and Obedience either
Active or Passive to all his Commands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>I readily grant, that as you are a Subject to the King
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> his Majesty hath an undoubted Right to
challenge your Obedience, but the Ground and Reason of
this Right does not proceed as an Emanation from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as I shall immediately evince, when I have gotten a
right sence of your Notion of Passive Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>By Passive Obedience I understand a submissive and
patient suffering the Punishment due to the obstinate refusal
of Actively obeying those Commands and Injunctions of my
Superiors, that are either inconsistent with, or opposite to
the Laws and Precepts of the Divine Creator.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Patience under Punishment, when Legally inflicted
upon us, and there is no lawful way to escape it, is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Duty, as is clear and obvious, both from the Doctrine
and Example of our Saviour, who despised the shame and
endured the Cross.</p>
               <p>But if Passive Obedience (as you interpret it) be Sence,
Logicians are much mistaken in affirming ten Predicaments;
since (in your account) <hi>Actio</hi> and <hi>Passio</hi> are one. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(in all Histories, whether Sacred or Prophane) has no
relation to suffering, but always signifies the <hi>doing</hi> things
commanded. Thus <hi>Exod. 15. 26. If thou wilt heark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to the
voice of the Lord, and do that is right in his sight. Exod.</hi> 24. 7.
After <hi>Moses</hi> had read the Book of the Law, the People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
their Obedience to <hi>do</hi> all that was there injoyned them.
And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 19. King <hi>Saul</hi> for not <hi>doing</hi> the Command
of the Lord, was stigmatized with the infamus Character of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49977:4"/>
Disobedience, notwithstanding his suffering the punishment of
his Transgression. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 29. the Apostles affirm they
ought to obey (that is <hi>Do</hi>) the Will of God rather than Man.
And all those Express and Positive Commands for Wives,
Children and Servants, to obey their Husbands, Parents and
Masters, only import, 'tis their Duty to please them well,
by <hi>doing</hi> those things enjoin'd by them.</p>
               <p>In opposition to this; Passive naturally implies, suffering
the Penalty for not doing; so that should we allow such a
contradiction in Speech, as Passive Obedience, 'twould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow, that those who have suffered the punishment
of the Law, are justified by the Law; for if Suffering ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Men obedient, the Penalty being endured, they are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from their Guilt and become Immaculate: And by
virtue of this Argument, Rebels, Thieves, Murtherers, or the
worst of Villians are (after they have receiv'd the Reward of
their Transgressions) as honest Men, as good Neighbours, and
as Loyal Subjects as your self.</p>
               <p>I know 'tis objected that Rebels, Thieves, &amp;c. are actual
Transgressors of the Laws both Humane and Divine, and so
fall as Criminals; but the others suffer because they refuse to
violate or transgress those Laws. But to this 'tis replyed, that
according to your own Position they are Criminals alike; for
the Doctrine of Passive Obedience (especially as by you defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
doth sufficiently evidence (notwithstanding what you
talk of Laws) that the Will of the Supreme Magistrate is
the chiefest Rule we are to walk by; for whatever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
brings with it Authority to require Obedience, that
very Authority doth plainly impress upon it the Character
of a Law. Now Criminals, upon the account of Omission,
are equally guilty with those that have render'd themselves
so by Sins of Commission; it being equally the same as to
matter of Crime, not to do those things Commanded, and
to act or do those things Prohibited. So that by parity of
Reason, if the one be justified so will the other; for <hi>facinus
quos inquinat, aequat.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>I had no design to enter into a Controversie about
Passive Obedience; I asserted that Nature enjoined me to
pay Allegiance to the Supreme Magistrate, and my Reason
was, because I was by Birth a Natural Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49977:5"/>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>That Nature obliges you to Obedience, is a great
Mistake; for the constitutes no Subordination among Men;
as we are produced by her, we are all Equals; she ordains
neither King or Peasant, Lord or Slave: Her Actions are
only internal, such as respect not those outward Adjuncts, or
external Qualifications. The Laws she designs for our Guide,
are her own Precepts; (<hi>viz.</hi>) those Innate Notions of Good
and Evil, those Common Sentiments of Vertue and Vice
that are proper to all men, as they are Rational Creatures.
The Governour she appoints over us, is every man's own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the Judge, our particular Consciences. 'Tis indeed by
the Force or Energy of Nature we are made Men, but we
are born free. This is evident from that absolute Authority
every particular Man hath over himself, (<hi>viz.</hi>) an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Power in disposing of his own person: Thus by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
or Bargain, any Man (I speak of Subjects) may become
a Covenant-Servant, an Apprentice, or a Slave, without Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
being concern'd in the Contract. For though a King's
Eldest Son be a Prince by Birth, and the first legitimate Male
Offspring of an Earl, a Lord the Day of his Nativity; yet
those are Birthright Priviledges accruing to them, not from
Nature, but the Laws of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Thus Royal Blood and Descent from Ancient Progenitors,
are only imputative Qualities, and have so little Relation to
Nature, that they are only <hi>Praemia Virtutis,</hi> Rewards for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
and Generous Actions, that the persons concern'd, or
their Forefathers were eminent for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>These Commands that are Moral, and perpetually to
oblige, are esteemed as Natural; but the Duty of Obedience
is Moral, and perpetually to oblige (if the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be so,) which makes me account it Natural.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>As we are Subjects, the Duty of Obedience is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Obligation, and, after a manner, essential to us; But
our Allegiance has not its Foundation in Nature, or her O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
but in the Relation we bear to a Soveraign: And
more than this the Fifth Commandment doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>This Precept is Moral, and perpetually to oblige; but the
Rational part of it is grounded not in Nature, but in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes, Man is a Sociable Animal,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49977:5"/>
and there is nothing more destructive to Society, than Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and Unthankfulness. And since Children have not
only their very Being, but their Well-being also, from their
Parents, no Obligation can be greater or more obligatory to
the foresaid Duties.</p>
               <p>So that were our Filial Obedience founded in Nature (as
you fondly imagine), the Obligation to that Duty would not
be half so strong and valid. Besides, Natural Duties have
respect to the whole <hi>Species;</hi> and by this Argument, the Bonds
and Obligations to Obedience are General, and every man
that is a Parent, may challenge as strict a Duty of Obedience
from us, as our immediate Parents that begat us; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this, is, because Nature is equally concern'd for the
whole <hi>Species,</hi> as for an <hi>Individium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctrine contrary to this, is so plain and evident
from the general practice of the World, that it needs no
proof. For though we are by Nature equally allied to all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first in the Loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> afterwards in <hi>Noah;</hi> yet this
Relation is never term'd more than <hi>Common Humanity.</hi> And
how firm or lasting soever we esteem those Ties and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you mention (which is really nothing but Friendship),
the Second or Third Age commonly expunges them, if dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
Carriage, distance of Place, or want of Converse, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it not in much less time.</p>
               <p>That Paternal Love, and Filial Affection, is not founded in
Nature, seems plain and evident from those different Degrees
of Love Men generally bear to the Legitimate, and Spurious
Issue; and that 'tis cherished by Converse, and made firm
and solid by process of Time, is more than probable, from
the affectionate Nurse, whose Excess of Love to the tender
Babe, does often transcend the affectionate Mothers. Yet 'tis
clearly manifest, Man has a Natural Appetite or Desire to
survive in his Posterity, as irrational Creatures have of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
their <hi>Species:</hi> But this proves nothing against the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
because the Issue of the latter (in riper years) are
not by Nature obliged to the Duties of Gratitude and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>That the Fifth Commandment enjoyns us Obedience to our
Superiors, is beyond all controversie true; and the Reason is,
because in the beginning of Government, Soveraighty was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49977:6"/>
part of the Paternal Power; but (to speak in our common
Language) if the Duty of Obedience in a Natural Son to a
Natural Father, be not a Natural Duty, much less can this
Argument prove Natural Allegiance due to our Civil Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

               <p>The Parliament Conven'd in the Twenty Fourth

govern'd by a Soveraign Head, to which there is a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

who are bound, next under God, to render unto their King

               <p>Natural Allegiance in that Act of Parliament, is only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a Rhetorical Flourish, spoken after the largest acceptation of

'tis a Duty so proper, intrinsical and Essential to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>quâ talis.</hi> For mens very incorporating themselves into

               <p>What you term <hi>Novelty</hi> proceeds from the vulgar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Men, and want of a more serious and weighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Inspection into the Doctrine. And this will appear more Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
if we consult the Specimen of Government in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>The great and fundamental Law of Nature is <hi>Self-Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
'tis the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of all Constitutions, and the
very End and Design of Government it self; 'tis a Principle
so deeply radicated in Nature, that 'tis engraven upon every
man's heart.</p>
               <p>Had indeed our First Parents maintain'd the Original Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Brightness of their Creation, and preserved Nature in
her state of Rectitude, Justice had been our Director, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
our Guide: But by that Fall of theirs, the Nature of
Man was so depraved and vitiated, his Passions so transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Desire so covetous, his Revenge so implacable, that
<hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> were measured only by Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
the Longest Sword was the best Law, a securer Title than
<hi>Prescription</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49977:6"/>
Thus the more powerful preyed upon, and devoured the
weaker; so that Nature destroyed her own works: And the
best course to countermand those Hostile Proceedings, and
preserve this grand Principle of Nature, was mens moulding
themselves into Tribes, associating into Colonies.</p>
               <p>Thus, when a Company of Men, (whether many or few
it matters not; for, <hi>Majus &amp; Minus non variant Speciem</hi>) are
unanimously incorporated into one Society, for the securer
Maintainance of Peace, Correction of Vice, Reformation
of Manners, and the more equal Administration of Justice;
Laws were enacted, Constitutions made, and Statutes provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to redress all private Grievances among themselves; and
to protect the Society from the open Hostility of Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders.</p>
               <p>And since neither Plaintiff or Defendant was fit to be
Judge of his own Plea, nor the <hi>Mobile Vulgus</hi> easily induced
to a joynt Method, a Unanimous Consent in opposing the
Common Enemy; a single person (if Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
or several (in other Constitutions) of such Vertue.
Prudence and Fortitude, as the whole Society thought fit to
confide in, was elected, as an Impartial Arbitrator in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whether private or publick.</p>
               <p>And to him, or them, was committed the sole Executive
Power of these Laws; in all Differences the Definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was (according to Law) to be expected from his, or
their mouth. And this Supream Authority being both Judge
and Protector of the whole Corporation, to advance the
Grandeur of such Authority, and compleatly to capacitate
him, or them, for the Execution of those Established Laws:
This Power was held in high Estimation by the whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by the setled Constitutions of the Government; a
proportionable Tribute from the Subject was by Law allowed
as a Revenue to support that Royal Office.</p>
               <p>And for the firmer uniting this Supream Head and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the former obliges himself by the Sacred Ties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
of an Oath, at his Inauguration, to govern his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
according to the Rule of the Established Laws; and the
latter as solemnly pays Homage, and swears Obedience. So
that Allegiance in all Subjects, whatsoever Government they
live under, (and especially in our own Constitution) is a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49977:7"/>
Duty so perpetual and indispensible, that a violation of it is
an high Offence against God, as well as against his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>This is my very Sense of the Duty of Allegiance;
this the Reason I refused to take that New Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
because 'tis a plain Violation of the Old, which
you your self acknowledge perpetually to oblige.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The Duty of Obedience is an inseparable Accident
to every Subject; and you may as well divest him of his
Being, as his Subjection; for this Duty, like the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
never dies, but immediately descends from one to
another. But what you talk of is a perfect Frensie of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
makes Allegiance an infinite Duty, and exalts a King to
the Honour of a God; if all his Commands must be obeyed,
we tacitely acknowledge he can command nothing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
for an illegal Mandate must not be obeyed, nor an evil
Action committed, though imperiously enjoyn'd by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Men.</p>
               <p>In all Governments, whether Monarchy, Aristocracy, or
Democracy, the Subjects Duty of Obedience is to be measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the express and positive Laws of that Government they
are Members of, and not to be regulated by a fancied <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
of obeying no man knows what, it being now visibly
apparent, that Men may be as superstitiously Loyal as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and the first prove as fatal and destructive to the Peace
and Happiness of the Nation, as the last to the Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of True Religion; when in good earnest, the utmost li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of Allegiance, is but entirely to observe all the lawful
Commands and Injunctions of our Superiors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>Has the Supream Magistrate no Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our Obedience? And is the Extent and Latitude
of the Duty of Allegiance limited by declaritory and express
Laws?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a most certain Truth, especially in our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
where the Government is a Monarchy Royal, in
which the Subjects have as undoubted a Right to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Liberty and Property, as the Supream Magistrate has to
the Royal Prerogative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49977:7"/>
For as the Inferior Laws limit the Peoples Rights, restrain
them from invading the Royal Priviledges, and from offering
violence one to another; so the chief design of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
is to reduce the Regal to a Legal power. The Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Statutes of this Nation are the impartial Arbitrators
of Government and Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>At present a plausible Plea may arise from hence;
but in the beginning 'twas not so; For <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of till King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Eighth King from
the Conquest. And where were those Liberties then you so
much boast of now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Right! <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (in that particular form of
words 'tis now express'd) was not in being till the time you
mention; but our Liberties and Properties were as much then
the undoubted Birthright and Inheritances of the Subjects, as
they are now; for <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (as the Learn'd and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
Lord <hi>Cook</hi> observes) is for the most part Declaritory,
informs us what our Rights and Priviledges are, instates us
into what was lawfully and antecedently our own Right, but
confers no new Immunities upon us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>This is strange indeed, when the very first Chapter
begins, <hi>We have granted to God, and we have given and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Freemen of this Realm.</hi> How could King <hi>Henry</hi> give
and grant those things were none of his?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The Subjects Liberties asserted in this Great Charter,
are not to be look'd upon as pure Emanations from the Royal
Favour, or new Bounties, to which the People had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Right or Claim, but rather a restoring those Priviledges
which by the Usurpation and Encroachments of former
Kings, were forcibly with-held from the Subjects. And the
truth of this is evident from the Charter it self; which in
the words of Conveyance frequently mentions <hi>sua jura,</hi> and
<hi>suas Libortates, Their Rights and their Liberties;</hi> which shews
the People had a former Title to those Immunities, that by
this Charter they were again put in possession of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>This is a pleasant Story indeed: Are the Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
more Ancient than the Conquest? Has not a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
power to impose what Laws he pleases upon those Vassels
and Slaves he has conquered?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>However pleasant it be, 'tis clear and obvious, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Properties of <hi>Englishmen</hi> are of greater Antiquity
than King <hi>William,</hi> call'd <hi>the Conqueror,</hi> as appears from the
Laws that assert them, some as Ancient as the <hi>Heptarchian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
granted by <hi>Ethelberd, Ina,</hi> and <hi>Offa;</hi> others Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
with the Monarchical Regency, given and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon the Subjects by pious King <hi>Alfred.</hi> Neither were
these Laws abolished by the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke, but were of such
Force and Vigour, as to survive (what you call the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,)
and set Bounds and Limits to that pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.</p>
               <p>'Tis not denied, but an absolute Conqueror may propose
and enact what Laws he pleases, to regulate and govern the
Conquered by: but this was far from King <hi>William</hi>'s Case,
For though that great Victory over <hi>Harold,</hi> with such a
mighty slaughter of the <hi>English,</hi> gave him great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet the Crown was obtain'd by Bargain and Compact,
as is plainly evident from those Grants made to <hi>Stigand,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Eglesine,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s,
in behalf of the <hi>Kentish men,</hi> and also from the <hi>Coronation
Oath</hi> it self; where the King swears to maintain and observe
the Laws and Customs of the Nation.</p>
               <p>'Tis true he made little esteem of violating this Sacred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation;
and his Successors vehemently encroach'd upon the
Liberty and Property of the People; but what power force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
snatch'd from them did not invalidate the Subjects
Right. Neither had King <hi>William</hi> (notwithstanding all his
Pretensions to a Conquest) power to dispose of the Lands
or Inheritances of those Natives he received to Protection:
This is manifest from that known Case of <hi>Sherborn</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi>
who had a Castle and Lands in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conqueror gave to one <hi>Warren</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Sherborn</hi>
dying, the Heir claiming the same by Descent, according to
the Law, it was before the Conqueror adjudged for the
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir, and the Gift made void.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The Coronation Oath is nothing to purpose, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
a Paction or an Agreement upon this Account; for that
was made to God, not to Man; and if that Oath prove a
Compact, 'tis between God and the King, not between the
King and the People.</p>

               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis neither my design, nor pertinent to the business
in hand, to begin a Discourse of the difference between Vows
and Oaths. Suppose the Oath were made to God, (which
in propriety of Speech is a Vow) how does that weaken or
invalidate the force of the Argument? It matters not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a Vow to God, or an Oath to Man, so long as
the matter of it is so express and declarative of the King's
Duty, and the Peoples Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The taking the Coronation Oath was the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
Condescention; a compliance with the Customs usual at
the Inauguration of former Kings, and has no tendency to a
Compact or Bargain with the People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>You may stile it what you please: but 'twas such a
Condescention or Compliance, without which (unless he
had first won it by an absolute Conquest) he had never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And the Ancient Rites of the
Coronation it self had some footsteps of this Contract, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Presenting the King, on the day of his Coronation, to
the People upon every corner of the Scaffold, and asking
them if they would have him for their King? I do not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the People had power, to refuse or reject the Person
thus exhibited, that would have render'd the Kingdom E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective;
but the Custom being an ancient Ceremony, and
commonly used till <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Coronation, is in my
Judgment a more than plausible Argument of a Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Supreme Power and the Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>How can that be? the King of <hi>England</hi> is Invested
with all the Rights and Prerogatives of Royalty before he is
Crown'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Right, The King is before his Coronation as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
a Monarch as after: This the Case of <hi>Watson</hi> and
<hi>Clark</hi> (who Conspir'd against King <hi>James</hi> before his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and were condemn'd of High Treason) puts beyond
all Controversie, and the Reason of this is clear; the Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Agreement between King and People, is an insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Concomitant to the Crown, devolves with it to the next
Successor, and is the tacite Condition and Terms upon which
he accepts the Government.</p>
               <p>So that 'tis no more necessary or expedient for every Heir,
as to the <hi>Esse</hi> of his being King, to Declare the Conditions
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49977:9"/>
immediately upon his coming to the Crown, than 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for every successive Generation, when the Court of
Wards was in force, to declare he held his Lands by Knights
Service; the ancient Tenure of the Estate sufficiently evinc'd
the former, and the very Descent of the Crown to the next
of Blood, brings with it a tacite implication of all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
and Liberties of the Subjects, in as full and ample a
manner, as if they had been repeated a thousand times
over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The Court of Wards is as signal a Badge of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
as undoubted a Character of Vassalage and Slavery,
as any we can possibly instance in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The Court of Wards has so little relation to Slavery, that

Slaves, though all Slaves may be called Servants in the most
strict sense; 'tis only a Token of Subjection, and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
an Ensign of Freedom; a lasting Monument of Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Agreement between the Royal Authority and the
People. When at such an easie rate, as attending the Wars
in extraordinary and emergent Occasions, a Man has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Propriety in so large an Estate, so ample an Inheritance.
And the very Antiquity of these Courts doth sufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
the nulity of a Conquest: These being in force in

               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>A Paction between the King and the People is a strange
Assertion; and to say that the People can make a King is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>Because the Royal Authority has a power lodged in
it, which the Subjects have neither Right or Pretence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
For Example, The power of Life and Death are in the
hand of the Supreme Magistrate; which 'tis impossible he
could receive from the People, because no Man has power of
his own Life; much less has he Right or Authority to put it
into another Mans disposal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Here we must distinguish between Absolute and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional:
No Man has an absolute Power over his own Life,
so as to lay violent hands upon himself, or oblige another
to shed his Blood, yet every Man hath hath a conditional
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49977:9"/>
Power upon this account; that is, he is capable (as he is a
Member of the Body Politick) to Covenant and agree with
the Head, and the other Members; that conditionally he
violate those Laws, the Transgression of which, the whole
Society have by Statute Law Ordain'd to be punished with
Death, he will submit to the Punishment. So that the King
has not an Absolute Power of Life and Death; the latter is
only a Penalty conditionally we break such Established
Laws: And this Power is rather in the Laws than the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate; for the King himself (without manifest
Violence and Injustice) has no power to put any Man to
death contrary to Law, or upon a particular Humor.</p>

               <p>Suppose we grant somewhat of Agreement or Paction,

Elect the King as their Governour; when once the Act was
done, and Allegiance sworn, the People have no more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Pretence to revoke or annul that Election, than a Wife
(who has chosen a Husband, promised him her Obedience,
join'd her self to him in Marriage) has to put away her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and to say that the People may Depose their King if
there be a Bargain or Contract between them, is to affirm the
Wife may Divorce the Husband because she chose him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>If all this be granted, you here contend for; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine, how it would weaken or prejudice our present
Cause.</p>
               <p>The Wife after Marriage may not put away her Husband,
that lives with her as an Husband: Nay, though a very ill
Husband, turn Nonthirft, spend his Estate, abuse her Person,
prove unnatural to her Children; notwithstanding all this,
she is obliged to an entire Obedience.</p>
               <p>But if her Husband prove Tyrannically cruel; so far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the wicked Counsels and Designs of her Enemies, as
to give signal and evident Demonstrations that he intends her
Ruine, Destruction and Death: If he be in himself insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
(as in the Case of the Countess of <hi>Essex</hi> by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Devereux</hi>) the Laws allow relief to such a Distressed
Wife. And can we suppose there is greater care taken for
a particular Member, than for the whole Body? In short,
though the Wife cannot put away the Husband because she
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49977:10"/>
chose him; yet the Cruelties, Injustice, Violence and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
of the Husband may be such, as may give just
cause of Divorcement.</p>

               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>But were it not Grand Impiety, by violence to seize
upon the Estate or Goods of a private Man, and dispose of
it to others? What Sacriledge then must it be to Invade the
Dignities Royal, and dispose of the Crown and Scepter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Causelesly to make forcible entry upon any Mans
Goods or Estate, and by violence to keep Possession, is plain
and open Robbery; yet a Man may be Guilty of such Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Actions, such indiscret and undue Behaviour, as may
cause a seizure of both his Moveables and Possessions
without any manifest Wrong or Injury to the once Right
owner. And the Laws allow a particular Man for Just and
Reasonable Causes to Disinherit his eldest Son, and Entail
the Estate upon others of his Posterity, only for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a private Family; and I would fain hear a solid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
why such an Advantageous Priviledge (in extream
Necessity) should be denyed the Publick?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The Reason is clear and obvious, the Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Subjects, or private Men are confirm'd by the
Laws of the Land, made theirs by Agreement: But the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of the Crown, are a Divine Right, the Imperial
Diadem setled upon the Royal Head by the Almighties own
appointment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>If this were but proved the business were done: But
alas! this Doctrine is both groundless and absurd; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Monarch holds his Scepter <hi>jure Divino,</hi> must either be
invested by an immediate Divine Designation (<hi>viz.</hi>) a special
and extraordinary Commission from Divine Providence; as
that of <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Jehu;</hi> or else Successively by
a Legitimate Descent from Persons thus Designed; as that of
<hi>Rehoboam, Asa, Jehosophat;</hi> to the former of these, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of <hi>England</hi> have no Pretence; and if the latter invest
them with it, 'tis derived either from the Ancient <hi>Saxons,</hi> or
from the <hi>Norman</hi> Line: That the first had no such Divine
designation is clear from the Story of <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that no such pretence can be made from King <hi>William,</hi>
stiled the Conqueror, will be more than evident from his
Ambitious Designs; his illegal Attempts; his hostile and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49977:10"/>
unnatural Proceedings; and his Barbarous in Actions wading
through Torrents of Blood; riding in Triumph over heaps
of slaughtered Innocents to ascend a Throne and grasp at a
Scepter, to which he had no more right than the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul.</hi>
And if<note n="*" place="margin">Quod initio vitiosum est; non potest tractu temporis convalescere.</note> the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke first entred by force of Arms,
and after a Battel compounded for the Crown, 'tis vain and
ridiculous to urge Prescription to make a Divine Right; be
cause what in the beginning was not Divine Process of time
can never impress with a Divine Character.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>Solomon</hi> affirms, Eccles. 8. 14. <hi>Where the word of a
King is, there is power, and who may say unto him, what dost
thou?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Right, the words of Kings are Powerful, and no Man
ought to dispute their Commands: But the Reason of it is
grounded upon that Confidence we put in the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
that his Mandates will be always Lawful.</p>
               <p>But this Place of Scripture has a peculiar relation to the
Kings of <hi>Israel;</hi> a People whom God chose to enter into
Covenant with, and over whom he Exercised such a special.
Providence, that 'twas usual with him to set up one, and
pull down another, and cause to Govern whom he pleased.</p>
               <p>Thus when he had granted an extraordinary Commission
to his Prophets, and they had Anointed the designed Person
King over that People, his Word was powerful, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
because so immediately constituted God's Vicegerent.
But this Command is not adapted to our Circumstances: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it add to our Duty of Allegiance; and we may as
rationally evince the <hi>Levitical</hi> Laws obligatory in <hi>England,</hi> as
evidence the <hi>British</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> from this place
of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Besides, if this Doctrine were applicable to the Monarchs
we live under, 'twould be destructive to our Established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and repugnant to the Apostolick Doctrine. If a
King decease whilst his Heir is an Infant, by this Argument
the whole Realm must be subject to his fond and childish
Commands; and when he is arrived to those years in which
Passions are more vigorous, and youthful Lusts strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
to ascend the Stage, and act their Scene even in the
violent prosecutions of those leud Debauches; a Grave and
Reverend Bishop dares not advise him to a Reformation of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49977:11"/>
Manners, to live soberly and become religious, for fear he
transgress his Precept of saying unto him, what doest thou?
But what's infinitely worse may happen: the Heir to the
Crown may be born a Fool, or Ideot, or by accident be a
Lunatick, or labour under a grievous Disease of Madness;
and yet no man must gain say or contradict him, if this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
be valid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>A Child incapacitated to govern by tender years,
ought to be put under Protectors and Tutors during his
Childhood; but in his Adult State, his mature Age may
challenge this Authority. A Fool or Ideot can never be
brought sensible what Government is; and a Lunatick or
Mad-man is more incapable of Government than either. So
that not only Reason, but Nature's Instinct of Self preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
commands us to fence these from the Crown and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>An Infant is as much a Monarch in his Minority, as
in his mature and riper Years; and if he ought to be under
Tutors and Governours, they must have power to say unto him,
what doest thou? Or we may reasonably infer he will be very
ill Tutor'd. A Fool or an Ideot (though in all his Actions
innocent) must be obliterated from the Line of Succession;
and a Lunatick or Mad-man (who never acted against, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
the destruction of Church or State) must lose his
Right, because incapacitated by his Disease.</p>
               <p>Why then by parity of Reason may not a Papist be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who hath already so vehemently shook the Foundations of
Government, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, and for the future
stands bound by all the Sacred Obligations of Oaths and
Vows, obliged under the penalty of forfeiting his Diadem
and Scepter in this World, and his precious and immortal Soul
in that to come; to extirpate our Religion, subvert our Laws,
and reduce us to the Subjection and Vassallage of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Yoak.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>This Argument (I confess) does a little stagger my
Judgment; but when I remember those other express and
positive places of Scripture, so pertinent to this present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
I am radicated as firm as before, <hi>Prov. 8. 15. By me
Kings reign, and Princes decree judgment.</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 9. <hi>Who
can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49977:11"/>
guiltless?</hi> What can be more clear or obvious? what more
positively evinced, than Monarchy, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> from these
Texts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, the places of Scripture do sufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
the Divine Right of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> but they
prove nothing for the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> And indeed, not
only these, but all other places of Sacred Writ, in the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi>
that evidence Regal Authority to be founded by
Divine Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have such a proper Aspect, such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Relation to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government, that they can be
expounded of no other Constitution, unless there be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Footsteps of an extraordinary Divine Designation, as in
all Changes was apparently visible in that Government,
where commonly the Almighty chose, the Prophets conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
and the People obeyed.</p>
               <p>But in opposition to this, the Government of <hi>England</hi> is
a Paction and Contract between the Supream Authority and
the People; the former to govern according to those Rules
the Laws prescribe, and the latter quietly (without Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
to submit to be governed by the Laws Established,
and to support with their Lives and Fortunes the Regal
Power.</p>
               <p>And this Agreement with the Subjects, does not lessen or
depress the Authority of the Supream Magistrate, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advanceth it; for 'tis the Honour of a King, not to
be capable of doing wrong; and 'tis the Safety and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the People, to be under such a Magistrate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s only
commands lawful things, which capacitates the Subject to
obey with safety, <hi>sub clipeo legis nemo decipitun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst the Execution of illegal Commands, is dangerous
to the People; that being an high Offence to the Publick,
and by Consequence no small Transgression against the
Supream Magistrate. For the King being a principal part of
the Body Politick, must necessarily have a principal share in
that grand Affront. And this is the Reason of that Maxim,
<hi>The King can do no wrong;</hi> all his lawful Injunctions being Just
and Righteous, and his illegal Mandates must not be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So that would Court Earwigs leave off to flatter, and be
exact and impartially honest in their Duty both to King and
People, the first would be renown'd, great and glorious, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49977:12"/>
the second, being free from oppression and violence, would
be loving, loyal, and dutiful Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>But the Doctrine of the Gospel is so positive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'
in commanding Obedience to Superiors, that if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arguments were away, this is sufficient to turn the scale
against all that can be said to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>You mistake the very End and Design of my Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
I purpose not to annihilate, or destroy our Obedience,
but to reduce it to its due proportion assign'd it, both by
God and Man; cause it calmly to run down within the
Banks of its own Channel. By which we shall be fitly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated
to follow our Saviour's Advice; <hi>(viz.) to render to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are
God's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangelical Precepts confine us to no particular Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of Civil Government; in general, it provides for the
preservation of Honesty, Justice, and Peace; frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates
our Duty of Obedience, pressing it by many cogent
and rational Arguments; and exhorts us patiently to bear all
Calamities or Oppressures, we have no lawful way to avoid:
but it does not oblige us to be Vassals and Slaves to an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power.</p>
               <p>This is evident from pregnant Examples in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
especially from the Epistles of the Two Famous and
Renowned Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and particularly the last
part of the <hi>12th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>13th,</hi> were penn'd wholly upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>The Scriptures you mention, are so Diametrically
opposite to the Doctrine you teach, that 'tis impossible to
find a more cogent Argument, or positive Command for
Absolute Obedience than those are. The Texts are largely
insisted upon by our Divines; and from thence they rationally
evince an unlimited Duty of Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>For the more clear Explication, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the particular Scripture above mention'd, we
must enquire, what was the End and Design of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and especially this place formerly quoted. And the
Reasons of that, together with the knowledge of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for whom 'twas written, their Estate, Condition and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49977:12"/>
Circumstance, will give us a very great light towards a Right
Apprehension of it.</p>
               <p>The grand End and Design of this Epistle, was not to
plant the Gospel at <hi>Rome,</hi> or prescribe all the Doctrines requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Foundation of Christianity; but rather to refute
those false Doctrines that Hereticks had super-induced, and
to condemn and reform those wicked and revengeful Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that tho Christians (upon some mistakes) were highly
guilty of.</p>
               <p>The Persons for whose sake and instruction this Epistle was
written, were chiefly <hi>Jews</hi> proselyted to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but yet still strongly tinctur'd with their former Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>John</hi> 8. 33. that they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; and by
that Foederal Pact between God and him, were so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
under the Government of Divine Providence, that
no <hi>Heathen</hi> Potentate could have Authority or Lordship over
them, further than urgent Necessity or meer Compulsion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them.</p>
               <p>And being at that time subjugated by force of Arms to
the Yoak of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and by reason of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
Commerce, and other occasions, necessitated to inhabit
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the very Exercise of their Religion was an high
Transgression of the Imperial Laws, which, together with
their refusal to pay the accustomed Tribute, and to render
some respect of Honour the Laws conferr'd upon the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
the Imperial Officers frequently dealt very severely
with those Christian proselytes; and the Christians (upon
the aforesaid Principle) used all opportunities as severely to
revenge themselves; which rendered the Christian Religion
very odious at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was a great block to the propagation
of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>So that the Christians resisting those imperial positive Laws,
and their opposition to the Execution of them, was the only
Reason, the alone Cause that moved the Apostle to write this
Portion of Scripture to them; as appears from <hi>Chap. 12. v.
17. Recompence no man evil for evil:</hi> v. 19. <hi>Dearly beloved,
avenge not your selves, but rather give place to wrath;</hi> That
is, rather suffer the punishment of the Law, and the Injuries
that those who inflict it, offer to you, than resist. Because
(as he assures them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.) Obedience to the Established
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49977:13"/>
Laws is a Christian Duty, though it be to the Laws of a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
Prince.</p>
               <p>And when these Laws are opposite or repugnant to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Precepts, quietly to submit, and patiently to suffer the
punishment of Transgressors, verily believing, that God will
cause all such afflictions and calamities to work for the benefit
and advantage of his People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>What's this but Passive Obedience you so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the beginning of this Discourse?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis so far from Obedience, that 'tis suffering for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
sake. And indeed 'tis the only suffering that has a
Promise annexed to it in Sacred Scripture; for those lively
Oracles authorize us not to cut our own Throats in Obedience
to the Supream Magistrate, if he enjoyn it, nor to sit still, whilst
others illegally act such violence.</p>
               <p>The Gospel does not destroy the grand Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>(viz.) Self-preservation,</hi> but cherishes and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it.</p>
               <p>But in respect of the Publick, if Wrongs be personal, or
Injuries peculiar to particular Men, such as portend not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or grand detriment to the whole Body Politick;
such must be patiently submitted to, rather than by resisting,
disturb the publick Peace or Tranquility of the Nation. As
'tis more safe and prudent to bear with a little uneasiness in a
particular Member, conditionally it endanger not the other
parts, than hazard the Health of the whole Body by
churlish Physick, to redress that Tollerable Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The Duties of Obedience the Gospel enjoyns, is to lawful
Authority, not to illegal or imposed Jurisdiction; not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power. It condemns not our desending our selves
from apparent Ruine and Destruction; and permits us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
our Rights with our Princes, without that infamous
Character of Rebels.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. was written on purpose to confute that
fond Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> before mentioned, that they were
so immediately in Covenant with God, that no Foreiner had
Authority to oblige them to obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49977:13"/>
This the Apostle condemns by a positive Command to the
contrary, saying, <hi>Let every scul be subject to the higher powers;</hi>
and withal, shews them the Reasonableness of this Precept;
because <hi>the powers that be</hi> (whether <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Jewish) are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God;</hi> inferring, that they living under the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, are obliged to be subject unto it: Verse the
Second, he illustrates the heinousness of the sin of opposing
Lawful Authority, in the Execution of Legal Commands;
both from the Ordinance it self and the punishment due to
the Transgression of it. And perswades persons in these
Christian Circumstances, who were daily violating the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
Laws of the Empire, patiently to suffer and quietly
submit to the Legal Execution of the Laws.</p>
               <p>Because opposition made by such persons, was resisting the
Ordinance of God; the punishment of which is Damnation.
He farther Illustrates, that this was the end why Rulers were
Ordained; their Business and chief Occupation being to
punish such Violaters of the Laws as lived in an open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Transgression of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore plainly tells them, they must be subject
(there's a necessity laid upon them) not only for fear, wrath,
compulsion, or punishment; the alone Obligations that had
power to keep the Jews in Subjection, but also for Conscience
sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the same Reason enjoyns them to pay Tribute:</hi>
Render therefore to all their due, tribute to whom tribute is due,
custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>From hence 'tis clear and manifest, the Apostle did not
command those Christians to subject themselves to an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or Arbitrary Power; but to render Obedience to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and publick Laws of the Empire, because these Laws
only could determine how much Tribute, Fear or Honour
Superiors challenged, and Inferiors ought to pay.</p>
               <p>The same Doctrine also St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaches, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. where
observing the <hi>Heathens</hi> distinguished not between the Jews
converted to the Christian Religion, and those which retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Principles, who, for the above-mentioned
Cause, became the most obstinate, turbulent, factious and
seditious People imaginable, upon all occasions exerting their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49977:14"/>
utmost endeavours to raise Tumults, and embroil the State
in Civil wars.</p>
               <p>The Apostle, to dehort the Christians from the Belief and
Practice of that wicked Principle, earnestly perswades them
not to follow the Example of that obstinate and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
People, but by their regular and meek Behaviour,
quiet and candid Carriage, to approve themselves to the
<hi>Heathen</hi> Governours, by submitting to the Ordinance of
Man, for the Lord's sake; That is, Render all due Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
not only to <hi>Jewish,</hi> but <hi>Heathen</hi> Governours, even

               <p>If this be the Genuine Sense, the Natural Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of these places of Scripture, how came the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers to interpret them in another Sense? And
why doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirm, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. that the weapons of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are not carnal?</hi>

               <p>This is the very Doctrine those Fathers delivered,
as is evident from the Epistles of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and the
Apologies of <hi>Justin Martyr, Athenagoras</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to
free the Christian Religion from those Aspersions of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Rebellion the <hi>Heathens</hi> accused it of, and to
justifie the Loyalty and Obedience of Christians to the
Powers and Magistrates under which they lived. Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49977:14"/>
Till the Conversion of <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, the Evangelical Doctrine was always in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Established Laws of the Empire. And in
all Cases, when the Divine Precepts were inconsistent
with the Laws Established in the Empire, the Christian
Religion taught its Votaries quietly to submit, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to suffer the punishment due to the Transgression
of these Laws, without resistance, or calumniating Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
to take up their Cross and follow their Saviour.
This the Primitive Fathers did not only frequently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to their Auditors, but manifested their Doctrine (as
is evident from their Works) very often by their own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>But when the aforesaid Emperour had setled the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, and added the Civil Sanction, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
its Precepts as the Laws Imperial, the Doctrine
of the Gospel (as to the suffering part) was much altered.
In all former Mutations or Changes in the Government of
the Empire, the Christian Pastors constantly exhorted their
Flocks to obey the Supream Powers; not to calumniate,
or speak evil of Dignities, but patiently to submit to the
most barbarous Cruelties.</p>
               <p>But when the Evangelical Doctrine and Discipline was
Established by Law, and <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Orthodox Clergy,<note n="*" place="margin">Contra Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantum Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum.</note> St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> that Pious and
Learned Father, roundly tells the Emperour of his impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and unchristian Actions. And when <hi>Julian</hi> Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
from the Faith, banished the Gospel, demolished the
Churches, and scoffingly told the Christians, their <hi>Doctrine
was to suffer;</hi> an Eminent Man of that Age writ a Tract
<note n="†" place="margin">De Regibus Apostaticis.</note> approved as Orthodox Doctrine by that Catholick and
Renown'd Bishop <hi>Athanasius,</hi> which tartly inform'd the
Emperour, That the Christian Religion (when Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Law) allowed its Votaries to justifie their Rights,
and was not to be trampled upon, ruined, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to gratifie the Humour of an Ambitious and Idolatrous
Prince.</p>
               <p>That of St. <hi>Paul</hi> has no Relation to our present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
the Weapons there mentioned, are no Shields or
Bucklers against the Hostile Attempts of our Adversaries,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49977:15"/>
but such as the Church is invested with for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Criminal Members; such as Excommunication, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that 'tis clear and evident those places of Holy Writ
that enjoyns Obedience to Superiors, however express or
emphatical in themselves, have neither Relation or Aspect
to our present Circumstances; they only enjoyn Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to all lawful Commands, and prohibit Resistance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the greatest punishment, when legally imposed; which
is so far from our late Transactions, at which you scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they were only acted to preserve our pure and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
Religion, and secure our Fundamental Laws and
Ancient Government.</p>
               <p>And 'tis most palpably ridiculous and very injurious to
the Gospel, to wrest places of Scripture, peculiarly adapted
to the Suffering State of Christianity; I mean whil'st 'twas
under Pagan Princes, and without National Laws to support
it, to blacken and condemn the Actions of Christians; whose
Religion and Liberties are Entail'd to posterity by Established
Lawes; and whose only Action (for which they are blamed)
is for Rescuing their Religion from Superstition and Idolatry,
and their Ancient Liberties from the Vassallage and Slavery of
Arbitrary Power.</p>

               <p>But 'tis observable, when God chastiz'd the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> he never did it by their own
People, but by a strange Nation; shewing by the Conduct
of his Justice and Providence, that Subjects must not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Faults of their Kings, but leave that to God,
to whom they are only Answerable for what they do.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, that was the general Method God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
used in that Nation, especially with those he had
advanced to the Throne, by Vertue of an Extraordinary
Commission from himself. Yet the Histories of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
yield us particular Examples of the contrary practice.
Thus the Cruelty, Irreligion, and wicked Reign of <hi>Jeboram,</hi>
caused <hi>Libnah</hi> to revolt from under his Government, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 10. And the Reason of this Revolt was because <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49977:15"/>
And the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> (when <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> their
Lawful King, had silenced the <hi>Jewish</hi> Burnt-Offerings and
Sacrifices, profaned their Sabbaths, and polluted their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary)
by opposition and violence, in a most hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
rescued their Worship from <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolatry, and
cleansed their Sanctuary from such <hi>Pagan</hi> Pollutions. And

               <p>Were I convinced of all we have hitherto discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, there is another Knot so intricate and perplexing,
that I despair ever of satisfaction. The <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi>
is so express and positive, so firm and binding an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that nothing can possibly be a firmer Tie to secure my
Obedience to <hi>James</hi> the Second; <hi>(viz.) Not to take up
Arms against the King upon any pretence whatsoever:</hi> And to
give this Oath of Fidelity to another, is not only a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in it self, but a down-right Violation of that former
sacred Obligation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The Objection, I confess, (before seriously consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
is a very plausible plea, and of great importance; but
when compared with the Rules of Right Reason, and the
Commands of Scripture, the Difficulty doth immediately
vanish. Yet I deny not but such Oaths are of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in a Publick Society: by <hi>these</hi> Princes are secured
of their Subjects Allegiance, Generals of their Soldiers Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
Subjects assertained their Princes will not degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Tyrants; Leagues confirm'd between Nations,
Peace conserv'd among Men, Mutual Commerce and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
secured, Liberties and Properties maintained, Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
and Suits decided.</p>
               <p>And among those the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> challenges a prime
place, being really and indeed a very sacred Obligation;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) a calling of<note n="†" place="margin">Iurare nihil est aliud quam Deum testem invocare.</note> God to witness the Reality of our
Inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion, to keep inviolable that Faith and Obedience
we have promised and sworn to our Superiors,<note place="margin">Assumere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in testem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur jurare.</note> the breach
of which is a most horrid Crime, a superlative Perjury,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49977:16"/>
very often severely punished in this World, and (without
a sincere and unfeigned Repentance) will inevitably ruin us
in the next.</p>
               <p>So that whatever we thus promise, we are as firmly
obliged to perform, as the Wit of Man can contrive to
bind us.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this, the Oath of Allegiance,
however solemnly administred, or however significant or
express in it self, adds nothing to the Duty of Obedience
incumbent upon us as Subjects, without, and antecedent
to the formal Administration of it; it may indeed corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
and confirm the Obligation, by adding Perjury to
our Disobedience, but it cannot encrease or augment the
Duty.</p>
               <p>And the very End and Design of the Oath, attests the
same; for though the Oath do particularly name the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate (because he is Head of the whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty),
as if 'twere design'd only for his Protection and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet we may rationally infer, That the Parliament
(being conven'd for the good of the Publick) who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this Oath, took it themselves, and imposed it upon
others, had in this Oath a more General and Notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
of a more Excellent and Transcendent Nature;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to promote the Safety, Honour and Happiness of
the whole Society. This is evident from the Ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Injustice of that acceptation; for if the Oath of
Allegiance be obligatory only in the former sense; (<hi>viz.</hi>)
have respect only to the Protection and Safety of the
King's Person, without having any Relation to the Peace
and Welfare of the Publick? By this Obligation our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives
in Parliament, put both themselves and us
into the hands of the Supream Power, to destroy us at his
pleasure; binding us by the most solemn Obligations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
even the Sacred Ties of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi>
quietly to submit to the Invasions of our Liberties and
Properties, Confiscation of our Goods, Sequestration of
our Estates, Prophanation of our Holy and Apostolick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by Superstitious and Idolatrous Practices; and to all
other barbarous Outrages that the Pride and Ambition of
Man, or the Malice and Cruelty of Implacable Enemies,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49977:16"/>
could invent; which is a <hi>Soloecism</hi> of so grand a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as we may well think impossible for so Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Judicious, and August a Senate to impose upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Especially if we consider, that the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi>
taken only in the former Intention, confounds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
all other Constitutions of Parliament; is opposite
and destructive to the Fundamental Laws of Nature;
<hi>(viz.) Self-Preservation,</hi> and plainly repugnant to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Rules and Precepts, which (to any Rational Man)
methinks should be a sufficient Argument to engage him
to understand it, in the Second, and more Excellent Sense,
since 'tis granted by all Men of Reason and Learning,
That Oaths are only obligatory in the Sense of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who invent and impose them, if their Intention may
clearly and rationally appear from the words, as expressed
in the Oath.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> in different Circumstances,
being capable of a double Construction, and both appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
agreeable to the Intention and Design of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
I will a little illustrate the Reasonableness of this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
signification.</p>
               <p>The Royal Authority being the Head of the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
the Life of the Law, and the Soul of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis not only highly reasonable, but absolutely
necessary for the Publick Advantage and Behoof, to
fence and defend this Supream Magistrate against For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Enemies, and secure him from private Insurrections at
home.</p>
               <p>And to the end that Rebellion might prove abortive in
the very Conception, and that Cockatrice Egg be crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ere it became a Serpent; the sacred Tie of the <hi>Oath
of Allegiance</hi> was judged the most effectual means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Civil Wars, repel all open Hostility, and secure
the whole Society of the intire Affections of every particular
Member.</p>
               <p>And the King being the Person to whom was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the weighty and important Affairs of the Nation,
and in whose Management and Conduct, the Happiness
or Misery of the Publick does very much consist. This
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49977:17"/>
Oath of Fidelity was personally made to the Supream
Magistrate, as Head, though really designed for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and Promotion of the Peace, Happiness and
Safety of the whole Society.</p>
               <p>And for the Truth of this Assertion, I appeal to the
Capacity of the meanest Reader, whether he can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the Great Council of the Nation, Assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who composed this Oath of Fidelity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
it to be given to the Prince; whether, I say, they
design'd it only for the Preservation and Safety of the
King? Especially when (by his own Option and Choice)
he should place his personal Interest and Safety in opposition
to that of the Publick Weal?</p>
               <p>From hence 'tis evident, That in all ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Circumstances; that is, when the Interest of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority, and the People, (which always ought to
be) are in Conjunction, the Oath of Allegiance binds
all Subjects, both with Life and Fortune, to assist and
defend the Supream Magistrate against all Stratagems
and Hostilities, whether publick or private. And the
Reason of this is, because the Prince is so nearly allied
to the Publick, and so much a part of it, that the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Happiness of the latter is, in a very high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
involved in the Prosperity and Welfare of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>But in great Exigencies, and Extraordinary Junctures of
Affairs, in which the Ruine and Destruction of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
is inevitably involved (especially if that National Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
be favoured, advanced and promoted by that
Person whose particular Safety is design'd in the Oath,)
the promise of Fidelity in such Circumstances, bind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the latter, and more general Intention; for Kings
were made for the People, not the People for Kings.
And it is plain Madness to imagine any Obligation
can bind us to hasten the Accomplishment, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our own, but the Publick Destruction; because
such Actions are Diametrically opposite of all Laws, both
Natural, and Civil, and Divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49977:17"/>
And that Extraordinary Contingencies are not to be
regulated but by Extraordinary Methods, is plain and
obvious from several Topicks. In Common and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Circumstances, the Laws secure every man in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Property: Thus the breaking a private man's
House, forcibly seizing a man's Goods, or violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
his Person, are Actions very unjust, and highly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable.</p>
               <p>But in Extraordinary Cases, these are no Rules; but
Necessity has her Laws: As in time of a Raging Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Propriety of Goods may be forced; Corn may
by Violence be taken from private men, and sold for the
publick Relief; In a Noysome Plague, and Infectious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,
for the Common Preservation, Men may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from Commerce, and confined to their Houses:
and in an apparent apprehension of an Invasion from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
encouraged by a Party at home, Men may be
seized, or imprisoned, or restrained to their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Thus Divine Providence Constituted the General Law
of Nature to regulate the Ordinary Course of things: but
beside these, Miracles have been often effected, which the
aforesaid Law could never regulate: and yet these super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
and stupendious Works were always design'd for
wholesome and excellent Ends. Thus Nature her self,
for her own preservation in <hi>vacuums,</hi> &amp;c. causes Natural
things to act contrary to their Natural Motions, forcibly
attracting heavy Bodies upward, and as impetuously compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the light to descend.</p>
               <p>And the express and positive Laws of the Decalogue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Solemnity of their Promulgation, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Evangelical Commands of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(though back'd with stupendious Miracles to attest
their Divinity,) are null and void, when by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Circumstances they are placed in opposition to the
Works of Mercy, Charity or Necessity. Our Saviour,
confirming this Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 11. saith, <hi>Which
of you shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the
Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and pluck it
out?</hi> Notwithstanding the strict Precept for the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49977:18"/>
of that Day. And our strictest Casuists (in case
of Necessity) allow <hi>Apothecaries</hi> to Compound Medicines,
<hi>Mariners</hi> to follow their daily Labours, and <hi>Midwives</hi> to
do their Office upon the Lord's Day; and all this for the
preservation of particular Persons.</p>
               <p>So that the Natural Consequence from hence, is, That
if the preservation of a few Individuals be more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, than the strictest Litteral Observance of his
Laws; and the Deliverance of the Publick from Ruine
and Destruction, a Matter of such grand Importance,
such absolute Necessity, as can consecrate the Violation
of positive Laws, both Humane and Divine. Then our
present Obligation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Oath of Allegiance, Not to
take up Arms against the King, upon any pretence whatsoever,</hi>
can be obligatory only in the Literal Sense, when the
Interest of the Supream Magistrate is in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Publick Safety and Happiness, and has no
Relation to his particular Intreagues, or Personal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>And if the Royal Authority (as in our late Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
be so deeply infatuated by the wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of Impious and Self-ended Men, as to sever his
Peace, Prosperity and Quiet from that of the whole
Nation, and illegally to prosecute that Advice so far,
as to place his own Safety, Happiness and Tranquility,
in Opposition to the Safety, Welfare and Security of all
his People; the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> is then loose, as to
him, and obligatory only in the latter and more Excellent
Sense.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
               <p>But all Oaths, when once taken, (if imposed
by a Lawful Authority, and Legal Oaths) do so far
invest the Persons sworn to, with a Right to the thing
sworn, that the Person swearing has no Power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(without the other's Consent) to retrieve that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
unless by Violence and manifest Injustice. Now
the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> being a Lawful Oath, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a Competent Authority, my taking this Oath
invested the King with a Right to my Fidelity
and Obedience; That without the Approbation of
his Royal Person, 'tis not only unjust, but even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49977:18"/>
to divest him of it, and confer it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Right! The former part of your Assertion is true,
the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> is a Lawful Oath, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a sufficient Authority; yet His Majesty, before
you took this Oath, was invested with as undoubted
Right to your Obedience, and in as full and ample
a manner, as if you had taken the Oath a Thousand
times. Neither indeed has the Supream Magistrate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to absolve you from this Obligation; And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this is manifest; for the Daty of Allegiance does
so mightily conduce to promote the Advantage and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the whole Society, that the Publick in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
(of which the Supream Magistrate is but a part)
challenges so large a Concernment in it, that 'tis a
manifest Wrong, an apparent Injustice, for a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(though never so great) to dispence with the undoubted
Birthright of every Subject.</p>
               <p>So that should the Oath be taken only in the first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
as you seem plainly to understand it, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
to have Relation only to the Safety and Preservation
of the King's Person, without an Eye to the Publick
Welfare and Security, the Oath, in that Sense, is not
Obligatory, but, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> void from the very impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>And the Reason of this is plain and obvious, because
all Oaths, or Promissory Obligations, that are contrary
to our Duty to our God, our Neighbour, or our selves;
repugnant to Piety, Justice or Charity, are invalid, and
bind not. <hi>Rei illicitae nulla obligatio,</hi> is a Maxim so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the Doctrine of the Gospel, that no Christian
(I suppose) has a face to deny it. And that the <hi>Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi>
in your sense, is <hi>Res illicita,</hi> is easily manifested from
several Topicks.</p>
               <p>First, From its Opposition to Piety, and Destructiveness
to Religion. His Majesty to whom you have given this
Oath of Fidelity, is by Profession a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi>
and, <hi>qua talis,</hi> he is obliged, not only by the Principles
of his Religion, but <hi>sub poenâ,</hi> of Excommunication, Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
yea, Damnation, to extirpate the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49977:19"/>
to the utmost of his Power, and to propagate Superstition
and Idolatry in its room.</p>
               <p>Now your Notion of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> is both
a License and Encouragement to such a Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
actually to free himself from the Tyes of such
Powerful and Terrifying Obligations, by prosecuting the
Business: For when his Person and Government is secured
(under the penalty of Perjury, and punishment of Rebellion)
against all Resistance and Opposition from the Publick, what
Block can hinder him from working out his Liberty, setting
up his Superstition, Idolatry, and approving himself to his
Holy Father, by subverting our Laws, destroying our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by severely punishing those who obstinately oppose
his Arbitrary Proceedings?</p>
               <p>Beside, if the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Not to take up Arms
against the King, upon any pretence whatsoever;</hi> but to assist his
Majesty with Life, Limb, and Terrence Honour, be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
particularly of the King's Person; by this Argument,
if a King degenerate to a <hi>Julian,</hi> his Subjects are (by all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Obligations) bound to assist him with their utmost Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in demolishing the Temples and Houses of God, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
their Religion, burning their Bibles, and banishing
the Gospel from his Territories, and by their endeavours to
introduce <hi>Paganism,</hi> and establish the Worship of <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> in this Sense is not Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
because of its contrariety to Justice and Righteousness:
Politick Justice commands us to support as well as obey all the
wholesom Laws of that Society we are Members of; and the
Divine Precepts enjoyn us to protect the Innocent, relieve the
Needy, and defend the Oppressed; which are Mandates very
inconsistent with your Notion of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance:</hi> for
according to your Interpretation of that Obligation, all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are obliged to support and defend the Supream Magistrate
in all his Proceedings, as well when he oppresses the Loyal and
Innocent, as when he punishes the Guilty and Criminal; as
vigorously in his Encroachments upon the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Subject (if he please to invade them) as in
maintaining his own Just Rights and Prerogatives.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatsoever Plea or Objection may be made
against the two former, there is in the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49977:19"/>
in the aforesaid sense, such an evident Repugnancy to
that Eminent and Evangelical Duty, Charity, so frequently
inculcated in sacred Scripture, that that alone doth sufficiently
evidence the Invalidity of the Obligation.</p>
               <p>The Duties of Mercy and Charity, are not only the Advice
and Counsel of our Saviour, but his express and positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
(<hi>viz</hi>) That we shew Mercy as our Heavenly Father
is merciful; that we deal by others as we would be dealt with
in the like Circumstances: Merciful not only to Mens Bodies,
the perishing part, but chiefly to their Souls, that are Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and must live for ever; that we may (as much as in us
lies) promote and set forward the salvation of all men; not to
detract from, or add to the Word of God, nor to comply
with those that do it, but uncorruptedly to teach it to our sons,
<hi>and our sons sons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> in the aforesaid acceptation, can
never be reconciled to this Doctrine; for that Obligation,
(whenever the Supream Magistrate pleases) destroys Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
confirms the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Principle, opens a door to Popery,
Turcism, Apostacy, Atheism, or what else that Magistrate
shall please to introduce.</p>
               <p>And whatever Objection may be produced against it from
our sins; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they are as numerous and great as the
Transgressions of <hi>Sodom,</hi> unparallel and provoking as the
Wickedness of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that our obstinate contempt, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
abuse of his Evangelical Mercies, cry aloud to Divine
Justice, at least, to obscure and darken his Gospel, if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
to deprive us of it, yet these can never justifie our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
to future Ages, or yield any pretence to a Plea, to
free us from our Duty of Christian Charity, to the Infants of
our Time, and the Children yet unborn, which doubtless are
not criminals upon this account, which notwithstanding will
(by this unparallel stupidity of ours, under the Mask or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of Loyalty) be (as by a fatal and peremptory Decree)
for ever deprived of the knowledge of the right worship of
God, and inevitably involve them into such a lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as will certainly render them either in defiance of God
their Creator, or in ignorance of a saving knowledge of their
blessed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49977:20"/>
The Natural Consequence from the whole is, That the <hi>Oath
of Allegiance</hi> can only bind in the first sense, when 'tis in order
to effect the second; that is, it only obliges us to protect and
defend the Interest of the Supream Magistrate, when his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is subservient to the welfare of the whole Society. But if
bigotted Zeal, haughty Ambition, or wicked Counsellors, be
so prevalent with the Prince, as to obliterate his Duty to the
Publick, and upon private Picks and Humors, destroy the
Laws, subvert Religion, neglect all the Methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and separate his own Happiness from the Safety and
Welfare of the Publick; the Oath in the former sense is void
and inobligatory.</p>
               <p>And the Reason of this Consequence is very plain, because
men are under former Obligations to the contrary: For in the
Baptismal Vow, (which is commonly the first men make,)
they oblige themselves by that Covenant made with God, to
perform all Christian Duties, which respect either God, their
Neighbours or themselves, and especially to the Works of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Justice and Charity. Now <hi>After-Obligations</hi> can never
bind such to opposite Duties; <hi>Obligatio prior praejudicat posteriori;</hi>
as in case of Marriage, <q>A Pre-contract with one Party, void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
After contracts with any other: And if a man convey
Lands to several Persons, by Deeds of several Dates, the
first Conveyance stands in force, and all the rest are void.</q>
Thus the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> (though design'd and taken in
your sense) becomes void and inobligatory, because it finds
men formerly engaged to contrary Duties.</p>
