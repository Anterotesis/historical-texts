            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Survey of the River <hi>AVON,</hi> from <hi>BATH,</hi> to <hi>BRISTOL,</hi> by Experienc'd Artiſts; with their Opinion of the Difficulty, and Charges to make the ſame Navigable.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THAT from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to <hi>Hannam,</hi> which is 5 Miles by Land, the River is already Navigable; But that 12 Tydes in 15 days, do not flow to <hi>Hannam,</hi> in which Tydes no Boat can be brought thither, and the higheſt Tyde doth not ſerve above 3 hours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That upon the River, from <hi>Hannam</hi> to <hi>Bath,</hi> being but 6 Miles by Land, there are ſeven <hi>Wears,</hi> and twenty nine <hi>Mills,</hi> beſides ſeveral Fords and Bridges for Paſſage, between <hi>Glouceſter-ſhirt</hi> and <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-ſhire,</hi> and many <hi>Rocks,</hi> and <hi>Shallows</hi> croſs the River.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The firſt <hi>Wear</hi> from <hi>Bath,</hi> is upper <hi>Tierton-Wear,</hi> at which is ſix foot and a half fall of Water; that the neceſſary charge of fixing Locks in the ſaid <hi>Wear,</hi> will be <hi>9001.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſecond <hi>Wear</hi> is lower <hi>Tierton,</hi> at which is 6 Foot and 8 Inches fall, and the freſh riſes there 16 foot, and is frequently Choaked with Sand; and the fixing Locks in this <hi>Wear,</hi> will coſt 1000l; in which <hi>Wear</hi> it appears, a Lock hath been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, formerly, to be ſet, but left unfiniſhed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third <hi>Wear</hi> is that of <hi>Salford,</hi> where there is ſeven Foot fall, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſixteeh Foot deep on each ſide the <hi>Wear,</hi> the River not to be diverted, but with extream difficulty, for tho' Draughts be made, according to the cuſtom of the River, there will ſtill remain twelve Foot water, and the fixing Locks in this <hi>Wear</hi> (if pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable) will coſt at leaſt 1500l.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The fourth <hi>Wear</hi> is <hi>Kelſon,</hi> at which is ſeven Foot fall, which (tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ words">
                  <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
               </gap> he eaſieſt) will coſt at leaſt 800l. to place Locks there.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The fifth <hi>Wear</hi> is that of <hi>Swinford,</hi> which hath 5 Foot, and a half head of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will likewiſe coſt 800l. to place Locks there.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſixth <hi>Wear</hi> is <hi>Keinſham,</hi> which hath 8 Foot and a half head of Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a conſiderable fall from the <hi>Wear</hi> to a hundred Foot below the Bridge, which cannot be made Navigable, but by making a new <hi>Wear</hi> and <hi>Lock</hi> below the Bridge, or by cutting a new Water-way, from the Mill Pond, to one hundred Yards below the Bridge, which will be 400 Yards, and a Lock to Pen fourteen Foot high will coſt 1800l.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ſeventh <hi>Wear</hi> is <hi>Hannam,</hi> at which there is eight Foot and a half fall, the water not to be diverted; the Banks being there 15 Foot high, and the water riſing by freſhes more then 20 Foot Perpendicular height; placing Locks there, will coſt at leaſt 1500l. If it can be performed at all.</p>
            <p n="10">10. So that, the <hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> Charges, in placing the ſaid ſeveral <hi>Locks,</hi> Amount to 8300l. And thoſe Locks cannot be made, without the hazard of uſual and Cuſtomary floods, and other Accidents, which, ſhould they happen during the Work (as is more then probable) the <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Charges and Damages cannot be computed or gueſſed at.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the <hi>Charges</hi> above, are computed, without Consideration had, of the Damages the Proprietors of the Lands upon the ſaid River will ſuſtein, or of the great Damages the Proprietors of each <hi>Mill</hi> muſt unavoidably ſuſler, by loſs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the while the <hi>Locks</hi> are ſetting down, and afterwards by the frequent opening them; And eſpecially <hi>Hannam</hi> Mills, which are the <hi>Loweſt</hi> upon the River, and where the Engins are placed for ſerving the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> with freſh water: The working of which requires the greateſt ſtrength of water the River now Affords.</p>
