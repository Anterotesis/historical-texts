            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter written from abord the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall of Sir <hi>Kenelme Digbie.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe tenth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1628. we lay at Hull all night in sight of Cape <hi>Congier,</hi> which is ten leagues from <hi>Scanderon,</hi> and sent a boat to descry the Road. The next morning shee brought vs word that there were at Ancor there two Venetian Galleazzes, two of their Galleons, two English ships and foure French vessells. We then prouided our selues to come into that place, and had fitted our selues in most ample manner, both for offence, defence and freeing of vessels if we should be hard set, the name of Gallegrezes was a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, but after a short speech made to our men, they expressed much desire to aduenture in, and gaue assurance that they would not faile in performing their duties; Indeed they kept their words, for neuer men behaued themselues more brauely. About ten of the clocke that day (then) wee had a fine gale which brought vs within a league of <hi>Scanderone</hi> by two of the clocke in the afternoone; and wee had sent the Sattie in before to deliuer Letters to the Generall of the Venetians, as also to the English Captaines there. Therein acquainting them how we came forth vpon a voyage of warfare, with his Maiesties Commission vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> and assuring them of all due respect and friendlinesse vnto them as became vs. Vpon the receipt of this Letter the <hi>Venetians</hi> wayed anchor, and treating our men very discourteously would not permit them to goe deliuer our Letters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the English ships; the Galleasses haue betweene 30. or 40. brasse guns in each of them of incredible big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9309:7"/>
some of 9000. weight, they haue six or 700. men in them a piece; the Galleons were of aboue 800. tuns, one had 40. the other had 30. great brasse Ordnance. As soone as they were within shot of vs the Admirall Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasse shot a bullet within halfe a shippes length of vs, which we vnderstood as a salute (for we had giuen them no cause to the contrarie) therefore saluted them with a peece from them wards and did so to all the other vessels which likewise shot at vs after 7. or 8. shots (some of which did hit some of our ships.) They shot at our flag and at the same instant our Satties boat came aboard vs, and told vs how hardly the <hi>Venetians</hi> had treated them, and in returne to our respectiue Letter they sent this message. That if wee did not immediatly depart out of sight of the Road, they would sinke our vessels. We then endeuoured the best wee could to let them see our long forbearance was to make our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell a iust one and not through apprehension of their much famed vessels. For we gaue them 3. or 4. broad sides in a very short time, which (they being neare) did them spoile, vpon this they grew more cautious and fought at a further distance whilst in the meane time we laid so well at the Galleons that the men stowed themselues in their holds, and left their vessels to their owne fortunes without guidance. The Galleasses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp to help them receiued so rude a welcome from vs, that they rowed amayne away, and sheltred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder the English ships that were in the Road; which saued of them neare 100. shot out of our ship; for we were all commanded to be very cautious in that point rather to misse an opportunitie of hurting the Enemie, then to endanger our Countrimen. In this time whilst the <hi>Eagle</hi> Vice-admirall and Rere-admirall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9309:8"/>
were hot in fight with the Galleasses and Galleons, the <hi>Hopewell</hi> and the <hi>Sattie</hi> were sent vpon the French men, one of them had 16. Peeces of Ordnance, all the other had some guns, 3. of their vessels they took pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, the fourth ran a ground; at our beginning the fight, she had a 100000. peeces of Eight Rials in her, but before we could board her, she had sent all the money ashoare in her boats. Towards euening it blew a fresh gale with yare working of our ships, it fared ill with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and they sought to auoid vs as much as they could. And we followed them close, our great guns going off in swiftnesse rather like Muskets then Peeces of Ordnance, the truth is our men did exceed beliefe in good performance. And if our powder had not beene very bad, for wee had none but <hi>Dutch</hi> Powder, and the day calme, we had soone ended the quarrell with them: By this time they were much maymed in their oares, and had receiued many dangerous shots. Then they procured the <hi>English</hi> Vice-consull here, (who was aboard them) to come to our Admiral to mediate their peace; who would not consent to it vpon any other termes but that they should quit the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> wholy to our deuotion; and acknowledge their error expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be sorrie for it. To these conditions they glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assented, and the Generall sent his Chancellor to vs with such a Letter as was desired and expected from him. Then the Vice Consul represented to our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall what preiudice it might bee to the Merchants of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo;</hi> if we carried away the French vessels, and after ransacking, finding there was nothing worth carriage in them (for they had landed althings during the fight, and sunke most of their Gunnes) we onely tooke their Flags out of them and some Brasse-bases to serue our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9309:8"/>
beats-head, besides what our Saylors pillaged (which was some good quantitie of money all that was left.) And sent for our men of from them that night and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd them the next day to their owners, assuring them of quiet possession in this fight which lasted neer three houres, we made neere 200. shot out of our ship play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one side of it for the calme permitted no other, and about 500. out of our Fleet, and they as many or more at vs: they killed vs neuer a man but hurt some few (thankes bee to God) and spoyled vs some Masts, Sayles, rigging and shot some of our shippes through but in no dangerous places. By their acknowledgement afterwards wee killed them nine and fortie men out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right besides a great number hurt. Their vessels were much spoiled, about which they were at worke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring them all the while, wee staid in the Road and brought their vessels vpon the Careene to stoppe their leakes betwixt wind and water. In euidence how much they had lost of their former pride. We saw the next day a Frigot comming into which wee mand out our boat, and shee tooke her within 4. boats length of the Admirall Galleasse, and our <hi>Sattia</hi> in chase of that Frigot sailed within a boats lenght round about the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Galleasse to which the Frigot betooke her selfe for aide, Insteed of presenting this they sent vs very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous salutations by our men who brought the Frigot to vs. And whereas formerly they did set their Watch with much ceremonie with Drummes, Trumpets and Gunnes, and so like wise discharged it, now they passe their time with much silence. Whilst wee performe duly all the rites that belong to them that haue the superioritie in a Road.</p>
