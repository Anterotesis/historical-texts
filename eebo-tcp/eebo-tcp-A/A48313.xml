         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. E. Hyde, in answer
to one of his, occasioned by the late
Insurrection at Salisbury.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was my resolution a good while ago (of which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to give a good account, though I do not to you) never
to deale with you in a private way of writing under Seal,
but to maintain a publique contestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with you, for all the
differences betwixt us in a fairer Character then either you or I
can write, &amp; to make all conscientions and rationall Readers
judges of the right we claim, and of the wrong we charge upon
each other: And your last Letter of <hi>March</hi> 29. rather fully
confirms me in this course, then any way diverts me from it,
because (as I shall prove before I conclude mine exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it) it referreth to now publique affairs, (though a little
before secretly carryed in the way of a Plot) both for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
which induced you to it, and for the end you aimed at in
it. Before I come to examination and answer of the parts
of it, I will premise my generall censure of the whole, which
is this. In the Letter you have shewed such boldnesse, in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that against me which is untrue, such eagernesse (in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of me, that which is unjust) that I may well thinke when
you wrote it, you set aside, not only the sincerity of a Divine,
but the charity of a Christian, and the ingenuity of a Scholar.
Now to the particulars, It beginneth thus.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64415:2"/>
                  <head>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> H.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>you may easily remember how much I have
receded from my Wives Right of Fifts, hitherto.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Sir, Remembrance is of a thing that hath or had
a being, and easie remembrance of that which by its evidence
and importance maketh a strong impression upon the memory:
Your Wives right of Fifths out of the Rectory of <hi>Brightwell</hi>
(as you require them) is no such thing, but a <hi>Non ens,</hi> a meer
nothing.<note place="margin">Colleg. Conim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricens. in lib. <hi>Aristot.</hi> de memoria &amp; Reminiscentia c. 10. col. 18. Â§. 13.</note> I will not say but you may imagine some appearance
of a right, for if (as some do) you lodge phantasie and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
both in one bed, they may be the parents of such a phantasme.
But I may rather say, Sir, You may easily remember that I have
proved your wife hath no such right at all to fifths; as you claim
in her name, because I have given you reasons in print against
it, which (I doubt not) will be acknowledged valid, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
(either to satisfie or silence you) by all unpartiall Judges,
who shall read them, as by many such they have been already;
whereas you neither do, nor can give any to the contrary,
which may with any colour of truth be brought both to oppose
or over-poise them.</p>
            <p>And this is not my conceit alone, but his judgement like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
whose great parts have deservedly advanced him to high
prelations of dignity and authority above other men. For
when (about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last) I told him I
had not received a word from you, in answer to my Book sent
you about the 11th. of the last <hi>November.</hi> Nor ever shall
do (said he) intimating (as then I understood his meaning)
that you were convinced by it (and therefore made no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against it, for then he knew nothing (though he be a very
knowing &amp; eminently learned man) of that mystery of iniquity
(since revealed) whereof you are thought to have been both
sooner and more confidingly acquainted, then a true hearted
English Patriot should have been, and whereby you might be
not only moved, but much heartned &amp; heightned in your spirit,
to act by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> &amp; to write to me your selfe, as of late you did.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>D. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>And how much you have receded from your sever all promises.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64415:2"/>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Just so much, neither more nor lesse, that is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a whit, either the one or the other, for I have constantly
been so punctuall in performance of my promises (though to
my great disadvantage, as those who best know me, will testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for me) that I have lost more, meerly to keepe my word,
then somebody (I say not Dr. <hi>H.</hi>) would have done to keepe
his Oath: If you will not believe me, believe your selfe, and
then you will not be so forward to impute unto me the breach
of promise with you, which hitherto I have not made. You
are my witnesse, that to keepe my word with my Parishioners,
(without any likelihood of benefit, or rather with apparent
probability of damage to my selfe, from which I might have
been freed within a few houres) I refused an hundred pound
in hand for the first payment of a years rent, which I thought
fully enough for the Rectory of <hi>Brightwell.</hi> And in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the 17. of <hi>November</hi> 1653. wherein you acknowledge
the receit of moneys from me: You say in your next words,
<q>For which I kindely thank you, for really it is now a great
courtesie for a man to keepe his word, though I cannot say but
you have carefully kept yours.</q> Since that time, what breach
of promise can you charge me with? I wish you had given
me just cause to commend your constancie in the like kinde,
but instead thereof, you put me to complain of your levity and
unfaithfulnesse, in that you promised you would not expect the
payment of Fifths above two years, for as you said, and I
have shewed (page 16 of my Book) you should not need them
any longer, and now (after four years receit of them) you are
(as if you were distempered with an hydropical thirst of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse)
no lesse <hi>Pecuniarum petax,</hi> but rather more then
you were at first. You say in the same line:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>And now at last you seeke to recede from your agreement.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> An agreement is a promise and somewhat more,
and therefore to recede from it, is worse then to recede from a
single promise; so worse and worse on your part, for this is the
third stumble you take at the threshold, the four first lines of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64415:3"/>
your Letter contains three untruths, and this last is not the
least, but so much the greater as it is more expresly confuted,
<hi>pag.</hi> 24, 25, 26, of my printed Book. That I may not take it
too tenderly, that you thus accuse me, you presently bring in
an accusation against your selfe, saying.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>It was the sin of my civility (because you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of being raised in the contribution) to let Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
offer you but 280 li. but yet in effect to give you as good as
300 li.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> For your sinne of civility (if it were so) he that
would not pardon you (so seldome offending on that hand)
hath an harder heart towards you then I have. But wherein
shewed you your civility? you say in letting Mr. <hi>D.</hi> offer
but 280 <hi>li.</hi> in money: why Sir, was Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to be directed
by you what he should offer? and had you the disposall of his
tongue and hand, to promise so much by word and writing,
as he did, and of his purpose for performance of what he so
promised? He is (surely too wise to take his rate from your
direction, whose interest was (as he and you conceived) wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in mine, if the treaty were seriously and sincerely intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
on his part. But when I expressed my conceit, that he
was set on by you, to make me an offer, and but an offer, and
that only for your advantage, he would not then own it, with
any relation unto you, either as an efficient or finall cause of
any motion toward a contract betwixt us: nor did he (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as you suggest) give me (you would say bid me, for he
gave me nothing) as good as 300 <hi>li.</hi> And for the reason you
render of being raised in the contribution, that might have, and
in probability had, no farther operation upon you, then was
commensurate with your concupiscence, after a large portion
of the parsonage, which made you fear the fifths claimed by
you would be so much the lesse, as the charge was the greater
upon the whole. It was not (then) the sin of your civility,
that Mr. <hi>Day</hi> made such an offer at <hi>that time,</hi> but your sin of
hypocrisie, <hi>now,</hi> in pretending it was done to gratifie me.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Truth is, I should have been contented with Fifths
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64415:3"/>
(after that proportion) and had rather have lost my share of
20 li. <hi>per annum,</hi> then have given the Parishoners occasion of
exacting upon you.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Truth is, It is weil Sir, that there is some truth
in your Letter, though but a word, yet is not that word so
truly brought in by you as it should be, for it leadeth in a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which no discreet man (who knoweth you) will believe
to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that you had rather lose about 4 <hi>li.</hi> a year, then
that I should be raised but the eighth part of that sum in the
Military Assesment. If you looke to be believed (while you
so lavishly bely your selfe) that you may be mistaken for a
moderate man, you must finde out an example for <hi>Solomons</hi>
Aphorisme <hi>Prov. 14. 15. The simple believeth every word.</hi>

                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>But now (you say) since I make so ill use of all that
I can do, only to try how much I am content to suffer, it is high
time for me to send this letter of demand.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer. But now. &amp;c.</hi> I must therefore henceforth expect
you will be more curst then you have been, because you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you have been too kinde heretofore, yet must I not think
the worse of you for all that, because you give two reasons for
the change of your dealing with me. 1. That you have done
all you can to give me content, that's your meaning (if you
write sense) though your form of words reach not so far. 2.
That I have abused your goodnesse by ungratefull returns, only
<hi>to try the extent of your patience.</hi> He is well worthy (I confes)
to be visited with the Rod, who will not be won by the spirit
of meeknesse,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 21.</note> and supposing me such an one, you come to this
resolution, <hi>It is high time for you to send this letter to demand,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For your first reason, <hi>that you have done all you can, &amp;c.</hi>
I am sure, Sir, you have done all you can to get all you could
from me, though never so much to my discontent and damage,
and this I can aver upon 4 years deare bought experience, of
such an inordinate desire in you, as the Apostle calleth, <hi>The
root of all evill.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>Your second reason is, <hi>That I have made ill use of your

favourable usage of me, only to try how much you are content
to suffer.</hi> You mean this because of my Book against the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a fifth part, wherein I give reasons why I resolve to
give it over, and not to pay that unrighteous Tribute any more.</p>
            <p>But why do you say it is only to try how much you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to suffer, what needeth that? when I know (almost ever
since I knew you) you were not content to suffer the losse of a
Groat, which you might either gain or save by any pretence of
right: may I not (upon just cause) conceive so of you, when
being to pay you <hi>19 li. 12 s. 2 d.</hi> upon very dear rates for
over-worne utensils, the first year of my comming to <hi>Br.</hi> you
tooke the whole summe, not abating so much as the odde two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of so hard a bargain? and you know well enough by my
Book, that I refused to pay fifths, not to try your patience, but
to free my selfe from your oppression. And why do you say,
<q>Now since you make so ill use of all that I can do:</q> Did I make
any ill use of your pretended kindnesse in <hi>March</hi> last, when
your Letter beareth date, or in <hi>November</hi> the last year, when
I sent you my printed Acquittance the next day after I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it from <hi>London?</hi> That, I doubt not (as I said before)
is the ill use you mean. If so, why did you not write unto me
until four moneths after? Why were you so silent so long,
when that which so much offended you came to your notice so
soon? Why was it high time toward the latter end of <hi>March,</hi>
and no sooner?</p>
            <p>Sir (to deal plainly with you) not my self onely, but all
who well know you, and are best able to judge of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are men of sound judgement, not swayed by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
or passion, (to whom I have imparted the substance and
circumstance of Mr. <hi>Day</hi> his offer, and your demand by letter,
for their opinion on them both) unanimously conceive, and
confidently say, that your <hi>Now and high time,</hi> point (like the
finger of a Dial) to the high affronts of publick authority, by
the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> at <hi>Salisbury-Assizies,</hi> and their high hopes of a
general Insurrection of the people at home, and the Invasion
of great forces from Princes abroad; whereof if I should say,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64415:4"/>
it is very probable you were not ignorant (before the Plot
brake out into open Rebellion) I could render reasons, which
(by judicious men) will not be thought either feigned or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,
and it will not be your wisdome to urge me to prove
the presumption against you. And though you may haply say
(that which you do not think) it is but my uncharitable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit
of you: I can truly testifie that a man of worth and
note (in both Counties where you and I live) told me, you
were under such suspicion of disloyalty to the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that you were to have been secured, if some ill news
(which at that time made the greatest noise) had proved true.</p>
            <p>But that the time of plotting, acting, and giving out
hopeful expectations, of happy success to the destructive designe
of your discontented party (against the Lord Protector) and
all those who (in conscience as well as in affection were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with him in the same common cause) was the time
when you were animated to resume your project upon me by
Mr. <hi>D.</hi> his mediation, of whom I have no minde to say any
more then his relation to you extorteth from me, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon that to send me the letter, to which I now addresse an
answer, may thus appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpon Monday morning the</hi> 12th. <hi>of March,</hi> Sir <hi>Ioseph
Wagstaffe</hi> Collonel <hi>Penruddock, &amp;c.</hi> seised on the Judges
at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> took away their Commission, and carryed the
High Sheriffe prisoner with them to <hi>Blanford.</hi> By the way (Sir)
I do not write this as a parcell of news to you, for I will not
take upon me to be your intelligencer, for such matters as you
may know by prophecy, and I but by History, or hearsay: I
only touch that here as a Chronologicall note of conformity
betwixt their high attempts and your high demands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpon Tuesday morning the</hi> 13th. <hi>of March,</hi> came Mr. <hi>D.</hi>
to me, with another Gentleman, whom I forbear to name, I
supposed them (as soon as I saw them) sent by you (for no
good to me) and therefore I told them, I would not speak
with them both together, but apart. So the other Gentleman
withd rawing, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> stayed and told me he came to offer me
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64415:5"/>
300 <hi>li.</hi> a year for the Rectory of <hi>Brightwell;</hi> and on Friday
morning <hi>March</hi> the 16th. he sent me a letter (dated the same
day) wherein he offered the same, and named sureties, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of that he offered, both in that writing and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
when (a few dayes before) he came unto me.</p>
            <p>I took time, until the next week, to consider of an answer
to his proposal, being doubtful, whether I had not promised
to some of my chiefe Parishioners (upon his falling from his
own offer the year before) not to let it to any one, but to keep
it in mine own hands: and when such a promise, was remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and claimed by them, I told Mr. <hi>D.</hi> I was not free to accept
of his offer: but if I were, I knew not any man who would bid so
much, and was so well able to make good his word, as he was.</p>
            <p>It seemed very strange to me, that he, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to be Farmer of the Parsonage, the last year, upon easier
termes, yea who would not deale with me for it, upon any
termes (as he wrote to me<note n="â€œ" place="margin">The copie
of this Letter is in the last page of mine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance.</note>
the 9th. of <hi>Iune</hi>) should (about
8 Moneths after) come of his own accord, to bid me more for
it, than ever I asked. He told me, it was because I had taxed
him with breach of promise in Print: But why then did he not
tender his Motion, and tell me his reason till <hi>March</hi> 13. when
that I printed, came to your hands 4 Moneths before, and from
you the notice of it, was brought very neer Mr. <hi>D.</hi> within a
while after: and it is like so intimate a friend as he, should be
informed assoone as any, especially since he was concerned in
it, as well as your self, though not so much; and for the time of
this last offer, I suppose it was rather of your choice, than his,
as the reason of it might be better known to you than to him.
When I had given my negative answer to Mr. <hi>Day,</hi> the next
week after I received your letter of the 29th. of <hi>March,</hi>) in due
order of time both inrespect of the publique proceedings of
your party, &amp; of your own private negotiation, for <hi>Brightwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1 the condition of the Commonwealth, seemed on the
suddaine to be strangely changed, (even to astonishment) in
that so small a number of Cavaliers, at <hi>Salish:</hi> durst raise their
insurrection, to such an height as there they did, when the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64415:5"/>
Assembly of the Judges, High Sheriff, with his armed
attendants, Justicee of the Peace, Grand Jury, &amp;c. were to
cast an awe upon the whole County, then and there for such as
they (so few) to affront and outface that venerable Authority,
and to bear themselves as a triumphant Army, before they had
been a militant troop, was a prodigie of presumption, which
might amaze the people (as it seems it did) into a fear both of
resistance and defence.</p>
            <p>2 It was not probable they durst have been so rampant, but
that (as hath been partly touched before) they had strong hopes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 That other Counties would turn Royallists and rise
with them.</item>
               <item>2 That the Antiroyallists were so divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that enow of them would not unite, to make
head against them.</item>
               <item>3 That Forreign Forces would come into their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</item>
               <item>4 That our wooden walls were so far distant, from our
own Coasts, that they could not stop them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Sutable to such general conjectures, they gave out particular
reports as Col. <hi>Penrudduck</hi> did, encouraging others to embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in that Rebellion, by telling them, that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>
had 8000, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> 4000 (in <hi>London</hi>) ready for the
Kings service, with many more, some more probable, others
but possible, but if impossible, you have a phansie and a faith of
as vast a compass, as your<note n="*" place="margin">Quod val<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e volumus, facile credimus.</note> desires for the Ruine ofâ€”and
for the <hi>Restauration</hi> ofâ€”else you would not have believed
(as you said to some body about six weeks after your party was
routed at <hi>Worcester</hi>) that 40000 <hi>Swedes</hi> were up in arms for
<hi>Charles</hi> the second, and that he was in the head of them.</p>
            <p>But for the late Plot (which is our Theme at present) I
doubt not but you confidently conceived, it would proceed so
prosperously, that your hopes and my fears would grow apace,
up to their <hi>Achme,</hi> and that the face of publike affairs, (like a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64415:6"/>
picture on a furrowed table) would so frown upon me, while it
smiled upon you, that I would be afraid to make any long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad
at <hi>Brightwell,</hi> and so would soone run away and make
you room, and opportunity for you thither, and then it would
be no matter how much was bidden for the Parsonage, nor
what bonds were given, for I durst not stay to claim the one,
nor must be allowed (in case of forfeiture) to sue for the other.
In your prevailing this way (but God forbid you should do so)
I could not but account all my temporall livelyhood (if not
my life) as utterly lost, and so not only one fifth part of the P.
of <hi>Br.</hi> but all five would be yours again. Howsoever (Sir) if
that (which was your chiefe end) were not attained Mr. <hi>D.</hi> his
offer then (which at another time would have been too much)
might serve you for a fair colour to exact the fifths (with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour)
according to his rate, and this was a secondary end
you aimed at, if you were disappointed of the principall which
you discovered by your letter, so soon as seasonably you
could, that is, the next week after I had given my negative an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to Mr. <hi>Day:</hi> For then you wrote and sent your letter of
demand for fifths, according to the proportion of his promise.
All this sorts well with your <hi>high time</hi> in that notion which
symbolizeth with the designe and doings of Sir <hi>Io. Wag.</hi> at
<hi>Salisbury.</hi> Your next words are screwed up to an unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
height, by the like contemporary influence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>Dr. H. It is high time (say you) to send this letter to
demand what remains still due upon your account for the year
1653, as also for some reckonings of the years before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> If you had not been too high in your hopes of
more then your right, in a way of violence, you would not
have made a demand so contrary to all reason and conscience,
as to require an account of me for arrears of the year 1653,
and for the years precedent to that, when you do or should
remember that for those years even to the year beginning,
<hi>Aprill</hi> 11, 1653, and ending <hi>Aprill</hi> 11, 1654, I have made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64415:6"/>
an account unto you (and that so exactly as if I had been to
passe it upon my Oath) and have received acquittances from
you under your own hand, in full discharge of each whole
year severally, which (if you deny) I can produce to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you of untruth. By this unjust demand you manifestly
shew, that if your party had been predominant, and I forced to
sodain flight from my present habitation, you might, and meant,
to make my Books and other goods (which I could not carry
with me) lyable to any demand or charge you would please to
put upon them in my name.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>But for this year 1654, I know the proportion I
have reason to expect, <hi>viz.</hi> after 300 li. <hi>per annum.</hi> for so
much you may have for the living by Mr. <hi>Day,</hi> and such
security as you can not but approve.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> If I confessed a right of fifths, due to you or yours,
I should not be unwilling to pay them in a due proportion; but
you know Sir, I resolutely deny it, and have rendred reasons
of my deniall, whereof you seem to take no notice, because you
have no minde to meddle with them, if you have, and please
to make an answer to them, and I cannot confute it, I will
either fairly part with <hi>Br.</hi> or freely pay a fifth part to you,
according as the profits of it come into me, but not after the
proportion of 300 <hi>li. per annum.</hi> Because,</p>
            <p>First, this is more (by above a fourth part) then (<hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
annis &amp; computatis computandis</hi>) I can make of it,
whereof in a letter to an eminent person (whom you know)
I have shewed such reasons, as any intelligent and indifferent
Judge will acknowledge both for just and weighty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though you and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> or you by Mr. <hi>D,</hi> raise
the rate of the Parsonage, the new Farmers bring it down,
abating no lesse then 4 <hi>li.</hi> of 14 <hi>li.</hi> a year, for the Tithes and
other rights of the Parson, not taken in kinde of the Farm of
<hi>Brightwell:</hi> for which abatement they plead by such reasons,
as I and my friend (who in such matters hath ten times more
knowledge then my selfe) cannot readily answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64415:7"/>
3 Mr. <hi>D.</hi> his offer was but the acting of your device upon
me, as I have already shewed, wherein he gave evidence of his
good will to you, as you did of your love to your self, and of
your ill minde towards me, and if he had bin taken at his word
and made to keep it, he might well have accounted you his dear
friend, for he must needs have lost a great deal, for your
sake, had he been as punctual in his performance; (whether
with or against his will) as he was prodigall in his promise.
But you thought it more likely that I should lose all, than he
any thing, by his undertaking, and I think it was no more your
meaning, really to ingage so good a friend, than it was his to
be so far ingaged, to his prejudice, but to entitle your self to a
demand, and to entangle me to the payment of a fourth part in
stead of a fift.</p>
            <p>Having followed you thus far, I will not leave you, until you
come to your final period, and now you draw neer unto it, in
your next words, which are,</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Therefore having performed my part of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I expect yours.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I shall answer you here with a question or two,
What agreement Sir, do you mean? and when was it made?
If you mean that of the 19th. of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Reading,</hi> or that
of <hi>Iune</hi> the 13th. at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> you have an answer to them
both in the three last pages of the Book I sent you: if any of
later date, say what it was, when and where it was made, and
you shall have mine assent unto it in word and deed, or just
reasons of my refusall of it.</p>
            <p>You conclude with some good counsell to me, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of two particulars. First,</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Follow that Rule of Do as you would be done by.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> That Rule (I grant) is a most righteous Rule,
given by our blessed Saviour himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. and a most
just standard, (if rightly understood) whereby we must mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our mindes and dealings towards others (I say) if rightly
understood, that is, when the understanding is truly informed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64415:7"/>
and the will and desire rightly, ordered, otherwise, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it to practise may prove unjust and absurd.</p>
            <p>1. Unjust, as when a Judge on the Bench will not passe
sentence upon a Malefactor at the Bar, because he loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too well, to be content to be condemned, or when a man hath
a faulty friend, who deserveth to be punished, and he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
for favour for him, to free him from the stroke of Justice,
as <hi>Agesilaus</hi> did, (when as<note n="â€œ" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his precepts of policie, p. 300. of his Morals.</note> 
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth) he wrote
to a great Lord or Potentate for one <hi>Nicias</hi> in this manner.
<hi>If he have not transgressed deliver him for justice sake: If
he have, deliver him for my sake: but howsoever deliver
him.</hi> So, no doubt, he would have been dealt withall himself
(had he been in the offenders case) but so it was not lawfull
for him to do by another.</p>
            <p>2. Absurd, as thus, A Master (as our great Master Christ
Jesus maketh the comparison) when his servant commeth from
the field, will say unto him, <hi>Make ready wherewith I may
sup, and gird thy selfe, and serve me till I have eaten and
drunken, afterward thou shalt eat and drinke: Luke</hi> 17. 7, 8.
because he would have his servant so obsequious unto him,
were it not very absurd if he should receive the like command
from his servant, and submit unto it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, to take and apply the Rule as you would have me,
the meaning of it, according to your minde will be this:</hi>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Doe as you would be done by (that is) Pay the fifths of the
Rectory of <hi>Brithwell,</hi> to Dr. <hi>H.</hi> for the use of his wife and
children, and pay them freely and fully, as you would have
him do to you, were you in his case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will answer you not in your way of protestation (1) <hi>in
verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> but on the faith of an Evangelicall Minister,
and (if you could see into mine heart) you should not see there
a syllable or a letter contrary to what I now professe (as in the
presence of the Omniscient God) <hi>viz.</hi> that knowing what
I do of your state and mine own, and of both our relations to
<hi>Brightwell,</hi> I durst not (out of conscience) require at fifth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64415:8"/>
part of the Parsonage of you, and out of ingenuous civility
(if I had not a nobler principle of operation in me then that)
I would scorne to presse you with such undue demands as
you do me, and to put you to the triall of the rule you bring
to me; would you, were your condition such (as I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
set down mine <hi>Ã  pag. 16. ad</hi> 22. of my printed Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance)
be content to pay a fifth part (as you would have
it) to any one who needeth it no more then you do? you
know you would not, <hi>Do then</hi> but <hi>as you would be done by:</hi>
And you would do as I do, if you had no higher thoughts of
the Parsonage of <hi>Br.</hi> then I have. For though you very much
advance the value of the Benefice (as you call it) the Pastorall
charge as I finde it, is so little beneficiall to me, all receits and
disbursments rightly calculated, that weighing the benefit and
burthen in all kindes together, I had just cause to write thus
to Mr. Vicechancellor of <hi>Oxon.</hi> November 22. 1654.</p>
            <p>I will say thus much, and will make my word good; by
my deed, if I be put to the triall, that I am so far short of
competent contentment, in that condition wherein I am at
<hi>Br.</hi> (chiefly through what I have suffered by you, and your
most and worst affected followers, that I shall be very willing
to do service to any good people elsewhere (though with a
great deal lesse wages then I am thought to have here, but
have not) if I may have a fair call to another place, and
a conscionable discharge from this where I am.</p>
            <p>And (which may be more to your satisfaction, if you want
not faith to believe the truth) I have made offer of all mine
interest in <hi>Brightwell</hi> (without any capitulation at all) to a
man of as excellent parts, and as potent friends as any I
know, who (if he accept it) will easily acquit himselfe from
your unrighteous and unreasonable exaction.</p>
            <p>Howsoever, Sir, I had rather (according to the conditions
promised) resolve to leave <hi>Brightwell,</hi> then still to worke
under such a rigorous Taske-master as I have found and felt
you for four years together,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64415:8"/>
The other part of your counsell to me (wherewith you close
up your Letter) is:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Not to give any occasion of breach, or quarrell
to him, who desireth to expresse himselfe:</p>

                     <signed>Your affectionate Friend to serve you.

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>If a breach and quarrel be not yet made by your unjust
demand, and my just deniall of fifths, with reasons for it,
in print, I shall not give you any greater occasion of it then I
have done, for (for that <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>tter) I shall but deny to pay them
still, and that upon the same grounds. But if a breach and
quarrel be made already, (and I believe you take it so) your
counsell commeth too late, and you should rather have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
some means to make up the breach, to take up the quarrel:
you would seeme to be peaceably disposed. when you professe
a desire to expresse your selfe mine affectionate friend to serve
me. But <hi>how feeble is your affection</hi> if it be true? for it is but
a desire, a desire but to expresse (that is so to shew, and declare
your selfe, that you may appear such a friend) <hi>how false your

otherwise, when you pretend love, and intend Law: For
having heretofore used to send to me by your friends, Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Wh.</hi> you sent me this last Letter by a professed Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer;
as though thereby you meant to tell me, that if I will
not be lead by your Letter to do what you would have me,
you would compell me by Law to conformity to it; and for
that Sir, you may take your course, and when you take up

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOV have (since I wrote this Letter) turned my
suspicion of your professed friendship, into undoubted
assurance of your dissembling with me: By sending
a Bailiffe on Saturday, (<hi>May</hi> 12.) to attach me, or
to take Bond for my appearance, on Monday <hi>May</hi> 14. in the
Court of Common Pleas, Which sodain warning was not by
his choice but yours, as the date of your Letter of direction
to him (for serving the Sheriffes Warrant upon <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>) sheweth.
Hereby he that hath but halfe an eye may see, you meant
(not like a good Minister) to disturbe my preparations for the
Sabbath, and (as unlike a good Christian) to distresse me by
want of time to take Counsell, how to apply my selfe for my
just defence in the Suit commenced by you. I would not, I
did not, serve you so, when I sent you my Book against you
(by a Messenger of purpose) the next day after Ireceived it
from <hi>London,</hi> that you might have as timely intelligence of
the publishing of it as I could give you. Howsoever, Sir, you
may perceive my readiness to perform my promise to you, (which
was <hi>To serve you at the bar of any Court of Justice or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when you serve me with Processe to attend you there)</hi> for
<hi>that day (viz.</hi> Monday forementioned, though your sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were so short) I came to <hi>Westminster</hi> where you had
put (into the Court) no Declaration against me. So forward
were you to shew your teeth, before you could bite; which may
give occasion of caution, and (that may be also) some cause of
security to him who sincerely subscribing to the Christian sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of<note n="â€œ" place="margin">Amicos deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere omnium est inimicos so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum <hi>Tertul. ad Scapul. Tom. 2. p. 162. item.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> had rather (notwithstanding your harsh
and hasty dealing with him) entitle himselfe your Respondent,<note place="margin">Christianus nullius cst ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
