            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

By <hi>IOHN FLAVELL,</hi> Preacher of the Gospel in <hi>DARTMOUTH.</hi>

            <p>And because the Answers therein are some of them pretty large, and Treat of the most profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our Religion; therefore several Persons have bestowed their good and laudable Pains, some in descanting more largely, and proving by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reasons the Particulars: and one has shewn the harmony thereof with the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (designed, I suppose, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the prejudice which some have taken against it). Others have parted the Questions and Answers into several little ones, under each, to make them more intelligible to younger ones, and more easy to be remembred.</p>
            <p>Among whom, Worthy, Orthodox, and Excellent Mr. <hi>Iohn Flavell</hi> may be ranked, who among other of his many and most profitable Labours, applied himself to the chewing of this Bread of Life, or crumbling it into smaller pieces, for the Cenveniency of Children and (indeed) of all; wherein (as in all his other Works) he hath shewn himself a Workman that needs not to be ashamed.</p>
            <p>There needs no other recommendations to this <hi>Posthumus</hi> Piece, but the worthy Author's Name; he was removed before he had compleatly finished it; he had prepared his Questions and Answers upon the second Petition of the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi>; but lived not to propose them in the publick Congregation. God then translated him into his Kingdom of Glory above, while he was so industriously endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Kingdom of Grace below.</p>
            <p>The other five remaining Questions and Answers (to compleat the Work) were done by a ruder hand; as may easily be discerned by any observant Reader, who will find himself transfer'd from a
<pb facs="tcp:41733:2"/>
plain, clear, and delightful Stile, method, and manner, into more rough, disorderly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant ones; for who, indeed, could equal this Divine Labourer? Not the Compleater: who would account himself to have made very great Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Divinity and Usefulness, if he were left but a few furlongs behind him.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader use and peruse this Piece, and he will see cause to bless God for the Author.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Divine Providence having unexpectedly cast my Lot for a few Days in <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> where that blessed man of God Mr. <hi>John Flavell</hi> did for many years honour Christ, and was honoured by him; I have been favoured with a sight of that most judicious Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> which is emitted herewith.</p>
            <p>Being desired to testify my Respect to the worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, by Prefacing this Excellent Labour of his with a few Lines; I can truly say (as sometimes <hi>Beza</hi> of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>) <hi>Now Mr.</hi> Flavell <hi>is dead, Life will be less sweet, and Death less bitter to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My heart bleeds to look on this desolate Place, and not to see him, that whilst living, was the glory of it.</p>
            <p>But neither the Author, nor his Writings stand in need of the commendation of others, much less of mine.</p>
            <p>His Works already published have made his Name precious in both <hi>Englands,</hi> and it will be so as long as the Earth shall endure.</p>
            <p>There are some considerations which may cause the <hi>Reader</hi> to expect (and he will not find himself disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therein) that which is extraordinary in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Manuel</hi>: for the <hi>Author</hi>'s Heart was very much engaged in doing this Service for Christ, in thus feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lambs. And he did himself design the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is here committed to the Press; and was very desirous (with an holy submission to the Will of God) to have perfected this Work before his Decease; but had strange intimations that he should finish his Course, before that could be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41733:3"/>When he did <hi>viva voce</hi> deliver his Meditations, there were many Enlargements, and lively Passages which are not here inserted: nevertheless here is as much as he thought needful for publick view, not being willing that his Book should be Voluminous.</p>
            <p>In his last Catechetical Exercise concerning <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name of God,</hi> he was exceedingly enlarged; but he must himself go into the Kingdom of Glory, when he intended to have discoursed on that Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He also began some Meditations on <hi>the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>: But before he had an opportunity to express what had been in his Heart, the Lord Iesus said unto him, <hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> And thus doth it happen many times to the eminent and holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God.</p>
            <p>Another Consideration, recommending what comes herewith, is, that it was amongst Mr. <hi>Flavell</hi>'s last Works. The (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Last Sayings of wise and great Men have been esteemed Oraculous; and the Scripture puts an Emphasis on <hi>the last Words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the sweet singer of <hi>Israel, 2 Sam. 23.1.</hi> Not that those were the last words that ever <hi>David</hi> spake, only they were written not long before his Death, when he was come near Heaven.</p>
            <p>So was what is now put into the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Hand, written by Mr. <hi>Flavell</hi> not long before his translation to the World of Souls, where the Spirits of Iust men are made perfect.</p>
            <p>There was a more than ordinary presence of God with him to his last; and in his last Days, not the last <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that he preached (which was <hi>June 21. 1691.</hi>) He did more than once surprize his Hearers with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that, that might be the last time he should
<pb facs="tcp:41733:4"/>
speak to them in the Name of the Lord. And was not then the Secret of the Lord with him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dartmouth</hi> will know, and <hi>Devonshire</hi> will know, that there has been a Prophet among them.</p>
            <p>And now my Soul bleeds to Look on the dear Flock of God, which are as Sheep without a Shepherd. The Lord Iesus, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, bave compassion on them, and give them a Shepherd like to his blessed Servant <hi>Flavell,</hi> who did for many years feed them with Knowledge, and with Understanding.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Man's Chief End is to glorify God, and to enjoy him for ever.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>A. <hi>It was prudently, soberly, and mercifully, to govern, use, and dispose of other Creatures in the Earth, Sea, and Air, over which God gave man the Dominion;</hi> Gen. <hi>1.26.</hi> And God said, Let us make man in our Image, after our likeness: and let them have domonion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattel, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. <hi>So Psal. 8.6.</hi> Thou madest him to have dominion over the work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What then is to be thought of those men, who being wholly intent upon inferior things, forget and neglect their principal End?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are dead whilst they live, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>5.6.</hi> But she that liveth in pleasure, is dead whilst she liveth. <hi>They have their Portion in this Life,</hi> Psal. <hi>17.14.</hi> From men of the world which have their Portion in this Life, <hi>and their end is destruction;</hi> Phil. <hi>3.19.</hi> Whose end is destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> How can man glorifie God, seeing he is perfectly glorious in himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41733:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>A. <hi>Man cannot glorifie God by adding any new degree of glory to him.</hi> Iob. <hi>35.7.</hi> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? <hi>but by manifesting his glory with the Lips;</hi> Psal. <hi>50.23.</hi> Whoso offereth praise, glorifieth me; <hi>or with the life,</hi> Mat. <hi>5.16.</hi> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Wherein consists the enjoyment of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists,</hi> first, <hi>In the facial vision of him in Heaven.</hi> Secondly, <hi>In full conformity to him. 1</hi> Ioh. <hi>3.2.</hi> But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Thirdly, <hi>In that full satisfaction which results from both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Psal. <hi>17.15.</hi> I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 5.</hi> Can none enjoy him in Heaven, who do not glorifie him on Earth?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No adult person can Scripturally expect happiness in Heaven, without holiness on Earth.</hi> Heb. <hi>12.14.</hi> And holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. <hi>Rom. 8.30.</hi> Whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> How comes the glory and enjoyment of God our Chief End?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He is our Master, and rightful Owner, and Benefactor; we receive our Being and Preservation from him</hi>; Of him, and through him, and therefore to him be all Things; <hi>Rom. 11.36.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Do all men make God their chief End?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, they do not; some make their sensual Pleasure their chief End.</hi> Phil. <hi>3.19.</hi> Whose God is their Belly; <hi>and some the World,</hi> Col. <hi>3.5.</hi> Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the Earth, and Covetousness, which is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What are the Signs of a man's making himself his chief End?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Those make themselves their chief End, who ascribe the glory of what they have, or do, to themselves, and not to God,</hi> Dan. <hi>4.30.</hi> The King spake and said, Is not this great Babylon which I have built? <hi>Isa. 10.18.</hi> For he saith, By the strength of my hand have I done it; and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; therefore they sacrifice to their own net, and burn Incense unto their Drag. <hi>Hab. 1.16.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Why are the glorifying and enjoying of God put together, as making up our chief End?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because no man can glorifie God, that takes him not for his God; and none takes him for his God, that takes him not for his Supream Good; and both these being essentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41733:5"/>
in this Notion of the chief End, are therefore justly put together.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the first Truth inferr'd from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God hath dignified Man above all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on Earth, in giving him a capacity of glorifying God here, and of enjoying him hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the second truth inferr'd hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the Soul of man is not annihilated by Death, but advanced by it.</hi> Phil. <hi>1.21.</hi> To die is gain. V. <hi>23.</hi> Having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the third truth inferr'd hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is the duty and wisdom of every Christian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, deny, and forsake all inferior Interests and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they come in competition with the glory of God, and our enjoyment of him.</hi> Luke <hi>14.33.</hi> So likewise whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Disciple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What is the fourth Inferrence hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we are to abhor and renounce all those Doctrines and Practices that debase the glory of God, and exalt and magnifie the Creature.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are truly and properly called the Word of God, because they came not by the Will of Man, but holy Men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>What are the principal Arguments to persuade us that the Scriptures are of Divine Authority, and Inspiration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three things especially convince us. <hi>First</hi> The Holiness of the Doctrine therein contained. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The awful effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41733:6"/>
thereof on the Soul. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The uncontroulable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by which they are sealed, put it beyond all rational doubt, that they are the very Word of God.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>What is the Holiness of the Scriptures? and how doth that prove them to be God's Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Holiness of the Scriptures doth appear in two things. <hi>First,</hi> In commanding and encouraging whatsoever is pure, and holy; <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Whatsoever things are pure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> In forbidding all unholiness, under pain of Damnation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. This shews that they came not from Satan, being cross to his design; nor from men, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his corrupt nature; and therefore from God only.</p>
               <p>Q. 4. <hi>What is their Authority and Efficacy on the Soul? and how doth that prove them Divine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Their Authority and Efficacy on the Soul, consists in three Things: <hi>First,</hi> In the power they have to search and discover the secrets of men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, of the Ioynts and Marrow; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Secondly,</hi> In their converting Efficacy, changing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Soul. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Soul. Thirdly,</hi> In their chearing and restoring Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, when the Soul is cast down under any inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing the Heart.</hi> No humane Power can do such things as these. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17 17. <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>How do Miracles confirm it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because all proper Miracles are wrought only by the hand of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>And no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him</hi>; and so are his seal to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he affixes them, and it consists not with his truth and holiness to set it to a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. 6. <hi>VVhat was the end of writing the word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the Church to the end of the world might have a sure, known, standing Rule to try and judge all things by, and not to be left to the uncertainty of Traditions: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testify of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 7. <hi>Doth not the Authority of the Scriptures depend on the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fathers and Councils?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41733:6"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, the Scriptures are not built on the Authority of the Church, but the Church on them. <hi>Ephes</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>And are built on the Foundations of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Stone.</hi> And for Councils and Fathers, the Scriptures are not to be tried by them; but they by the Scriptures. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law, and to the Testimony; if they speak not according to this word, 'tis because there is no light in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 8. <hi>VVhat may be fairly inferr'd from this Proposition, That the Scriptures are the word of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three things may be thence inferr'd, <hi>First,</hi> The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures, which being the only rule given by God, must therefore be perfect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is the right of common People to read them. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> Acts 17.11. <hi>These were more noble than those of</hi> Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica, <hi>in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and search the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That we owe no obedience to the Injunctions of men, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they are sufficiently warranted by the written Word. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>But in vain do they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> VVhy is Faith conjoyned with Obedience, and put before it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because Faith is the principle from whence all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence flows, and no man can perform any duty aright in the estate of unbelief.</hi> Heb. <hi>11.6.</hi> But without Faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Can there be no saving Faith where the Scriptures are not known and preached?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; for the Apostle saith,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.14.</hi> How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent? <hi>And v. 17.</hi> So then, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the VVord of God.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>No, if the things they teach be not contained expresly, or by necessary consequence in the Word of God, we are not obliged to believe them as points of Faith.</hi> Isa. <hi>8.20.</hi> To the Law, and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them. <hi>Gal. 1.8.</hi> Though we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <hi>And Christ hath charged us,</hi> Mat. <hi>23.10.</hi> To call no man Master, for one is your Master, even Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Are there some things in Scripture more excellent than others; Because it's said, the Scriptures principally teach matters of Faith and Duty?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Every part of Scripture is alike pure;</hi> Prov. <hi>30.5.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word of God is pure, <hi>and of equal authority, but not of equal weight; as several pieces of Gold are alike pure, and of the same stamp, but not of equal value.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What may be inferred hence for Use?</p>
               <p>A. First, <hi>Hence 'tis our duty to examine what we hear, by the Word; and not receive any Doctrine, because men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm it, but because the Scriptures require it.</hi> Acts <hi>17.11.</hi> These were more noble than those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.

Secondly,</hi> By way of Negation, when we remove from God in our Conceptions all that is imperfect in the Creature: so we say God is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, Infinite, Immutable; and in this sense we also call him a Spirit, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he is not a gross corporeal Substance.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>How many sorts of Spirits are there? And of which sort is God?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are to understand them as Expressions of God, in condescention to the weakness of our understandings; even as the Glory of Heaven is exprest to us in Scripture by a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Royal Feast.

                  <hi>First,</hi> In respect of the perfection of his Nature; his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power, and Holiness, exceed all measures and limits; as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>There is none holy as the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In respect of time and place; no time can measure him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus saith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity,</hi> 1 Kings 8.27. <hi>Behold the Heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this House which I have built?</hi> The Heaven of heavens contains all created Beings; but not the Creator. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In respect of his Incomprehensibleness, by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all creatures. <hi>Iob.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q 3. <hi>If God be thus Infinite, and no understanding can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, How then is it said in</hi> 1 John 3.2. VVe shall see him as he is?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41733:8"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is not, that glorified Saints shall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God in their understandings; but that they shall have a true apprehensive Knowledge, though not a comprehensive Knowledge of God: and that we shall see him immediately, and not as we do now thorow a glass darkly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. <hi>What is the first Lesson to be learnt from God's Infinity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That therefore men should tremble to sin even in secret. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.11. <hi>If I say, surely the darkness shall cover me, even the Night shall be light about me.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The second Instruction is, That there is an infinite evil in sin, objectively consider'd, as it is committed against an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God; and therefore it deserves Eternal Punishment; and no satisfaction can possibly be made for it, but by the Blood of Christ. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold — but with the precious Blood of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The third Instruction is, That those who are reconciled to God in Christ, need not fear his ability to perform any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for them; for he is able to <hi>do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, Ephes.</hi> 3.20, And those that are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, are in a very miserable condition, having infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er set on work to punish them. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 7. <hi>What is the fourth, Instruction from God's Infinity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That no place can bar the access of gracious Souls to God. They are as near him in a Dungeon, as when at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that he knows their thoughts, when their tongues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It differs in two respects; <hi>First,</hi> In this, That tho An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Souls of men shall have no end; yet they had a

beginning, which God had not. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Eternity is by gift from God, or by his appointment; but his Eternity is necessary, and from his own Nature.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Covenant is called an Everlasting Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. because the mercies of it, conveyed to believers, as pardon, peace, and salvation, are mercies that shall have no end.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Gospel is called the Everlasting Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. because the effects thereof upon the Souls it sanctifies, will abide in them for ever.</p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>In what sense is the Redemption of Christ called the Eternal Redemption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Redemption of Christ is called Eternal Redemption in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. because those whom he redeems by his Blood, shall never more come into condemnation. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. <hi>He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The last Judgment is called Eternal Judgment, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God judged men from Eternity, or because the Day of Judgment shall last to Eternity; but because the consequences of it will be Everlasting Joy or Misery to the Souls of Men; therefore it's called <hi>eternal judgment,</hi> Heb. 6.2.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hence wicked men may see their own misery in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it; that they will have an eternal Enemy to avenge himself upon them for ever, in the world to come. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.9. <hi>VVho shall be punished with everlasting destruction, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Whence doth God's Immutability flow?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Immutability of God flows from the perfection of his Nature, to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken away. If any thing could be added to make him better than he is; or if any thing could be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to make him less good than he is, then he were not the chiefest Good, and consequently not God.</p>
               <p>Q 3. <hi>By what other Argument prove you his Immutability?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I prove it from the Eternity of God. If God be eternal, he must be immutable; for if he change by addition of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him he had not before, then there is something in God which he had not from Eternity: And if he change by diminution, then there was something in God from Eternity, which now is not; but from <hi>everlasting to everlasting,</hi> he is the same God, and therefore changeth not.</p>
               <p>Q. 4. <hi>Bus it is said, God repents, and Repentance is a change; How then is he unchangeable, and yet repents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In those Phrases God speaks to us, as we must speak of, and to him; not properly, but after the manner of men; and it only notes a change in his outward providence, not in his nature.</p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>But how could God become man, and yet no change made on him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is a twofold change, one active, made by God, that we allow. He made a change upon our nature by uniting it to Christ; but a passive change made upon God, we deny. The nature of man was made more excellent; but the Divine Nature was still the same.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Q. 7. <hi>VVhat is the second Instruction from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the happiness of God's people is firm, and sure, being still upon the word of an unchangeable God. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not consumed.</hi> Heb. 6.18.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. <hi>VVhat is the third Instruction from this Attribute?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the hopes of all wicked men are vain, being built upon a presumption, that God will not deal with them as he hath threatned he will do.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That Christians may take as much encouragement now from the nature, word, and providence of God, as the Saints in any former Generation did, or might do; for he is the same now, he was then.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>It is an Essential Property of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he is absolutely and perfectly good in himself, and the Fountain of all communicated Goodness to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Psalm <hi>119.68.</hi> Thou art good, and dost good, teach me thy Statutes.</p>

                  <hi>Q 2.</hi> How doth the Goodness of God differ from the Mercy of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It differs in its Objects; for Misery is the Object of Mercy; but Goodness extends to the Creatures that are happy, as well as miserable; as the Angels,</hi> Psal. <hi>145.9.</hi> The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
               <p>

               <p>A. <hi>That all his other Attributes flow out of it as their Fountain: The other Acts of God are but the Effluxes of his Goodness.</hi> Exod. <hi>33.19.</hi> And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto whom I will shew mercy. <hi>Exod. 34.6.</hi> And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed The Lord, the Lord God. merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.</p>

                  <hi>Q 4</hi> What is the Second Property of the Divine Goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is supream, and perfect in it self, so as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of no Creature is, or can be.</hi> Luke <hi>18.19.</hi> None is good save one, and that is God: <hi>And consequently above all additions from the Creature.</hi> Psalm <hi>16.2.</hi> O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord— my goodness extendeth not unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What is the Third Property of God's Goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is communicative with pleasure and delight to the Creature: No Mother draws out her Breast to an hungry Child with more pleasure than God doth his Goodness to the Saints.</hi> Psalm <hi>145.9.</hi> The Lord is good to all, and his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> In what Acts hath God first manifested his Goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He hath manifested it in the creation and government of the World.</hi> Psalm <hi>104.24.</hi> O Lord, how manifold are thy works? in wisdom hast thou made them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 7.</hi> What was the principal Work in which God hath manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his Goodness to men?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41733:13"/>A. <hi>The principal manifestation of God's Goodness, was in the Work of Redemption by Christ.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.8.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. <hi>1 John 4.8, 9.</hi> In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten son into the world, that we might live through him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> But are not the Iudgments of God on the wicked, and his Afflictions on the Saints, impeachments of his goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, It is the property of Goodness to hate and punish Evil in the impenitent.</hi> Exod <hi>34.7.</hi> Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty, <hi>&amp;c. And the Afflictions of the Saints flow from his Goodness, and end in their true and eternal good. Heb 12.6.</hi> For whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. <hi>Psalm 119.71.</hi> It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Stàtutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What may we infer from the Goodness of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The first thing is, that Sin hath made our Natures base, and disingenuous, in that we take no notice of his Goodness.</hi> Isa. <hi>1.3.</hi> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his masters crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider; <hi>And answer not the design of it. Rom. 2.4.</hi> Not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the Second Inference from the Goodness of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That therefore God is the fittest Object of our delight, and love, and of our trust and confidence (1.) Of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Love.</hi> Psalm. <hi>116.1.</hi> I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice, and my supplication. <hi>(2.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the Third Inference from God's Goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Christians should imitate God in his Goodness, in charity to our Enemies.</hi> Matt. <hi>5.44, 45.</hi> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you, that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the Last Inference from God's Goodness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Christians have great encouragement to go to God for pardon in case of sin.</hi> Psalm <hi>130.4.</hi> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared; <hi>and for refuge of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> Nahum <hi>1.7.</hi> The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; he knoweth them that trust in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why is he called the true God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To distinguish him from the Idols and false Gods of the Heathens. 1</hi> Thes. <hi>1.9.</hi> How ye turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God. <hi>Acts 14.15.</hi> We preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Why is he called the living God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because all life, natural, spiritual, and eternal, is in him, and from him only.</hi> First, <hi>Natural Life.</hi> Acts <hi>17.28.</hi> For in him we live, and move, and have our being.

               <p>A. <hi>It was made with him, and all his natural Posterity, descending in the ordinary way of Generation from him. Rom. 4.12.</hi> Wherefore as by one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. <hi>v. 14 and 18.</hi> Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come: Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes; for he was made upright.</hi> Eccles. <hi>7.29.</hi> God made

               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>5.</hi> Did this Covenant admit of no repentance, nor accept any short Endeavours?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That God is just in all the punishments and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that came upon Man, yea, Infants, that never sinned after his similitude.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.14.</hi> Nevertheless death reigned from <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s transgression.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A. Our first Parents being left to the freeedom of their own w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <div type="questions">
               <p>Q. <hi>1.</hi> How doth it appear that man is fallen?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By the Scripture History, an account of it in</hi> Gen. <hi>3.6, 7.</hi> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves Aprons, and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden, in the cool of the day, and <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, amongst the trees if the garden. <hi>And the sad experience we all have of it in our own selves.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.12.</hi> Therefore as by one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>2.</hi> How could man fall, since he was made upright?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though he was upright, yet his will was mutable; and by abusing that liberty, he fell.</hi> Eccles. <hi>7.29.</hi> Lo this only have I found, that God hath made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>3.</hi> How did God leave him to abuse the freedom of will?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not by inclining him to abuse it; but by with-holding that further grace which he was no way obliged to continue to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>4.</hi> Did the will of man lose its liberty to good, by the Fall?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it did, and is so wounded, that it cannot without preventing and regenerating grace put forth one spiritual and saving act.</hi> Eph. <hi>2.8, 9, 10.</hi> For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of our selves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast; for we are all his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, created in Christ Iesus unto good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>5.</hi> VVhat was the aggravation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It was aggravated in his being a publick innocent person, so newly placed in a State of Happiness and Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q, 6.</hi> What is the first inference from the Fall?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41733:21"/>A. <hi>That the best Creature left to himself, cannot be long safe; as the Angels, and</hi> Adam. Psal. <hi>49.12.</hi> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not, he is like the beast that perish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is the second Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That since man could not be his own keeper, he can be much less his own Saviour. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.5.</hi> Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is impossible for the covenant of works to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify any one.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.20.</hi> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight. <hi>Rom. 8.3.</hi> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned sin in the flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the last Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>What cause have we to bless God for Christ, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered us when the Fall left us helpless?</hi> Rom. <hi>5.6.</hi> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>

               <hi>Quest. 14. WHAT is Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of the law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="questions">
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What is meant by the Law?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Commands and Rules flowing from God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, whereby his will is manifested, and the Creature bound to obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>2.</hi> Where is this Law written?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is written either in the heart,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.15.</hi> Which shews the work of the law written in their hearts, which we call the law of nature. <hi>Or in the Bible, which we call the written Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What conformity is due to this Law of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>A two fold conformity is due to it.</hi> First, <hi>Internal, in our hearts.</hi> Secondly; <hi>External, in our lives; and the want of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41733:22"/>
either is sin, 1</hi> Ioh. <hi>3.4.</hi> Whosoever committeth sin, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 4.</hi> How doth it appear that the want of internal conformity is sin?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because the Law requires it.</hi> Mark <hi>12.30.</hi> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; for this is the first commandment. <hi>And condemns the want of it,</hi> Rom. <hi>7.7.</hi> What shall we say then? is the law sin? God forbid; nay, I had not known sin but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 5.</hi> Is nothing a sin but what is against God's Law?</p>
               <p>A <hi>No, nothing can be a sin but what God hath either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, or by consequence forbidden in his word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 6</hi> Wherein lies the evil of transgressing God's Laws?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The evil of sin principally lies in offence and wrong done to God, whose soveraignty it labours to shake off, and despises his will.</hi> Psal. <hi>31.4.</hi> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> VVhat further evil is in sin?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It highly wrongs the Sinner's Soul, by defacing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing, and damning it.</hi> Prov. <hi>8.36.</hi> But he that sinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me, love death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> VVherein is the evil of sin manifested?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It's manifested in the death of Christ, the terrors of Conscience, and torments of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> VVhat course must the Sinner take to recover himself out of his misery?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Repentance towards God, faith towards Christ; and both evidenced by new obedienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> VVhat may we infer from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we have infinite cause to bless God for Christ's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Law for our Sins.</hi>

               <p>A. First, <hi>For the discovery of his dominion over man.</hi> Secondly, <hi>For the trial of his subjection and obedience.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>For the aggravation of his sin, if he should eat.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>3.</hi> VVhat evil was there in eating of it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There was a twofold Evil, the evil of Sin, and the evil of Punishment, both very great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>4.</hi> What was the Evil of Sin?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>A threefold Evil of Sin.</hi> First, <hi>Against God, called disobedience.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.19.</hi> For as by one man's disobedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made sinners.

               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the admirable love of Christ in taking our nature, with all the sinless Infirmities thereof.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.3.</hi> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>The necessity of our Union with Christ, in order to our participation of his Righteousness and Redemption. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.22.</hi> For as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>We are guilty of it, because</hi> Adam <hi>sinned not only as a single, but also as a publick Person, and representative of all Mankind.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.15, 16, 17.</hi> But not as the offence; so also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>A. <hi>It consists in two things.</hi> First, <hi>In our aversation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that which is good.</hi> Rom. <hi>7.18.</hi> In me, that is, in my flesh, there dwelleth no good thing.

               <p>A. <hi>It abides in the whole man, in every part of man, both Soul and Body.</hi> Gen. <hi>6.5.</hi> God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. <hi>1 Thes. 5.23.</hi> Now the God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes: God hath chosen some to salvation, and passed by others; as the Scriptures speak.

               <p>A. <hi>They differ many ways; but principally in three things.</hi> First, <hi>The Covenant of works had no Mediator; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace hath a Mediator.</hi> Heb. <hi>12.24</hi> And to Iesus the Mediator of the new Covenant.

               <p>A. <hi>A twofold misery,</hi> vis. <hi>Sin and Hell.</hi> First, <hi>Sin.</hi> Mat. <hi>1.21.</hi> Thou shalt call his name Iesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Secondly, <hi>Hell. 1</hi> Thes. <hi>1.10.</hi> Even Iesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> When was the Redemption wrought by Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It was decreed from Eternity; it was actually wrought on the Cross.</hi> Col. <hi>1.20.</hi> And having made peace through the blood of his cross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by him to reconcile all things unto him self, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How then could they be redeemed that died before?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though Christ's Blood was actually shed after the Old-Testament believers died; yet the virtue of Christ's Death extends to them, as well as us.</hi> Heb. <hi>11.39, 40.</hi> And these all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us should not be made perfect.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A. Christ the Son of God became man, by taking to himself a true Body, and a reasonable Soul, being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Uirgin Mary, and born of her, yet without Sin.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ is their only Redeemer, and there is no other Redeemer besides him.</hi> Acts <hi>4.12.</hi> Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>He is the Son of God by Nature, from all Eternity, and so no Angel or Saint is.</hi> Heb. <hi>1.5.</hi> For unto which of the Angels said he, at any time, Thou art my son, this day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3</hi> VVhy was it necessary he should become man?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That he might be capable to suffer Death in our room.</hi> Heb. <hi>2.15, 16, 17.</hi> For verily he took not on him the nature of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but he took on him the seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why must the Redeemer be God as well as Man?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because the blood of a meer man could not satisfy and redeem us.</hi> Acts <hi>20.28.</hi> Feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Do these two Natures make two Persons?</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>1.</hi> What doth Christ's Prophetical Office imply?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It implies man's natural blindness and ignorance. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.14.</hi> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lse doth it imply?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Christ is the original and fountain of all that light, which guides us to salvation. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>4.6, 7.</hi> For God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>3.</hi> How doth Christ teach men the will of God.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He doth it by external Revelation of it.</hi> Acts <hi>3.22.</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. <hi>And by internal illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Q. <hi>4</hi> What need then of man's ministry?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Very much; for Christ hath instituted Ministers as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, by whom he will teach us.</hi> Eph. <hi>4 11, 12.</hi> And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. <hi>Acts 26.18.</hi> To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>5.</hi> Can no man savingly know the will of God without the teachings of Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; though common knowledge may be obtained in a natural way, yet not saving.</hi> Mat. <hi>11.25.</hi> At that time Iesus answered, and said, I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth; because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>6.</hi> How appears it that Christ is appointed to this office?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We have the written word for it.</hi> Acts <hi>3.22.</hi> A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>7.</hi> What is the first Instruction hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>None need be discouraged at their natural weakness, if Christ be their Teacher.</hi> Mat. <hi>11.25.</hi> At that time Iesus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and said, I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. <hi>Psal. 19.7.</hi> The testimonies of the Lord are sure, making wise the simple.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>8.</hi> What is the second Instruction?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it's a dreadful judgment to be spiritually blinded under the Gospel. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>4.3, 4.</hi> But if our Gospel be kid, it is

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the third Instruction?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Prayer is the best Expedient to obtain saving Knowledge.</hi> Iam. <hi>1.5.</hi> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</p>

of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. <hi>And as to men, to put away their sins.</hi> Heb. <hi>9.26.</hi> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world, but now once in the end of the world, he hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>4.</hi> What is the first difference between Christ and other Priests?</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>5.</hi> What is the second difference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They offered many Sacrifices; Christ perfected all by one offering.</hi> Heb. <hi>10.14.</hi> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>6.</hi> What was the sacrifice Christ offered to God?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That Christ's love to Sinners is astonishingly great. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>8.9.</hi> For ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich.</p>

                  <hi>A.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 31. WHAT is effectual Calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Effectual Calling is the work of God's Spirit, whereby convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing one wills, he doth perswade and enable us to embrace Iesus Christ, freely offered to us in the Gospel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What makes the difference between effectual and ineffectual Calling?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ineffectual calling is when men have nothing but the external sound of the Gospel.</hi> Mat. <hi>20.16.</hi> For many be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and few chosen. <hi>Effectual is, when the Spirit works in conjunction with the Word.</hi> Iohn <hi>6.45.</hi> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God; every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, cometh unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What is the First act of the Spirit in Effectual Calling?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Conviction of Sin.</hi> Iohn <hi>16.8.</hi> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Do the Called of God hear any voice from Heaven?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ordinarily it is a call without sound, yet as efficacious as an audible Voice from Heaven.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is the Second act of the Spirit in our Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The illumination of the mind in the knowledge of Christ.</hi> Acts <hi>26.18.</hi> To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> In what things doth it enlighten them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>In this, That Christ is their only remedy.</hi> Acts <hi>4.12.</hi> Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. <hi>And their all-sufficient remedy.</hi> Heb. <hi>7.25.</hi> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>His renewing of the Sinner's will, and making it flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Psal. <hi>110.3.</hi> Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. <hi>Ezek. 36.26.</hi> A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 7.</hi> Can no man come to Christ till thus enabled?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it's not in the power of man's nature or will, till thus renewed and enabled.</hi> Eph. <hi>1.19, 20.</hi> And what is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him on his own right hand in the heavenly places. <hi>John 6.44.</hi> No man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>The poor and mean ones in the world. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1.26.</hi> For ye see your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.</p>
               <p>

               <p>A. <hi>All things co-operare to their good.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.28.</hi> For we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 33. WHAT is Iustification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Iustification is an Act of God's Free-grace, wherein he pardoneth all our Sins, and accepteth us as righteous in his sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly faith alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="questions">
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 1.</hi> What are the parts of Iustification?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists of two Parts.</hi> First, <hi>The pardon of Sin.</hi> Acts <hi>13.39.</hi> And by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses. Secondly, <hi>The acceptation of our persons as righteous.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1, 2, 3.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whose act is it to justify Sinners?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the act of God alone.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.33.</hi> It is God that justifieth. <hi>Man's justifying of himself is nothing.</hi> Luke <hi>16.15.</hi> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify your selves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God. <hi>Nor other mens justifying of us.</hi> Rev. <hi>3.1.</hi> I know thy works, that thou hast a name to live, and art dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Is there any thing in man to merit his Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it is an act of Free-grace in God.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.24.</hi> Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> If it be not for any inherent righteousness, how then?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us.</hi> Rom. <hi>4.6.</hi> Even as <hi>David</hi> also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41733:40"/>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How is Christ's righteousness made ours?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By Application of it to us by Faith.</hi> Gal. <hi>2.16.</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Iesus Christ, even we have believed in Iesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Is it not partly by Christ's Righteousness, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our own?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No: by Christ's Righteousness, without any mixture of ours.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.28.</hi> Therefore we conclude, that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But doth not <hi>James</hi> says otherwise. <hi>Jam. 2.14.</hi> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he, hath faith, and have not works, Can faith save him?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The two Apostles contradict not one another.</hi> Paul <hi>speaks of Justification before God; and</hi> Iames <hi>of justifying our Faith before men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Is no regard then to be had to good works?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, very great; they that believe, must be careful to maintain good works.</hi> Tit. <hi>3.8.</hi> That they which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, might be careful to maintain good works. <hi>These things are good and profitable unto men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Why can none be justified by works?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because all are guilty before God.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.29.</hi> Is he the God of the Iews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also. <hi>And the Law curses all that are under guilt.</hi> Gal. <hi>3.10.</hi> Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The happy State of Believers who are now at peace with God.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>And whom he justifieth he glorifieth.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.30.</hi> Whom he justified, them he also golrified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the second Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The excellency and necessity of Faith.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.30.</hi> The circumcision is justified by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the greatness of sin is no bar to faith, since it is the Righteousness of Christ that justifieth. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>5.21.</hi> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we may be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What is the last Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Believers ought to be exceeding humble, and far from boasting. The Law of Faith excludes boasting.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.27.</hi> Where is boasting then? It is excluded; by what law? Of works? nay, but by the law of faith.</p>

                  <hi>Quest. 1.</hi> DOTH all true Grace increase and grow?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it doth, like the Morning light.</hi> Prov. <hi>4.18.</hi> The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. <hi>And for that end God hath appointed Ministers and Ordinances.</hi> Eph. <hi>4.11, 12.</hi> And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and some Pastors aud Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>2.</hi> Cannot false or seeming Grace grow?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It may spring up and seem to flourish for a time; but comes not to perfection.</hi> Luke <hi>8.14</hi> And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard, go forth, and are choaked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this tife, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>3.</hi> What is the first respect in which Grace grows?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It grows by deeper rooting it self in the Soul.</hi> Eph. <hi>3.17.</hi> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>4.</hi> What is the manner of its growth?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>It grows in respect of its abilities to fix the mind more steadily on spiritual things. Hence grown Christians are called spiritual men.</hi> Gal. <hi>6.1.</hi> Ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Why must all true Grace grow?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What are the causes of a Christians growth?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Union with Christ.</hi> Iohn <hi>15.4.</hi> As the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. <hi>And his Blessings on the Ordinances.</hi> Isa. <hi>55.10, 11.</hi> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and returneth not thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; So shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. <hi>And Providences.</hi> Phil. <hi>1 19.</hi> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayers, and the supply of the spirit of Iesus Christ.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whom will Christ acknowledge for his?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Such as confess Christ now.</hi> Mat. <hi>10.32.</hi> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Before whom will Christ confess them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Before his Father, Angels and Men.</hi> Rev. <hi>3.5.</hi> He that overcometh, the same shall be cloathed in white Raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his name before my Father, and before Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Who shall be denied by Christ in that Day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>All that now deny Christ, shall be denied by him. 2</hi> Tim. <hi>2.12.</hi> If we deny him, he also will deny us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Why will Christ openly acknowledge them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To wipe off all Aspersions and Censures that now are cast upon them</hi> Isa. <hi>66.5.</hi> Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my names sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What will be the effect of Christ's Acknowledgment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Twill put a full end to all Doubts, Fears, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of themselves. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>4.3, 4.</hi> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment; yea, I judge not my own self, for I know nothing by my self; yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>7.</hi> What other effect will it produce in them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Joy unspeakable and transcendent: hence called time of refreshing.</hi> Acts <hi>3.19.</hi> When the time refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Is this the only time Christ acknowledgeth them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, he acknowledgeth them by his Spirit's Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now; but that's private in their Bosoms.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.16.</hi> The spirit it self beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>To warn all how they pass rash Censures on Christ's Servants.</hi> Psal. <hi>73.15.</hi> If I say, I will speak this, Behold I should offend against the generation of thy children.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Let Christians abound in good works. Every act of Charity for Christ, shall be acknowledged by him in the Day of Judgment.</hi> Mat. <hi>25.35.</hi> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the last inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Let all Christians love and long for the day of Christ's appearing. 2</hi> Tim. <hi>4.8.</hi> Hence forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Iudge shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto them also that love his appearing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. 1.</hi> WHat is it to be acquitted by Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is to be discharged and cleared from all the guilt of Sin, and punishent due to it by the Law, upon the account of Christ's Righteousness imputed by God, and received by Faith.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>Rom. 8.1.</hi> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> How many ways are Believers acquitted?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are acquitted now in the Court of Heaven.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.33.</hi> Who shall lay any thing to the change of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth. <hi>In the court of their own Consciences. 1</hi> Iohn <hi>3.21.</hi> Beloved, if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. <hi>And in the Day of Judgment. Both particular;</hi> Heb. <hi>9.27.</hi> As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment. <hi>And general.</hi> Acts <hi>3.19.</hi> Repeat ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out. <hi>Their Sins are then blotted out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> How doth Christ's acquittance now, differ from that at Iudgment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They differ in respect of publickness; this is secret in the Believer's bosom, and that open before Men and Angels.</hi> Rev. <hi>3.5.</hi> I will confess his name before my Father, and before his Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:41733:52"/>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is the second Difference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They differ in respect of subjective certainty and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance. A Believer may doubt of this, but not of that. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>4.4, 5.</hi> For I know nothing of my self, yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord; therefore judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time, until the Lord come.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>5.</hi> What is the third Difference betwixt them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They differ in point of consolation. This always bears proportion to the certainty of it. Hence that day is called the time of refreshing; when Christ blots out their Sins by Sentencial Justification.</hi> Acts <hi>3.19.</hi> Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Do Believers then lie under condemnation till that Day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, they are truly and fully justified now.</hi> Iohn <hi>5.24.</hi> He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. <hi>But this Sentence is not yet publisht by Christ's own mouth, as it shall be then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>7.</hi> On what account shall they be acquitted in that Day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>On the very same account and score they are now,</hi> viz. <hi>For the imputed Righteousness of Christ in the way of Free-grace.</hi> Eph. <hi>1.7.</hi> In wham we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>8.</hi> Must the Saints be summoned to Christ's Bar in that Day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, they must appear as well as others. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>5.10.</hi> For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ. <hi>But not to the same end.</hi> Iohn <hi>5.29.</hi> And shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life: and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>9.</hi> What is the first Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>How sure is a Believer's Justification, being so ratified privately and publickly, in this World, and that to come!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>10.</hi> What is the second Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though the Day of Judgment be awfully solemn, it should not be dreadful to Believers. They should look for, and hasten to the coming of the Day of God. 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3.12.</hi> Looking for, and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Faith is a Grace of absolute necessity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable excellency.</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1, 2.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ.

By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the last Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>All unbelievers are in a miserable State now.</hi> Iohn <hi>3.18.</hi> He that believeth not, is condemned already. <hi>And worse in the world to come.</hi> Mat. <hi>25.41.</hi> Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. 1.</hi> WHAT doth perfect Blessedness suppose and imply?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It supposes the total Freedom of Believers from all the moral evil of Sin.</hi> Eph. <hi>5.27.</hi> That he might present you to himself a glorious Church, not having spot nor wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy, and without blemish. <hi>And from all the penal evils of suffering.</hi> Rev. <hi>21.4.</hi> And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2</hi> What else is implied in perfect Blessedness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It implies the full and perfect enjoyment of God. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.28.</hi> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 3.</hi> What is it for God to be all in all?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It implies three things in it.</hi> First, <hi>That all the Saints shall be filled and satisfied from God alone.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That there shall be no need of other things out of which they were wont to fetch comfort.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That all other things, as Heaven, Angels, Saints, should be loved and enjoyed in God.</hi>

                  <hi>Q 5.</hi> In what other respects shall they Enjoy God?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, they do; but not so as they shall enjoy him in Heaven. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13.12.</hi> Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Their Communion with God here is clogg'd with Sin.</hi> Rom. <hi>7.21.</hi> I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me. <hi>Here it is not constant.</hi> Psal. <hi>22.1.</hi> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <hi>Nor is it satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyîng: but in Heaven it will be pure, constant and satisfying.</hi>

                  <hi>Q 10.</hi> What is the first Instruction from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the World is not the place of the Saints rest and satisfaction.</hi> Heb. <hi>4.9.</hi> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. <hi>2 Cor. 5.2, 6.</hi> For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be cloathed upon with our house which is from heaven; therefore we are always confident, knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we we are absent from the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the second Instruction from hence?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, subjects must obey their lawful Magistrates.</hi> Rom. <hi>13.1.</hi> Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. The powers that be are ordained of God. <hi>People their Ministers.</hi> Heb. <hi>13.17.</hi> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give an account. <hi>Children their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> Eph. <hi>6.1.</hi> Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. <hi>But not as they are to obey God.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, their Judgment of Discretion is both command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.15.</hi> I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say. <hi>And commended.</hi> Acts <hi>17.11.</hi> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the only Rule for our Obedience to God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The will of God revealed in the Scriptures, is our only Rule of Obedience.</hi> Isa. <hi>8.20.</hi> To the law, and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes; if it be consonant to the revealed will of God in the word, otherwise not.</hi> Deut <hi>29.29.</hi> The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That it's highly sinful and dangerous to disobey the known will of God in any thing.</hi> Rom. <hi>1.18.</hi> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. <hi>Luke 12.47.</hi> And that servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is highly sinful and dangerous to command others, or obey commands from others, which are not according to God's Command.</hi> Hos. <hi>5.11.</hi> Ephraim is oppressed, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in judgment, because he wilingly walketh after the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Jer. 7.31.</hi> And they have built the high places of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes; being a reasonable Creature is capable of, and fitted for Government by Law, which other Creatures are not; and being an accountable Creature to God, must needs be under a Law.</hi> Rom. <hi>2.15.</hi> Which shew the works of the Law written in their hearts; their consciences also bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Before ever the Law was given at</hi> Sinai, <hi>all the race of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>had a Law written in their Hearts,</hi> viz. <hi>the Light of Reason, and Dictates of natural Conscience.</hi> Rom. <hi>2.14.</hi> For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the law, are a law

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What is the meaning of the Moral Law?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis not a Law to direct and order our Manners; but a Law that binds universally and perpetually, as the Ten Commandments do those to whom they are promulged, and the Light of Nature doth all others.</hi> Rom. <hi>2.14.</hi> For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves.

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why is it said to be summarily comprehended in the Ten Commandments?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because much more is included in every Command, than is exprest, as our Saviour shews in his Exposition of it</hi> Mat. <hi>22.40.</hi> On these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Doth the Moral Law bind Christians under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it doth, as a Rule to order their Conversations by.</hi> Iam. <hi>2.8, 9, 10.</hi> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self; ye do well, but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors; for whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all?</p>

               <p>A. <hi>God never designed the Law to be the way of Man's Justification since the Fall.</hi> Gal. <hi>3.21, 22.</hi> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! for if there had been a law-giver which could have given life, verily, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Iesus Christ night be given to them that believe. <hi>But it was promulged to convince Men of Sin.</hi> Rom. <hi>7 7</hi> What shall we say then?

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the abominable Nature of Popery. The Pope being that lawless One, who will not be bound to the Laws of God himself. 2</hi> Thes. <hi>2.8.</hi> Then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. <hi>But assumes Power to dispence with God's Laws to others.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the second Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That man dieth not as Beasts die; which are under no Moral Law, and therefore capable of no sin, but must come to Judgment after Death.</hi> Eccles. <hi>3.21.</hi> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? <hi>Heb. 9.27.</hi> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the Iudgment.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the third Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That though the actions of men naturally considered, are transcient, yet their consequences and effects are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; An act is soon done, a word soon spoken, a thought soon thought; but when done, spoken or thought, they are placed to account.</hi> Gal. <hi>6.7, 8.</hi> Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall be also reap; for he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the fourth Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God will proceed with man by different rules in the Day of Judgment, according to the different Law; they lived under in this World.</hi> Rom. <hi>2.12.</hi> For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the fifth Inference from hence?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the sixth Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That as we are to prize the Moral Law highly, as a Rule of Life;</hi> Psal. <hi>119.105.</hi> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. <hi>So are we to bless God for the Gospel-Dispensation, by which only we can attain to Justification and Salvation.</hi> Heb. <hi>12.22.</hi> But we are come to Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, to an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>To love the Lord our God with a Supream love, and Men with a Sincere love, in and for him.</hi> Matt. <hi>22.37, 38.</hi> Iesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

               <p>A. <hi>It implies the loving of God purely and absolutely for himself.

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What is the Second Property of this Supream Love?</p>
               <p>A <hi>Supream love devotes the whole man to God and Christ: So that in life and death that man designs the Glory of God as his main end.</hi> Rom. <hi>14.7, 8.</hi> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is the third Property of Supream Love?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It causes the Soul to depreciate and slight all other things in comparison of God's Glory, and an Interest in Christ.</hi> Acts <hi>20.24.</hi> But none of these things move me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my course with joy. <hi>Phil. 3.8, 9.</hi> I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What is the fourth Property of Supream Love?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It centers the Soul in God as its only rest.</hi> Psal. <hi>116.7.</hi> Return unto thy rest, O my soul. <hi>And cannot be satisfied till it come to the full enjoyment of him. 2</hi> Thes. <hi>3.5.</hi> The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and patient waiting for Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Why must we love God with a supream Love?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because such a love only suits the transcendent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God. Commands all we are and have for God, and is the only love that will continue to the end.</hi> Rom. <hi>8.35.</hi> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is it to love our Neighbour as our selves?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the exact Observation and Practice of the golden Rule of Christ.</hi> Matt. <hi>7.12.</hi> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the first Instruction from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the excellency of Divine love.</hi> Moses <hi>expresses the Whole Duty of Man in Ten Commandments. Christ hangs the Whole Law upon these Two, Love to God, and our Neighbour.</hi> Mark <hi>12.30, 31.</hi> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first Commandment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It convinces the holiest of men how far short they come in their Obedience to the rule of duty, and therein</hi> the law is our School-master to bring us to Christ. <hi>Gal. 3.24.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q 3.</hi> What is the second argument to Obedience?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our propriety in God by Covenant [I am the Lord thy God] This obligeth to Obedience, and aggravateth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi> Psal. <hi>50.7.</hi> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee; I am God, even thy God. <hi>Hos. 9.1.</hi> Thou hast gone a whoring from thy God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is the third argument unto Obedience?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The benefits of Redemption that they receive from God. Benefits perswade to duty; and</hi> the goodness of God leads to repentance. <hi>Rom. 2.4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How can deliverance out of Egypt, be an argument to them that never were in Egypt?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>As that Deliverance was a Type of our Deliverance, so 'tis an argument to us, and an argument from the less to the greater; so it obligeth us more than them.</hi> Luke <hi>1.74<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 75.</hi> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41733:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>A. <hi>Our Deliverance is not from</hi> Egypt, <hi>but from Hell.</hi> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. <hi>Col. 1.13. And our persons are bought by the Redeemer to glorify God. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.19.</hi> What, know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you; for ye are bought with a price; wherefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirits which are Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Is it not mercenary to serve God upon the account of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received, or to be received?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He that makes religious Duties</hi> Mediums <hi>to attain car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantages only, is of a worse than mercenary Spirit.</hi> Hos. <hi>7.14.</hi> And they have not cried unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds; they assembled themselves for corn and wine, and they rebelled against me <hi>But to be quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mercy to Duty is not mercenary, but Evangelical.</hi> Hos. <hi>3.5.</hi> They shall fear the Lord and his goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That great is the condescention of God to Man, that he will use arguments to induce him to obedience, who might exact it only by his Sovereignty, and justly damn us for our disobedience. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>5.20.</hi> Now then we are embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> What is the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the more mercy any receive from God, the more obligations are laid on them to obey him.</hi> Psal. <hi>116.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</hi> I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice, and my supplication; because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the third Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The more mercies and favours any man sins against, the greater is that man's sin, and the sorer will be his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Amos <hi>3 1, 2.</hi> You only have I known of all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth; wherefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the fourth Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God's expectations are greater, where his mercies and favours have been so.</hi> Isa. <hi>5.4</hi> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That memorials of God's Mercies are to be kept by us, to provoke us to constant and chearful duties of obedience</hi> Exod. <hi>17.14.</hi> And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Ioshua. <hi>Psal. 103.2, 3.</hi> Bless the Lord, O my soul, forget not all his benefits.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. The First Commandment is, Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What is the first duty enjoin'd in the first Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is to know and acknowledge the Existence or Being of God, and consequently condemns all Atheism, both in judgment and practice.</hi> Heb. <hi>11.6.</hi> He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seek him. <hi>Psalm. 14.1.</hi> The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What is the second duty of the First Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It requires all men to know and acknowledge the unity of God.</hi> Deut. <hi>6.4.</hi> Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. <hi>And condemns Polytheism, or plurality of Gods. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>8.5, 6.</hi> For tho' there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be Gods many, and Lords many; but to us there is but one God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Whence sprang the Opinion of more Gods than one at first in the world?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It sprang from ignorance of God's Omnipresence and Omnipotence. Hence came their vain imaginations.</hi> Rom. <hi>1.21.</hi> Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. <hi>They thought the presence and power of God might reach one place, and not another. 1</hi> Kings <hi>20.23.</hi> And the servants of the King of Assyria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What were the first Creatures worshipped as Gods?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Probably the heavenly Bodies, Sun, Moon and Stars, because of their splendor and influence,; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se as Heralds, do

proclaim God to the World.</hi> Psal. <hi>19.1, 2.</hi> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. <hi>And these messengers of God were mistaken for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> Iob <hi>31.26, 27.</hi> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly inticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand; This also were an iniquity, for I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What do these words <hi>[before me]</hi> import?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It notes God's perfect knowledge and abhorrence of all Idolatry, or worshipping of another God, as what he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to behold.</hi> Ier. <hi>44.3, 4.</hi> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve other Gods, whom they knew not, neither they, you, nor your fathers; howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending them, saying, O do not this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing that I hate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Are none guilty of this sin but heathenish Idolaters?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, all that place their supream love or trust in any creature, make that creature their God, and in Scripture are called Idolaters.</hi> Col. <hi>3.5.</hi> And covetousness which is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> How doth the Idolatry forbidden in the first, differ from that forbidden in the second Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Idolatry forbidden in the first Commandment is a sin respecting the object of worship, when we set up any thing in the place of God, which by nature is not God.</hi> Gal. <hi>4.8.</hi> Howbeit then when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. <hi>But that against the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, when we pretend to worship the true God, but do it by such means, and in such a manner as he hath not required, or hath forbidden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Exod. <hi>32.4, 5.</hi> And he received them at their hands, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made a molten calf, and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the house of Egypt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the first inference from the first Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is a special mercy to be brought forth in a land where the true God is known and worshipped.</hi> Psal. <hi>147.20.</hi> He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for his judgments they have not known them; praise ye the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the second inference from the <hi>1</hi>st. Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is a great and dreadful sin to live without the worship of God in the world.</hi> Eph. <hi>2.12.</hi> That at that time ye
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41733:60"/>
were without Christ, — and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What's the third inference from the <hi>1</hi>st Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Christians must not comply with Idolatrous or Superstitious worship, when they are cast into Idolatrous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how great soever the danger be.</hi> Psal. <hi>16.4.</hi> Their sorrows shall be multiplied, that hasten after another God; their drink offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the fourth inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the supream love, fear, and trust of the Soul is God's peculiar right and due. Whosoever places them on any other besides God, is guilty of a very heinous and great sin against him. 1</hi> Iohn <hi>2.15.</hi> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. <hi>Compared with</hi> Iob <hi>31.24, 28.</hi> If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; this also were an iniquity to be punished by the Iudge, for I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the fifth inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God's eye discovers the closest Idolatry in the world, whether it be in secret actions;</hi> Ezek. <hi>8.12.</hi> Hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark? Every man in the chambers of his imaginary; for they say, the Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth. <hi>Or inward affections. Col. 3.5.</hi> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 13.</hi> What is the sixth inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That an high and full condition in the world, is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition, and lies most exposed to the danger of Heart-idolatry.</hi> Prov. <hi>30.9.</hi> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? <hi>Mark 10.24</hi> How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What is the last Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That in covenanting with God, and avouching him for our God, we must wholly renounce all others, and take God alone for our portion; and the object of our love and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi> Hos. <hi>3.3.</hi> Thou shalt not be for another man. So will I also be for thee. <hi>Luke 14 33.</hi> So likewise whosoever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What is the second Sin forbidden in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The second Sin against this Commandment is Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, consisting in the addition of mans inventions to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God as a part thereof,</hi> Matth. <hi>15.9.</hi> But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <hi>Col. 2.20, 21, 22, 23.</hi> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world; why, as though living in the world, are ye sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ordinances, (Touch not, taste not, bandle not: Which all are to perish with the using) after the commandments and doctrines of men: which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will-worship and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and neglecting of the body, not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; That Scripture commands that Gods Institutions be regularly and decently performed, but not that we invent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that are symbolical, to make them more decent than Christ left them.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The first Reason annexed is Gods Sovereignty,</hi> I the Lord; <hi>which shews that it belongs to God only to institute his own Worship, and make it effectual; and therefore to do that in his Worship which he never commanded, is sinful and dangerous;</hi> Ier. <hi>7.31.</hi> And they have built the high places of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41733:61"/>A. <hi>The second Reason is Gods Propriety in us; he is our God, and we belong to him; and therefore to corrupt his Worship, greatly aggravates our Sin,</hi> Hos. <hi>9.1.</hi> Rejoyce not, O Israel, for joy as other people; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The jealousie of God over his Worship and Worshippers; so that this sin of corrupting his Worship, will dreadfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense his wrath, as it did,</hi> Levit. <hi>10.1, 2.</hi> And Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire thereon. and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.

               <p>A. <hi>That those that suffer for endeavouring to preserve the purity of Gods Ordinances, and non-conformity to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary injunctions of men, have a good warrant to bear them out in all such Sufferings;</hi> Deut. <hi>4.2.</hi> Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the third Instruction from the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is highly sinful and dangerous to innovate and prescribe by Humane Authority, such symbolical Rites in the Worship of God, as he never appointed or allowed in his Word,</hi> Matth. <hi>15.9.</hi> But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the fourth Instruction hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn how much Parents and Children are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to worship God constantly, spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the day which was foretold to be our Sabbath; <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> The Lord hath marked it for himself by setting his own Name on it; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi> And the Apostles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church constantly set it apart to Religious uses and ends; <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 16.2. <hi>Vpon the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:41733:64"/>Q. 6. <hi>When doth the Christian Sabbath begin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It appears that this day is not to be reckoned from even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evening, but from morning to morning; because the Christian Sabbath must begin, when the Jewish Sabbath ended, but that ended towards the morning; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1. <hi>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary to see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 7. <hi>What is the ground of changing the day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The solemn commemoration of our Redemption by the Resurrection of Christ from the dead, is the ground of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the Week; <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoyce, and be glad in it.</hi> Mark 16.9. <hi>Now when Iesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 8. <hi>Is it the whole day, or only some hours of the day that are set apart for God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not a part, but the whole day is the Lords; and it is as dangerous to halve it with God in point of time, as it was for <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> to halve their dedicated Goods, and bring in but a part. <hi>Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day,</hi> is the Command.</p>
               <p>Q. 9. <hi>Is there any other day holy besides this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No day but this is holy by Institution of the Lord; yet dayes of Humiliation and Thanksgiving may be lawfully set apart by men on a Call of Providence; but Popish Holy-dayes are not warrantable, nor to be observed; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve dayes, and months, and times, and years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 10. <hi>But seeing every day should be a Sabbath to a Christian, what needs any other set time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though Christians must walk every day with God, yet every day cannot be a Sabbath, because God calls us to other Duties on those dayes, but will have this to be a solemn and entire day to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. 11. <hi>But if a man scruple the change of the Sabbath, may he not keep both dayes weekly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for then by doing more than God requires, he breaks a plain Command, <hi>Six days shalt thou labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 12. <hi>At what time should Christians be up, and at their Duties on the Lords day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As early in the morning as their strength will permit, to prepare by private for publick Duties; yet the publick are not

to be entrenched on by private Duties; <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. —<hi>Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A. The fourth Commandment forbiddeth the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or careless performance of the Duties required, and the profaning the day by Idleness, or doing that which is in it self sinful, or by unnecessary thoughts, words or works, about our worldly employments or recreations.</hi>

               <hi>A. The Reasons annexed to the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are, Gods allowing us six days of the week for our own employment, his challenging a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the seventh, his own example, and his blessing the Sabbath day.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> May not any works of our civil Calling be ordinarily done on that day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; it is sinful to put our hands ordinarily to our Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on that day, and God usually punishes it:</hi> Neh. <hi>13.15, 16, 17, 18.</hi> In those dayes saw I in Iudah, some treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses, as also
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41733:65"/>
wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Ierusalem on the sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath, unto the children of Iudah, and in Ierusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Iudah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> May we not refresh our Bodies by Recreations or our Minds by thoughts of Earthly Business or Discourses on that day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Recreations of the Body which are lawful on other days, are sinful on this day; and all the Recreations of the Mind allowed on this day, are Spiritual and Heavenly;</hi> Isa. <hi>58.13, 14.</hi> If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thy self in the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Iacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What works may lawfully be done on that day?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Christs example warrants works of necessity, and works of mercy, but no other,</hi> Matth. <hi>12.3, 4.</hi> But he said unto them, have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests. <hi>And</hi> ver. <hi>7.</hi> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The publick Worship of God in reading and hearing the Word preached;</hi> Isa. <hi>66.23.</hi> And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. <hi>Luke 4.16.</hi> —And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stood up for to read. <hi>And Prayer;</hi> Acts <hi>16.13, 14.</hi> And on the sabbath day we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>A. <hi>Yes; it is not enough to sanctifie the Sabbath in publick Ordinances, but God requires it to be sanctified in Family and private Duties;</hi> Lev. <hi>23.3.</hi> —But the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation, ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>The first Reason is the sufficient and large allowance of time God hath given us for our civil Callings and earthly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Six days in the week is a large allowance.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Is it not enough to sanctifie this day in our own persons?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; if God hath put any under our Authority, their profaning the Sabbath will become our sin, though we be never so strict in the observation of it our selves.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> May we continue our civil Employments to the last moment of our common time?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Except Necessity or Mercy urge us, we ought to break off before, and allow some time to prepare for the Sabbath;</hi> Luke <hi>23.54.</hi> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What are the Duties of Wives to their Husbands?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis their Duty, (1.) To be in subjection to their own Husbands</hi>; Eph. <hi>5.22, 23.</hi> Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord: For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church. <hi>(2) To reverence them;</hi> Eph. <hi>5.33.</hi> —And the wife see that she reverence her husband. <hi>(3.)

               <p>A. <hi>'Tis their Duty, (1.) To be faithful in all things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge;</hi> Tit. <hi>2.10.</hi> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity, <hi>&amp;c. (2.)

To bear patiently their rebukes; 1</hi> Pet. <hi>2.18, 19.</hi> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What is the first Duty of Masters to their Servants?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Their first Duty is to rule over them with gentleness, and not with terrour and rigour;</hi> Eph. <hi>6.9.</hi> And ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A. <hi>No, it primarily respects our own lives, and forbids us all things that tend to the shortening and ruin of them,</hi> Eph. <hi>5.29.</hi> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>The second Reason is, because of the evil of it to our selves: As (1.) It injures the Body, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.18.</hi> —He that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body. <hi>(2.) It levels us with the Heathen,</hi> Eph. <hi>4.17, 19.</hi> This I say therefore, and testifie in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, —Who being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. <hi>(3.)

               <p>A. <hi>The Youthful Age is most apt to be drawn into this Sin;</hi> Prov. <hi>7.7.</hi> And behold among the simple ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding. <hi>And 2</hi> Tim. <hi>2.22.</hi> Flu also youthful lusts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>This Command requires every Man to take care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his own good Name, by ordering his Conversation in universal Integrity, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>3.15, 16.</hi> But sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready alwayes to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear: Having a good conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whereas they speak evil of you as of evil doers, they may be ashamed that falsly accuse your good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What's the second thing required in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It requires all due care to preserve the good Name and Honour of other Men, as well as our own; for Christians are not to be of narrow and private Spirits, which center only in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41733:73"/>
their own interests and concernments,</hi> Phil. <hi>2.4.</hi> Look not every man on his own things; but every man also on the things of others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How else are we to defend other Mens Names?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By our readiness to receive with joy the reports of that good that is in them, 3</hi> Epist. Iohn <hi>3.</hi> For I rejoyced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. <hi>And discountenancing all reproaches mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously vented against them,</hi> Psal. <hi>15.3.</hi> —Nor taketh up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach against his neighbour.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But what if the report be evidently true?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>In that case we are to grieve for their miscarriages, as the effect and fruit of our love to their Souls, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>2.4.</hi> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote unto you with many tears, not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. <hi>And to discharge our Duties privately and faithfully in order to their recovery,</hi> Mat. <hi>18.15, 16, 17.</hi> Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is forbidden in the ninth Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids us to injure others, by raising or receiving Lyes and false Reports, which are highly injurious to their good Names,</hi> Col. <hi>3.9.</hi> Lye not one to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>It especially forbids Perjury or false Swearing, whereby not only the Names, but Estates and Lives of the innocent are injured and ruined,</hi> Psal. <hi>35.11.</hi> False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not. <hi>Prov. 19.5.</hi> A false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. <hi>A sin which God will punish,</hi> Mal. <hi>3.5.</hi> And I will come near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What else doth the ninth Commandment forbid?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids all rash and unwarrantable judging of other Mens Hearts and final Estates, which is usually accompanied with ignorance of our own,</hi> Matth. <hi>7.1, 3.</hi> Iudge not that ye be not judged. —And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What else is forbidden in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids the eclipsing of the true worth and honour of others, by a proud exalting of our selves, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13.4, 5.</hi> —Charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, <hi>&amp;c. Or by crying up one to the disparagement of another good Man, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.4, 5.</hi> For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollo, are ye not carnal? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the best Christians have cause to be humbled for the sins of the Tongue, whereby God is dishonoured, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are injured,</hi> Iam. <hi>3.2.</hi> —If any man offend not in word, the same is a per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue amongst our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis our great concernment to walk with that Piety and Justice towards God and Men, as to cut off all just occasions of reproach from our own Names, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>11.12.</hi> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion, <hi>&amp;c. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>5.14,</hi> I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to speak reproachfully.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Is contentment with Gods appointments attainable in this life?</p>
               <p>A: <hi>Some Christians have attained to a very great measure and eminent degree of Contentment in the midst of change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and afflictive Providences,</hi> Phil. <hi>4.11.</hi> —I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. <hi>Psal. 16.5, 6.</hi> The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest my lot.

               <p>A. <hi>It directly and especially forbids all sinful and inordinate desires and motions after other Mens enjoyments,</hi> Col. <hi>3.5.</hi> Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication,

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What's the second Sin forbidden in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids all cruelty and incompassionateness to others in necessity, and keeping back from them that relief which is made theirs by Gods command,</hi> Prov. <hi>11.24.</hi> —There is that with-holdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. <hi>Lev. 19.9, 10.</hi> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy harvest. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard: thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the Lord your God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is the third Sin forbidden in this Command?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids the detaining of the Hirelings Wages, when it is due,</hi> Hab. <hi>2.9, 10, 11.</hi> Wo to him that coveteth an evil cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness to his house that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What's the fourth Sin forbidden in this Commandment?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It forbids all inward grudgings at, and envyings of the enjoyments of others, whether they be inward Goods of the Mind, or outward belonging to the Body; 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13.4.</hi> —Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity envieth not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the mischief of Covetousness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It distracts the Heart in Duties,</hi> Ezek. <hi>33.31.</hi> And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee, as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness. <hi>Provokes the wrath of God,</hi> Isa. <hi>57.17.</hi> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Inference hence?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What's the last Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>If God have given us a sufficiency of the things of this life for our necessity, let us be satisfied, though we want other things for our delight, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>6.8.</hi> And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. <hi>And relieve our selves by an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of those better things laid up in Heaven for us, if we be believers,</hi> Iam. <hi>2.5.</hi> —Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them that love him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. No meer man, since the fall, is able in this life perfectly to keep the Commandments of God, but doth dayly break them in Thought, Word, and Deed.</hi>

                  </gap> perfect keeping of Gods Law consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists in the perfect and constant conformity of the internal and external Actions of Heart and Life, to every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.10.</hi> —Cursed is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them. <hi>Matth. 22.37, 38, 39.</hi> Iesus said unto him, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great Commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>No, for an inward motion of sin in the Heart, that never breaks forth into act, is a violation of the Law, and brings the Soul under the curse of it,</hi> Matth. <hi>5.21, 22.</hi> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> May not a man keep the Law, if he keep some of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, though he cannot keep every one of them punctually?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No he cannot; for the transgression of any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the least degree, is a breach of all, and brings the curse of the whole upon a Mans Soul,</hi> Iam. <hi>2.10.</hi> For who soever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Was the Law never kept by any since it was made?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes,</hi> Adam <hi>in his innocent state kept it, for he was made upright,</hi> Eccles. 7.29. God made man upright, <hi>&amp;c. And Christ perfectly kept it,</hi> Matth. <hi>5.17.</hi> Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What's the first Reason why no meer man in this life can fulfil and keep the law of God perfectly?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is because the Law of God is perfect, and the best of Men in this life are imperfect,</hi> Psal. <hi>19.7.</hi> The law of the Lord is perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eccles. <hi>7.20.</hi> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But may not Men perfectly keep it, when regenerate, and born of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, because even in the regenerate there is a Law of Sin which wars against the Law of God,</hi> Gal. <hi>5.17.</hi> For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, <hi>&amp;c. Rom. 7.22, 23.</hi> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, <hi>&amp;c. And though they are said not to sin, 1</hi> Iohn <hi>3.9.</hi> (Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>that is not to be taken absolutely; but comparatively, as they once did, and others still do.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But did not Christ command the young man to keep the Law?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis true that Christ did put the young man upon this task,</hi> Matth. <hi>19.17.</hi> —If thou wilt enter into life, keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>But it was not on a supposition that he was able to do it, but to convince him of the impossibility of Justification that way.</hi>

                  </gap> is fulfilled in Believers?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis true that the Apostle doth say so,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.4. but the meaning is not, that we fulfil it in our own persons by our

compleat obedience to it, but it is fulfilled in us by our union with Christ, who perfectly kept it; and that Righteousness of the Law which is in Christ, becomes ours by Gods imputation of it to us,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.23, 24.</hi> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him. But for us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him, that raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 9.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That Justification by our own Works is utterly impossible to the holiest of Men,</hi> Gal. <hi>2.16.</hi> —For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. <hi>Psal. 130.3.</hi> If thou Lord, shouldst mark iniquities: O Lord, who shall stand?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What's the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn what an infinite Mercy it is, that God sent Jesus Christ made under the Law,</hi> Gal. <hi>4.4, 5.</hi> But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the law, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the third Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the dreadful Curse must needs lye on all Unbelievers that are out of Christ,</hi> Iohn <hi>3.36.</hi> —He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. <hi>And seek their Justification by the deeds of the Law,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.10.</hi> For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>What a deluge of sin and misery brake in upon the whole World by the fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>and all his Posterity being by him plunged under both,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.12.</hi> Wherefore, as by one man si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A. <hi>That the Popish Doctrines of Merits, and Works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation are false and groundless Doctrines, springing out of the ignorance aud pride of mans heart.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The sin of</hi> Murder <hi>is in Scripture set down for an heinous and</hi> crying <hi>sin in its own nature,</hi> Gen. <hi>4.10.</hi> The voice of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood cryeth unto me from the earth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is reckoned in Scripture an heinous sin against the First Table.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The sin of</hi> Atheism, <hi>or denying the Being of God, is a sin of the first magnitude,</hi> Iob <hi>31.28.</hi> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the Iudge: for I should have denyed the God that is above. <hi>This was the sin of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>Exod. 5.2.</hi> And Pharaoh said, who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice, to let Israel go?

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What's the most heinous of all the sins in the world?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The sin</hi> against the Holy Ghost <hi>is the most heinous of all other sins, and shall never be forgiven by Him,</hi> Matth. <hi>12.31.</hi> —All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> From whence doth this Scripture aggravate sin?</p>
               <p>A <hi>The Spirit of God in Scripture aggravates and estimates sin from the degree of</hi> light <hi>and</hi> knowledge <hi>Men sin against,</hi> Luke <hi>12.47.</hi> And that servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. <hi>John 15.22.</hi> If I had not come, and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What's the second thing that aggravates sin?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The more</hi> Mercies <hi>any man sins against, the greater is his sin,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.4.</hi> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? <hi>And especially when 'tis against</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Mercies and Means of</hi> Salvation, <hi>Heb. 2.3.</hi> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, great and heinous sins are capable of forgiveness upon true Repentance,</hi> Isa. <hi>1.18.</hi> —Tho' your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shallbe as wooll.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the second inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That there are different degrees of</hi> torments in Hell, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the different degrees of</hi> sins on earth, <hi>Matth. 11.21, 22.</hi> Wo unto thee Chorazin, wo unto thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the third Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That great Sinners when pardoned and received to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, should excel all others in love to Christ,</hi> Luke <hi>7.42, 43.</hi> —Which of them will love him most?

               <p>A. <hi>Let no Man neglect Christ, because his Sins are not so heinous as others, because the least Sin without Christ is damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.23.</hi> For the wages of sin is death, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>A. To escape the Wrath and Curse of God due to us for Sin, God requireth of us Faith in Iesus Christ, Repentance unto Life, with the diligent use of all the outward means, whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of Redemption.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The things required of us, are, (1.)</hi> Faith <hi>in Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts <hi>16.31.</hi> And they said, believe on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thine house. <hi>(2.)</hi> Repentance <hi>from Sin,</hi> Acts <hi>3.19.</hi> Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Are these things in Mans power to perform that God requires of him?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though they are our Duties, yet we have no power in our selves by Nature to perform them, but the power is of

God, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.5.</hi> Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Though God from Eternity decreed, and Christ long since purchased the Salvation of the Elect; yet have they no union with Christ, till they believe,</hi> Ephes. <hi>3.17.</hi> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love. <hi>Nor remission of Sin,</hi> Acts <hi>3.19.</hi> —That your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord; <hi>but lye under wrath as others do,</hi> Eph. <hi>2.3, 12.</hi> —And were by nature the children of wrath even as others. <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, having no hope, and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4</hi>: If it be God that can only work these Graces in us, to what purpose is our striving?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Gods working doth not exclude Mans striving, but more excites and obliges us to it,</hi> Phil. <hi>2.12, 13.</hi> —Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> To what purpose is it to strive in the use of means, except we knew we were elected?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The knowledge of our Election is not antecedent to our diligence, but our diligence is required antecedently to that knowledge, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.10.</hi> Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make your calling and election sure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>No, it is impossible to escape them,</hi> Iohn <hi>3.18.</hi> —He that believeth not, is condemned already. <hi>Heb. 2.3.</hi> How shall we escape it we neglect so great salvation.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41733:80"/>A. <hi>No, Sobriety and Reformation are Duties, but it's Faith and Regeneration that puts men into Christ, and out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> Matth. <hi>5.20.</hi> —Except your righteousness shall exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <hi>Titus 3.5.</hi> Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Do all believing and penitent Sinners escape Gods Wrath and Curse?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, they do, and shall for ever escape it,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.1.</hi> There is therefore now no condemnation to them, which are in Christ Iesus, <hi>&amp;c. Col. 1.12, 13.</hi> Giving thanks unto God the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. <hi>Joh. 5.24.</hi> —He that beareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death unto life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the first Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence it appears how false and dangerous the</hi> Antinomian <hi>Doctrine is, which teacheth that our Sins are pardoned before they are committed, or we either believe or repent, contrary to</hi> Acts <hi>26.18.</hi> To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them, which are sanctified by faith, that is, in me. <hi>James 5.20.</hi> —He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, <hi>&amp;c. Acts 10.43.</hi> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoseover believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence it follows that it is dangerous on the one side not to strive in all the wayes of Duty for Christ and Salvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to</hi> Luke <hi>13.24.</hi> Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. <hi>And as dangerous on the other side to rest in, and depend on our own Works and Duties.</hi> Phil. <hi>3.9.</hi> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law; but that which is through the faith of Christ: the righteousness which is of God by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the third Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the miserable stare of all unbelievers, and impenitent persons; the Curse and Wrath of God lyes upon them,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.10.</hi> For as many as are of the works of the

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the fourth Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the happy state into which Faith and Repentance brings the Souls of Men,</hi> Acts <hi>13.38, 39.</hi> —By him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> How doth the Spirit of God ordinarily produce Faith?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is the seat or habitation of Faith?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not only the Head or Understanding, but principally the Heart and Will,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.10.</hi> —With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, <hi>&amp;c. Acts 8.37.</hi> And Philip said, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest with all thine heart, thou mayest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But is not the assent of the understanding true Faith?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The meer assent of the Understanding to the Truths of Scripture, is not such a Faith as will save the Soul,</hi> Jam. <hi>2.19.</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:41733:81"/>
Thou believest that there is one God, thou doest well; the devils also believe and tremble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What's the act of Faith that justifies a Sinner?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis the receiving of Christ by the full and hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the heart that justifies us;</hi> Iohn <hi>1.12.</hi> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is the object of Faith?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The primary object of Faith is the Person of Christ, and the secondary are his benefits,</hi> Isa. <hi>45.22.</hi> Look unto me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Phil. 3.8, 9.</hi> Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ: the righteousness which is of God by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> May not a man look partly to Christ, and partly to his own Works and Duties for Righteousness?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, he must eye Christ only, and exclude all others, or he cannot be justified,</hi> Phil. <hi>3.9.</hi> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ: the righteouness which is of God by faith. <hi>Rom. 4.5.</hi> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Is it enough to eye the person of Christ only in believing?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, we must eye the Person of Christ, as cloathed with all his Offices,</hi> Acts <hi>16.31.</hi> And they said, believe on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thine house. <hi>Our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance needs him, as a</hi> Prophet, <hi>our guilt as a</hi> Priest, <hi>our sins and enemies as a</hi> King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Is true Faith exclusive of all fears and doubts?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it is not, but true Believers are troubled with many fears and doubtings,</hi> Isa. <hi>50.10.</hi> Who is he among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and hath no light, <hi>&amp;c. Mark 9.24.</hi> And straitway the father of the child cryed out with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Is no man actually justified till he believe?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, he cannot be justified actually till he believe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.22.</hi> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Iesus Christ might be given to them that believe. <hi>John 3.18.</hi> He that believeth on him, is not condemned:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41733:82"/>
but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the name of the only begotten son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Is every man that believes justified immediately and fully upon his believing?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, he is,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>John 5.24.</hi> —He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death unto life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the true character or description of a Believer?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He is one that having been convinced of his sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and of his own and all other Creatures inability to save him, and of the ability and willingness of Christ to save him, lets go all hold, and dependance on Creatures, and his own Righteousness, and casts himself entirely upon Christ for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Life.</hi>

               <hi>A.

               <p>A. <hi>No; there must be apprehension of Mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with God, or else no man can sincerely repent,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.4.</hi> —Not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>And this Mercy must be discerned in and through Christ,</hi> —Zech. <hi>12.10.</hi> —And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Wherein doth Repentance chiefly consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists in real inward sorrow for sin, as committed against God,</hi> Psal. <hi>51.3, 4.</hi> For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Wherein else doth it consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>In turning from sin as well as grieving for it,</hi> Isa. <hi>55.7.</hi> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Is turning from sin sufficient?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, that is but the negative part of Religion, there must be also a sincere turning to God,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.59.</hi> I thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Is all sorrow for sin saving?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, there is a Repentance that doth no good,</hi> Matth. <hi>27.3.</hi> Then Iudas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, there is, and they are therefore conjoyned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Acts <hi>5.31.</hi> —For to give repentance to Israel, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sins. <hi>And destruction threatned to the impenitent,</hi> Luk. <hi>13.3.</hi> —Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the first Inference hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it's a false Doctrine, which teaches us that sins are actually forgiven from Eternity, and therefore no need either of Repentance or Prayer, save only for the manifestation of Pardon.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>That an hard Heart is a dreadful sign of a lost state of Soul,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.5.</hi> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</p>

               <hi>Quest. 88. WHat are the outward means whereby Christ communicateth to us the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Redemption?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of Redemption, are his Ordinances, especially the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, all which are made effectual to the elect for Salvation.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The institution or appointment of God, is that alone which makes a Divine Ordinance,</hi> Matth. <hi>28.20.</hi> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Are the institutions of all Ordinances alike clear in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, some are more explicitly and clearly revealed in Scripture than others; as the Lords Supper more clear than Baptism, but whatever hath Scripture warrant in the words or consequence, is of divine appointment.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> May not men institute Ordinances of Divine Worship?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, this in Scripture is condemned as Will-worship,</hi> Col. <hi>2.20, 22, 23.</hi> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which things indeed have a shew of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in will-worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why cannot man institute a Divine Ordinance?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He cannot do it, because it's the prerogative belonging to Christs Kingly Office,</hi> Matth. <hi>28.20.</hi> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> For what other reason cannot man do it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because he cannot bless them, and make them effectual to their ends, but they will be in vain,</hi> Matth. <hi>15.9.</hi> But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Why are the Ordinances called means of Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because by and through them, the Spirit of the Lord conveys Spiritual Graces into Mens Souls, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1.21.</hi> —It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. <hi>1 Cor. 3.5.</hi> Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves: but our sufficiency is of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Whence is the vertue of Ordinances?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis not in and from themselves, or the gifts and abilities of him that administers them, but from the Blessing and Spirit of the Lord, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.7.</hi> —Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Do all Gods Ordinances attain their end?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, there is none of them in vain, but do attain their end, in the Salvation or Damnation of all that come under them,</hi> Isa. <hi>55.10, 11.</hi> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Are instituted Ordinances the only means of Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are not the only means; for God can convert Men to Christ without them,</hi> Acts <hi>9.4, 5.</hi> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, who art thou, Lord! and the Lord said, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest: It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. <hi>But they are the ordinary standing means,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.14, 15.</hi> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> To whom are the Ordinances made effectual to Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To all Gods elect they are effectual to Salvation, and to them only,</hi> Acts <hi>13.48.</hi> —As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed. <hi>John 10.26.</hi> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the first instruction from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That great preparation is due to all the Ordinances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we engage in them,</hi> Iob <hi>11.13, 14.</hi> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thy hand towards him. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; <hi>1 Chron. 29.18.</hi> —And prepare their heart unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That great Reverence is due to Gods Ordinances, when we are actually engaged in the use of them,</hi> Psal. <hi>89.7.</hi> God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints: and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the third Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That those people that want Ordinances, are in a sad and deplorable condition,</hi> Eph. <hi>2.11, 12.</hi> Wherefore remember that ye being in time passed Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands; that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the common-wealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That those that perish in the midst of Ordinances, and means of Salvation, will perish with aggravated perdition,</hi> Matth. <hi>11.23.</hi> And thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works, which have

            <p>
               <hi>A. The Spirit of God maketh the reading, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the preaching of the Word, an effectual means of convincing and converting sinners; and building them up in holiness and comfort, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>By the Word is meant the Word of God, consigned to writing in the Books of the Old and New Testament, which though it be ministred by men, yet it is no other than the very Word of God, and as such to be received, 1</hi> Thess. <hi>2.13.</hi> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men: but (as it is in truth) the word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whence is the efficacy of this Word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is wholly from the Spirit of God that it becomes effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to any mans Salvation, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3 6, 7.</hi> I have planted, and Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Is the reading of the Scripture an Ordinance of God for mens Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it is,</hi> Deut. <hi>17.19.</hi> And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes to do them. <hi>And in reading of it, God sometimes comes in by his Spirit to mens conversion,</hi> Acts <hi>8.27, 28, 29.</hi> And he arose and went, and behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Ierusalem for to worship, was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sitting in his chariot, read Isaias the prophet.

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it is,</hi> Isa. <hi>55.3.</hi> Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor. 1.21.</hi> —It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> To what end is the Word useful to men?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The first end and use of the Word is to convince men of their sin and misery out of Christ, 1</hi> Cor <hi>14.24, 25.</hi> But if all prophesie, and there come in one that believeth not, or one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.

               <p>A. <hi>'Tis useful for conversion, as well as conviction,</hi> Psal. <hi>19.7.</hi> The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul, <hi>&amp;c. Acts 26.18.</hi> —To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>&amp;c</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Doth the Word convince and convert all that hear it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, but those only that are ordained to Eternal Life,</hi> Acts <hi>13.48.</hi> —As many as were ordained to eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What else is the Word useful for?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To build up the Saints to perfection in Christ,</hi> Eph. <hi>4.11, 12, 13.</hi> And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastours and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man; unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the stature of the fulness in Christ. <hi>Acts 20.32.</hi> And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> May the common people read the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, 'tis a duty commanded by Christ,</hi> Ioh. <hi>5.39.</hi> Search the scriptures, <hi>&amp;c. and commended by the Apostle,</hi> Acts <hi>17.11.</hi> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dayly, whether those things were so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Is it their duty or liberty also to preach it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it is not, for besides abilities for that work, there must be a call,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.14, 15.</hi> — How shall they hear without a preacher, and how shall they preach except they be sent? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That sad is their condition, who sit all their dayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word to no purpose at all, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>4.3, 4.</hi> If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine into them.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>It consists in serious consideration of the greatness and holiness of that God, whom we approach in hearing the Word,</hi> Acts <hi>10.33.</hi> —Now therefore we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. <hi>And awing the heart even to a degree of holy trembling thereby,</hi> Isa. <hi>66.2.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The Word is in its own nature an heart-searching Word,</hi> Heb. <hi>4.12.</hi> For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <hi>And that eventually 'twill be the savour of Life or Death to us, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>2.16.</hi> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Longing after the Word for further communications of Grace by it, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>2.2.</hi> As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. <hi>Isa. 2.3.</hi> And many people shall go and say, come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Iacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What's the second antecedent duty of hearing?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Prayer is an</hi> antecedent <hi>duty to hearing the Word, and that both for the assistance of the Minister, 2</hi> Thess. <hi>3.1.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: <hi>And our own illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.18.</hi> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What else should we pray for?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God would pour out his Spirit with the Word ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that promise,</hi> Prov. <hi>1.23.</hi> —I will pour out my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Doth unpreparedness for the Word alwayes hinder its efficacy on the heart?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, God sometimes is found of them that sought him not,</hi> Isa. <hi>65.1.</hi> —I was found of them that sought me not, <hi>&amp;c. But it is a sin to neglect it, and needs a pardon of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What's the first motive to prepare for solemn duties?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:41733:87"/>A. <hi>That it argues the sincerity of the heart, and in that case God will be merciful to infirmities, 2</hi> Chron. <hi>30.18, 19.</hi> For a multitude of the people, even a multitude of Ephraim and Manasseth, Issachar and Zebulu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the second motive?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis a sweet sign that God will make that duty successful for which the heart is prepared,</hi> Psal. <hi>10.17.</hi> —Thou preparest their heart: thou bendest thine ear to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the third motive to preparation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The majesty and jealousie of God, to whom we approach, obliges us to solemn preparation,</hi> Heb. <hi>12.28, 29.</hi> —Whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a consuming fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> But must a man neglect the duty if his heart be not duly prepared for it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, for that would be to add a new sin to a former, and aggravate it the more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> In what manner must the prepared heart go to the word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not in dependance on its own preparations, but upon the Spirits assistance,</hi> Psal. <hi>71.16.</hi> I will go forward in the strength of the Lord God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> What's the first act of Faith due to the Word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The assenting act of Faith is required to the Word read or preached, whereby we acknowledge it to be of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, 2</hi> Tim. <hi>3.16.</hi> And without controversie, great is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. <hi>2 Pet. 1.21.</hi> For the prophesie came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> What's the second act of Faith required of us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>An applying act of Faith is also required of us,</hi> Rom. <hi>15.4.</hi> For whatsoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, that we through patience and com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> What's the first end in applying the Word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is first to be applyed to our conviction both of sin and misery,</hi> Acts <hi>2.37.</hi> Now when they heard this, they were
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41733:88"/>
pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> What's the second end, or use of applying it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It must be applyed for our guidance and direction to Christ,</hi> Iohn <hi>6.4, 5.</hi> —Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, cometh unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> What's the third use to which it must be applyed?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We must apply it for our direction through the whole course of Christian Duties, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.19.</hi> We have also a more sure word of prophesie; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> What other use must we apply it to?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It must be applyed for our comfort in all inward and outward troubles,</hi> Rom. <hi>15.4.</hi> For whatsoever things were written afore time, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> On what account are we to receive it with love?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We are to love it for its Authors sake, because it's the Word of God,</hi> Psalm <hi>119.159.</hi> Consider how I love thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> What's the second motive of love to the Word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The holiness and purity of it deserves and engages our love to it,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.140.</hi> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> What's the third motive to engage our love to it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The great and constant usefulness of it to our Souls, as that we cannot subsist without,</hi> Iob <hi>23.12.</hi> —I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 24.</hi> How doth this love to the Word manifest it self?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our love manifests it self in our longing after it,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.20.</hi> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all times. <hi>Our diligent attendance on it,</hi> Acts <hi>10.33.</hi> Immediately therefore I sent unto thee, and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> How is Faith and Love evidenced to the Word after hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By preserving it carefully in our hearts and memories,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.11.</hi> Thy word have I hid in my heart: that I might not sin against thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 26.</hi> What's the best cure for a bad memory?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:41733:88"/>A. <hi>Labour to get an high esteem of it, and an experimental feeling of it, and frequently meditate on it,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.16.</hi> I will delight my self in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word, <hi>Psal. 119.93.</hi> I will never forget thy precepts; for with them thou hast quickened me, <hi>Psal. 119.99.</hi> —Thy testimonies are my meditation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 26.</hi> How is Faith and Love principally manifested to the word after hearing?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis principally manifested by bringing forth the fruits of it in our lives,</hi> Col. <hi>1.5, 6.</hi> For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye bear a of it, and knew the grace of God in truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 28.</hi> What's the use of all this?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>This serves to reprove our formal and dead hearing the Word, and excites us all to evidence and exercise more Faith, Love and Obedience in hearing it.</hi>

               <hi>Quest. 91. HOw do the Sacraments become effectual means of Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. The Sacraments become effectual means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not from any vertue in them, or in him that doth administer them, but only by the blessing of Christ, and the working of his Spirit in them, that by Faith receive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="questions">
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What's the first proper sense of this word Sacrament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It primarily signifies a solemn Oath taken by Souldiers when they List themselves under a Prince or General; and this Oath was mutual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Why do we use it seeing it is not a Scripture word?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though the Word be not found in Scripture, yet the thing intended by it is, and that brings the word in use, for in the Sacraments God obliges himself to us by confirming his Covenant by it,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.11.</hi> And he received the sign of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they be not circumcised, that righteousness might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them also. <hi>And we oblige our selves to God,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.3, 4.</hi> Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ, were baptized into his death?

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What is here meant by Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By Salvation is meant our compleat and final deliverance from sin and misery, both temporal and eternal. From sin,</hi> Matth. <hi>1.21.</hi> —For he shall save his people from their sins. <hi>From misery, 1</hi> Thess. <hi>1.10.</hi> —Even Iesus which delivereth us from the wrath to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is a mean of Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>A mean of Salvation signifies any appointment of God, whereby he promotes and accomplishes his design of saving our Souls, so the word is a mean,</hi> Rom. <hi>1.16.</hi> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to every one that believeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How doth the Word and Sacraments differ as means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Word is appointed to be the first means of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith; 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.5.</hi> Who then is Paul? or who is Apollo? but ministers by whom ye believed, <hi>&amp;c. Sacraments are to seal and confirm it,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.11.</hi> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What is meant by an effectual mean of Salvation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By an effectual mean, is meant such a mean as fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and accomplishes the end it was appointed for, 1</hi> Thess. <hi>2.13.</hi> —Because when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men; but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Don't all the means of Salvation prove effectual to men?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Though the means of Salvation prove effectual to all Gods Elect, yet they are so to no others,</hi> Acts <hi>28.23, 24.</hi> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them concerning Iesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets from morning till evening. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Do not the Sacraments save all that partake of them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, they do not; Baptism may pass on a cast-away,</hi> Acts <hi>8.23.</hi> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. <hi>And the Lords Supper may be received unworthily, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.27.</hi> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What's the reason they prove not effectual to all?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because their vertue and efficacy is not in themselves, but in God; for we see they work as Gods Spirit concurs, or not concurs with them, as in the instance before given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But is not that for want of wisdom, holiness or zeal in the Minister, that they have no more efficacy?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it is not principally, or only from thence; for it's not in the power of the holiest Minister in the World to make them effectual, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.7.</hi> —Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Whence is it that Sacraments become effectual?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis only from the Spirit of Christ working in them, and by them, on the souls of men, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>12.13.</hi> For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, —and have been all made to drink into one spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the first Instruction hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That men enjoying all the Ordinances of the Gospel, and partaking of the Sacraments annexed to the Covenant of Grace, may yet perish for ever, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.3, 4, 5.</hi> And did all eat the same spiritual meat: and did all drink the same spiritual drink: (for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was Christ) but with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <hi>Luke 13.26, 27.</hi> Then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten, and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That men should not idolize some Ministers for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their gifts, and despise others, seeing 'tis not in them to make the means effectual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What's the last Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That in all our attendance upon the means of Salvation, we should be careful to beg the Spirit and Blessing of Christ, without which they cannot be effectual to our Salvation.</hi>

            <p>

               <p>A. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ as King of the Church, by whose sole authority Baptism was instituted,</hi> Matth. <hi>28.19, 20.</hi> Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you, <hi>&amp;c. And the Lords Supper, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.23, 24.</hi> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Iesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: This do in remembrance of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Are the old Sacraments yet in being and use in the Church?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, they are past away, and the new come in their room. Baptism takes place of Circumcision,</hi> Col. <hi>2.11, 12.</hi> In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of Christ: buried with him in baptism, <hi>&amp;c. And the Lords Supper of the Passover, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.7.</hi> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened, for even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Of what parts doth every Sacrament consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Every Sacrament consists of two parts, one external and earthly; another internal and Heavenly, or Spiritual. Bread, Wine and Water, are the external, Christs Blood and Spirit the internal parts,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.3.</hi> Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Iesus Christ were baptized into his death? <hi>1 Cor. 11.25.</hi> —This cup is the new testament in my blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Wherein consists the Sacramental union of these parts?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists by vertue of Christs institution in three things, (1.) In apt</hi> signification. <hi>(2.) Firm</hi> obsignation. <hi>And (3.) Real</hi> exhibition <hi>of the Blessings signified and seald.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What are the Blessings signified by Water in Baptism?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It signifies our implantation into Christ, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in his Death and Resurrection,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.4.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life. <hi>And our solemn admission into the visible Church,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.26, 27, 28, 29.</hi> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Iew, nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Iesus. And if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What are the Blessings signified by Bread and Wine?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They signifie Christs Body and Blood, broken and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for us, with all the Blessings of Remission, Peace and Salvation purchased by his Blood, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.16, 17.</hi> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the bloud of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? for we being many, are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Do the Sacraments seal, as well as signifie these things?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, they do,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.11.</hi> And he received the sign of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, <hi>&amp;c. Their use is to confirm Gods Covenant with Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Who are the proper subjects of the Sacraments?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Believers and their Seed are the subjects of Baptism, but adult Christians only of the Lords Supper,</hi> Acts <hi>2.38, 39.</hi> —Repent and be baptized every one of you, —for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. <hi>1 Cor. 11.28.</hi> But let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the main use and end of Sacraments?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is to ratifie and confirm Gods Covenant with Believers,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.21.</hi> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the saith, that he had yet being uncircumcised, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor. 11.26.</hi> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What's the first Instruction from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the abuse of such holy and solemn mysteries, is a sin of dreadful aggravation, and such as God will punish, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.27.</hi> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Instruction?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Hence we learn the tender care and love of Christ over the Church in instituting such useful and comfortable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for us.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What is their Sacrament of Confirmation?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is the anointing of the Baptized with Chrism in the Forehead, with this Form of Words,</hi> I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and confirm thee with the Chrism of Salvation, in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What's their ground for this practice?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What's their Sacrament of Penance?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is Repentance manifested by outward signs, to which the word of Absolution coming, makes it a Sacrament mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded on,</hi> Iohn <hi>20.23.</hi> Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>It is Marriage, grounded upon those words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> Eph. <hi>5.32.</hi> This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Which only shews a similitude of our union with Christ, not an instituted sign to that end.</p>

               <hi>A.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What doth Water in Baptism signifie?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It signifies the Blood of Christ,</hi> Rev. <hi>1.5.</hi> —Vnto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What's the first resemblance it hath to Christs Blood?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>In the freeness of it to all, it represents the unpurchased Blood of Christ,</hi> Isa. <hi>55.1.</hi> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What's the second resemblance to Christs Blood?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It resembles it in its refreshing quality; Water refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thirsty; so doth Christs Blood,</hi> Iohn <hi>6.35.</hi> —He that believeth on me, shall never thirst.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What's the third resemblance it hath to Christs Blood?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q 6.</hi> What's the fourth resemblance it hath to Christs Blood?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It resembles it in the necessity of it; for as the Body cannot live without Water, so neither can the Soul without Christs Blood,</hi> Heb. <hi>9.23.</hi> It was therefore necessary, that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with bitter sacrifices than these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What's the fifth resemblance of Water to the Blood of Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>As Water neither refreshes, nor purifies the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out application; so neither doth Christs Blood refresh or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Soul till applyed, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1.30.</hi> But of him are ye in

               <p>A. <hi>The word</hi> [Baptize] <hi>signifying as well to wash, as to plunge: A person may be truly Baptized that is not plunged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And we cannot think by the circumstances of time and place, that the</hi> Iaylor <hi>in the night was carryed to a River out of the City,</hi> Acts <hi>16.33.</hi> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he, and all his, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The word signifies many waters (that is) springs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there, which are known by Travellers to be small, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of plunging into.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What are the benefits accruing to us by Baptism?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The benefits are twofold; some external, called the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Olive-tree,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Ordinances and visible Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> Rom. <hi>11.17.</hi> —And thou being a wild olive-tree, were grafted in amongst them, and with them, partakest of the root and fatness of the olive-tree. <hi>And some spiritual and saving, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>3.21.</hi> The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God) by the resurrection of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What engagements are said on the Baptized?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are engaged to be the Lords people and walk suitable to that engagement,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.4.</hi> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Is Baptism to be reiterated as the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; for the Lords Supper is a Sacrament for nourishing, but this for implantation</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom <hi>6.4, 5.</hi> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> Doth Baptism regenerate men, and confer saving Grace?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it doth not in its own vertue convey Grace, no more than the Lords Supper; but the Spirit of God is the

                  </gap>old to infer their priviledge under the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it was not; for God never did, nor will become a God by way of special interest to any people, by vertue of the Covenant of Works, since the breach of it by the fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> But if it were the Covenant of Grace, how doth it appear the right of Believers Infants is still the same it was before in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It appears plainly from the Apostles own words and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> Acts <hi>2.39.</hi> For the promise is to you, and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But though Infants then were members of Gods visible Church among the Iews, how doth it appear they are so now when God hath vast them off?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It appears the membership and priviledges are as sure and ample to them now, that are the Children of</hi> Gentile-believers, <hi>as ever they were to the</hi> Iewish <hi>Infants,</hi> Rom. <hi>11.17.</hi> And if some of the branches be broken off, and then being a wild

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> How else doth it appear they are within the Covenant?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It appears by this, that they are pronounced holy, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>7.14.</hi> —Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy. <hi>Which is a</hi> foederal holiness; <hi>and none out of Covenant can be holy by Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But may not that place mean only their legitimacy?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it cannot; for then the Apostle must pronounce all the Infants in the World</hi> bastards, <hi>that descend not at least from one believing Parent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> But Infants are not capable to Covenant with God, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Covenant Duties, and therefore why should they be admitted to Covenant Priviledges?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>A Child now of eight dayes old is as capable of being admitted into Covenant with God, as Children of the same age were in</hi> Abrahams <hi>dayes; and then it's manifest they were admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Though they were admitted by Circumcision then, will it follow they may be so by Baptism now, seeing that Ordinance is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it will; for though Circumcision cease, yet Baptism is come into its place,</hi> Col. <hi>2.10, 11, 12.</hi> And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power. In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But Circumcision was a Seal of the Covenant of Works, and the argument will not hold from a Seal of the Covenant of Works, to a Seal of the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Circumcision never was, nor was intended to be a Seal of the Covenant of Works, but of the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> Rom. <hi>4.11.</hi> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had, yet being uncircumcised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But have we no express command in the New Testament to baptize Infants?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There needed no new command; their priviledge had been setled many ages before upon them, and never reversed by Christ, or his Apostles, but their former right declared to continue still to them,</hi> Acts <hi>2.39.</hi> For the promise is to you and your children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But if they have a right, we might expect to find some examples of their baptizing?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis manifest that Believers housholds were baptized with them,</hi> Acts <hi>16.15, 33.</hi> And when she was baptized, and her houshold, <hi>&amp;c. Ver. 33.</hi> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he, and all his straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>And if Infants are not named, so neither are any of Age, born of Christian Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> But many trust to their Infant-baptism, as to their Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and so much mischief's done?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They do so; yet the Duty is not therefore to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. The preaching of Christ is to some a stumbling block, yet Christ must be preached for all that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> But many baptized Infants prove naught?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>And so do many baptized at Age too. Duties are not to be measured by events.</hi>

               <hi>Quest. 96. WHat is the Lords Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. The Lords Supper is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein by giving and receiving Bread and Wine according to Christs appointment, his Death is shewed forth; and the worthy receivers are, not after a corporal and carnal manner, but by Faith made partakers of his Body and Blood, with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to their spiritual nourishment, and growth in Grace.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>By the soveraign authority of Christ the King of the Church, and not by the pleasure of man, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.23.</hi> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Iesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Of what parts doth this Sacrament consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists of two parts, one earthly and visible; to wit, Bread and Wine, the other spiritual and invisible, the Body and Blood of Christ, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.16.</hi> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> How do these earthly and heavenly things become a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:41733:94"/>A. <hi>By the word of institution and blessing coming from Christ upon them, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.23, 24, 25.</hi> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Iesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he brake it; and said, Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> When did Christ ordain and institute this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>He instituted it in the same night he was betrayed, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.23.</hi> —The Lord Iesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. <hi>It could not be sooner, because the Passover must be first celebrated, and by the institution of this abrogated. Nor later, for soon after he was apprehended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What doth the time of its institution teach us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It teacheth us how great Christs care and love to his people is, that he makes in his Ordinance such provision for our comfort, though he knew his own bitter agony was just at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What is the general use and end of this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is to confirm, seal and ratifie the New Covenant to Believers, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.35.</hi> —This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What are the particular ends and uses of it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The first particular end and use of it is, to bring Christ and his Sufferings afresh to our remembrance, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.24, 25.</hi> —This do in remembrance of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What kind of remembrance of Christ is here intended?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not a meer speculative, but an affectionate heart-melting remembrance of him, like that of</hi> Peter, Matth. <hi>26.75.</hi> And Peter remembred the words of Iesus which said unto him, before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly. <hi>Or of</hi> Ioseph, Gen. <hi>43.29, 30.</hi> —And Ioseph made haste: for his bowels did yern upon his brother, and he sought where to weep, and he entred into his chamber, and wept there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What doth this end of the Sacrament imply?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It implyes this, that the best of Gods people are too apt to forget Christ, and what he hath endured and suffered for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What else doth it imply?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It implies this, that none but those that have the saving knowledge of Christ, and have had former acquaintance with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41733:95"/>
Christ, are fit for this Ordinance; for no man can remember what he never knew, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.28.</hi> But let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What's the second particular use and end of this Sacrament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is to represent Christ to Believers, as an apt sign of him, and of his Death; and that both</hi> memorative, significative, <hi>and</hi> instructive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> How is it a memorative sign of Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It brings Christ to our remembrance, as his Death and bitter Sufferings are therein represented to us, by the breaking of Bread, and pouring forth of Wine, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.26.</hi> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew forth the Lords death till he come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> How is it a significative Ordinance?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is a significative Ordinance, not only as it represents Christs sufferings, but the Believers union with him as the head, and with each other as members of his body, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.61, 17.</hi> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many, are one bread, and one body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> In what respect is it an instructive sign?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It is an instructive sign in divers respects; namely, First, As it teaches us that Christ is the only nutritive bread by which our Souls live,</hi> Iohn <hi>6.51.</hi> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world. <hi>And Secondly, As it instructs us that the New Testament is now in its full force by the death of Christ the Testator</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb. <hi>9.16, 17.</hi> For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no force at all, whilst the testator liveth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much of the Author, Nature and Ends of the Lords Supper.</hi>

               <p>Q. 1. <hi>ARe not Bread and Wine too small and common things to represent the body and blood of Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though a bit of Bread, and a draught of Wine, be things of small value in themselves, yet they are great in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their use and end. A penny-worth of Wax is a small
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41733:95"/>
thing in its self; but being applyed to the Label of a Deed, may be advanced to the worth of thousands of pounds, as it receives the seal to a great inheritance.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Is not the bread in the Sacrament turned into the very body of Christ it self by</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it is not; but the Elements retain still their own proper Nature of Bread and Wine after the words of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and are so called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 26.29. <hi>But I say unto you, I will not henceforth drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>What is the first argument by which Protestants confute the Popish Doctrine of</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The first Argument against it, is taken from the end of the Sacrament, which is to bring Christs Body and Blood to our remembrance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. —<hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> Now signs for remembrance are of things absent, not present.</p>
               <p>Q. 4. <hi>What's the second Argument?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the language in which our Saviour spake, had no other property of expression, there being no other word for <hi>signifie</hi> but <hi>is,</hi> in stead thereof, as is manifest in both Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.27. <hi>And the seven ill-favoured kine that came up after them, are seven years of famine.</hi> Rev. 1.20. —<hi>The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>What's the third Argument against</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The manifold gross absurdities that naturally and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow on this Doctrine, shew the falseness of it, and that it is justly rejected and abhorred by all sound Christians.</p>
               <p>Q. 6. <hi>What's the first absurdity that follows it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This Doctrine allows that to a silly <hi>Priest,</hi> which is not to be allowed to all the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven. It allows him power to make his Maker, and eat his God. And in justifying this by the Omnipotency of God, they say no more than what a <hi>Turk</hi> may say to justifie the most ridiculous fooleries of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 7. <hi>What's the second absurdity of</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The second absurdity is this, that it denies the truth of the testimony given by the senses of all men, that it is real Bread and real Wine after Consecration, and not Flesh and Blood. And if the testimony of sense be not certain, then the being of God cannot be proved by the things that are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41733:96"/>
made, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead,</hi> &amp;c. Nor the truth of Christs Resurrection, by seeing and feeling, contrary to <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my self; handle me and see,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. <hi>What's the third absurdity of</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The third absurdity is this, that in affirming the accidents of Bread and Wine to remain, and their substance to vanish, they affirm that there is length, breadth, thickness, moisture and sweetness, and yet nothing long, broad, thick, moist or sweet, which is a perfect contradiction.</p>
               <p>Q. 9. <hi>What's the fourth absurdity of</hi> Transubstantiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It implies that the entire living body of Christ sate at the Table, and at the same time was dead, and in the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouths and stomachs in the first Sacrament; and that in all after Sacraments it is wholly in Heaven, and wholly in as many thousand places in the World, as there are Sacraments administred.</p>
               <p>Q. 10. <hi>What doth the breaking of this bread, and pouring out of wine in the Sacrament signifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It signifies the violent painful death, and bitter sufferings of Christ for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 11. <hi>What doth the giving and taking of the Sacramental bread and wine signifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> These actions signifie Gods exhibiting, and the Believers applying of Christ and all his benefits to their Souls.</p>
               <p>Q. 12. <hi>Who are fit subjects to receive the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> None that are grosly ignorant, scandalous, or unbelievers in their Natural state, for such cannot examine themselves as the Word requires, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>But let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> But do eat and drink Judgment to themselves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 13. <hi>Are morally honest and sober persons qualified for this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What are the Duties of worthy receivers?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There are three sorts of Duties incumbent on them, some</hi> antecedent <hi>to it, some</hi> concomitants <hi>of it, and some</hi> subsequent <hi>to it</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What are the antecedent Duties to it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are two, (1.) Examination of their Graces. (2.) Preparation of their Souls. Examination of their Graces. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.28, 29.</hi> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body. <hi>And preparation of their Souls, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.8.</hi> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What's the first Grace to be tryed?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our saving knowledge of God in Christ, without which we cannot discern the Lords Body, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.29.</hi> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What are we to enquire of touching our knowledge of God in Christ?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We are to examine whether it be competent for</hi> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, <hi>and savingly operative and influential on the Heart and Life for</hi> quality, Hos. <hi>4.6.</hi> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor. 13.1.</hi> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as a sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brass or tinkling cymbal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:41733:97"/>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> When is knowledge competent and influential?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>When we truly understand by the teachings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the sin and misery of the Fall, the nature and necessity of Christ, and under these convictions come to him in the way of Faith,</hi> Iohn <hi>6.45.</hi> —Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. <hi>And subject our selves to him in sincere obedience,</hi> Matth. <hi>11.28, 29.</hi> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What are we to examine our selves about besides knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We are obliged to examine our selves about our Faith, whether we have it in any saving degree, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>13.5.</hi> Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your selves, whether ye be in the faith: prove your selves, <hi>&amp;c. For without Faith we cannot please God,</hi> Heb. <hi>11.6.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>&amp;c. Nor enjoy Spiritual Communion with Christ,</hi> Eph. <hi>3.17.</hi> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What other Grace must be examined and sought for?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We must examine our Love to Christ and all that are his, because no gifts signifie any thing without Love, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13.2.</hi> And though I have the gift of prophesie, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What else must worthy receivers examine themselves about?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The sincerity of their hearts evidenced by their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without which they cannot worthily approach the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.8.</hi> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> But if upon examination we are in doubts about our Faith and Sincerity, must we forbear?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>If our doubts arise from the weakness, and not the total want of Grace, such doubts should not hinder us,</hi> Rom. <hi>14.1.</hi> Him that is weak in the faith receive you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is the danger of coming to the Lords Table without these Graces?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The danger is exceeding great to Soul and Body. (1.) To the Soul, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.29.</hi> For he that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, <hi>&amp;c. And to the Body, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.30.</hi> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What are the Duties of worthy receivers at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Their Duties at the Table are to discern Christ by the eye of Faith, under those signs of his Body and Blood, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.29.</hi> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body. <hi>On the discovery of him to mourn bitterly for sin,</hi> Zech. <hi>12.10.</hi> —And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. <hi>And to excite all their Graces into vigorous acts for the applying Christ to themselves,</hi> Cant. <hi>4.16.</hi> Awake, O north wind, and come thou south, blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the Duty of worthy receivers after the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Their Duty is heartily to bless God for Christ, and the benefits of his Blood,</hi> Matth. <hi>26.30.</hi> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. <hi>To double their care and watchfulness against sin,</hi> Ephes. <hi>4.30.</hi> And grieve not the holy spirit, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption. <hi>And to grow more fruitful in all spiritual obedience,</hi> Col. <hi>1.10.</hi> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the abuse and profanation of this Ordinance, either by coming to it for carnal ends, or being forced upon it by fear of sufferings, or approaching to it without due qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a dreadful sin, which God will terribly avenge,</hi> Matth. <hi>22.11, 12, 13.</hi> And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man, which had not on a wedding garment. And he saith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? and he was speechless. Then said the king unto the servants, bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What's the second Inference from it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That great and manifold are the blessings and advantages, which Christians duly prepared may reap by this Ordinance.</hi>

               <hi>Quest. 98. WHat is Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Prayer is an offering up of our desires unto God for things agreeable to his Will,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41733:98"/>
in the name of Christ, with confession of our sins and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> Who is the proper and only object of Prayer?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>God only is the proper object of Prayer; it is a part of his Natural Worship: therefore 'tis peculiarly his Honour and Prerogative, and none else can hear and answer them, but God,</hi> Psal. <hi>65.2.</hi> O thou that bearest Prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Through whom, or in whose name are our Prayers to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our Prayers are to be directed to God only through Christ, and his Name, and not by the mediation of Angels or Saints,</hi> Col. <hi>2.18.</hi> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary humility, and worshiping of angels. <hi>For the merit and satisfaction of Christ alone give success and acceptance to our Prayers,</hi> Rev. <hi>8.3, 4.</hi> And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before God out of the angels hand. <hi>1 Tim. 2.5.</hi> For there is one God, and one mediatour between God and men, the man Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What's the first property or quality of acceptable Prayer?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No Prayer can be acceptable to God, except the matter of it be agreeable to his Will,</hi> Iam. <hi>4.3.</hi> Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. <hi>1 Joh. 5.14, 15.</hi> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he beareth us. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Is it enough to make Prayer acceptable, that the matter is agreeable to Gods will?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, it is not; for the manner as well as the matter, must be so too,</hi> Psal. <hi>66.18.</hi> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What's the first qualification of an acceptable Prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the manner of it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it be sincere, and flowing from the heart of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate person,</hi> Prov. <hi>15.29.</hi> The Lord is far from the wicked; but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. <hi>Jer. 29.13.</hi> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What's the second qualification of Prayer, respecting the manner?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It must be performed in the heart of a Child of God by the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Gal. <hi>4.6.</hi> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son in our hearts: crying, Abba, Father. <hi>Rom. 8.26.</hi> Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What's the third qualification of an acceptable Prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the manner?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It must be servent and importunate, not cold and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> Iam. <hi>5.16.</hi> —The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. <hi>Matth. 7.7.</hi> Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Wherein doth true importunity with God in Prayer consist?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not in the multitude of words,</hi> Matth. <hi>6.7.</hi> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do: for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking. <hi>But in an holy earnestness of Spirit to be heard,</hi> Psal <hi>143.7.</hi> Hear me speedily, O Lord, my spirit faileth; hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. <hi>A prudent choice of prevalent Arguments,</hi> Iob <hi>23.4.</hi> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. <hi>And a resolute persistance in our requests till they be granted</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isa. <hi>62.7.</hi> And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Ierusalem a praise in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Do not Prayers thus qualified sometimes miscarry?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>God may delay and suspend the answer of them for a time,</hi> Psal. <hi>22. 2.</hi> O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> not, <hi>&amp;c. But sooner or latter, God will alwayes answer them, either in the very thing we ask, 1</hi> Iohn <hi>5.15.</hi> —We know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. <hi>Or in that which is equivalent or better,</hi> Gen. <hi>17.18, 19.</hi> And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee. And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed, and thou shalt-call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Is there no Prayer but what is stated and fixed?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, there is sudden occasional Prayer, which we call ejaculatory: Such was</hi> Iacobs, Gen. <hi>49.18.</hi> I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord. <hi>And this is exceeding useful to maintain constant communion with God, and keep the heart in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Is all stated and fixed Prayer publick in the Congregation or Church?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, stated Prayer ought to be in our Families with those under our charge; and in our Closets betwixt God and us alone,</hi> Iosh. <hi>24.15.</hi> —But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. <hi>And</hi> Matth. <hi>6.6.</hi> But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What infer you from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The restraint of Prayer is not only a great fin, but an ill sign of a graceless heart.</hi> Iob <hi>15.4.</hi> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. <hi>And that which entails a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and curse upon men, and their Families,</hi> Ier. <hi>10.25.</hi> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not; and upon the families that call not upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Inference from the Ordinance of Prayer?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the true reason why we enjoy not the Mercies we pray for, is not because God is unwilling to grant Mercies, but because we either neglect Prayer, or miscarry in the manner of Prayer,</hi> Jam. <hi>4.2, 3</hi> Ye lust, and have not; ye kill and desire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have not; because y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hence we are informed how necessary it is to acquaint our selves with the mind of God, revealed in his Word, that we may guide our selves in Prayer, both for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereby, and not utter to God words without knowledge.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> That it is a dreadful infatuation and spiritual judgment upon those men, that think they glorifie God in doing those things, which his Soul hateth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my names sake, said,</hi> let the Lord be glorified: <hi>but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.2. <hi>They shall put you out of the Synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think, that he doth God service.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it should be indifferent to a Christian what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God puts him into, so that he may but be useful to Sanctifie and exalt the name of God therein, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. — <hi>as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That it's an high and dreadful provocation of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and abuse his worship, whereon his Name is called, and wherein it is to be Sanctified, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. <hi>And Nadab and Abihu, the Sons of Araon, took either of them his Censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.

               <p>A. <hi>The</hi> Gospel <hi>is here intended by the Kingdom of God,</hi> Matth. <hi>13.47.</hi> —Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:41733:104"/>A. <hi>It signifies the removal of all impediments, that hinder its propagation in the world, 2</hi> Thess. <hi>3.1.</hi> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, even as it is with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Who, and what hinders the propagation of it?</p>
               <p>A. Antichrist <hi>that man of sin hinders it</hi> externally, <hi>2 Thess. 2.4.</hi> Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God, sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. <hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>and Mens</hi> Lusts internally, <hi>1 Thess. 2.18.</hi> Wherefore we would have come unto you (even I Paul) once and again; but Satan hindered. <hi>Luke 19.14.</hi> But his citizens hated him, and sent a messenger after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What then is the desire of all good men with respect to the coming of the Gospel-Kingdom?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That all Nations may be brought to Christ by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and so Christs Kingdom be greatly exalted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,</hi> Isa. <hi>2.2.</hi> And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills: and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What's the second thing here meant by the Kingdom of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It signifies and intends the work of saving Grace wrought in Mens Souls,</hi> Luke <hi>17.21.</hi> —Behold the kingdom of God is within you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Why is this work of Grace called the Kingdom of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because wherever saving Grace comes, it subdues the Soul to Christs Sceptre, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>10.5.</hi> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Wherein consists the Kingdom of Grace?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It consists not in external Rites and Observances, but in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. <hi>14.17.</hi> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Herein we desire not only our own personal progressive Sanctification, but the Sanctification of others all the World over,</hi> Acts <hi>26.29.</hi> And Paul said, I would to God, that not only

               <p>A. <hi>By it is here meant the future state of Glory and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.50.</hi> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Why is the Heavenly state called the Kingdom of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>This is called the Kingdom of God, because in that state God reigns over his people gloriously, there being no rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them in the least degree,</hi> Luke <hi>20.36.</hi> —For they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What do we desire in Prayer for the coming of this Kingdom?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We desire not only our</hi> preservation <hi>in our passage to that state of Glory, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>5.10.</hi> But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Christ Iesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. <hi>But the</hi> hastening <hi>of it to our selves and others,</hi> Rev. <hi>22.20.</hi> —Amen, even so, come, Lord Iesus.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That the Gospel is an invaluable Mercy, as it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of bringing us into Christs Gracious and Glorious Kingdom,</hi> Asts <hi>26.18.</hi> To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith, that is in me.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What's the second Inference from hence?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> How do these perform the Will of Gods Providence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>(1.) The Heavenly bodies do it evenly, constantly and unweariedly,</hi> Psal. <hi>104.19.</hi> He appointeth the moon for seasons, the sun knoweth his going down. <hi>(2.) The Angels do speedily, voluntarily, chearfully, and so knowingly,</hi> Psal. <hi>103.21.</hi> Ye ministers of his that do his pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Must we be agents in this Providential Will?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, we must,</hi> Acts <hi>13.36.</hi> For David after he had served his generation by the will of God, fell on sleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> How must we do it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By imploying our abilities, faculties and interests, in the Duties of our particular Callings, and by moving constantly, prudently and vigorously in our own sphere, and so imitate those in Heaven.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Why do we pray that Gods Will of Providence may be done by us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because we are his Creatures, and the most noble instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the inferiour World; and therefore we should be willing to be acted by him, and active for him; and because this Will of Providence is alwayes just, good and true, and for his own Glory,</hi> Psal. <hi>145.17.</hi> The Lord is righteous in all

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What other Will of God is here meant?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Will of his Precepts; and this is chiefly intended.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> And how is this Will of God done in Heaven?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>By the Angels 'tis done universally, chearfully, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, humbly, thankfully, loyally, readily,</hi> Psal. <hi>103.20.</hi> Bless the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength, that do his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. <hi>And so 'tis done by the Saints in Heaven,</hi> Rev. <hi>7.15.</hi> Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple. <hi>And 22.3.</hi> And his servants shall serve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Do we pray then that we may thus do the Will of God?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes; for though we cannot perfectly without sin do it, yet that is our Duty,</hi> Matth. <hi>5.</hi> ult. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect. <hi>And in all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars we may, and we must imitate them herein,</hi> Psal. <hi>119.6.</hi> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> I have rejoyced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. <hi>Ver. 60.</hi> I made has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> How must we know Gods Will?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not notionally and rationally only, but spiritually also, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.14.</hi> They are spiritually discerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Why is knowing Gods will placed here before doing it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because the Understanding is the leading Faculty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which 'tis impossible there should be any Obedience,</hi> Prov. <hi>19.2.</hi> Also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good. <hi>Jer. 5.4.</hi> Therefore I said, surely these are poor, they are foolish: for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> Why pray we to God for this knowledge, can we not know it of our selves?</p>

his mighty power. <hi>Eph. 5.8.</hi> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> Why do we pray that we may obey, can we not do it of our own free will when we know it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; for our Wills are stubborn and rebellious against Gods Commands, as well as our Minds ignorant of them,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.7.</hi> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. <hi>Ezek. 36.25, 26.</hi> Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <hi>Phil. 2.13.</hi> For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> What is meant by submitting to Gods Will?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>(1.) Either a voluntary subjection of Soul, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredness actually to do his Will. Or (2.) a voluntary and silent submission to his Will of Providence in affliction; but in this particular we cannot imitate those in Heaven, because no cross ever befals them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> Why is Will added in all things?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because partial Obedience, is no Obedience; he that does not obey God in every thing obeys him in nothing.</hi> Iam. <hi>2.10.</hi> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> Why do we pray that God by his Grace would work this Will in us and by us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because 'tis Free-grace that determines it, 2</hi> Tim. <hi>1.9.</hi> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Iesus, before the world began. <hi>And effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace that works it in us, and enables us to do it,</hi> Eph. <hi>5.8.</hi> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord. <hi>Ver. 10.</hi> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That 'tis Mans glory and felicity to be conformed to the Will of God,</hi> Prov. <hi>12.26.</hi> The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour. <hi>Psal. 19.10, 11.</hi> More to be desired are they than gold, yea then much fine gold; sweeter also then honey, and the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned; and in keeping of them there is great reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> What is the second Inference?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41733:106"/>A. <hi>That we must mortifie in our selves every lust that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts Gods Will, and renounce without our selves, every thing that comes in competition therewith, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>9.</hi> ult. But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: least that by any means when I have preached to others, I my self should be a cast away. <hi>Gal. 6.14.</hi> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That it is in vain, yea a provocation to pray, if we be not obedient to Gods, Will,</hi> Prov. <hi>2.8, 9.</hi> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea every good path.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> What is the fourth Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That the Law still hath the authority of a Rule to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; because it reveals Gods Will, which they must do.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Because those concern immediately and generally Gods Glory, in the advancement of his Name, Kingdom and Will, which ought to be preferred to all our personal concerns,</hi> Psal. <hi>69.9.</hi> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. <hi>Acts 21.13.</hi> For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to dye at Ierusalem for the name of the Lord Iesus.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>Not for its worth, but for its order; for we can have no Spiritual Blessings unless we have a Natural Being in this Life.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Do we pray here for our selves only?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, but also for our Charge, Children and Family; that under and with us they may have the good things of this Life.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Why do we pray to God for these good things, can we not get them our selves, or our fellow creatures give them to us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not without God: Whatever we have of these things they are from God; who ever be the second cause or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if our selves, God gives us ability and success to get them; if others, God inclined their hearts, and opened their hands to bestow them,</hi> Deut. <hi>8.17, 18.</hi> And thou say in thine heart, my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Why do we pray to God to give us Bread?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because the least crumb of Bread is a free gift, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be merited by all we can do or suffer</hi>; Luke <hi>17.10.</hi> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all these things which are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Why are all these good things couched under the expression Bread?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>(1.) Because Bread is one of the most necessary and useful things to preserve Life. (2.) Because we must not ask delicacies and dainties of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is meant by day in the Petition?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Why do we pray for Dayly bread?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because God must give us the mercies and good things of every day, or else we cannot have them.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>(1.) Because 'tis fit we should be still sensible of our dependance upon God. (2;) Because we do frequently pray to God, and so exert our Graces, and maintain communion

with him, and dayly render thanks for dayly favour,</hi> Psalm <hi>55.17.</hi> Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud; and he shall hear my voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What need we to pray for Dayly bread when we may have stores laid up for years?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They that have the good things of this Life need to pray this Petition, as well as they that have them not. Not that they may have Bread; but that it may be Bread to them; for except God give his Blessing upon it, Bread would be ashes and not sustaneous; neither could all the comforts of this Life do us any good,</hi> Isa. <hi>3.1.</hi> For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts doth take away from Ierusalem, and from Iuda, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water. <hi>Mal. 2.1, 2.</hi> And now O ye priests, this commandment is for you. If you will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and will curse your blessings; yea I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> Why do we pray only for dayly Bread, or a competency, may we not pray for abundance and riches?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, because Riches are a great snare and temptation,</hi> Matth. <hi>19.23, 24.</hi> Then said Iesus unto his disciples, Verily, I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <hi>Prov. 30.8, 9.</hi> Remove far from me vanity and lyes, give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for me; lest I be full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? Or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> What shall we then do with Riches, if Providence cast them upon us, shall we cast them away?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, for some of the best of Men, and greatest of Gods favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, have lived and dyed rich. But (1.) We must wean our hearts from them.</hi> Psal. <hi>62.10.</hi> Trust not in oppression, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not vaine in robbery: if riches increase set not your heart upon them. <hi>(2.) Be thankful for them, and (3.) Fruitful with them in acts of Piety and Charity. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>6.17, 19.</hi> Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> Wherefore is the Bread called our Bread?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41733:108"/>A. <hi>Not because we are absolute Lords and Possessors of it, for so 'tis Gods only.</hi> Psal. <hi>24.1, 2.</hi> The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and estabilished it upod the floods. Psal. <hi>50.10, 12.</hi> for every beast of the forrest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine and the fulness thereof. <hi>But (1.) Because we must have a Covenant right to it. and (2.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> Having prayed for our daily Bread; need we to labour and endeavour to get it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes; we must labour in good and honest callings, Gods blessing and Mans industry must concur towards the present maintenance of life,</hi> Psal. <hi>128.1, 2.</hi> Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord: that walketh in his ways, for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Prov. <hi>10.4, 22.</hi> He becometh poor that dealeth with aslack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. The blessing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> What is the first Inference from it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we must not seek great matters for our selves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make them the matter of prayer to God; nor the end and design of our labours and callings among Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> What is a second Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That having Food and Rayment, we must be therewith content, and therefore thankful. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>6.8.</hi> And having food and rayment let us be therewith content. <hi>1</hi> Thes. <hi>5.18.</hi> In every thing give thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> What is the third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we ascribe not our success in the World to our own skill and industry, for the wisest, and most industrious do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times labour in the fire, and put their gain in a bag of holes; but to Gods free donation to us, and to his Blessing upon our endeavours,</hi> Gen. <hi>33.5, 11.</hi> And he lift up his eyes, and saw the the women and the children; and said, who are those with thee?

               <hi>Quest. 105. WHat doth we pray for in the fifth Petition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. In the fifth Petition, which is [and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors] we pray that God for Christs sake would freely pardon all our Sins: which we are the rather encouraged to ask, because by this grace we are enabled from the heart to forgive others.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1.</hi> Why doth this Petition immediately follow the former?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To teach that all temporal and corporal good things; without special and Spiritual ones are little worth,</hi> Psal. <hi>4.6.</hi> There be many that say, who will shew us any good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Psal. <hi>17.14, 15.</hi> From men which are thy hand O Lord, from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy likeness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Why is it annexed to the former with the Copulative, and?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>To teach that to be one minute in the confluence of all earthly good things without the pardon of Sin, is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and dreadful condition.</hi> Luke <hi>12.16, 20.</hi> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully, but God said unto him, thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Why is forgiveness of Sins placed in the front of spiritual Blessings?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because till sin be pardoned we are under wrath, and can have no special saving Grace applyed to us; till we are accepted; till we are in Christ we have no Covenant right to the blessings of Christ</hi> Matt. <hi>11.28.</hi> come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, <hi>ver. 30.</hi> for my yoke is easie, and my burden is light. <hi>John 15.4, 5.</hi> abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye except ye abide in me. I am the Vine ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing— <hi>ver. 7.</hi> if ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. <hi>John 3.</hi> ult. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why do we pray for forgiveness, cannot we make amends for our sins, and be freed from their guilt without pardon?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, all that we can ever do or suffer, can never expiate the guilt of the least sin,</hi> Psal. <hi>49.7, 8.</hi> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.) <hi>1 Sam. 2.25.</hi> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him.</p>

                  <hi>Q 5.</hi> Does God then freely, and out of meer Grace forgive us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, without any respect had to any thing we can do, or be,</hi> Isa. <hi>43.25.</hi> I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember thy sins. <hi>Rom. 9.15.</hi> I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. <hi>Ver. 18.</hi> Therefore hath he mercy, on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will be hardneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> How doth God forgive sins?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>(1.) Universally all sins,</hi> Exod. <hi>34.6, 7.</hi> And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression and sin. <hi>Jer. 33.8.</hi> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. <hi>Hos. 14.2.</hi> Take away all iniquity and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously. <hi>(2.) Compleatly and perfectly,</hi> Isa. <hi>43.25.</hi> I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember thy sins. <hi>Psal. 103.12.</hi> As far as the east is from the west: so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hath he removed our transgressions from us. <hi>Mic. 7.19.</hi> He will subdue our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. <hi>Isa. 38.17.</hi> For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. <hi>(3.) Everlastingly,</hi> Ier. <hi>31.34.</hi> For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. <hi>Heb. 8.12.</hi> and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>No, not with a proper and vindictive punishment; but he brings evil upon them for their sins, as a Father chastises his Child; and other sorts of afflictions for their spiritual good: He may be angry as a Father, with those he has pardoned, but never hate them as a condemning Judge,</hi> Psal. <hi>89.28.</hi> My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. <hi>Ver. 34.</hi> My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> How can God be said freely to pardon all our sins; when we pray it may be done for Christs sake, does not that imply that Christ has satisfied God for our sins, and deserved our remission?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, it does so; for the Lord Christ by his Life and Death did satisfie Divine Justice, and did merit our forgiveness; but if he did so, we did not so; our sins cost him dear, but their pardon cost us nothing; our pardon is perfectly free to us; though due to Christ, for God gave Christ freely for us; God accepts of his merits, and applyes them to us freely,</hi> Rom. <hi>3.24.</hi> Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> But is there nothing required from us as the condition of pardon, and if so, how can it be absolutely free?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There are required Repentance from Sin, and Faith in the Lord Christ,</hi> Luke. <hi>13.3.</hi> But except ye repent, ye shall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perish. <hi>Joh. 3. ult.</hi> And he that believeth not the son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. <hi>This is required from us towards our pardon; but yet 'tis free, (1.) Because God freely ordains thus to pardon. (2.) Because both these are the free gifts of God,</hi> Acts <hi>11.18.</hi> Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. <hi>Eph. 2.8.</hi> For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of your selves; it is the gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> When then are our sins forgiven?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Just upon our closure with Christ by Faith, in that very moment,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.1.</hi> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>Rom. 8.1.</hi> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Why do we pray in the answer for the forgiveness of all our sins?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because if the least guilt should remain upon us, 'twould exclude from Gods favour, and lodge us in everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.</hi> ult. For the wages of sin is death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What are the priviledges and blessings that accompany pardon?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Justification is accompanied with Adoption,</hi> John <hi>1.12.</hi> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. <hi>With the Spirit and Principle of all Grace and Holiness, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.11.</hi> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God. <hi>With an infallible title to Eternal Glory,</hi> Iohn. <hi>3.16.</hi> That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. <hi>Rom. 8.30.</hi> Whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:41733:110"/>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> How may we know that we are pardoned and justified?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Ordinarily by our Sanctification, by our loathing of Sin, our contempt of the World, our valuing of Christ, our love and thankfulness to God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.11.</hi> But ye are sanctified. Rom. <hi>7.24.</hi> O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? <hi>Gal. 6.14.</hi> By whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <hi>1 Pet. 2.7.</hi> Vnto you therefore which believe he is precious. <hi>Luke 7.47.</hi> Her sins which are many are forgiven; for she loved much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What is meant by <hi>[Our]</hi> is it only such sins as we have personally and actually committed?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No; but also</hi> Adams <hi>sin, which is ours by imputation,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.19.</hi> By one mans disobedience many were made sinners. <hi>And original sin which is ours by inhesion,</hi> Psal. <hi>51.5.</hi> Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. <hi>And other mens sins which we have made ours, by exciting them to them, not hindering of them, silence at them, and other ways, 2</hi> Sam. <hi>12.9.</hi> Thou hast killed Vriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. <hi>1 Tim. 5.22.</hi> Neither be partaker of other mens sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> Wherefore are sins called debts?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because they are a non-payment of Gods dues, a non-performance of our duty, which makes us lyable to the arrest of Death, and to the prison of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> Why do we plead our own forgiveness of others?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not as any merit of our own pardon, but either as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to our selves to beg pardon; seeing such evil, envious and malignant persons are enabled to forgive others; much more may we hope the good and gracious God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us: Or as a condition, without which we can have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and with which we shall,</hi> Mat. <hi>6.14.</hi> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> How do others trespass against us?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>When they injure us either in our Persons, or Names, or Families, or Estates, or Souls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1</hi> Sam. <hi>2.25.</hi> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> Can we forgive our Neighbours freely, fully and perfectly, as God doth forgive us?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> Are we always bound to manifest outwardly our love and forgiveness to all our enemies; and to behave our selves towards them as friends?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, if we have experienced them to be treacherous and false, and see no change, we are not bound to trust them, if they be and remain wicked and profane, we must not associate with them,</hi> Psal. <hi>26.5.</hi> I have hated the congregation of evil doers: and will not sit with the wicked. <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> I have not sate with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> What then must we do to such?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We must heartily forgive them all their injuries; we must love them with the love of benevolence, pray for them, and be ready aud willing to do them all good both of Body and Soul,</hi> Mat. <hi>5.44, 45.</hi> But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which dispitefully use you, and persecute you. That you may be the children of your father which is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil, and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> If we forgive others shall we be forgiven our selves?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We shall, if out of obedience to God, and love to Christ we do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> What is the first Inference from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That except our sins be forgiven, we are lost and undone creatures, and therefore we must never be contented till we are pardoned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 24.</hi> What is a second Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That God is a God of love, goodness and pardon; seeing he will not pardon us, if we do not pardon others; but will if we do so.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> What is a third Inference?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That if we live in hatred when we pray the Lords Prayer, we pray for our own damnation,</hi> Mat. <hi>18.22.</hi> Iesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven times, but until seventy times seven. <hi>Ver. 35.</hi> So likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>

               </p>

               <p>A. <hi>We beg that we may not any of these, or any other ways, whereby the holy God may be said to lead into temptation, be led thereinto,</hi> Psal. <hi>141.4.</hi> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties. <hi>Psal. 19.13.</hi> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>That without Gods Grace we can never withstand, but shall be overcome by every temptation, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.5.</hi> Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves; but our sufficiency is of God. <hi>Joh. 15.5.</hi> For without me ye can do nothing.</p>

               <p>A. <hi>To teach us that therein are included arguments or reasons to press God withal, and to prevail with him for audience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> But is it lawful to argue with God, and to urge him with Reasons in Prayer?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>'Tis not only lawful, but expedient, yea highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; as is seen in the Sains Prayers. In</hi> Moses<hi>'s,</hi> Numb. <hi>14.13.</hi> And Moses said unto the Lord, then the Egyptians shall hear it (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them.) <hi>Ver. 19.</hi> Pardon I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now. <hi>In</hi> Ioshua<hi>'s, chap. 7.7.</hi> And Ioshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Iordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Iordan. <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? <hi>In</hi> Asa<hi>'s, 2</hi> Chron. <hi>14.11.</hi> And Asa c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yed unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: Help us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord our God, for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this great multitude: O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee. <hi>In</hi> Iehosaphat<hi>'s, 2</hi> Chron. <hi>20.6.</hi> And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee. <hi>And</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs, <hi>2</hi> Kin. <hi>19.15.</hi> And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth. <hi>Ver. 19.</hi> Now therefore, O Lord our God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But to what purpose can we think to prevail with God by our Arguments and Importunity?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are not used as though we would put God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any thing; or would prevail with God to do that for us which he is unwilling to give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why then?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:41733:112"/>A. <hi>For our own profit, for the enlarging of our own hearts, for the exciting of our fervency, for the exerting of Faith, Hope, Zeal, Charity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Prayer, and so to prepare our selves for the Mercy, that we may the more gratefully receive it, and the more fruitfully imploy it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How many Arguments are in this Conclusion?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> From whence are they taken?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>From Gods Kingdom, from his Law, and from his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What Kingdom is here meant?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Gods universal, essential and absolute Kingdom, wherein may be and is involved his special Kingdom over the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What are the Arguments from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because all that we can pray for in this Prayer, is for the advancement and perfecting of this his Kingdom, by the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all persons and things that oppose it, and the completion of his dominion over all his Subjects; therefore he would grant all these requests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What is another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(2.) Because he being such an absolute Lord and Soveraign, has an undeniable Right, and unquestionable Authority to give and grant all we ask, and to effect and bring to pass all we beg; for all persons and things are his own, and at his disposal,</hi> Mat. <hi>20.15.</hi> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is meant by Power?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Gods essential, infinite, irresistible power, whereby he can do what he pleases,</hi> Ps. <hi>135.6.</hi> Whatsoever the Lord pleased, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is the Argument from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we ask nothing from God, but what he can do with infinite ease, in despite of all the opposition that Hell, Earth, and Heart can make to the contrary,</hi> Phil. <hi>3.</hi> ult. According to the working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eph. <hi>3.20.</hi> Now unto him that is able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 12.</hi> What is meant by Glory?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not his essential Glory, which no Man or Angel can ever apprehend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What Glory then?</p>
               <p>A <hi>His declared and acknowledged Glory; even the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all his Decrees by his Providence; and then the love, the adoration and the praises, the self-dedications of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints returned to him for the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What is the Argument or Motive from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That seeing the substance of every request, does directly tend to, and will perfectly end in this Glory of God, when they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41733:113"/>
are fully answered; therefore he would gradually answer them while we are here, and perfectly at last, to the advancement of his Glory now, and the completion of it then, 1</hi> Chron. <hi>29.11.</hi> Thine O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, <hi>&amp;c. Jos. 7.9.</hi> And what wilt thou do unto thy great name. <hi>Isa. 42.8.</hi> I am the Lord, that is my name, <hi>&amp;c. Isa. 48.11.</hi> For my own sake, even for my own sake will I do it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> Why is <hi>Amen</hi> added?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Because 'tis the usual Conclusion of Prayers and Praises,</hi> Psal. <hi>41.13.</hi> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, <hi>&amp;c. Psal. 72.19.</hi> And blessed be his glorious name for ever, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Cor 13. ult.</hi> The grace of the Lord Iesus, and the love of God, <hi>&amp;c. Rom. 16.20.</hi> The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> But what doth this word here signifie?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It signifies (1.) the reality and ardency of our desire to be granted in what we pray for,</hi> Rev. <hi>22.20.</hi> He which testifieth these things, saith, surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so come Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> And what besides?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Our trust and firm confidence that we shall be heard and answered in all these our requests,</hi> Rev. <hi>1.7.</hi> Even so, Amen. <hi>Rev. 7.12.</hi> Saying Amen: Blessing and glory, and wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> What are the Inferences from hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we ought to use in Prayer all such Arguments as may most and best affect our Hearts towards God, excite our Graces, and succeed with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> What's another?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That all we pray for must be in a subserviency to Gods Kingdom, and with a desire of his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> What is the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xt?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we must act according to our Prayers; do all we can for the advancement of Gods Kingdom, and the exaltation of his Glory, as subjects and votaries thereto,</hi> Ps. <hi>116.16. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.31.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> What may more be gathered hence?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we ought to begin, so to continue, and conclude our Prayers in lowest Adorations of God, and acknowledgments of his Glory and Attributes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> What more doth this Conclusion teach?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That in Prayer we must be fervent in our desires, and longing for what we pray,</hi> Jam. <hi>5.16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 23</hi> Is there any thing besides?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>That praying for things agreeable to Gods Will, we ought to be confident that we shall succeed in our requests; praying for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
