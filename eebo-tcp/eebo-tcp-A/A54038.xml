            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>VVHether it be lawful for Chriſtians (who know Chriſt, the Subſtance of all the Shadows under the Law, and are in the New Covenant) to Swear upon weighty occaſions, as it was lawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> to do under the Old Covenant? <hi>or,</hi> Whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> alloweth his Diſciples to ſwear in ſolemn Caſes, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did allow his Diſciples?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the clearing of this weighty Controverſie to all ſuch, as ſingly deſire to know the Truth (as it is in Jeſus) in this particular, that their hearts may bow to Him therein, and not be overtaken with the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Subtilties of the Carnal Mind (which never knew nor can know the Power, but hath alwayes been, and ſtill is ſetting up dead Images, of God's Truths and of his Worſhip, out of the Power) theſe few things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing would be conſidered of. Firſt, <hi>What an Oath is,</hi> or, <hi>The nature of a right and true Oath under the Law.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The ground or occaſion of its Inſtitution.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Caſes wherein an Oath was to be uſed.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>The proper end and ſervice of an Oath.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of its nature to its end and ſervice.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>The perſons to whom the uſe of an Oath was proper in it ſelf, and intended and allowed by God; and whether there be any perſons to whom it is not proper, and to whom the Lord doth not allow it?</hi> This laſt is the main, and will it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40624:3"/>
determine the thing; but yet a brief Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former may not be unprofitable, to make way for a clearer leading and inſight into it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As touching <hi>an Oath, what it is,</hi> or <hi>the nature of it.</hi> A true and lawful Oath under the Law, was an Engagement or Bond upon the Soul <hi>(Numb.</hi> 30. 2.) by the Name of the Lord <hi>(Deut.</hi> 10. 20.) to the ſpeaking of Truth in things <hi>affirmed,</hi> and to the performance of Truth in things <hi>promiſed.</hi> It was as a Seal to bind fallen man (man fallen from the Truth, from the Uprightneſs) to Truth in his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> either to God or man. This is the nature &amp; uſe of <hi>an Oath,</hi> to wit, to bind the Soul to Truth, to be ſuch an Engagement upon the Soul, as, if there be any fear of God there, it cannot but dread to break, knowing that <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, that taketh his Name in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The ground or occaſion of an Oath,</hi> is the Fall of Man from Truth, from Innocency, from the Uprightneſs which engaged him to Truth before his Fall. This made the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtand in need of this Bond under the Law, in their Purpoſes and Promiſes towards God; and the ſame thing likwiſe made them ſtand in need of it one from another, to Ratifie and Confirm Truth between them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Caſes wherein an Oath was to be uſed,</hi> which were chiefly theſe four.</p>
               <p>
                  <table>
                     <row>
                        <cell>1. In caſe of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Vow to God,</cell>
                        <cell rows="2">That the Truth, Integrity, and plain Intention of the Heart might ſtand, and there might be no departing therefrom, in the thing promiſed, either to God or man; an Oath in that ſtate was found uſeful to bind the Soul thereto.</cell>
                     </row>
                     <row>
                        <cell>2. In caſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to man,</cell>
                     </row>
                  </table>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40624:3"/>
3. In caſe of Pronouncing or Declaring the Truth of a Thing, which was weighty, that there might be a clear and ſatisfactory ground of belief.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In caſe of Controverſie between Parties, where the Controverſie could not be determined, but by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Confeſſion of the one Party for Truth; there that Party was to ſeal his Confeſſion with an Oath, and ſo the other to reſt ſatisfied therewith, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie thereupon end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The end of an Oath,</hi> which is, for final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and avoiding of all further Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the Thing ſworn to. By binding the Thing (promiſed or affirmed) with an Oath, the thing is confirmed; and now there is no more ſtrife in the heart concerning the thing, if relating to God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man in things relating to them, but the ſtriving nature is bound down by the Oath of God, wherewith the Thing is ratified, and ſo the Doubt and Uncertainty removed, and the Conteſt ended. Thus of right it ought to be, and is where the Oath is forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and in its proper ſervice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The ſutableneſs of its nature to the end aimed at by it.</hi> Man out of the Chriſtian Life, can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to engage himſelf by the fear and dread of that God, whom he profeſſeth to worſhip and ſerve, and who cannot but be jealous of his Name and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ready to vindicate the taking of it in vain. Man under the Law, could not bind himſelf to God, in any promiſe or ſervice more than thus; nor can there be any greater Bond or Seal of Truth given by one man to another, in the fallen ſtate, than this. And he that will venture to break this, what but Deceit and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery can be expected from him? inſomuch as no other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40624:4"/>
Engagement from him can be of weight, he hereby manifeſting the want of that in his mind and ſpirit, whereupon all ties are to faſten.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>The perſons to whom the uſe of an Oath was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lawful, and for whom it was inſtituted; and whether there be any perſons to whom it is not proper and lawful, and for whoſe uſe it was not inſtituted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To find out this diſtinctly and truly, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeveral Conditions of Man ſince the Creation, and obſerve to which of thoſe it is uſeful and proper in it ſelf, and allowed by God; and to which it is not uſeful in it ſelf, nor allowed by God.</p>
               <p>There have been four Eſtates or Conditions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſince the Creation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An Eſtate of Innocency,</hi> an Eſtate of Integrity, of Purity, of Righteouſneſs, wherein man could not lye or deceive; but his Promiſes to God, and his words to men, muſt needs be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> for it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to man, who was made in God's Image (which is Truth) to lye or deceive, until the Deceit entred him, and drew him out of the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was (and ſtill is) <hi>an Eſtate of deep Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> wherein this Truth and Innocency was wholly loſt, and man wholly corrupted in his ſpirit and nature, and wholly degenerated from God. This was the Eſtate of the Heathen, who knew not God generally, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired after Him, but walked in the vanity of their minds, and were given up to their own hearts luſts. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome of theſe the Eternal Principle of Life was ſtirring, which did check them, and offer to guide them out of this Eſtate, which they that hearkened unto, did not remain in the Fall with the reſt, but felt the Power of that, which reproved and checked them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40624:4"/>
circumciſing their Hearts, and, in their Obedience thereto, juſtifying them in their Conſciences before God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was <hi>an Eſtate of ſhadowy Redemption,</hi> which was not the true Eſtate of Redemption it ſelf, or they the true People which were to be redeemed, but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it the Redemtion, a ſhadow of the Redeemed People, a ſhadow of the Way and Path of Life, wherein were Figures of the Heavenly Subſtance, the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People, the Heavenly Things, the Heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, the Heavenly Food, &amp;c. But all theſe Figures in and under the Law, were not the true Heavenly and Inviſible Things themſelves, but outward and viſible Signs and Repreſentations of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was, and, bleſſed be the Lord, now at length (after the great, long and dark night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy) again is brought forth <hi>an Eſtate of True Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> wherein the Soul is brought back from the Death, from the Captivity, from the Fall, from the Deceit, and from the Shadows into the Truth, into the pure Life, into the Innocency, into the Uprightneſs; wherein Chriſt (the Power of God) is witneſſed, and the Soul new formed in his pure Image, and become a new Creature, having a new Eye, a new Ear, a new Heart, a new Nature, a new Life and Spirit (in the newneſs of which Life, it is to live and walk) a new Courſe and Converſation, a new Place to walk and have its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in, even in that very Heaven, from whence it looks for the Saviour; wherein alſo all old things, which came in by the Fall, and all the old ſhadows of the Law are to paſs away, and in this ſtate all things to become new. And this is not only to be expected in the perfection of this ſtate, but belongs (in its meaſure
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40624:5"/>
and degree) to the very beginning of it: for even ſo ſoon as a man is engrafted into Chriſt, and can be ſaid to be in Chriſt, even then he is a new Creature, and all things then begin to become new unto him, and he is then to begin, departing from all the old things, both of the Natural or Heatheniſh ſtate, and of the Jewiſh ſtate, until he hath left them all behind. The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: Old things are paſſed away; all things are become new.</hi> Chriſt, the Lord and Maſter of all Believers, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not of the World, calleth all His Diſciples and Followers out of the World. How out of the World? doth He call them from having any being or commerce in the Earth, or in the World? Nay, not ſo, but to come out of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>corrupt ſtate, practices</hi> &amp; <hi>wayes</hi> of the World; out of the <hi>Earthly Wayes</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, out of the <hi>Earthly Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> of the Jewes; yea, even out of every thing in both, which was not of the Father, but of the World; and this made them a gazing ſtock to both, and the ſcorn and hatred of both, where-ever they came.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the four Eſtates or Conditions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſince the Creation: in one of which, all men that ever were, have been to be found; and according to the Eſtate and Condition wherein Man is found, is the Law of God to him, and His Requirings of him.</p>
               <p>Now let any man, in the Fear of the Lord God, weigh and conſider, to which ſort or ſorts of theſe an Oath was uſeful in it ſelf, and allowed by God, and to which not. Was it uſeful in the Innocent ſtate? or, did God appoint it there, when man could not but ſpeak Truth? or, is it uſeful in the Redeemed Eſtate, where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40624:5"/>
a greater Bond is received, and profeſſedly held forth, than the Innocency of Mans Nature was? Is not Chriſt the Truth, the Subſtance? Is not he that is in Him, the New-Creature? Were not all the <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the Law, to laſt till Chriſt the <hi>Subſtance</hi> came? Is not this the Bond of the Goſpel? and doth not this ſeal Truth, and keep to Truth more firmly, than the <hi>Oath</hi> under the Law could? And the greater Bond being come, doth not the leſſer Bond (which ſignified it) flee away and vaniſh, and the uſe of it now become both needleſs and unlawful? Men may reaſon ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perſwade ſtrongly againſt the Truth, but we know certainly and infallibly in the Light of the Lord, that the uſe of an Oath was not for Man in Innocency, nor for Man under the power and vertue of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt (which brings Man back into the Truth, into the Innocency, and into that Life and Strength, which preſerves in the Truth and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) but for fallen Man, for Man erred from the Truth and Covenant of God: And it is very manifeſt to us, that for a Diſciple of Chriſt, who hath received the Law from his Lips againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> to be brought back again <hi>to Swearing</hi> (the bond of Man in the fallen ſtate, and under the Law) is no leſſe than a denial of Chriſt, who is his Life and Redeemer out of the fallen ſtate, and who alſo is the Subſtance, which ends the Oaths: and he that hath ever known the <hi>pure Power</hi> of His Life, and received the <hi>pure Law</hi> thereof in the clear Openings of his Spirit, muſt not depart from thence, from the feeling of that, into the fleſhly reaſonings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſultations with the fleſhly-wiſe part, which will be ſure to give ſuch Interpretations of Scriptures, as may avoid the Croſſe; but keep to that Power which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40624:6"/>
begat him; and to that Principle wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and there he ſhall never be able to get beyond the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt, beyond the Confeſſing of the Truth in the Preſence and Life of it, which is the end and ſubſtance of <hi>Swearing</hi> under the Law: and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſeveral Times, and in ſeveral Caſes relates to the Prophecies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (who foretold of things under the Goſpel, in Law-phraſes) renders the word <hi>Confeſs,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Swear,</hi> as may appear by comparing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. and <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 11. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. That which the Law called <hi>Swearing,</hi> the Goſpel calls <hi>Confeſſing</hi> (each of them ſpeaking of the ſame thing, in the proper dialect of each:) which Confeſſing in the Life, in the Truth in the renewed Principle, is the weight and ſubſtance of that, whereof the Oath was but a ſhadow. For what is the ſubſtance and intent of an Oath? is not the intent of it to bind to the ſpeaking or performing of Truth? And what is it that binds? is it the ſhadow, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? is it the words of an Oath, or the ſenſe and weight of the thing upon the ſpirit? It was not the <hi>form</hi> of an Oath, but the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, which bound the <hi>Jew</hi> under the Law: and if there be more weight and ſubſtance in the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> of a Diſciple under the Goſpel, it muſt needs be more binding to them, and hath alſo more true ground of ſatisfaction in it (to other Chriſtians at leaſt) than a <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> ſwearing: yea, and if the Men of the World would but freely ſpeak their hearts, it would be acknowledged to be of more weight with them alſo.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God (being not bound Himſelf by the Laws, wherewith He binds the Creature) may either Himſelf, or by an Inſtrument (in his immediate Life and Power) do that, which the Creature hath not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Him to do: but that is no warrant in general, but the Diſciple is particularly to eye the Rule from his Maſter <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> (who is Lord over the Houſhold of Faith, and who was as faithful in all His Houſe as a Lord, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant was in his Houſe) by whom the ſame God, who once allowed Oaths to the <hi>Jems,</hi> hath now wholly forbidden <hi>Swearing.</hi> And let the Diſciple diligently and faithfully eye the Laws of the New Covenant (which are written by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ingrafted Word of Faith in the heart) he ſhall find Oaths excluded there as a part of the Old Covenant, even as a <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>ſhadowy</hi> Confirmation of Truth among the Jews, under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the time of the Law; but the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf is the ſubſtance, and the <hi>Faith received</hi> is the ſeal of Truth under the Goſpel, both towards God and man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. A Chriſtian may not ſwear in relation to the ſatisfaction of others, Becauſe he is to hold forth his Light, his Life, his Principle in the eye of the world; He is to teſtifie to the Worth and Excellency of it, that
<pb facs="tcp:40624:7"/>
it is a greater and firmer Bond to him (both towards God and man) than any Oaths either of the Heathen, or of the Jews can be. Now his entring into their way of Confirmation of things, which is ſhort of his own, is an undervaluing and diſparagement of the worth and weight of that Principle of Truth, which God hath given him and raiſed up in him: It is indeed a denying of it: for, entring into the Law-bond, is a laying of the Goſpel-bond by, and an offering of that as a Bond, which indeed once was ſo, but is now excluded by the Law of Faith from being a Bond any longer, and hath loſt its vertue. And if men would but open their eyes, they might eaſily ſee how little Oaths bind, and how unprofitable they are to the end and uſe for which they are intended: but the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt (the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life) cannot be broken, but he that abides in Him, muſt perform the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> which is firm in Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. A Chriſtian or Diſciple may not ſwear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, Becauſe Chriſt hath brought in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or Affirmation of the Truth, from the Principle of his Life, inſtead of Oaths: which is made good, not only by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s rendring of <hi>Swearing</hi> in the Law-time, <hi>Confeſſing,</hi> in the fulfilling of it under the Goſpel; but alſo by Chriſt's bringing in the <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> inſtead of the Law's Swearing. In the Jew the Oath was the Seal or Confirmation under the Law: in the Diſciple, who is in the Life, and hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Truth of Chriſt the Life, the <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> the <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> is appointed him by Chriſt inſtead of the Oath. And though the ſubtilty and fleſhly widom ſtrive hard, to wreſt that place out of the hands of the Simplicity, yet they ſhall never be able to do it; but he that looks
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40624:7"/>
on it with a ſingle eye in the Light of that Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was wrote, ſhall plainly ſee Chriſt's drift to be to take away the ſhadow, even to aboliſh that uſe of <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> which was proper and allowed to the Jews under the Law, and to bring the Confeſſion or Denial of the Thing, the <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> (from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſpirit and Principle in the Diſciple) in the ſtead of it: Which, to make more manifeſt to the honeſt, ſimple, and naked heart, which is willing to take up the Will and Truth of God in every thing, with all the croſſes that attend it, let theſe few Lines following be uprightly conſidered of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſlight, trivial and frequent Oaths were not allowed under the Law, but forbidden by the Law, as a taking of Gods Holy and Dreadful Name in vain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That though vain Oaths were then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, yet ſolemn Oaths, weighty Oaths (ſuch as were needful and uſeful to the thing intended) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed under the Law. So in all thoſe caſes before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, Oaths were allowed and juſtifiable, ſo that they were but careful to perform them, and did not forſwear themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt brings in an Exception againſt the uſe of this lawful Swearing under the Law, as the word <hi>But</hi> doth plainly ſignifie, and forbiddeth Swearing wholly, altogether, or at all. The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf</hi> (that's the ſubſtance of what the Law forbids: it allows <hi>Swearing,</hi> but forbids <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing)</hi> But I ſay unto you, Ye ſhall not only avoid <hi>Forſwearing,</hi> but <hi>Swearing</hi> alſo, and that wholly or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt brings in another thing inſtead of Swearing (a thing far more ſutable to the truth, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40624:8"/>
and ſimplicity of the Goſpel) which is Confeſſing the thing, or ſpeaking the thing in truth, juſt as it is either by way of Affirmation or Denyal; <hi>But let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is liberty enough left to a Diſciple, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any man concerning the truth of a thing by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as much as by an Oath: For is it not full as weighty, under the Goſpel to confeſs the Preſence of God, or that He is Witneſs, or that we ſpeak the thing in his Fear, and in the feeling of his Life and Power, as it was under the Law to ſwear <hi>by his Life, by his Fear, by his Power,</hi> or the like? Is not the Confeſſing of God by a Chriſtian, of more weight, than the Swearing by Him from a Jew or Heathen? O Nations and Powers of the Earth, ſeek Truth, ſeek Righteouſneſs, and do not ſet up a Form or Image of things in your own wills (and according to your own wiſdom and inventions) above the Power of God.</p>
               <p>And let it be duely conſidered, whether the Powers of this Nation deal kindly with the Lord, in exacting an Oath from his People, who not in the leaſt diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them, but only in fidelity of Conſcience to Chriſt their Lord and Maſter, cannot but refuſe it.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, concerning their Fidelity and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King, that is the thing which an Oath is required to ratifie and confirm. Now the Swearing it ſelf (or formal taking of an Oath) is of little value; but to be obedient, to be faithful, is the thing of value. The caſe then ſtands thus: The Lord hath ſo formed them, that they cannot but be faithful and obedient. The Lord hath raiſed up that Principle in them, which cannot hurt the King or any man, nor cannot ſtand by and ſee him or any man hurt, without endeavouring to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40624:8"/>
prevent it. Here is their ſtrength of performing good and avoiding evil; and their <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> from this Principle, is the beſt Security which they can poſſibly give to any man (and he who hath thus formed them in the <hi>pure Principle</hi> of his Life, hath likewiſe forbidden them to ſwear) But this cannot be accepted for want of the other Confirmation, to wit, <hi>of Swearing,</hi> which came in by the Fall, and was allowed among the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Law, but is forbidden by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now, O King, ſhall not God's People be faithful and obedient to the Lord as well as to thee? ſhall they not be true to the Principle of Life, wherein they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and brought forth, in the Love and Good-will to all, and out of Enmity to any? Hath God raiſed up in them a Principle which cannot deceive, and will not the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> of that ſerve (after ſo much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through ſo many changes) but they muſt either break Chriſt's Command, and hazard their Souls, or elſe loſe their Liberties and Eſtates?</p>
               <p>O that men would wait on the Lord, for his pure Fear to be written on their hearts by the finger of His Spirit, that they might come out of the fleſhly wiſdom into the womb of the Eternal Wiſdom, from whence our Principle came; that they might be able to ſee and juſtifie the Purity, Righteouſneſs, Nobility and Worth of it, and that they might feel its ſecurity from all that is out of the Good-will, out of the Love, out of the Life, and out of the Peace, that ſo there might be an end of all Strife, Rebellion, Heart-burnings, Plots, and all manner of Wickedneſs and Ungodlineſs, which have no place in it, but daily waſte and wither where it is ſown and grows, even till they come to an end, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40624:9"/>
till Righteouſneſs and pure Innocency fill the room and place which they had, both in the heart and mind within, and in the life and converſation outwardly.</p>
               <p>And let every one that nameth the Name of the Lord, depart from Iniquity, and look well to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: for the darkneſs of the thick night of Apoſtacy is already paſt, and the True Light now again ſhineth. Bleſſed is the Eye which ſeeth it, and the Heart which is eſtabliſhed in it, in the midſt of thoſe terrible and dreadful ſhakings and confuſions, which muſt not end here, but go over all Nations. O that this Nation could once bow to it, that it might be happy, and its Rents and Breaches healed for ever.</p>
