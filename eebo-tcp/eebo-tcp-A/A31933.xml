            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable House of COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Bedience is a virtue of such great worth, that <hi>Luther</hi> did rather desire <hi>to have grace to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, than power to work miracles.</hi> Out of this very Principle it was, that I first adventured to preach before such a <hi>grave and judicious Senate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mallem obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire quam miracula facere.</hi> Luther.</note>
               <hi>coram tam multis viris &amp; tam paucis hominibus.</hi> And from the same Principle it is, that I now present the Sermon to a more publike view. The time allotted for the making of it, was so short (by reason of your more serious affairs) that it might have been a sufficient Apology, to excuse both the preaching and
<pb facs="tcp:101394:3"/>
printing of it, had not pure Obedience just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly silenced all such Apologies. And now it is printed, the Sermon it self is so poor and mean, that it may fitly be answered to me, what <hi>Apelles</hi> once did to a Painter, who having drawn many Lines in a little space of time, and boasting to <hi>Apelles</hi> that he had done so much in so short a time; it was replyed, <hi>That he wondered that he had drawn no more.</hi> But yet howsoever, my humble request is, That you would accept of this poor <hi>Mite,</hi> this <hi>little Goats-haire,</hi> which your commands (like a Mid-wife) have brought into the world. And indeed the kinde entertainment it found in the hearing, and the great acknowledgement of your <hi>Thanks</hi> (farre above all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or desert) afterwards, is an abundantly sufficient incitement against all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatsoever. The subject of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is of great concernment. It is about the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>repair</hi> of Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a matter sutable for you that are the representative Body of the Kingdom. Sin ruines Kingdoms. When <hi>Nicephorus Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> had built a mighty Wall about his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb facs="tcp:101394:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for his defense, he heard a voyce in the night, crying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Though thou build'st thy walls as high as Heaven, sin is within, and this will easily batter down thy walls. Sin is like a Traytor in our own bosomes, that will open the gates to the enimy. Sin weakens our hands, and makes them unapt to fight. Sin taketh away the courage of our hearts. It was not the <hi>strength of Ai</hi> that overcame the <hi>Israelites, but Achans sin.</hi> Sinne causeth a great Army to be overcome by a little one.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.24.</note> 
               <hi>The Army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> The sins of <hi>England,</hi> are the enimies of <hi>England.</hi> These beleaguer our Walls, and are as so many Canaanites alwayes rising up in rebellion against us. But now on the contrary, Repentance and Reformation repairs and upholds Kingdoms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: this is their Fortresse and Tower of defense; their Munition, Armour, and Wall of Brasse to defend them. <hi>Righteousnesse
<pb facs="tcp:101394:4"/>
exalteth a Nation, but sinne is a reproach to any People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14 34.</note> The Lord in mercy ruinate our sinnes, and not the Nation! the same Lord worke a Nationall Reformation, and make you his <hi>Instruments</hi> in this great work! Much hath been done by you this way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (which is acknowledged in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing discourse, with great thankfulnesse) The Lord enable you to perfect what you have begun. He that is the <hi>Finisher of our faith,</hi> finish this much-desired Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! It is very observable, that when God raised up Magistrates, such as <hi>Nehemiah, Zerubbabel,</hi> and others, to pity Sion that lay in the dust, and to repair her breaches: at the same time he raised up Prophets also, such as <hi>Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and others, to strengthen the hands of the Magistrates, and to encourage them in so noble a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and therefore it is expresly said.<hi>Then the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 5.1.</note> Haggai <hi>and</hi> Zechariah <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied unto the Iews that were in</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem <hi>in the Name of the God of Israel, even unto them. Then</hi> (and not before) <hi>rose up</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>and</hi> Jeshua, <hi>and began to build the house of God which is at</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>and
<pb facs="tcp:101394:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with them were the Prophets of God helping them.</hi> And <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14. <hi>The Elders of the Iews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of</hi> Haggai <hi>the Prophet, and</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah <hi>the sonne of</hi> Iddo; <hi>and they builded and finished it, according to the Commandment of the God of Israel, &amp;c.</hi> By both these Texts it appears, that the Magistrates began and finished the reparations of Gods House, by the help of the Prophets of God. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me, therefore (as divers others have done before) the unworthiest of all Gods Ministers, according to my duty and place, to beseech and exhort you to the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those blessed good things which you have begun to do for the Church of God in <hi>England.</hi> And the God of all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, blesse you and yours.</p>

                  <p>If that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evill, I will repent of the evill that I thought to do unto them.</p>
                  <p>And at what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it:</p>
                  <p>If it do evill in my sight, that it obey not my voyce, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text may fitly be called a Looking glasse for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or for any other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whatsoever; wherein God Almighty declares what he can do with Nations and Kingdoms, and what he will do.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101394:6"/>1. What he can do. He can <hi>build and plant</hi> a Nation. and he can <hi>pluck up, pull down, and destroy</hi> a Nation. And when a Kingdom is in the depth of misery, he can in an <hi>instant,</hi> if he but speake the word, raise it up to the top of happinesse; and when it is in the heigth and Zenith of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, he can in another instant speake a word, and throw it downe againe into an Abysse of misery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What he will do. God will not alwayes use his Prerogative, but he will first <hi>speake</hi> before he strikes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 7.</note> he will first <hi>pronounce</hi> judgement before he executeth judgement.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>then will God repent of the evill he intended to do unto them</hi>: And not only so, but he will <hi>build and plant</hi> that Nation, and of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wildernesse, make it a fruitfull Paradise. But if <hi>that Nation do evill in Gods sight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>and will not obey his voice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10.</note> then will God repent of the good wherewith he would have benefited them,</hi> and pull down what he hath built, and pluck up what he hath planted, and of a fruitfull Paradise, make it a barren wildernesse.</p>
            <p>By all this it appears, That as this day is a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall day,</hi> and this Honourable Assembly <hi>a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Assembly,</hi> so this Text is a <hi>Nationall Text,</hi> every way sutable for the occasion about which we are met. The Lord make it as profitable to you, as it is sutable for you. From the words thus explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I gather these four Doctrinall conclusions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101394:6"/>1. That God hath an absolute power over all Kingdoms and Nations, to pluck them up, pull them down, and destroy them as he pleaseth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That though God hath this absolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative over Kingdoms and Nations, yet he seldome useth this power, but first he gives warning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If that Kingdome against which God hath threatned destruction, repent and turn from their evill; God will not only not destroy that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but build it, and plant it. Or thus,</p>
            <p>Nationall Repentance will divert Nationall judgements, and procure Nationall blessings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That when God begins to build and plant a Nation, if that Nation do evill in Gods sight, God will repent of the good he intended to do unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is this,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That God hath an independent and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prerogative over all Kingdoms and Nations to build them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> or destroy them as he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>This is set forth in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by ocular demonstration. God bids <hi>Ieremy Arise and go down to the Potters house, &amp;c.</hi> them,<note place="margin">

This power of God over Kingdoms, hath two properties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is illimited and independent, which appears by three expressions in the Text 1. By these words, <hi>At what instant</hi>; which hold forth unto us, that God can destroy a Nation in an instant, in the very twinckling of an eye. In the morning the Sun shone upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> but before night it was destroyed with fire and brimstone. The old World was drowned (as <hi>Luther</hi> thinks) in the Spring time, when all things began to bud and blossome. The flood came suddenly, saith Christ,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101394:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it came <hi>de repente,</hi> according to the vulgar transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these words, when they least expected it. And on the contrary, God can in an instant make a Nation happy. The Israelites were in an instant brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi>;<note n="a" place="margin">

By these words— <hi>I shall speak.</hi> If God do but speak to destroy a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is presently destroyed: He spake the word, and the World was made; and if he speak the word, the World will return to its first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>If I bring a sword upon a land, and say, sword go through that land, so that I cut off man and beast from it. Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 14.17, 18. On the contrary, if God do but speak to plant a Nation, it is planted; for Gods <hi>benedicere,</hi> is <hi>benefacere.</hi> 3. This absolute power of God is likewise deciphered by three synonimicall expressions in the Text, <hi>To pluck up, pull down, and to destroy.</hi> Which three words do intimate, That God hath an illimited Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive over Kingdoms, and that he can <hi>overturn, overturn, overturn uhem,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.27. Or as <hi>Hugo</hi> glosseth upon the words, He can <hi>pluck up</hi> all mercies, <hi>pull down</hi> all judgments, and <hi>destroy</hi> them; that is, make an utter ruine of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This power of God, is universall. For the words run in generall, At what instant I shall speak concerning a <hi>Nation</hi>: not this or that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101394:8"/>
but a <hi>Nation</hi> indefinitely. There is no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome exempted from Gods jurisdiction, or that hath Letters Patents to priviledge it.

            <p>Though God hath this absolute power over Kingdomes and Nations, yet he seldome useth this power, but first he gives warning.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101394:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon his own people, but first he speaks before he strikes. First <hi>Verba,</hi> then <hi>Verbera,</hi> as it is in the Text. <hi>At what instant I shall speak, &amp;c. If that Nation concerning which I have pronounced, &amp;c.</hi> First God pronounceth a judgement before he executeth a judgment; he lightneth before he thundreth; he hangs out his white Flag of mercy, before his red Flag of utter defiance; first he shoots off his warning Peeces, before his murdering Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>And the Reasons are,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the World may take notice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> that all punishments and afflictions come not by chance, or fortune, but from the immediate hand of the great God. It is he that <hi>forms the light, and creates darknesse</hi>; it is he that <hi>makes peace, and creates evill, I the Lord do all these things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 45.7.</note> And therefore God gives warning to imprint this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: That there is no evill of punishment, but from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because God is loath to punish.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Minatur De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ut non puniat:</hi> they that minde mischiefe, give no warning. When <hi>Absalom</hi> intended to murder <hi>Amnon,</hi> he spake neither good nor bad unto him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.22. Neither would God reveale his intentions to destroy us, but only because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires not to destroy us. I reade of one that came to murder one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and by speaking these words, <hi>Hunc tibi pugionem mittit Senatus, detexit facinus fatuus, &amp; non implevit.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was seen whetting his sword, and by that, suspected and detected. But it is otherwise with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101394:11"/>
God, he gives many items, and sets many Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons on fire before he destroyes a Nation. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13. <hi>He puts his bow in the Cloud; Non sagittam, sed arcam,</hi> not his Arrow, but his Bow; the Bow cannot hurt us, but the Bow forewarns us of the Arrow; and the string of the Bow is to us-ward, to shew how unwilling God is to punish: He must first turn the Bow and put in the Arrow, before he can shoot. And as it is, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 7.12. <hi>If you will not turn, I will whet my sword, I will bend my Bow, and make ready my Arrow.</hi> First God whets his sword before he strikes, and bends his Bow before he shoots, his Arrow is unprepared, &amp;c. And all this, because he is a Father of mercies, and a father you know is loath to whip his child. <hi>I afflict not willingly,</hi> Lamen. 3.33. <hi>Fury is not in me, Isa.</hi> 27.4. It is your sinnes that put thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts in my hands. As a Woman brings forth her childe with pain, and a Bee never stings, but when he is provoked: So it is with our good God, He never punisheth, but when <hi>there is no remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. When God came to punish <hi>Adam,</hi> he came slowly, <hi>in the cool of the day</hi>; but when he commeth to shew mercy, he comes <hi>leaping over the hills,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>and skipping over the mountains.</hi> God was but six dayes in making the whole World, and yet as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, he was seven dayes destroying one City, the City of <hi>Iericho.</hi>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note>God gives warning for the glorification of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101394:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his justice. That all those persons and nations that are destroyed, may have no Apology, no excuse, but may be speechlesse at the great day of account, <hi>Ne dicant sibi non praedictum Cave.</hi> There is no Christian nation, shall be able to say, That God destroyed them, and yet never gave them warning. Read the second and third Chapters of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>; observe Christs warning to the seven Churches.

            <p>If this be Gods ordinary course,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> Let us admire and adore the patience of God towards our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in particular, and towards this Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, in which we live: A Nation not worthy to be beloved, A Nation as ripe for destruction, as any other Nation. How many Tapers hath God set on fire? How many white Flags of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath God hung out? How often hath he shot off his warning peeces, to forewarne this Nation, that God would <hi>pluck it up, pull it down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it. Ionathan</hi> shot three Arrowes, not to hurt <hi>David,</hi> but to help <hi>David</hi> by foretelling him of <hi>Sauls</hi> murderous intention against him; But God hath shot not only three, but eight Arrowes, to forewarne, and forearme us. The Lord awaken our secure hearts, to the consideration of these things: God hath spoken eight wayes to this Nation, by all which he hath intimated his intention to destroy us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath spoken unto us by the voice of his Ministers, that with one mouth and lip, have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101394:12"/>
foretold us of desolation, and destruction. It hath beene the constant voice of Gods faithfull Servants, from the Pulpit, for these many yeares early and late. Now this voice is not to be slighted; <hi>For surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his Servants the Prophets, Amos</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath spoken to us by the voice of his lesser judgements. For God hath two sorts of judgements, Rods and Scorpions: <hi>Footmen, and Horsemen,</hi> as it is expressed, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 12.4. And he deales with a Nation, as a Physitian with his Patient. If a lesser potion will not worke, the Physitian will prescribe a stronger. God hath sent many lesser judgements, The Small-pox, unseasonable Weather, the Plague in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate way; but these judgements have beene slighted and contemned; And lesser judgements contemned, are Harbingers to usher in greater: God threatneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.6. If his people will walk contrary to him, he will punish them seven times more: and afterwards he addes, That if they will not be reformed, he will punish them yet seven times more, and yet seven times more. Vers. 18.21, 24, 28. <hi>I, even I, will chastise you in fury, seven times more for your sins.</hi> As the ancient Consuls of <hi>Rome</hi> had Rods, and Axes, carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: Rods as ensignes of their lenity to penitent offenders; But Axes as tokens of their severity, against incorrigible offenders: So God hath his Rods, and his Axes, his puning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101394:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Knife, and his Axe. If his pruning Knife will not amend us, his Axe will hew us down, and cast us into the fire.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath spoken to us by the death of his godly Servants. <hi>For the righteous perish, and no man layeth it to heart, and mercifull men are taken away; none considering that the righteous is taken away, from the evill to come, Isa.</hi> 57.1. Thus <hi>Methusalem</hi> that godly Patriarch died, the very yeere the flood came. And his name signifieth, <hi>A messenger of death</hi>; His death did presage the flood. Thus <hi>Austin</hi> was taken away by death, immediately before the sacking of <hi>Hippo</hi> where he lived. <hi>Paraeus</hi> before the taking of <hi>Heilderberg. Luther</hi> a little before Warres came into <hi>Germany,</hi> as he himselfe did fore-signifie at his death. Thus the death of Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> was a fore-runner of the ruine of <hi>Italy.</hi> The many Reverend Preachers, <hi>The Chariots, and Horsemen of Israel,</hi> that in these few yeares are gone to their graves in peace; are as so many blazing Comets to portend our ruine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God hath spoken to us by the voice of other Protestant Nations beyond the Seas, that have drunk deepe of the Cup of Gods wrath. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, that in a certaine Egyptian Temple, there was a Statue built for <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> (this was he that besieged <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and was afterwards slaine by his sonnes) and upon this Statue was this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Look upon me, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101394:13"/>
learn to be righteous.</hi> Me thinks I heare <hi>Rochell, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> saying: Oh <hi>England</hi> look upon us, and learn to be righteous. God will not alwayes make you like <hi>Goshen,</hi> when we are plagued as <hi>Egypt:</hi> make you like <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, when we are drowned with a flood of miseries: make you like <hi>Gideons</hi> dry Fleece, when we are like his wet Fleece, bedewed with sorrow and lamentation. You must not look alwayes to drink so deep of the Cup of prosperity, when we have drunk so deep of the Cup of adversity. God hath made us examples to you; but if you amend not, God will make you your selves the next examples. It is a most true saying: <hi>Legimus Historias, ne ipsi fiamus historia.</hi> If you will not learne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse by our History, God will make you the next History. <hi>Discite justitiam moniti &amp; non temnere Divos.</hi> This is a loud and powerfull voyce.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God speaks now more neerly unto us, by the bloudy rebellion that is in <hi>Ireland</hi>; The sword that is there drawn, is like the Comet, that for a whole yeer hung over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the likenesse of a fiery flaming sword. This sword is Gods warning peece to <hi>England:</hi> It is like <hi>Tamberlaines</hi> red Flag, threatning ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation to us; For it is an old saying, <hi>He that would England win, must with Ireland first begin.</hi> A Serpent, the neerer it is, the more dangerous it is. The sword is now come very neere us: It is

like a Serpent in our bosomes: The Lord awaken our sleepy spirits. God hath 3. swords. The <hi>sword</hi> of the Angel, which is the plague: the <hi>sword</hi> of the Spirit which is his Word: and the <hi>sword</hi> of the Enemy. We have been wofully massacred with the first sword. The Plague hath been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously upon our bodies, but the plague of sin still remaines upon our soules; this sword hath done little good. If the sword of the Spirit will not now at last cut down our sinnes, we must expect the sword of the enemy to cut us down, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God now also speakes unto us by the many sad divisions, and unhappy fractions that are in Church and State. <hi>A Kingdome divided against it selfe, cannot stand.</hi> It is observeable, that scarce ever any great enemy entred this Kingdome, but when it was at Schisme and division within it selfe. <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, that nothing gave the <hi>Romans</hi> more advantage against the ancient <hi>Brittains</hi> then this, <hi>Quod factionibus &amp; studijs trahebantur.

            <p n="7">7. God speakes unto us by the great demur and delay of the reformation of the Church. For the Childe of reformation is come to the birth; but there wants strength to bring it forth. This is a signe, That there are some great obstructions in the Kingdome, that hinder the birth of this much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Childe. And it shrewdly presageth, as if God had begunne to repent of the good, that hee hath begun to doe for us; And that, it will be with us, as it was with <hi>Tamar,</hi> in the time of her travell, <hi>Genes.</hi> 38.28,29. <hi>Zarah</hi> first puts forth his hand out of the Wombe, but afterwards drew it in againe, and <hi>Pharez</hi> came out in his stead. So it gives us cause to feare, least the Childe of Mercy should goe backe into the Wombe againe, and the Childe of judgement come forth in his stead.</p>
            <p n="8">8. God hath spoken to us by the voice of our owne consciences. There is no man that lives in any knowne sinne, but his conscience hath often told him as <hi>Abner</hi> did <hi>Ioah, Will not this sinne bring bitternesse in the latter end?</hi> And as <hi>Reuben</hi> to his Brethren, <hi>Did I not tell you of this aforehand?</hi> That this sinne would bring you to hell. There is a Light which God hath set up in all our soules, which is as a Beacon, set on fire, to give notice of Gods Wrath and Vengeance. This light is Conscience,<note place="margin">

            <p>And thus you see how many waies, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven warning to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now I beseech you, <hi>Let the long-suffering, and goodnesse of God, drive us to repentance.</hi> This is the use the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> makes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. which is the more to be laid to heart, because that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> pickes out this exhortation from out of all the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> as one of the choisest, and urgeth it upon those, to whom he wrote, as you may read, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And account the long suffering of the Lord, is salvation; even as our beloved Brother</hi> Paul <hi>also hath written unto you.</hi> Now I conceive, this is no where written, but in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. Let not that which is our salvation (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith) become our damnation. Let us follow the example of <hi>Noah, Heb.</hi> 11.7. Noah <hi>by faith being warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with fear prepared an Ark, to the saving of his house, &amp;c. Noah</hi> had but one warning, and that of a judgement, which had no print in nature: But wee have had eight kindes of warnings, and there are many prints and foot-steps of Gods judgements amongst us. O let us beleeve these Voices of God and let faith worke feare, and feare worke care to prepare an Arke, before the Floud comes. Let us be amended by Gods war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-peeces, lest we be consumed by his murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-peeces.</p>

               <hi>Gods warnings are in Gods keeping.</hi> No man hath a locke and key of Gods patience. Hee is <hi>long-suffering,</hi> but not <hi>alwaies suffering,</hi> and how long he will suffer, no man knows. Sometimes God is warning of a people 120. yeers, as he was the old world. Sometimes but 40. yeeres, as he dealt with the Jews, before the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Sometimes but 40. dayes, as in <hi>Ninive's</hi> case. Sometimes but one night as in <hi>Lots</hi> case, who had warning of the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but the night before. We in this Nation have had many yeers warning. I feare me, the Taper is almost burnt out: That the Sun of our prosperity is ready to set. And that the houre-glasse of our happinesse is almost run out. This is our last warning. Mistake me not; I doe not prophecy what God will do; but what wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve God should doe, and what wee may justly expect he will doe, and what wee ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, if hee should doe. Let us amend now, or never; before the day of Mercy be past, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the draw-Bridge be taken up. It may be too late the next yeer.</p>

            <p n="1">1. They will <hi>necessitate our condemnation.</hi> For there are three degrees of Gods wrath. His threatning wrath, his punishing wrath, and his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101394:15"/>
condemning Wrath. And this is Gods Methode. First, He threatneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before he punisheth: And if his threatning anger reforme us, wee shall never feele his punishing anger; but if his threatnings prevaile not, wee shall certainly feele his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anger. And if neither threats, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments prevaile, nothing remains but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Wrath. <hi>Si non audies vocem misericordiae, senties vocem judicij.

            <p n="2">2. They will <hi>aggravate</hi> our condemnation: For as a childe in the Mothers womb, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it is in the wombe, before it comes forth, the bigger the childe will be, and the more pain it will put the Mother unto. So the longer God keeps in his wrath, and is patient toward a Nation, the bigger the childe of wrath will be, when it comes forth, and the greater will be our misery and affliction. This Metaphor God himselfe useth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 42.14. <hi>I have a long time holden my peace, I have been still, and refrained my selfe; now will I cry like a travelling woman, I will destroy, and devoure at once.</hi> Though God hath <hi>leaden feet,</hi> yet he hath <hi>iron hands.</hi> The longer he is before hee strikes, the heavier the blow will be, when hee strikes.

The wrath and punishments which sinne hath twisted, Repentance will untwist. Sinne is as a thicke Cloud, stopping the Sun-shine of Gods mercy; but if we turne from sinne, this will melt the cloud, and cause the Sonne of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to shine upon us. Sinne, it is as a Divell in the Aire, to hinder our prayers from ascending; but if we turne from sinne, this will charme the Divell, and make Satan like lightning fall downe from Heaven. Sinne is like so many great peeces of Ordnance, planted and charged upon high mountaines, ready to shoote downe Cities and Kingdomes: But if we turne from sinne, this will take away the force of these Cannons, and make them as Paper-shot. Sinne is a wall of separation betweene God and us: To turne from sinne, will breake downe this wall. Sinne is the great make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betweene God, and man: Sinne dissolveth

To turne from sinne, is a key to unlock all the chests of Gods mercies. It is <hi>Clavis viscerum Dei,</hi> A preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive against all misery. Oh the divine Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, and omnipotent efficacie of Repentance! This is that Raine-bow, which if God seeth shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our hearts, he will never drowne our soules. That starre which will bring us to Christ.

made them the members of a Harlot. What sin is there under the cope of Heaven, whereof any Nation is guilty, which we have not ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to our selves? Let us weepe for the beastly drunkennesse of this Nation: But why do I call it beastly? for generally beasts are sober: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a name inferiour to beasts, for so it makes a man for the time.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aust. Epist</hi> 6 4.</note> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> saith, that in his days drunkennesse was growne to that heigth, as that there was no remedy against it, but by calling of a Synod. And in our dayes it is growne to that Gyant-like bignesse, as that there is no hope of redresse, but in the Parliament. Woe to this Land because of this sinne; this is that which will make us unable to stand before our enemies, and to stagger like a drunken man. For this sin God gives a Land over to the spirit of giddinesse. Let us weepe for the blasphemous swearing that is in the Nation, wherein (if in any thing) there is a pride taken in offending God, for other benefit of it I know none.</p>
            <p>For this sinne the land mourneth, and let us mourne. Weepe for the adultery and fornication, which as an Epidemicall disease hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the Nation.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> 
               <hi>Whoremongers, and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> If man will not, God will. He that divorceth himselfe from his wife, and joyns himselfe to a harlot, God will divorce himself from such a man, and divorce his mercies and blessings from him. VVeepe for the covetousnes of the Nation. This sinne is the root of all evill:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101394:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for this sinne God will root out a Nation. He that is swallowed up with earth, (as <hi>Corah,</hi> and his company) his eares stopped with earth, his heart stuffed with earth, God will give him earth enough when he dyes; and they that love earth so immoderately, are likely to have little enough of Heaven. Weepe for the oppression, Extortion, Bribery, Lying, Griping, Usury, Cousenage and Deceit in trading. These sinnes will cause a fourth <hi>Ocean</hi> to encompasse this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, and that is an <hi>Ocean of misery.</hi> Let us shed teares for the innocent blood that is shed in the Land; for the divellish pride that is amongst us: Pride of heart, pride of apparell, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the fashions of every Nation almost. How justly may wee expect, that God should make us slaves to that Nation, whose fashions we so eagerly follow? Mourne for the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of our Christian Sabbath-day: how can we expect that God should give us rest in this Land, if we will not give him a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> a day of rest? Oh, let our eyes gush downe with rivers of teares! Oh that our heads were fountaines of teares for the Idolatry (that Land-devouring sinne of Idolatry) for the superstition, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, the contempt of the Gospel, and of the Ministers, and Ministery of it that raignes amongst us! It is time for God to deprive us of <hi>Manna,</hi> when we begin to be weary of it; the time may come we may have Sermons few enough, that neglect them so much as some doe.

The time would faile, if I should make a catalogue of our Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinnes.

Let us weepe, because we cannot weepe, let our hearts weepe, because our eyes cannot weep. To move your hearts a little more, suffer mee to propound three examples. 1. The example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was so zealous for the preservation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that by an humble importunity he brought God down to these terms, that if there had beene ten Wheat-ears in <hi>Sodome,</hi> all the Tares should have been spared for these ten mens sake. And when God was gone from <hi>Abraham,</hi> he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so solicitous for the good or <hi>Sodome</hi>; that (as <hi>Luther</hi> thinks) he could not sleepe all night. I am sure the Scripture saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>He gate up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord, and he looked toward Sodom,</hi> to see what was become of his Prayers. If <hi>Abraham</hi> did thus much for <hi>Sodome,</hi> for wicked <hi>Sodome</hi>; ought not you to be much more zealous for the Protestants in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who professe the same faith, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101394:23"/>
the same Government with us in <hi>England?</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Neh. 1.3, 4 5.</note> Let me offer the example of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who though for his owne particular he was in great prosperity, and in great favour at the Court; yet when he heard of the afflict on and misery of the people of God at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee sate downe and wept, and mourned, and fasted, and never desisted, till hee had obtained leave to goe and helpe his brethren at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> 3. I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the example of <hi>Hierome,</hi> who was writing a Commentary upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi>;<note place="margin">

            <p>There is one Bucket more, the last,<note place="margin">7.</note> but not the least; and that is the consideration of the Lord Jesus Christ. His body was rent and torne for us. Oh, let this rend and teare our hearts that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we should sinne against such a Christ! His bloud was poured forth as a sacrifice for our sins. Oh, let us pour forth our tears, for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences against him! Beloved in the Lord; This is a day wherin we ought to make conscience to get our hearts affected with deep sorrow for sin; otherwise we do but take Gods name in vain. Now there is no way more powerfull to produce this effect, then by going to mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> and by burying our selves in the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ crucified. There is a story of an Earle called <hi>Elzearus,</hi> that was much given to immoderate anger;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In vita e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus apud Surium.</hi>
               </note> and the means he used to cure this disordered affection, was by studying of Christ, and of his patience in suffering the injuries and affronts that were offered unto him; and he never suffered this meditation to passe from him, before he found his heart transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the similitude of Jesus Christ. Wee are all sick of a hard and stony heart; and if ever we desire to be healed of this soule damning disease, let us have recourse to the Lord Jesus Christ; and never leave meditating of his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings

               <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond duty is Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> The second duty wherein wee must expresse our turning to God is <hi>Reformation.</hi> Humiliation is not sufficient without Reformation.

Some turne like the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, which way the winde bloweth; which way soever preferment goes, that way they turne: Many turn Neurers: Many turne from Christs side, to be of Antichrists side; Many turne cold and Icy for God and his Church: Some are like unto the <hi>Chamelion,</hi> that will change it selfe into any colour but white.

that this day might be the conversion of some sinner, that they may be able to say, <hi>From such a fasting day, I began to turn unto God</hi>! Oh that this Fasting-day might be a Festivall-day to the Angels in Heaven; who rejoyce at the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a sinner! Oh that some <hi>Zacheus</hi> would make restitution this day! That some Prodigall childe would return to his Heavenly Father! God Almighty exceedingly delights to shew mercy to a penitent sinner. As a husband-man delights much in that ground, that after long unfruitfulnesse proves fruitfull, and calls his friends and neighbours, to behold that ground: As a Captain loves that Souldier, that once fled away cowardly, and afterwards returns and fights valiantly; Even so God is wonderfully inamoured with a sinner, that having once made shipwrack of a good conscience; yet at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and swims to Heaven upon the plank of Faith and Repentance. This is a notable provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to all wretched hard-hearted sinners to turn unto God by true Repentance. God is so farre from refusing you, that he rejoyceth in your conversion, and is more ready to receive you, then you are to come. And I may safely adde, That in some sense God delights more in a penitent Prodigall, then in one of his righteous children. As the good Shepheard rejoyced more in his lost sheep, then in his 99. sheep;<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> And the good Woman in her lost groat; And the good Father in his lost sonne, more then in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101394:26"/>
the sonne that went not astray. It is true, that <hi>Innocency of life</hi> is better, simply and absolutely considered, than <hi>Repentance:</hi> And it is more to be desired <hi>to live without sin,</hi> than to have grace <hi>to repent after sin.</hi> As a whole Garment is better than a rent Garment, and yet a rent Garment may be so handsomely pieced together, that there shall be little difference between that and a whole Garment. A penitent sinner, that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly apprehends the great mercy of God in pardoning so great a sinner as he was; the sense of this distinguishing love of God towards him, raiseth up his heart to a higher pitch of zeal, and enables him to draw neer to God with more affection, and fervently to be more tender of sin, and to do, and suffer more for God many times, than those that are more righteous than he is. As suppose, two men at Sea, the one comes safely to shore without danger, the other escapes to shore not without great hazard and perill of life: He that comes without hazard hath more cause simply to be thankfull; yet ordinarily, he that had the greater danger, out of sense of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, will return more praise than the other. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more than all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, because he was a greater sinner than all the other Apostles, and had obtained greater mercy. Therefore <hi>Mary Magdalen loved much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause much was forgiven her</hi> We never reade that the blessed Virgin ever came to wash the Feet of Christ with her tears. But <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101394:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinner she did it, and she comes first to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and afterwards (as some report) she spent 30. yeers in <hi>Gallia Narbonensi</hi> in weeping for her sins. <hi>Gregory</hi> brings the example of <hi>David,</hi> who after he had obtained pardon for murdering <hi>Vriah,</hi> and committing adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> fell a longing after the water of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> But when the water was brought, <hi>He poured it forth before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>and would not drink of it, because it hazarded the lives of his men.</hi> Observe how tender of sin <hi>David</hi> was after his Repentance. He that before had spilt innocent blood, is now troubled in conscience, for putting the lives of his men in jeopardy: He that before longed for <hi>another mans wife,</hi> doth now repent, for desiring <hi>another mans water. Bernard</hi> brings the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> who before his denyall, considently told Christ, <hi>Though all for sook him, yet he would not</hi>; Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he had repented of his denying of Christ, he was so tender, that when Christ purposedly asked him three times, <hi>Lovest thou me more than these?</hi> he answers not comparatively, as before, but positively; <hi>Onely Lord thou knowest I love thee.</hi> And this is another provocation to exhort all sinners to lay hold upon this holy Anchor, this wrath-charming Repentance. Come all ye prodigall children, all ye lost sheep that have gone astray: Behold your Heavenly Father is not onely ready, but joyfull to receive you; and if rightly understood, more joyfull, than in his faithfull Children. Was

there ever mercy like to this! Oh that we had hearts to embrace it! And the greater any man is in estate, and parts, the more honour God shall have, if such a man will turn to God this day.

            <p>If you that are the representative Body of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Nation, as you stand under this relation, be reformed, the Nation it self may be said to be reformed. For you are the Nation representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, virtually, and eminently; you stand in the place of the whole Nation; and if you stand for Gods cause, the whole Nation doth it in you. Oh let it not be said, that the Reformers of others need Reformation themselves! If the eye be dark, how great is that darknesse, &amp;c. If the Salt that seasoneth other things, be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, wherewithall shall it be seasoned? This is the first way.</p>
            <p>The second way to reform a Nation, is when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you that are the representative Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do, as much as in you lyeth, to reform the Nation you represent. This is a duty that God requires and expects from your hands. It was the complaint of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehe. 3, 1.</note> that <hi>the Nobles of</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koah <hi>did not put their necks to the yoak of the Lord,</hi> this was a great blemish to them. Let not, I beseech you, the like brand of infamy be cast upon any of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101394:28"/>
you. It cannot be denied but that this Nation needs Reformation, not onely in reference to the Common-wealth, but also to the Church. The Prophet in the ninth verse, compares a Nation to a <hi>House</hi> that needs building, and to an <hi>Orchard</hi> that needs planting. And sure it is, that the House of this Nation is much out of repair: the House of the Lord lieth waste, and there is much rubbish in it. Many pollutions have crept into our Doctrine, much defilement into our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, many illegall innovations have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon us; the very posts and pillars of this House, many of them are rotten, the stones are loose and uncemented; the House exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly divided and distracted with diversity of opinions; the very foundation is ready to shake, and the House to fall down about our ears. The Garden of this Nation is over grown with weeds; and there are many not onely unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but hurtfull trees planted in this Garden. Now this is the great work that the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at your hands, Oh ye Worthies of <hi>Israel</hi>! To stub up all these unprofitable Trees, and to repair the breaches of Gods House, to build it up in its beauty, according to the pattern in the Mount, and to bring us back not onely to our <hi>first Reformation</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, but to <hi>reform the Reformation it self.</hi> For we were then newly crept out of Popery, and (like unto men that come newly out of prison, where they have been long detained) it was impossible but our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

should smell a little of the Dungeon from whence we came. It is said of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that when he came first out of the Grave,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1 1.44.</note> 
               <hi>He came forth bound hand and foot with Grave-clothes, and his face was bound about with a Napkin.</hi> So it was with us in our first Reformation: it was a most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and glorious work, like the resurrection from the Grave: but yet notwithstanding we came out of this Grave bound hands and feet with our Grave clothes, and eyes-blinding Napkins; we brought many things out with us which should have been left behinde. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ rose from the dead, and left all his <hi>linnen clothes</hi> behinde him.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.5.</note> So must we bury all superstitious Ceremonies in the grave of oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perfect a Reformation according to the Word of God. And as our Saviour Christ, in the place forementioned,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11 44.</note> commanded his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to unbinde <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and to take away his Grave-clothes. Oh that you also would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Apostles of Christ, the faithfull and learned Ministers of this Kingdome to meet in a free Nationall Synod, for to inform you about the taking away of these grave clothes, and eies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinding Napkins, or whatsoever else shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be prejudiciall to the piety and purity of of Gods Worship. But then I do most earnestly beseech you to take heed that those whom you call to this Synod, be not like unto the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls and Prelates who met at <hi>Rome,</hi> to consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reformation of the Church,<note place="margin">

That they were like unto Foxes that came to sweep a house full of dust with their tails, and instead of sweeping out the dust, they swept it all about the house, and made a great smoke for the while, but when they were gone, the dust fell all down again.

            <p>That when God begins to build and plant a Nation; if that Nation do evill in Gods sight, God will unbuild, pluck up, and repent of the good he intended to do unto it. This is a point of great concernment, expressely set down in the tenth verse.

               <note place="margin">Ef. 26.</note> As many amongst us truely religious, as in any place in the world, of the like bignesse. But yet the Bulk of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are wicked, and their hearts are not as yet prepared to the yoke of the Lord. <hi>Oderunt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula pietatis.</hi> They are unreformed themselves; and it is no wonder they are so opposite to a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Reformation. It may be said of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> did once say of his people, <hi>The Prophets prophesie falsly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 31.</note> 
               <hi>and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so; and what will ye do in the end thereof?</hi> Now it is this sin of the Land that weakens your hands, and divides you sometimes one from another, and keeps you from perfecting this great work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And I conceive no way better to remedy this, than by sending a faithfull and painfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101394:33"/>
thorowout the Kingdom. For if you will be pleased to observe, you will finde that those places which are rud'st and most ignorant, most irregular; and where the least Preaching hath been, are the greatest enemies to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a work worth, of serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Lord stir up your hearts to consider it, and open your eyes also, clearly to perceive that there are more with you, then against you; and that when God reformes a Nation, he doth not finde us prepared, but he makes us prepared. When God sheweth mercy to a Nation, there goeth power with the mercy to heal the Nation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>If when a Nation doth evill in Gods sight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> God will repent of the good he intended, &amp;c. Let us repent of our evils committed against God, that he may not repent of the good he intends to do unto us. Chuse which you will, If <hi>we repent,</hi> God will repent of <hi>the evill, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>we repent not,</hi> God will <hi>repent of the good, &amp;c.</hi> And suffer me to tell you. That when God begins to draw back his mercies from a Nation, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in a wofull plight, God repented that he made the old World; And what followed? The next news you hear, is, they were all drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He repented that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King, and the next news we hear, is, That he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from being King. He repented that he had brought the Israelites out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and thereupon he carries them back again, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101394:34"/>
swears that not one of them should enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that all their carkases should perish in the Wildernesse. It is God only that can build and plant a Nation. He is the only Architect that can build our waste places, and make up our dilapidations, though never so great; he is the only Gardner to pluck up our Weeds, and to plant usefull and fruitfull Trees in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard of this Nation. And if he please he can do it, and that in an instant with a word speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For so it is in the Text, <hi>At what instant I speak concerning a Nation to build, and to plant it</hi>; Though the House of the Kingdom be never so much out of repair, God can in an instant build us, and plant us, and make us better then ever. But if God begin to repent of what he hath done, woe to the Nation,<note place="margin">Psa. 1:7 1.</note> 
               <hi>For except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that build it, in vain to rise up early, and to sit up late, &amp;c.</hi> God will unravell all, and though he hath brought us neer <hi>Canaan,</hi> he will carry us back again, and make us to tarry forty yeers for a Reformation, or it may be he will at last carry us back again to <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the last and greatest curse,<note place="margin">Deut. 28 68.</note> threatned against the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and it is the greatest misery that can come upon this Nation.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if we turn from our evill wayes, God will perfect his building, and finish his plantation, he will make us a glorious Paradise, an habitation fit for himself to dwell in; he will set up his ordinances after a purer

manner, and watch over us for good from the beginning of the yeer to the end of it. Oh that these words of mine might be as goads, and as nails to fasten this point upon your hearts, that it may take deep impression, and abide for ever upon your spirits. It may be some will say, That this doctrine is as common as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: It is true, It is <hi>a common high way,</hi> but it is <hi>the high way to heaven.</hi> And though it be not a Doctrine to glut your ears, yet <hi>it is savoury meat, such as Iacob provided for Esau, whereby he obtained the blessing.</hi> Turn or burn for ever in Hell. Let every man labour first to turn himself, and then let us endeavour to reform one another. There is a great complaint in the Kingdom. The Ministers complain of their people, that they are facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, seditious, covetous, dis-respectfull of the Ministery, &amp;c. And that because they do not reform; therefore the judgements of God are not turned away from us. The people complain of their Ministers, that they are dumb dogs, greedy dogs, which can never have enough, and that they are superstitious, more for pomp then substance; and that untill the scandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters be removed, Gods heavy hand will never be removed from us. The rich complain of the poor, that they are lazy, and theevish, The poor of the rich, that they are proud and hard-hearted. The superiours cry out against their inferiours, and the inferiours against the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. And because every man expects when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101394:35"/>
his neighbour should turn, hence it cometh to passe that no man in particular turns. We look for that in another, which we forget to do in our selves. I know no way to reconcile this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but by raising a new division, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading all sorts of people to strive, who should be the first in turning to God, who should first get into Christ, who should first get into the Ark. Every man strives for worldly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Oh let us strive for this spirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency! It is no pride in this to go one before another. He is the humblest that goeth first. And being reformed in our own persons, let us in the next place labour to reform one another. We are all of one nation, of one body, one flesh, one Church. There is a Nationall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, a Morall Communion, a Politicall Communion, a Spirituall Communion amongst us. I may adde, There is a Communion in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. We are all in the same condemnation. Let us labour to pitty one another, and to turn one another. Let every man search what drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, what swearer, what adulterer, &amp;c. He hath in his House, and either cause the sin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the person, or both sin and person from his house.</p>
            <p>First reforme your own families, and then you will be the fitter to reforme the family of God. Let the Master reforme his servant, the Father his childe, the Husband his Wife. Will a man keepe a servant in his house all night, if he were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101394:35"/>
assured he would murther him before morning? Such a servant is sinne, It will murther soul and bodie. Let us cast it away from our selves, and from our families.</p>
            <p>There is one Motive more, and that is from the ayd you are sending to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to distressed <hi>Ireland,</hi> that at this instant calls to <hi>England</hi> with aloud cry for help and assistance. I doubt not, but you are sensible that delay is as bad as deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all almost. I shall offer only one Text to be considered on when you send forth your help, and that is <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 9. <hi>When the Host goeth forth against their enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.</hi> If sin be in the Host, it will make you turn your backs upon your enemies; Turn to God, and he will make your enemies turn their backs upon you.</p>
            <p>But it is not in my power to turn,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> unlesse I were praedestinated?</p>
            <p>I answer with Master <hi>Bradford,</hi> that we must first go to the Grammar-schoole of Repentance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> before we can be admitted to the University of Praedestination. It is not a dispute about Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination that will turn away Gods wrath, but it is the practise of humiliation and Reformation. It is most certain, that God is not the cause of any mans damnation. He found us sinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> but made none sinners. <hi>Thy perdition is of thy selfe, oh Israel</hi>! And it is as certain, that it is not in the power of man by nature to convert himselfe. And that therefore God commands
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101394:36"/>
what we cannot perform, that we might therby take notice what we should do, and what we once could do in <hi>Adam,</hi> and where we should go to get power to do that which we cannot do of our selves. Go to the Word, that hath a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power. God oftentimes in speaking gives power. Go to prayer, for converting Grace. Pray with <hi>Austine, Lord give me what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest, and command what thou wilt.</hi> It is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rule observed by the same Author. <hi>That there is nothing required of us from God as a duty in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is either promised by God as a gift, or some of Gods Saints have prayed for it as a gift.</hi> As for example. God commands us to turn unto him, but <hi>Ieremy</hi> prayes for it; <hi>Turn us, oh Lord, and we shall be turned.</hi> And God promiseth it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. Let us therefore be sensible of our inability to keepe the commandement of the text; and let us beleeve in his promise, to give us power to keepe it, and pray for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promise.</p>
