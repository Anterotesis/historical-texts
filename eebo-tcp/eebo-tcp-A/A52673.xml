            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and now leaving Her strip, I come to Her Person; and as She came
to the Crown by the decease of Her Brother and Sister: under
<hi>Edward</hi> She was His, and one of the darlings of Fortune, for besides
the consideration of Bloud, there was between these two Princes,
a concurrency, and sympathie in their Natures, and affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with the Celestiall bond (Conformity in Religion) which
made them one, and friends, for the King ever called Her His sweetest
and deerest Sister, and was scarce His own man, She being absent,
which was not so between Him and the Lady <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnder His Sister, She found Her condition much altered: for it
was resolved, and her destiny had decreed to set Her an Apprentice
in the School of affliction, and to draw Her thorough the Ordeall
fire of tryall, the better to mould and fashion Her, to rule, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty:
which finished, and Fortune calling to minde, that the
time of Her servitude was expired, gave up Her Indentures, and
therewith delivered up into Her Custody a Scepter, as a reward for
Her patience, which was about the twenty sixth yeer of Her Age;
a time in which (as for externals) She was full blown, so was She for
Her internals grown ripe, and seasoned with adversity, and in the
exercise of Her Vertue, for it seems Fortune meant no more, then to
shew Her a peece of Her variety, and changeablenesse of Her Nature,
and so to conduct Her Her destin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Felicity.</p>
            <p>She was of personge tall, of hair and complexion fair, and
therewith well favoured, but high nosed, of lymbs, and feature neat,
and which added to the lustre of those exterior Graces, of Stately,
and Majestick comportment, participating in this more of Her Father
then Mother, who was of an inferiour allay, plausable, or as the
<hi>French</hi> hath it, more debonare, and affable, vertues, which might well
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97847:3"/>
suite with Majesty, and which descending, as Hereditary to the
Daughter, did render Her of a more sweeter temper, and endeared
Her more to the love and liking of the people, who gave Her the
name and fame of a most gratious and popular Prince, the atrocity
of Her Fathers nature, being rebated in Hers, by the Mothers swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inclinations for to take, and that no more then the Character out
of His own mouth, He never spared man in His anger, nor woman
in His lust.</p>
            <p>If we search further into Her intellectuals and abilities, the whole
course of Her government desciphers them to the admiration of
posterity, for it was full of magnanimity tempered with Iustice, and
Piety, and to speak truely, noted but with one act or taint, all Her
deprivations either of life or liberty, being legall, and necessitated:
She was learned (Her sex, and the time considered) beyond common
belief; for letters about this time, and somewhat before, began to be
of esteem, and in fashion, the former ages being overcast with the
mists and fogs of the <hi>Roman</hi> ignorance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it was the maxime that
overruled the foregoing times, that ignorance was the mother of
devotion.</p>
            <p>Her warres were along time more, in the auxiliary part, in assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of forraign Princes, and States, then by invasion of any, till
common pollicy advised it for a safer way, to strike first, and broad,
then at home, to expect the warre, in all which she was felicious, and
victorious.</p>
            <p>The change and alteration of Religion upon the instant of Her
accession (the smoak and fire of Her Sisters Martyrdomes, scarcely
quenched) was none of Her least remarkable accounts. But the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and establishment thereof, with the means of Her subsistance
amidst so powerfull enemies abroad, and those many domestique
practises, were (methinks) works of inspiration, and of no humane
providence, which on Her Sisters departure, She most religiously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
ascribing the glory of Her deliverance to God alone,
for She received the news both of the Queens death, and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
by the generall consent of the House, and the publique
suffrage of the people, whereat, falling on her knees (after a good

acted more by her own Princely rules and judgements, then by their
own wills and appetites, which she observed to the last: for we
finde no <hi>Gaveston, Vere,</hi> or <hi>Spencer,</hi> to have swayed alone, during forty
four yeers, which was a well settled, and advised maxime, for it
valued her the more, it awed the most secure, and it took best with

            <p>The principall note of her raign, will be, that she ruled much by
faction and parties, which her self, both made, upheld, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as her own great judgement advised, for I disassent from the
common received opinion, that my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> was absolute
and above all in her Grace: and though I come somewhat short of
the knowledge of those times: yet (that I might not rove, and shoote
at random) I know it from assured intelligence, that it was not so,
for proof whereof (among many that I could present) I will both
relate, a short, and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, a known truth; And it was thus, <hi>Bawyer</hi>
a Gentleman of the Black-rod, being charged by her expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to look precisely to all admissions into the Privy-Chamber,
one day stayed a very gay Captain, and a follower of my Lord of
<hi>Leicesters,</hi> from entrance; for that he was neither well known, nor a
sworn servant to the Queen, at which repulse the Gentleman bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
high on my Lords favour, told him, he might perchance procure
him a discharge: <hi>Leicester</hi> coming into the Contestation, said publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(which was none of his want) that he was a Knave, and should
not continue long in his office; and so turning about to go into the
Queen, <hi>Bowyer</hi> (who was a bold Gentleman, and welbeloved) stept
before him, and fell at Her Majesties seet, related the story, and
humbly craves Her Graces pleasure, and whether my Lord of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
was King, or Her Majesty Queen, whereunto she replyed, with
her wonted oath (Gods death) my Lord, I have wisht you well, but
my favour is not so lockt up for you, that others shall not partake
thereof, for I have many servants, unto whom I have, and will at
my pleasure bequeath my favour, and like wise resume the same, and
if you think to rule here, I will take a course to see you forth coming,
I will have heere but one Mistris, and no Master; and look that no
ill happen to him, least it be severely required at your hands, which
so quelled my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> that his fained humility, was long
after one of his best vertues; Moreover the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> then Lord
Chamberlain, was his profest Antagonist to his dying day; and for
my Lord of <hi>Hunsdone,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Sackvile,</hi> after Lord Treasurer
(who were all Contemporaries) he was wont to say of them, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97847:4"/>
they were of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and were <hi>Noli me tangeres,</hi> implying, that
they were not to be contested with, for they were indeed of the
Queens neer kindred; from whence, and in more instances I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that she was absolute and Soveraign Mistris of Her Graces:
and that all those, to whom, she distributed her favours, were never
more then Tenants at will, and stood on no better ground then her
Princely pleasure, and their own good behaviour; and this also I
present as a known observation, that she was (though very capable
of Councell) absolute enough in her own resolutions, which was
ever apparent even to her last, in that her aversation to grant Tyrone
the least drop of her mercy, though earnestly and frequently advised,
yea wrought onely by the whole Counsell of State, with very many
pressing reasons; and as the state of her Kingdom then stood (I may
speak it with assurance) necessitated Arguments.</p>
            <p>If we look into her inclination, as it is disposed either to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
or frugality, we shall finde in them many notable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
for all her dispensations were so poysed, as though discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Iustice had both agreed to stand at the beam, and see them
weighed out in due proportion, the maturity of her yeers, and
judgement meeting in a concurrency, and at such an age as seldome
lapseth to excesse.</p>
            <p>To consider them apart, we have not many presidents of her libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
or of any large donatives to particular men; my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>
Book of <hi>Parkes</hi> onely excepted, which was a Princely gift, and some
few more of a lesser size to my Lord of <hi>Leicester, Hatton,</hi> and others.
Her reward consisted chiefly in grants of Leases, of Offices, and
places of Indicature, but for ready money, and in any great summes,
she was very sparing, which we partly conceive was a vertue rather
drawn out by necessity, then her nature, for she had many layings
out, and to her last period. And I am of opinion with Sir <hi>Walter
Rawleigh,</hi> that those many brave men of our times, and of the <hi>Militiae,</hi>
tasted little more of her bounty, then in her grace, and good word
with their due entertainment, for she ever paid the Souldiers well,
which was the honour of her times, and more then her great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
of <hi>Spain</hi> could perform, so that when we come to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her frugality, the observation will be little more, then that
her bounty, and it were so woven together, that the one vvas suited
by an honourable vvay of spending, the other limited by a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
vvay of sparing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> action vve may call a mallady, and a Consumption of
her times: for it accompanied her to her end, and it vvas of so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
and vast an expence, that it drevv neer a distemperature of

and the <hi>Irish</hi> persecution, not ansvvering her expectation, and vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

vvarre vvhich did much disturbe, and mislead her judgement; and
the more for that it vvas a president, vvhich vvas taken out of her
ovvn Pattern; for as the Queen (by vvay of diversion) had at the
coming to the Crovvn, supported the revolted States of <hi>Holland,</hi> so
did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> turn the trick on her self tovvards her going
out, by cherishing the <hi>Irish</hi> rebellion, vvhere it falls into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

and grudge of the people, yet that truth may appear vvithout
retraction from the honour of so great a Princesse, It is manifest she
left more debts unpayed, taken upon the credit of her Privy-Seals,
then her Progenitors did, or could have taken up that vvay in a

to lay the burthen on that horse, that vvas best able to bear it, at
the dead lift, vvhen neither her receipts could yeild her relief at the

she received more, and vvith the love of the people, then any tvvo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97847:5"/>
of her predecessors, that took most, which was a Fortune strained
out of the Subject, through the plause ability of her Comportment,
and as I would say without offence the prodigall distribution of her
Graces to all sorts of Subjects, for I beleeve no Prince living that
was so tender of honour, and so exactly stood for the preservation
of soveraignty, that was so great a Courtier of her people, yea of
the Commons, and that stoopt and descended lower in presenting
her person to the publike view, as she past in her progresses and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations,
and in the ejaculation of her prayers on her people;
and truly though much may be given in praise of her magnanimity,
and there with comply with her Parliaments, and for all that come
off at last with honour and profit, yet must we ascribe some part of
the commendation to the wisedomes of the times, and the choice of
Parliament men, for I finde not that they were at any time given to
any violent or pertinatious dispute, elections being made of grave
and discreet persons, not factious and ambitious of fame, such as
came not to the house with a malevolent spirit of contention, but
with a preparation to consult on the publike good, rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
then contest with her Majesty, neither do I finde that the house
was at any time weakned and pestered with the admission of too
many young heads, as it hath been of later times, which remembers
me of Recorder <hi>Martins</hi> speech, about the tenth of our late Soveraign
Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> when there were accounts taken of forty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
not above twenty, and some not exceeding sixteen, which
moved him to say, that it was the ancient custome for old men to
make Laws for young ones, but that then he saw, the case altered,
and that there were children elected unto the great Councell of the
Kingdome, which came to invade and invert nature, and to inact
Laws to govern their Fathers: sure we are, the house alwayes took
the common cause into their consideration, and they saw the Queen
had just occasion, and need enough to use their assistance, neither do
I remember that the house did ever Capitulate or preferre their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
to the publike, &amp;c. The Queens necessities, but waited their
times, and in the first place gave their supply, and according to the
exigency of her affairs, yet failed not at last to obtain what they
desired, so that the Queen and her Parliaments had ever the good
Fortune to depart in love, and on reciprocall tearms, which are
considerations which have not been so exactly observed in our last
assemblies, as they might, and I would to God they had been for
considering the great debt lest on the King, and in what incumbrances
the house it self had then drawn him, his Majesty was not well used,
though I lay not the blame on the whole suffrage of the house, where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97847:6"/>
he had many good friends, for I dare avouch, had the house been
freed of half a dozen of populer and discontented persons, such
(as with the fellow that burnt the Temple at <hi>Ephesus)</hi> would be talked
of, though but for doing of mischief, I am confident the King had
obtained, that which in reason, and at his first accession, he ought
to have received freely, and without any condition, But pardon the
digression, which is here remembred, not in the way of aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in true zeal to the publike good, and presented in caveat to
future times, for I am not ignorant how the spirit of the Kingdome
now moves to make his Majesty amends on any occasion, and how
desirous the Subject is to expiate that offence at any rate, may it
please his Majesty gratiously to make tryall of his Subjects affection,
and at what price they now value his goodnesse and magnanimity.
But to our purpose, the Queen was not to learn, that as the strength
of her Kingdome consisted in the multitude of her Subjects, for the
security of her person rested in the love and fidelity of her people,
which she politiquely affected (as it hath been thought) somewhat
beneath the hight of her spirit, and naturall magnanimity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
it will be a true note of her providence, that she would alwayes
listen to her profit, for she would not refuse the informations of
mean persons, with purposed improvement, and had learned the
Phylosophy of <hi>Hoc ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re,</hi> to look into her own work, of the which
there is a notable example of one <hi>Carwarden</hi> an under Officer of the
custome house, who observing his time presented her with a paper,
shewing how she was abused in the under renting of her customes,
and therewithall humbly desired her Majesty to conceal him, for
that it did concern two or three of her great Councellors, whom
customer <hi>Smith</hi> had bribed with 200. a man, so to loose the Queen
2000. <hi>per annum,</hi> which being made known to the Lords, they gave
strickt order, that <hi>Carwarden</hi> should not have accesse to the back
stairs, till at last her Majesty smelling the craft, and missing <hi>Carwarden,</hi>
she sent for him back, and encouraged him to stand to his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the poor man did so handsomely, that within the space
of ten yeers, he brought <hi>Smith</hi> to double his rent, or to leave the
customes to new Farmers, so that we may take this also into obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that there were of the Queens Councell that were not in the
Catalogue of Saints.</p>
            <p>Now as we have taken a view of some particular notions of her
times, her nature, and necessities, it is not without the text, to give,
a short touch on the helps and advantages of her raign, which were
without paralell, for she had neither husband, brother, sister, nor
children to provide for, who as they are dependants of the Crown,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97847:6"/>
so do they necessarily draw maintenance from thence, and do often
times exhaust and draw deep especially when there is an ample fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of the bloud Royall, and of the Princes of the Bloud, as it
was in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, for then
when the Crown cannot, the publike ought to give them honourable
allowance, for they are the honour and hopes of the Kingdome, and
the publike which injoyes them, hath alike interest in them, with
the Father that begot them; and our Common-Law, which is the
heritance of the Kingdom, did ever of old provide ayds for the <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitures,</hi>
and the eldest daughter; so that the multiplicity of Courts,
and the great charge which necessarily follow a King, and Queen, a
Prince, and the Royall issue, was a thing which was not <hi>in rerum
natura,</hi> during the space of forty yeers, and which by time was worn
out of memory, and without the cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>deration of the present times,
Insomuch, that the aydes given to the late and right noble Prince
<hi>Henry,</hi> and to his sister the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were at first generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for impositions of a new Coynage. Yea the late impositions
for Knightwood (though an ancient Law) fell also into the imputation
of a tax of novelty, for that it lay long covered in the embers of
division, between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and forgotten, or
connived at by the succeeding Princes, so that the strangenesse of
the observation, and the difference of those latter raignes is; that
the Queen took up beyond the power of the Law, which fell not
into the murmure of the people, and her successors nothing but by
warrant of the Law, which neverthelesse was conceived (through
disuse) to be injurious to the liberty of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Now before I come to any further mention of her favorits (for
hitherto I have delivered, but some obvious passages, thereby to
prepare and smooth a way for the rest that follows) it is requisite
that I touch on the reliques of the other raign, I mean the body of
her sisters Councell of State, which she retained intire; neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
nor discontenting any, although she knew them averse to
her Religion (and in her sisters time perverse towards her person)
and private to her troubles and imprisonment: A prudence which
was incomparable with her sisters nature, for she both dissipated
and persecuted the major part of her brothers Councell, but this
will be of certainty, that how compliable soever, and obsequious
she found them, yet for a good space she made little use of their
Councells, more then in the ordinary course of the board: for she
held a dormant Table in her own Princely brest, yet she kept them
together, and their places without any suddain change, so that we
may say of them, that they were of the Court, not of the Councell,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97847:7"/>
for whilst she amazed them with a kinde of premissive disputation
concerning the points controverted by both Churches, she did set
down her own reservations, without their privity, and made all her
progressions gradations. But so that the tenents of her secrecy with
intent of her establishment, were pitcht before it was knovvn where
the Court would sit dovvn; neither do I finde that any of her sisters
Councell of state were either repugnant to her religion, or opposed
her doings <hi>(Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where besides the lickings of his own fingers, he got the King a
Masse of riches, and that not with the hazard, but the losse of his
fame and life, for the Kings Fathers sake. Certain it is, that his sonne
was left rich in purse and brain, which are good foundations, and
full to ambition, and it may be supposed, he was on all occasions
well heard of the King, as a person of marke and compassion in his
eye, but I finde not that he did put up for advancement, during <hi>Henry</hi>
the eights time, although a vast aspirer, and provident storier. It
seemes he thought the Kings raign was much given to the falling
sicknesse, but espying his time fitting, and the Soveraignty in the
hands of a pupill Prince, he thought he might as well, then put up
for it, as the best, for having then possession of bloud, and a purse,
with a head-peece of a vast extent, he soon got honour, and no
sooner there, but he began to side it with the best, even with the
Protector; and in conclusion got his, and his Brothers heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> still
aspyring, till he expired, in the losse of his own, so that posterity
may by reading the Father and the Grandfather, make judgement
of the sonne; for we shall finde that this <hi>Robert</hi> (whose originall we
have now traced the better to present him) was inheritor of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and craft of his Father; and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of the estate, of whom
hereafter we shall make some short mention.</p>
               <p>We take him now as he was admitted into the Court, and the
Queens favour, where he was not to seek to play his part well, and
dexteriously. But his play was chiefly at the forgame, not that he
was a learner at the latter, but he loved not the after wit, for they
report (and I think not untruely) that he was seldome behinde hand
with his Gamesters, and that they alwayes went away with the
losse.</p>
               <p>He was a very godly person, and singular well featured, and all
his youth well favoured, and of a sweet aspect, but high foreheaded,
which as I should take it, was of no discommendation: but towards
his latter end (which with old men, was but a middle age) he grew
high coloured and red faced; so that the Queen in this, had much
of her Father, for (excepting some of her kindred, and some few
that had handsome wits in crooked bodies, she alwayes took per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage
in the way of her election, for the people hath it to this day
in proverb, King <hi>Harry</hi> loved a man: Being thus in her grace, she
called to minde, the sufferings of his Ancestors, both in her Fathers

but long enjoyed her favour; and therewith, much what he listed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97847:8"/>
till time and emulation (the companions of great ones) had resolved
on his period, and to cover him at his setting in a cloud at <hi>Cornebury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
not by so violent a death, and by the fatall sentence of judicature, as
that of his Fathers, and Grandfathers was, but as it is suggested by
that poyson which he had prepared for others, wherein they report
him a rare Artist, I am not bound to give credit to all vulgar relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or to the libells of the times, which are commonly forced, and
falsified suitable to the moods, and humours of men, in passion, and
discontent, but that which leads me to think him no good man, is
(amongst others of known truth) that of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> death in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the marriage of his Lady yet living, which I forbear to
presse, in regard that he is long since dead, and others living, whom
it may concern.</p>
               <p>To take him in the observations of his Letters, and Writings
(which should best set him off) for such as fell into my hands, I never
yet saw a style or phrase, more seeming religious, and fuller of the
strains of devotion, and were they not sincere, I doubt much of his
well being, and I may fear he was too well seen in the Aphorismes
and principles of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> and in the reaches of <hi>Caesar
Borgia;</hi> and hitherto I have onely touched him in his Courtship. I
conclude him in his Lance, he was sent Governour by the Queen to
the united States of <hi>Holland,</hi> where we reade not of his wonders,

he came by degrees to a higher conversation vvith the chiefest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97847:9"/>
affairs of State, and Councels; but on the fall of the Duke he stood
some yeers in umbrage, and without imployment, till the State found
and needed his abilities, and though we finde not that he was taken
into any place, during <hi>Maries</hi> raign, unlesse (as some have said) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the last, yet the Councell on severall occasions made use of
him, and at the Queens entrance he was admitted Secretary of State,
afterwards he was made Master of the Court of Wards, then Lord
Treasurer, a person of most requisite abilities; and indeed the Queen
began then to need, and to seek out for men of both Garbs, and so
I conclude, and rank this great Instrument of State, amongst the
<hi>Togati,</hi> for he had not to do with the sword, more then as the great
pay-master, and Contriver of the Warre, which shortly followed,
wherein he accomplished much thorough his theoricall knowledge
at home, and his intelligence abroad, by unlocking the Councells
of the Queens enemies.</p>
               <p>We must now take (and that of truth) into observation, that
untill the tenth of her raign, her times were calm and serene, though
sometimes a little overcast, as the most glorious Sunne risings, are
subject to shadowings and droppings in, for the clouds of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
Vapors of the holy League, began then to disperse and threaten her
serenity; Moreover, she was then to provide against some intestine
storms, which began to gather in the very heart of her Kingdom, all
which had a relation, and correspondency, each with the other to
dethrone her, and to disturbe the publike tranquillity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
(as a principall work) the established Religion, for the name
of Recusant began then, and first to be known to the World, and
till then the Catholiques were no more then Church Papists, but
were commanded by the Popes expresse letters, to appear, and
forbear Church going, as they tender their holy Father, and
the holy Catholike Church their Mother: so that it seems the
Pope had then his ayms to take a true muster of his children,
but the Queen had the greater advantage, for she likewise took
tale of her apostate Subjects, their strength, and how many they
were that had given up their names unto <hi>Baal,</hi> who then by the
hands of some of his Prosilits fixed his Bulls on the Gates of <hi>Pauls,</hi>
which discharged her Subjects of all fidelity, and layed siege to the
received faith, and so under the vail of the next Successor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
the Catholike Religion, so that the Queen had then a new
task and work in hand, that might well awak her best providence,
and required a muster of men of Armes, as well as Courtships, and
Councels, for the times began then to be quick and active, fitter for
stronger motions, then those of the Carpet, and measure, and it will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97847:10"/>
be a true note of her magnanimity, that she loved a souldier, and
had a propension in her nature to regard, and alwayes to grace them,
which the Courtiers taking into observation, took it as an invitation
to winne honour, together with their Majesties favour, by exposing
themselves to the Warres, especially when the Queens, and the
affairs of the Kingdom stood in some necessity of a Souldier, for we
have many instances of the Sallies of the Nobility, and Gentry, yea
and out of the Court, and her Privy favorits (that had any touch or
tincture of <hi>Mars</hi> in their inclinations, and to steal away without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and the Queens privity, which had like to have cost some of
them dear, so predominant were their thoughts and hopes of honor
growing in them, as we may truly observe in the expositions of Sir
<hi>Philip Sydney,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Essex, Mountjoy,</hi> and divers others, whose
absence, and the manner of their cruptions, was very distastfull to
her: whereof I can here adde a true, and no impertinent Story,
and that of the last <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> vvho having tvvice or thrice, stoln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
into <hi>Britain</hi> (vvhere under Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> he had then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany)
vvithout the Queens leave and privity, she sent a Messenger
unto him, vvith a strict charge to the generall to see him sent home,
vvhen he came into the Queens presence, she fell into a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
demanding hovv he durst go over vvithout her leave, serve
me so quoth she once more, and I vvill lay you fast enough for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:

you, in the mean time see that you lodge in the Court (vvhich vvas
then at <hi>White-Hall)</hi> vvhere you may follovv your Book, read and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Warres.</p>
               <p>But to our purpose it fell out happily to those, and (as I may say)
to those times, that the Queen during the calm of her raign vvas
not idle, not rockt a sleep vvith security, for she had been very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in the Reparation, and Augmentation of her Shipping, and
Ammunition; and I knovv not, vvhether by a foresight of policy,

had received any affront from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that might deserve,

that he was one of the great allayes of the Austerian embracements,
for both himself and <hi>Stafford</hi> that preceded him, might well have
been compared to the fiend in the Gospel, that sowed his tares in

               <p>SIR <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> was somewhat of the Queens affinity, and
had likewise no incompetent issue, for he had also <hi>William</hi> his
Eldest, and since Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and Sir

men in their times, and places; but they were of the Court, and
Carpet, not led by the genious of the Camp.</p>
               <p>Between these two Families, there was (as it falleth out amongst
great Ones, and Competitors for favour) no great correspondency,
and there were some Seeds, either of emulation, or distrust, cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, which had they not been disjoyned in the residence of
of their persons, (as it was the Fortune of their employments) the

               <p>Surely, they would have broken out into some kinde of hostility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or at least they would have wrastled one in the other, like Trees, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled

exercises (the Queen and the old men being Spectators) which
ended in a flat quarrell amongst them all) and I am perswaded
(though I ought not to judge) that there were some reliques of this
fewd, that were long after the causes of the one Families (almost
utter) extirpation, and of the others improsperity: for it was a
known truth, that so long as my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> lived, who was the
main Pillar of the one side, as having married the Sister, none of
the other side took any deep rooting in the Court: though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they made their wayes to honour by their swords, and that
which is of more note (considering my Lord of <hi>Leicesters</hi> use of men
of Armes, being shortly after sent Governour to the revolted States,
and no Souldier himself) is that, he made no more accompt of Sir

               <p>SIR <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> was a goodly Gentleman, and of the sword, and
as he was of a very ancient descent, as an heir to many abstracts
of gentry, especially from <hi>Guy de Bryan</hi> of <hi>Lawhern,</hi> so was he of a
vast estate, and came not to the Court for want, and to these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts,
he had the endowments of courage, and height of spirit,
had it lighted on the allay of temper, and discretion the defect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
with a native freedome, and boldnesse of speech, drew him on
to a clouded setting, and laid him open to the spleen and advantage
of his enemies, amongst whom Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> was profest. He
was yet a wise man, and a brave Courtier, but rough, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
more of active then sedentary motions, as being in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation
destinated for Armes. There is a quere of some denotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how he came to receive his foyl, and that in the Catastrophe,
for he was strengthned with honourable allyances and the privy
friendships of the Court.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> and <hi>Burleigh,</hi> (both his contemporaries and
familiars. But that there might be (as the Adage hath it) falsity in
friendship, and we may rest satisfied, that there is no dispute against
fate.</p>
               <p>They quote him, for a person that loved too stand to much alone,
and on his own legs, of too often recesses, and discontinuance from
the Queens presence, a fault which is incompetible with the wayes
of Court and favour.</p>
               <p>He was sent Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as it was thought) for a
kinde of haughtinesse of spirit, and repugnancy in Councels: or as
others have thought, the fittest person, then to bridle the insolency
of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and probable it is, that both these (considering the sway)
that he would have at the board, and head in the Queens) concurred,
and did a little conspire his remove, and his ruine. But into <hi>Ireland</hi>
he went, where he did the Queen very great and many services, if
the surplusage of the measure did not abate the value of the merit,
as after times found that to be no Paradox, for to save the Queens
purse (which both her self) and my Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> ever took
for good services) he imposed on the <hi>Irish</hi> the charge of bearing their
own armes, which both gave them the possession, and taught them
the use of weapons, which proved in the end a most fatall work, both
in the profusion of bloud and treasure.</p>

tanted for his dancing, he was accused of high Treason, and
for high words, and a forged letter condemned, though the Queen,
on the news of his condemnation, swore by her wonted oath, that
they were all knaves; and they deliver with assurance, that on his
return to the Tower, after his Tryall, he said in oaths, and in fury,

Brother to be offered up, as a Sacrifice to the envy of my frisking
adversaries; which being made known to the Queen, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for his execution tendered, and somewhat enforced, she refused
to signe it, and swore he should not dye, for he was an honest, and
a faithfull man: and surely, though not altogether to set up our rest,
and faith upon tradition, and upon old reports, as that Sir <hi>Thomas
Perrot</hi> his Father was a Gentleman of the privy Chamber, to <hi>Henry</hi>
the eigth, and in the Court married to a Lady of great honour, of
the Kings familiarity, which are presumptions of some implication:
But if we go a little further, and compare his Picture, his qualities,
gesture, and voyce, with that of the Kings, which memory retains,
yet amongst us, they will plead strongly, that he was a subreptious
childe of the bloud Royall.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that he lived not long in the Tower, and that after
his decease, Sir <hi>Thomas Perrot</hi> his sonne (then of no mean esteem with
the Queen) having before married my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> Sister, since
Countesse of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> had restitution of all his Lands, though
after his decease also (which immediately followed) the Crown
resumed his estate, and took advantage of the former attainder.
And to say the truth, the Priests forged letter, was at his arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thought but as a fiction of envy, and was soone after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
by the Priests own confession, but that which most exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Queen, and gave advantage to his enemies, was (as Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> takes into his observation) words of disdain, for the
Queen by sharp and reprehensive Letters, had nettled him, and
shortly after sending others of approbation, commending his service,
and intimating an invasion from <hi>Spain,</hi> which he no sooner perused,
but he said publiquely in the great Chamber at <hi>Dublin:</hi> Lo now she
is ready to pisse her self for fear of the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> I am again one of
her white Boys.</p>

Words which are subject to a various construction, and tended to
some disreputation of his Soveraign, and such as may serve for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to persons in place of honour, and command to beware of
the violences of nature, but especially of the exorbitances of the
tongue: and so I conclude him with this double observation, the
one of the innocency of his intentions (exempt and clear from the
guilt of Treason) and disloyalty, the other of the greatnesse of his
heart, for at his arraignment he was so little dejected, by what might
be alleaged and proved against him, that he rather grew troubled
with choller, and in a kinde of exaspiration despised his Iury, though
of the order of Knighthood, and of the speciall Gentry, claiming
the priviledge of tryall, by the Peers, and Barronage of the Realm,
so prevalent was that of his native genious, and the haughtinesse of
his spirit, which accompanied him to his last, and till (any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of courage) it brake in peeces, the cords of his magnanimity,
for he dyed suddenly in the Tower, and when it was thought the
Queen did intend his inlargement, with the restitution of his posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

of a Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for his person, as goodly a Gentleman, as the times had any,
if nature had not been more intentive to compleat his person, then
Fortune to make him rich, for the times considered which were then
active, and a long time after lucrative, he dyed not wealthy, yet the
honester man, though it seems the Queens purpose was to tender
the occasion of his advancement, and to make him capable of more
honour, which at his return from <hi>Cadize</hi> accounts, she conferred it
upon him, creating him Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to the great discontent
of his Colleague, my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who then grew accessive in the
Appetite of her favour, and the truth was so exorbitant in the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Soveraigne aspect, that it much alienated the Queens
grace from him, and drew others together with the Admirall, to a
combination, and to conspire his ruine: and though I have heard it
from that party (I mean of the Admiralls faction) that it lay not in
his proper power to hurt my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> yet he had more followers,
and such as were well skilled in setting of the Gynne, but I leave
this, to these of an other age.</p>
               <p>It is out of doubt, that the Admirall was a good honest, and a
brave man, and a faithfull servant to his Mistris, and such a one as
the Queen out of her own Princely judgement, knew to be a fit
instrument for that service, for she was no ill proficient in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men, as well as Books, and his sundry expeditions, as that

               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Howards</hi> were of the Queens alliance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity

toward this great house, and it was a part of her naturall propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to grace and support ancient nobility, where it did not intrench,
neither invade her interest, for on such trespasses she was quick and
tender, and would not spare any whatsoever, as we may observe in
the case of the Duke, and my Lord of <hi>Hereford,</hi> whom she much
favoured, and countenanced, till they attempted the forbidden fruit,
the fault of the last, being in the severest interpretation, but a tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of incroachment, but in the first it was taken for a ryot against
the Crown, and her own Soveraign power, and as I have ever thought,
the cause of her aversion against the rest of the house, and the Dukes

worse Christian then he was, and a better Knight of the Carpet,

               <p>MY Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> (as Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> a Gentleman of great parts,

of affinity, which besides a more urgent obligation might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
his care to advance him, his fortune being then (and through
his Fathers infelicity) grown low; but that the sonne of a Lord
<hi>Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Charley,</hi> Viscount <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (who was of
the ancient Nobility) and formerly in the Queens good grace, could
not have a room in her favour, without the assistance of <hi>Leicester,</hi> was
beyond the rule of her nature, which as I have elsewhere taken into

observation, was ever inclineable to favour the nobility: sure it is,
that he no sooner appeared in Court, but he took with the Queen
and Courtiers, and I beleeve they all could not choose, but look
thorough the Sacrifice of the Father, on his living sonne, whose
Image by the remembrance of former passages, was a fresh, (like
the bleeding of men murdered) represented to the Court, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up as a Subject of compassion to all the Kingdome. There was in
this young Lord together with a most goodly person, a kinde of
urbanity, or innate curtesie, which both wonne the Queen, and
too much took upon the people, to gaze upon the new adopted sonne
of her favour: and as I go along, it were not amisse to take into
observation too notable quotations: the first was a violent indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of the Queen, (which incident to old age, where it encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with a pleasing and sutable object) towards this Lord, all which
argued a none perpetuity, the second was a fault in the object of
her grace; my Lord himself, who drew in too fast, like a childe suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on an over uberous Nurse, and had there been a more decent
decorum observed in both, or either of those, without doubt, the
unity of their affections, had been more permanent, and not so in
and out as they were, like an instrument ill tuned, and lapsing to
discord.</p>
               <p>The greater errour of the two (though unwillingly) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to impose on my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> or rather on his youth, and
none of the least of his blame, on those that stood Sentinels about
him, who might have advised him better, but that like men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
with hopes, they likewise had suckt in with the most, and
of their Lords receipt, and so like <hi>Caesars</hi> would have all or none, a

though they may expresse more affection to one in the abundance of

or undo you; strive not to rule, and over rule all, for it will cost hot
water, and it will procure envy, and if needs your genius must have
it so, let the Court, and the Queens presence, be your station: but
as I have said, they had suckt too much of their Lords milk, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed
of withdrawing, they blew the Coals of his ambition, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into him too much of the Spirit of glory: yea, and mixed the
goodnesse of his nature with a touch of revenge, which is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a destiny of the same fate, and of this number there
were some of insufferable natures about him, that towar is his last,

up the dregs of those rude humors, which by time, and his affliction,
out of his own judgement he sought to repose, or to give them all a

MY Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> was of the noble House of the <hi>Sackvills,</hi>
and of the Queens consanguinity, his Father was Sir <hi>Richard
Sackvill,</hi> or as the people then called him, Fill-sack, by reason of his
great wealth, and the vast Patrimony which he left to this his sonne,
whereof he spent in his youth the best part, untill the Queen by her
frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of his profusion, he was a
very fine Gentleman of person, and indowments both of art and
nature, both without measure magnificient, till on the turn of his
humour, and the allay that his yeers, and good Councells had
wrought upon those immoderate courses of his youth, and that
height of spirit, inherent to his House: and then did the Queen as
a most juditious, and indulgent Prince, when she saw the man, grow
stayed, and settled, give him her assistance, and advanced him to the
Treasureship, where he made amends to his house, for his mispent
time, both in the increasment of estate and honour, which the Queen
conferred on him, together with the opportunity to remake himself,
and thereby to shew that this was a childe, that should have a share
in her grace, and a taste of her bounty. They much commend his
elocution, but more the excellency of his pen, for he was a Scholler,
and a person of a quick dispatch (faculties, that yet runne in the
bloud) and they say of him, that his Secretaries did little for him,
by the way of inditement, wherein they could seldome please him,
he was so facet and choice in his phrase, and style, and for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches,
and the content he gave to Suitors, he had a decorum sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
since put in practise; for he had of his attendants that took
into rowl, the names of all Suitors, with the date of their first
adresses, and these in their order had hearing, so that a fresh man,
could not leap over his head, that was of a more ancient edition,
except in the urgent affaires of State. I finde not that he was any
wayes insnared in the factions of the Court, which were all his times
strong, and in every mans note the <hi>Howards</hi> and the <hi>

part, my Lord of <hi>Essex, &amp;c</hi> on the other part, for he held the Staff
of the Treasury fast in his hand, which once in the yeer made then
all beholding to him, and the truth is (as he was a wise man, and a
stout) he had no reason to be a partaker: for he stood sure in bloud,
and in grace, and was wholly intentive to the Queens service, and
such were his abilities, that she received assiduous proofes of his
sufficiency, and it hath been thought, that she might have more
cunning instruments, but none of a more strong judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

fidelity, whereunto methinks this Motto hath some kinde of reference,
<hi>aut nunq iam tentes aut perfice.</hi> As though he would have charactered in a

in his way to Court, whither no sooner came, but (without
asking) he had a pretty strange kinde of admission, which I have
heard from a discreet man, of his own, and much more of the secrets
of those times, he was then much about twenty yeers of age, of a
Brown-hair, a sweet face, a most neat Composure, and tall in his
person, the Queen was then at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and at dinner, whither he
came to see the fashion of the Court the Queen had soon found him

what he was, she answered she knew him not, insomuch as an inquiry
was made from one to another, who he might be, till at length, it
was told the Queen, he was Brother to the Lord <hi>William Mountioy,</hi>
this inquisition with the eye of Majesty fixed upon him, (as she was
wont to do, and to dant men she knew not) stirred the bloud of this
young Gentleman, insomuch as his colour came and went, which
the Queen observing, called him unto her, and gave him her hand to
kisse, incouraging him with gratious words, and new looks, and so
diverting her speech to the Lords, and Ladies, She said, that she no
sooner observed him, but that she knew there was in him some noble
Bloud, with some other expressions of pitty towards his House, and
then again demanding his name, She said, fail you not to come to the
Court, and I will be think my self how to do you good; and this was
his inlet, and the beginnings of his grace, where it fals into confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that though he wanted not wit and courage, for he had very fine
atractions, and being a good peece of a Scholler, yet were they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

And that it may appear how low he was, and how much
that heretique necessity, will work in the dejection of good spirits,
I can deliver it with assurance, that his exhibition was very scant
untill his Brother dyed, which was shortly after his admission to the
Court, and then was it no more then a thousand Marks <hi>

which had not some wise men about him laboured to remove, and
the Queen her self laid in her commands, he would (out of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
propension) have marred his own market, for as he was
grown by reading (whereunto he was much adicted) to the theory of
a Souldier, so was he strongly invicted by his genius, to the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the practique of the Warre, which were the causes of his
excursions, for he had a Company in the Low-Countries, from
whence he came over with a Noble acceptance of the Queen, but
somewhat restlesse, in honourable thoughts he exposed himself again,
and again, and would presse the Queen with the pretences of visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Company so often, that at length he had a flat deniall, and
yet he stole over with Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> into the action of <hi>Britain,</hi> (which
was then a hot and active Warre) whom he would alwayes call his
Father, honouring him above all men, and ever bewayling his end,
so contrary he was in his esteem, and valuation of this great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
to that of his friend, my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> till at last the Queen
began to take his decessions for contempts, and confined his residence
to the Court, and her own presence, and upon my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> fall
(so confident she was in her own Princely judgement, and opinion
she had conceived of his worth and conduct) that she vvould have
this noble Gentleman, and none other, to finish, and bring the <hi>Irish</hi>
Warre to a propitious end: for it vvas a propheticall speech of her

and amongst able ones, this vvas a chief, as having his sufficiency
from his instructions that begat him, the tutorship of the times, and
Court, which were then the Academies of Art and cunning, for such
was the Queens condition from the tenth or twelfth of her raigne,
that she had the happinesse to stand up (whereof there is a former

with more dangerous practises, then any Prince of her times, and
of many ages before, neither must we in this her preservation attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

his owne, out of a peculiar care had decreed the protection of the

                     </gap>,</hi> and of her Grandfathers line, by the Mother, which the
Queen could never forget, especially where there was a concunency
of old Bloud with fidelity, a mixture which ever sorted with the
Queens nature, and though there might appear something in this
House, which might avert her grace, (though not to speak of my
Lord himself, but with due reverence and honour) I mean contrariety
or suspition in religion, yet the Queen ever respected this House, and
principally this noble Lord, whom she first made Master of the Horse,
and then admitted of her Councell of State; in his youth (part
whereof he spent before he came to reside at Court) he was a very
fine Gentleman, and the best Horseman and Tilter of the times,
which were then the manlike and noble recreations of the Court,
and such as took up the applause of men, as well as the praise and
commendation of Ladies, and when yeers had abated these exercises
of honour, he grew then to be a faithfull and profound Councellor,
and as I have placed him last, so was he the last liver of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of her favour, and had the honour to see his renowned Mistris,
and all of them laid in the places of their rest, and for himself, after
a life of a very noble and remarkable reputation, he dyed rich, and
in a peaceable old age, a fate, (that I make the last, and none of the
slightest observations) which befell not many of the rest, for they
expired like unto lights blown out, with the snuff stinking, not
commendably extinguished, and with offence to the standers by.
And thus have I delivered up this my poore assay, a little draught of
this great Princesse, and her times, with the Servants of her State,
and favour, I cannot say, I have finished it, for I know how defective
and imperfect it is, as limbed onely in the originall nature, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the active blemishes, and so left it as a task fitter for remote
times, and the sallyes of some bolder Pensill to correct that which
is amisse, and draw the rest up to life, as for me to have endeavoured
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97847:22"/>
it, I took it to consideration how easily I might have dasht in too
much of the strain of pollution, and thereby have defaced that little
which is done, for I professe I have taken care so to master my Pen,
that I might not (<hi>ex animo,</hi> or of set purpose) discolour truth, or any
of the parts thereof, otherwise then in concealment. Happily there
are some which will not approve of this modesty, but will censure
me for pusillanimity, and with great cunning Artists attempt to draw
their line further out at large, and upon this of mine, which may
(with somewhat more ease) be effected for that the frame is ready
made to their hands, and then happily I could draw one in the
midst of theirs, but that modesty in me forbids the defacements of
men departed, whose posterity yet remaining, injoyes the merit of
their vertues, and do still live in their honour: and I had rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the censure of abruption, then to be conscious, and taken
in the manner of sinning by eruption, and of trampling on
the graves of persons at rest, which living, we durst
not look in the face, nor make our addresses
to them, otherwise then with due
regards to their honours,
and renown to their
Vertues.</p>
