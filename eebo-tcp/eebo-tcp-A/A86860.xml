            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers what Maſter <hi>Richard
Kilvert</hi> intimated to him, they deſired him the ſaid Alderman, and others (whom
they made a Commitee) to go to Counſell to be adviſed whether the buſineſſe might
legally be untertaken.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Alderman and Committee aſſured the Company that they had
taken as good counſell as gold could buy, and that the preſent Recorder of London and Mr. Sergeant
<hi>Stone</hi> (deceaſed) were of opinion that Wines being a forraigne commodity, his Majeſtie might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
what he pleaſed on it, and that the farme of that Impoſition might as freely be taken as any farme in
England.</p>
            <p>That this hath been already by Mr. Alderman himſelfe declared in the honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament, and can ſtill be fully proved if the leaſt doubt be made of it.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid advice brought by the Alderman and Committee, with the retayling Vintners feare to
be brought into the Starchamber on the illegall decree againſt dreſsing of meat in their houſes, was the
abſolute motive that made the retayling Vintners to make the contract with his Maieſtie, and the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
and Adventurers to undertake the Farme.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>VVilliam Dickens</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Anthony Low</hi> Counſeller at Law, to advice whether he might
come in to be a Farmer or undertaker, he adviſed he might freely doe it, for it was no hazard or crime to
be a Farmer of an illegall Impoſition before ſet on; thereupon the ſaid <hi>Dickens</hi> came in as great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer
as any one Farmer whatſoever.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Farmers and Adventurers (except Alderman <hi>Abell</hi> who was Treaſurer) never received
peny of the fourty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tun, and by the accompt they are indebted at leaſt 8000. pounds which
they are ſued for and muſt pay out of their own purſes, to the hazard of the undoing of ſome of them.</p>
            <p rend="indent">They humbly beſeech this honourable Aſſembly ſeriouſly to weigh the premiſſes, and
to commiſerate their caſe, and as they never got one peny profit by it, ſo they deſire
to ſurrender all up and to accompt from the beginning, and that they may of have out
of the Bonds owing by the retayling Vintners ſo much as may free them out of debt,
and thereby preſerve themſelves wives and children from diſgrace and ruine.</p>
