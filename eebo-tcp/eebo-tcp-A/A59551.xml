         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>—Blessed are they that have not seen, and
yet have believed.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are our Saviour's Words
to St. <hi>Thomas</hi> after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The occasion of them was
this: The other Disciples had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<hi>Thomas,</hi> That our Saviour was risen
from the dead, and that he had in Person
appeared to them. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this upon their report, but required farther
Evidence. <hi>Except (saith he) I shall see in his
hands the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into
his side, I will not believe.</hi> The next time that
our Saviour appeared to them, <hi>Thomas</hi> was in
the Company, and then he was pleased to give
him such a Proof of his Resurrection as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had stood upon; for he calls upon him,
and bids him <hi>reach forth his finger, and behold his
hands</hi> where the Print of the Nails was, <hi>and reach
forth his hand, and thrust it into his side,</hi> and after
this, <hi>not to be faithless, but believing.</hi> Hereupon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101798:5"/>
               <hi>Thomas</hi> owns himself fully convinced, and in
token thereof, <hi>he answered and said unto him, My
Lord, and my God.</hi> Then come in the Words of
the Text: <hi>Iesus saith unto him, Thomas, Because
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: Blessed are
they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words, as our Saviour tacitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
<hi>Thomas</hi> for his Incredulity, in not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a matter of Fact well attested, unless he
himself saw it: So he lays down an universal
Proposition for the Encouragement of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in future Ages of the world, to <hi>believe</hi> in
him, though they had not <hi>seen</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour knew very well, that this was to
be the Case of far the greatest part that were to
believe in him. For it was only to the men of
that Age in which he lived, and of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where he conversed, to whom it was given
to hear from his own mouth his Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and to see with their eyes the Proofs that
he gave of his Divine Mission, particularly that
illustrious one of his Resurrection from the dead.
But for all the succeeding Generations of men,
they were to <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>seeing.</hi> Their Faith
was not to be grounded on the Evidence of their
own Senses, but on the Testimony of those that
had had that Evidence. And therefore for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101798:5"/>
obliging and encouraging all Mankind, in the
Ages to come, to Embrace his Religion upon
such Motives and such Evidence as this, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
these words, <hi>Blessed are they that have
not seen, and yet have believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but that all Christians are fully
satisfied both of the Truth and Reason of this
Proposition of our Saviour, and are convinced
that they have Motives enow to oblige them to
believe in him, and to own his Religion; though
they never saw, nor were capable of seeing the
Original Proofs and Evidence he gave for the
Truth of it. Indeed if it were otherwise, none
of us at this day could be Christians upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Grounds. But this Doctrine will not pass
among all men. On the contrary, By several,
Their not <hi>Seeing,</hi> is made the great, if not the
only pretence, for their not <hi>Believing.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so; I hope it will not be time mis-spent, if I
endeavour to answer this Plea of theirs; and I
think I cannot to better purpose discourse upon
this Text, than by doing so.</p>
            <p>The Case is this. Some there are among us
that endeavour to run down all <hi>Reveal'd Religion.</hi>
If you ask them whether then they are for any
Religion at all; They will tell you, Yes, they are
for that which <hi>Natural Reason</hi> teacheth. We wish
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101798:6"/>
they were in good earnest when they say this.
For then we should hope to be soon all of a mind.
For we cannot doubt but that whosoever doth
sincerely believe all that <hi>Natural Reason</hi> will
teach him about Religion, and doth seriously
endeavour to frame his Life accordingly; such
a one will not fail to embrace <hi>Christianity,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Doctrines of our Saviour, and the
Proofs he gave for the Truth of them, are fairly
represented to him. But in truth, these mens
loose way, both of discoursing, and of living,
renders it suspicious, that their Profession of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion</hi> is not very sincere; but only for
the sheltering them from the Imputation of
Atheism, and serving other secular ends. For
such a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> have they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to themselves, as will not much trouble
their Consciences, let them <hi>live</hi> how they will.
But now the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion (which is that
they chiefly oppose under the name of <hi>Revealed
Religion)</hi> is a more Stubborn thing, and will
not so easily be brought to Comply with their
Humours and Inclinations. And <hi>That</hi> we fear,
though they are loth to own it, is the secret rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Grudge against it. The Gospel of
Christ doth not favour such sort of Principles as
these men have taken up, nor such a kind of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101798:6"/>
Life as they are engaged in; But on the contrary,
severely declares against them. And therefore
some colourable Reason must be found out, for
the setting aside the Authority of this Gospel,
which is so contradictory to their <hi>Interests.</hi> But
how is this to be come by?</p>
            <p>To object against the Sufficiency of the Proof
that our Saviour gave to the world of his being
sent from God to teach this Religion to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
That there is no colour for: For they are
sensible that if his History, as it is related in the
Gospel, be admitted to be a true History, so
that one may depend upon the Matters of Fact
there Recorded concerning him: If this, I say, be
admitted, it cannot be denied but that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gave abundant Evidence, that he was what
he pretended to be, the Son of God, and the great
Prophet whom all men were to be obedient to,
if they meant to be saved.</p>
            <p>Since therefore they cannot fasten upon this,
they pitch upon another Method. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to run down all our Evidence for the Truth
of Christ's Religion, by making a Difference
between <hi>seeing</hi> our Saviour's Miracles, and <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them in a Book. They will allow, that if
any man heard or saw Jesus Christ speaking
those things, or doing those things, which are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101798:7"/>
Recorded of him; such a man would have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Reason to induce him to be his Disciple:
But they deny that they have any such Reason to
be so, because they neither <hi>heard</hi> nor <hi>saw</hi> any of
those things; nor are they convinced that such
things were ever done. They reproach us, that
when they desire of us a Proof of the Christian
Religion, all the Answer they can obtain of us is,
that they must go to such a Book (which we call
the Bible) and that will satisfy them. But why
should they pin their Faith upon any Book in
the world? This is what they urge for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
            <p>This now being the State of the Controversy
between Us and several of the Unbelievers
among us, you see it turns upon this single Point
that is now before us; namely, Whether a man
that does not <hi>see,</hi> may not have sufficient Reason
to <hi>believe</hi> at many hundred years distance? Or
more particularly thus; Whether we in these
days, who never <hi>saw</hi> our Saviour, nor his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
(particularly That of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> with
Reference to which these words were spoken)
have not abundant Reason to believe in him,
upon the Testimony of those that did see all these
things. We say we have. They say we have
not. Here therefore we join Issue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101798:7"/>
Now for the making good our side of the
Question, I proceed by these Steps.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, We lay it down as a Principle,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
and I suppose every body will agree to it; That
if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his Apostles, when they first
Preached the Gospel, did give sufficient Proof
and Evidence that what they Preached was from
God: And likewise if both the Doctrine they
Preached, and the Proof and Evidence they
gave for it, be faithfully transmitted to us; and
with such Certainty likewise, that we cannot
have any reasonable doubt that it is so transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Then I say, we can have no reason in the
earth to complain, that we want Evidence for
the Truth of the Gospel. I do not say <hi>yet,</hi> that
we have as strong Proof, as if we had seen or
heard those things our selves: But I say we have
sufficient Proof to convince any reasonable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed
man: This I presume no body will deny,
and it is all that we ask at present.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> place; I believe none will deny,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
that what was once really spoken, or what was
once really done, may be truly and faithfully
put into writing. And it is possible likewise that
those Writings may come so well attested, to
them that live many Ages after those things were
spoken, or done, that none in any Age can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101798:8"/>
doubt that they give a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
account of the things therein reported to be
done or taught. I say, I believe none will deny
this; for if it be not admitted, we can give no
Credit to any History that was written; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to any Matter of Fact that was done
in former Ages. It therefore will, I hope, be
granted, that both the Doctrines of our Saviour,
and his Proofs of them, might in this way, if
God so pleased, be so faithfully transmitted to
Posterity, that future Ages might certainly come
to the knowledge of them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> In the <hi>Third</hi> place we say, That it is obvious
to all Mankind, that if ever there was any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
in the world, wherein the Providence of God
was concerned, that there should be a faithful
Conveyance of it made to all Generations to
come, and carrying the Marks of its own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility;
this Affair of the Gospel of Christ was
such a one. Because the Importance of it to
all the Children of men was such, that their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or Damnation to the end of the world,
did depend upon the Belief of it, if the Author
of this Gospel delivered a true Doctrine. And
therefore we may certainly conclude, that if
what Christ taught at the first, was from God;
God would take care that what he taught, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101798:8"/>
with sufficient Proof of the Truth of it,
should be conveyed to all the Ages of the world.
And if all this was to be contained in a Book;
we may likewise be assured, that Book should
come to us, with such Evidence of its being
true, that we could have no reasonable Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning it. We are sure God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath taken care that Writings of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
Date than the Gospel, that are of infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
less consequence to Mankind, should come
down to us without any Suspicion of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
And can it be imagined then, his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should be unconcerned, in preserving and
bringing safe to our hands, the Records of a
thing, by the Belief or Denial of which, the
Eternal State of men in the other world is to be
concluded?</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, having laid these Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
we advance a Step higher. It is certain,
that there was a timely and a faithful Record of
all the things that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> taught in order to
Salvation, and of all the Proofs he gave for the
Truth and Divinity of his Doctrine: And this
Record is contained in the Books of the New
Testament.</p>
            <p>That this is true Matter of Fact, we have all
the Proof that a thing of this Nature is capable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101798:9"/>
of. These Books were written either by men
that were <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi> Witnesses of our Saviour's
Miracles, and Doctrine, and Conversation: Or
by such as Conversed with those that were. This
appears not only from the Writings themselves,
which carry in them all the Marks of their being
written by Persons so qualified; but also from
the constant Tradition that hath in all Ages gone
in the world, about the Authors of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
And you may with as much, or more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
doubt, that those Writings among us, which
go under the Name of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
or any other most unquestioned Author,
were none of Theirs, but forged since their
times; than you can doubt that the Gospels of
St. <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi>'s both
Gospel and Acts of the Apostles, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Epistles, were not writ by those Authors, or in
the Age they pretend to be. I say, there is a great
deal more reason to doubt of that, than there is
of this: Because we have not only all the Proofs
of the Genuineness of those Writings, that can
be given for any other Writings, which are the
most unquestioned in the world; but this over
and above, which is compatible to none but
these; namely, That the Matter of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
is of such a Nature, that all Mankind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101798:9"/>
were concerned to detect the Fraud and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
of them, if there had been any: But yet
they have always passed under the Names they
bear at this day; nay, and in every Age, from
the first publishing of them, we have Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Authorities in a continued Succession to
vouch for them.</p>
            <p>Well, but supposing these men to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
of these Writings; yet how can we depend
upon the Truth of what they have Reported?</p>
            <p>In answer to this, I say in the <hi>Fifth</hi> place;
Let any man read them, and then speak from
his Conscience, Whether he does not think that
these men were in good earnest, and did really
write according to their own inward sense? And
yet the Matters they wrote were such, as it was
not possible they could be deceived about them;
because they were all plain Matters of Fact;
things which their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> were witnesses
of. But that is not all: They who lived in
those days, and had full opportunities of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the Truth of what they had written, gave
Testimony to them; since they built their Faith
upon the Matters of Fact they had delivered. If
therefore you suppose these Writers to be sincere
honest men, it is certain that what they record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning our Lord Jesus, and his Doctrines,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101798:10"/>
and his Actions, must be true. On the other
side, if you suppose them to have had Designs
of imposing upon the world with a false Story;
you must at the same time suppose a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People (of whom there is no ground
for such a suspicion) to be perfect Fools or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who gave so much Credit to all that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they related concerning our Saviour,
that they laid down their Lives to attest the Truth
of it.</p>
            <p>I know nothing to be said against this, unless
it be, That though they could not well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be mistaken in the Matters of Fact
which they relate concerning our Saviour, yet
they might in the Matter of his <hi>Doctrines.</hi> These
they might misrepresent, and consequently their
Writings ought not to be of that Authority with
us, as that we should be bound to believe all
that they say. But to this I give a very short
Answer; If we do admit them to be true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of Matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> we must also of
necessity admit them to be true Reporters, nay
I say more, Infallible Reporters of our Saviour's
<hi>Doctrine;</hi> so as that their Declarations of it must
for ever conclude all Christians. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is this: The Authors of these Writings were
either Apostles, or Apostolick Men, as has been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101798:10"/>
said before; and it is one of the matters of <hi>Fact</hi>
reported in these Writings, that our Saviour did
so assist these men with his Holy Spirit, that they
were enabled faithfully and infallibly to Preach
that Doctrine to others which he had delivered
to them. Now if we be sure they were inspired
in what they <hi>Preached;</hi> we may be as much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
they were inspired in <hi>putting</hi> what they
Preached into <hi>writing;</hi> since it was the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that they <hi>Preached</hi> and that they <hi>Wrote;</hi>
and especially since after it was written it was to
remain to all succeeding Generations, and to be
a <hi>Rule</hi> of mens <hi>Faith</hi> so long as the world should
last. And further, we are sure that all the
Christians of those days did look upon those
Writings to have a stamp of divine Authority
upon them, and distinguished them from all other
human Compositions. And to Evidence this,
they made these Writings to be the Standard of their
Belief; the <hi>Measure</hi> by which they tryed all <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
and <hi>Doctrines</hi> in Religion: So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was not found in these Scriptures, was not
accounted as necessary to Salvation; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was found disagreeing from these Scriptures,
was rejected as an Innovation, or an Error in
Christianity. And of this we have sufficient
Evidence from Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Well, but how shall we know whether these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101798:11"/>
Scriptures be faithfully transmitted down to us?
How do we know but that they may have been
corrupted since the time they were written, and
made to speak different things now, from what
they did at the first? This is the last Question
upon this Argument; and in Answer to it, I say
in the <hi>Sixth</hi> Place;</p>
            <p>If the Providence of God, as I told you before,
was ever concerned to preserve any Writings
from being depraved or corrupted; it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
more especially concerned to do it, as to
the Writings we are now speaking of, they being
of such vast Importance to all the Generations of
Mankind. But I do not leave the matter so.
There is Evidence of <hi>Fact</hi> as well as <hi>Reason</hi> to
be offered in this Case.</p>
            <p>Let the Books of the New Testament, as we
now have them, be tryed by the severest Rules
of Criticism. Let the <hi>Copies</hi> both Ancient and
Modern, which are extant of them, be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Let the several <hi>Versions</hi> of them likewise
that were made in the earliest times be examined.
Lastly; Let all the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Writers from the
beginning of Christianity to this day, who have
either commented upon them; or proved any
Doctrine from them; or but occasionally quoted
them in their Writings, be searched into: It will
appear by all these ways of Tryal, that our Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101798:11"/>
are the same at this day, that they were at
the beginning, without any material difference.</p>
            <p>Indeed, considering the multitude of Copies
that were taken of these Books, and the several
Translations that were made of them into other
Languages, even shortly after the time they were
first published; we cannot imagine it possible,
that in After-ages, any thing could be foisted
into them, to serve the Turn of any <hi>Party,</hi> but
the Imposture would have been presently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
And accordingly we find, that when any
Attempts of this kind have been made, there
were not wanting those who took care to detect
and expose them.</p>
            <p>I do not, when I say this, deny that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
differences and <hi>various readings</hi> to be met with,
in the ancient Copies of these Books, occasioned
by the negligence or mistakes of Transcribers.
Nay, and some few Passages may be wanting
in some Copies that are found in others: But then
I desire it may be observed that these differences
are of such small moment, that it is of no Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the Christian Faith, which of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
be right, and which of them be wrong.
For they all agree in all the Matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
either our Saviour's <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or his <hi>Precepts,</hi>
or the <hi>Proofs</hi> he gave of his Divine Mission. And
farther agreement than this I think none needs
to desire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101798:12"/>
Indeed if slight and <hi>verbal</hi> differences in Copies
be a good Argument against the Genuineness
of a Writing; we have no Genuine Writing of
any ancient Author at this day. For the same
thing has happened to all old Books whatsoever,
that have been often transcribed: And to suppose,
that it should be otherwise in the Books of the
Scripture, is to suppose, that God ought in
every age, as immediately and infallibly to guide
the <hi>Pen</hi> of every Transcriber of them, as he did
the <hi>Minds</hi> of their first Authors.</p>
            <p>To make now a little Reflection on what I
have said about the Scriptures of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is urged by our Deists, as a very hard
thing, That whereas, when the Gospel was first
preached, men had opportunities of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by their senses of the Truth of it; (or
at least it is pretended they had such Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
we now are only referred to a Book that
gives us an account of these matters: Why, I
desire to know, what other way they would
have had an account of them but by Books?
Would they have had our Saviour to come
down from Heaven every <hi>Fifty</hi> or <hi>Threescore</hi>
years, and to Preach the same Doctrine; and
Confirm it by the same Miracles to the men of
that Generation, that he once did among the
<hi>Iews?</hi> Yet this it must be supposed necessary for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101798:12"/>
him to do, if Men cannot otherwise be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the Truth of his Religion, but by their
Senses. Nay, that would not be enough: He
must not only publish his Doctrine, and repeat
his Miracles to every <hi>Age,</hi> but to every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Man</hi> of every <hi>Age:</hi> Otherwise <hi>All</hi> Men had not
opportunity of being convinced by their <hi>Senses,</hi>
and consequently could not upon reasonable
grounds believe in him. But if this Supposition
be absurd, as it certainly is; then we must be
content (and there is all the reason in the world
we should be so) with that sort of Evidence for
the Truth of his Gospel, that other Matters of
Fact, done at a great distance of time from us,
are capable of: That is to say, Authentick Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of them at the first; and the Testimony of
those Witnesses faithfully transmitted down to
Posterity. And how any Testimony can be
more faithfully transmitted, than by the way of
Writing, let them shew us, if they can.</p>
            <p>And then, as for the Books or Writings that
we refer you to in this Case, we ask no more
for the gaining Credit to them, than only that it
may be seriously considered, of what sort they are,
and what Authority they carry along with them.</p>
            <p>We do not send you to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi>
or such like Writers; who, though they were very
good Authors, yet took a great deal of what they
said, from uncertain Reports.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101798:13"/>
Much less do we send you to a <hi>Golden Legend,</hi>
or the Lives of the Saints, as they have been written
of later days, by Men who took advantage of
the Ignorance and Credulity of the Age they liv'd
in, to obtrude what they pleased upon the World.</p>
            <p>But we send you to Authors who themselves
knew, and were Witnesses of what they wrote.</p>
            <p>Who gave all possible proof of their Sincerity
and Integrity, not only by publickly, in all places,
asserting the Truth of what they had written, but
some of them also sealing it with their Blood.</p>
            <p>Who were so assisted with the Divine Spirit,
that they themselves wrought the same Miracles,
for the confirmation of Christ's Doctrine, that
they had recorded him to have done.</p>
            <p>And lastly, Who in all succeeding Ages were
had in such veneration among Christians, that
their Writings were esteemed the Platform and
Standard of True Faith: And upon which they
set so high a value, that they would keep them
at the Peril of their Lives. And Instances we
have of Multitudes, who rather chose Torments
and Death, than they would deliver up their Bibles.</p>
            <p>Taking now all this together, can any thing
like it be said for the Truth or the Authority of
any other Book in the world?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> But this is not all. I desire in the <hi>Seventh</hi> and
last place, it may be considered; That we do
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101798:13"/>
not send you to a bare Book for the Proof of the
Christian Religion, how much soever that Book
may have the Marks, not only of a True and
Genuine, but also of a Divine History. But we
insist upon a great many other things for the
Proof of the Matters contained in that Book,
besides the Authority of the Book it self.</p>
            <p>If indeed nothing had followed upon Christ's
publishing his Gospel, and we had never heard
more of it, or him, save what we might happen
to meet with in those Old Writings; I do not
know how far their Evidence alone, now at the
distance of near Seventeen hundred Years, would
have prevailed with us to embrace his Religion:
But now when we see and are convinced, that
so many remarkable Effects ensued upon his
Preaching in the world, and still continue visible
at this day; which yet cannot be ascribed to any
other cause, than to the particular Power and
Providence of God, which was concerned to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
our Saviour, and his Pretensions to the world:
This is certainly a new Evidence, and a standing
one, both for that <hi>Book</hi> which mentions all these
things, and especially for that <hi>Cause</hi> it maintains.</p>
            <p>The Case of the Christian Religion is plainly
this. <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> a mean Person as to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Circumstances, sets up for a Preacher of a
new Religion. And this, not in the times of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101798:14"/>
Ignorance, and Barbarism (when an Imposture
might be supposed more easy to be carried on, and
which Advantages <hi>Mahomet</hi> afterwards made use
of) but in the Reign of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> when Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Arts, and Sciences were in the most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Condition, that ever they were known to be.</p>
            <p>He chuses a Company of very ordinary <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered</hi>
Men, but very <hi>Honest</hi> Men, to be the
Witnesses of his Conversation and Doctrine.
And these he designs for the Spreaders of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
throughout the World.</p>
            <p>He neither makes use of Arts, nor Arms for
the gaining Disciples to himself: only declares
plainly, that he is the Person, whom God had
long before promised to send, and whom he did
now send, to publish Eternal Salvation to all that
should believe in him.</p>
            <p>The Religion which he taught, and which
all his Followers were to take upon them, was
so far from gratifying <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much better contrived, as the World then
stood, for the frighting men from it, than for the
alluring Proselytes to it.</p>
            <p>For there was nothing in it that ministred
to any sensual or worldly purposes; nothing
that tended to make a man either wise, or rich,
or great, or happy, in the sense of this world;
but all the quite contrary. He that would be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101798:14"/>
his Disciple, must quit all the popular Notions
about Happiness. Instead of being thought wise,
must submit to be counted a Fool for Christ's
sake. Instead of getting Wealth, or Honour, or
Preferment, must be prepared to part with all these
things, if he was already possessed of them; must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himself, and all his Temporal Interests; nay must
forsake Father and Mother, and his own Life also,
whenever he was called to it. The way to Heaven,
as he taught it, was by Humility and Meekness, and
Contempt of the World, and all the Glories of it; by
patient suffering Afflictions and Injuries, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Resignation of our selves to God, to do and
suffer whatever was his Will. And he himself, as he
lived thus, so did he thus go off the Stage; being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Three Years preaching this sort of Doctrine,
hanged up on a Cross, as an Impostor, and that
by the Vote of his own Countrymen.</p>
            <p>Where now was the temptation to the generality
of men, to own this Man as a Prophet sent from
God to Mankind? Why, in truth, by what I have
yet represented, there was very little: Nay indeed,
to any one that considers these beginnings of the
Gospel, it will be matter of Astonishment that any
more came of it, and that it did not presently dye
with the Author of it.</p>
            <p>But here was the thing. Our Lord, in how poor a
Condition soever he lived, yet he <hi>spake as never man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101798:15"/>
spake.</hi> He so explained the Old Scriptures which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
of him: He taught such Important Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
another Life; concerning the Nature and
Providence of God, and his Mercy to lost Mankind,
and the way in which he would be served, and in
what sort of things it was, that true Religion did
consist, that he pierced the very Souls of those that
heard him. There was so much Evidence in the
Truths themselves that he delivered, that no honest
virtuously-disposed Minds could stand out against
them, but must be convinced in their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that this, of all that they had ever heard of,
was a Religion worthiest to come from God, and
most accommodated to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Needs of
men; nay, and their <hi>Temporal</hi> ones too, supposing
that all men would embrace it.</p>
            <p>And then the whole Tenor of his Life was suitable
hereunto: For he appeared in all his Actions and
Conversation, to be a Man of so much Candor and
Goodness, and Clearness of Spirit; so Humble, so
Just, so Prudent, so Charitable, so Obliging to all
Mankind; so full of Piety and Devotion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
to God; and lastly, so free from all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
that he carried on any selfish Designs; that all
these Heavenly Doctrines came better out of his
Mouth, than if any other had delivered them.</p>
            <p>But that which crowned all was this; that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Stage of his Life there was a visible
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101798:15"/>
Evidence of a Divine Power and Presence going
along with him, which shewed it self in a thousand
Instances of the most glorious Miracles that ever were
seen or heard of in the world, and that to the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Country where he lived.</p>
            <p>In this manner, I say, did our Saviour lay the
Foundation for a Belief of his Doctrine, to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations; and a solid unshaken Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
it was.</p>
            <p>But yet for all that, if the Power of God had stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
here, I do not know what Superstructure would
ever have been made upon this Foundation.</p>
            <p>For so it was, that those very men, those honest
plain-hearted men that he had taken into his Family,
to be Witnesses of what he did and taught, with a
design, as I told you, of sending them abroad to
publish all those things throughout the World; yet
when he came to dye, such poor-spirited Creatures
they proved, that every man of them forsook him.</p>
            <p>O sad Example of human Frailty and Inconstancy!
those men that had the greatest opportunities of
knowing him and his Doctrine, and had professed
the most firm Resolutions of adhering to him; yet
all forsook him in the hour of danger, and shifted
for themselves.</p>
            <p>But God Almighty, tho he suffered good men to
act as men, did not therefore lay aside that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
he had set on foot by our Lord Jesus; no, nor
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101798:16"/>
of accomplishing it by the Ministry of these very men.</p>
            <p>For he raised up his Son from the dead on the
Third Day (as our Saviour had before told them
he would); and this put new Life and Spirit into
those Persons that had lately abandoned him.</p>
            <p>But that was not all. Our Saviour calls them all
together after he was thus risen from the dead. He
acquaints them with the Work that he had committed
to them. He assures them that he will be with them,
and those that should succeed them in that Ministry
for ever. Not in Person, for he was to continue in
Heaven to intercede for all Believers at the Right
Hand of God; but by the Virtue and Presence of
the Holy Spirit, who was to be his Deputy and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
upon Earth. This Holy Spirit he would in a
few days send down upon them, who should effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
furnish and endue them with all Powers, and
Qualities, and Abilities, needful for the discharge of
so great a Work, as the Conversion of the World
to his Religion, was. And after he had told them
these things, he visibly in their Presence ascended up
into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Here now begins Christ's Kingdom. He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<hi>Death</hi> before, and now he comes to conquer
the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> From henceforward you hear
of no Fear, no Pusillanimity, no mean Behaviour in
any of the Apostles. They then go and Preach to
all the World that Gospel which their Master order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101798:16"/>
them. No Danger frights them: No human
Learning or Philosophy is able to stand before them.
The greatest Obstacles, the greatest Terrors that
come in their way, are so far from making them quit
the Work they had begun; that they rather prove In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives
to them to go on in it. They make it their
business to gain Souls in every place to Jesus Christ:
They run about the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than ever that extended. They pretend to no
Eloquence, no polite Learning, no Arts of Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But they preach a plain, honest, pious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
but withal such a Doctrine, that as the Times
then went, a man must expect to bid an everlasting
Adieu to all the Wealth, and Pleasures, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of this World, if he once embraced it. They
declare to all people the Authority they had for the
Preaching this Doctrine. They vouch our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ as the Author of it, who <hi>died</hi> for the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Testimony to it; and <hi>rose again</hi> for its Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and is now King of Heaven and Earth.
And they shewed that they had an Authentick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from Heaven for the doing all this; by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Language of every Country where they came,
without ever being taught it; by curing all diseased
people that were brought to them; by dispossessing
Devils; by giving sight to the blind; and making the
lame to walk, and restoring dead Bodies to life.</p>
            <p>All these wonderful things they did all the World
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101798:17"/>
over. And what the Effects hereof were, was manifest
every where, and continues manifest to this day.</p>
            <p>The Gospel spread like Lightning in all places:
And whereever it came, Pagan Idolatry was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:
Till at last the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was
converted to the Religion of Jesus Christ. Converted
it was by men naked and unassisted; without the least
Encouragement at the first from the Secular Powers,
nay, in contradiction to the severest Penalties that the
Secular Powers could contrive or decree to hinder it.</p>
            <p>We grant indeed, that many thousands of brave
men did lose their Lives in this <hi>Religious</hi> War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Lord Jesus Christ and the Devil (who
was then the Prince of this World), and did patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submit to Death, that they might assert the truth
of our Saviour's Cause: But that was Christ's way of
vanquishing the Devil: He did thus <hi>break the Serpent's
head,</hi> while the Serpent <hi>bruised his heel:</hi> And he did at
last by this way effectually break his Kingdom; as is
visible and notorious even from that time to this day.</p>
            <p>And now I Appeal to every one, Whether this,
which is matter of Fact, and known to all men that
look into the Histories of Time; and of which we at
this day see and enjoy the happy Effects, in having
the Christian Religion, not only received among us,
but made a part of our National Constitution: I
say, whether this be not a convincing Proof, both of
the Truth of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and likewise of those
<hi>Scriptures</hi> from whence we fetch it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101798:17"/>
Had not the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> been true, how could
these things have ever come to pass? Seeing it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unconceivable, that without a Divine Power they
could be effected. And sure none can suppose that God
would exert his Power for the confirming of a Falshood.</p>
            <p>And again; had not our <hi>Scriptures</hi> been true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
or had they been the Fictions of any designing
men; how is it possible they should have given us an
account of these things so long before they came to
pass, and when there was so little appearance of their
ever coming to pass? And yet all that I have now
mentioned is plainly there set down, as foretold by our
Saviour, and his Apostles: And not only those things,
but a great many other remarkable Events are there
also foretold, which have since been exactly made good.</p>
            <p>I hope by what hath been said, it doth appear that we
at this day have sufficient Arguments to oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and adhere to the Religion of Jesus Christ, tho we
never saw the <hi>Original</hi> Proofs he gave of it; which was
the Point I was to make good. For I think I have shewed,
That if those Proofs were good and conclusive at the
first, to them that saw them, and were Witnesses of
them; they are so to us now, who receive them upon
their Testimony. And as for the difference that may be
alledged in point of Evidence, between a man's <hi>seeing</hi>
a thing, and receiving it upon the <hi>Report</hi> of others; all
that, I think, by the account I have given, is in a great
measure out of doors as to this matter. For the <hi>Report</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101798:18"/>
upon which we receive the Gospel, being so Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
so unexceptionable, and likewise so confirmed by
Matters of Fact still visible to us, it amounts to as strong
a Proof, as if we had Evidence of Sense. And I do in my
Conscience believe, that there is not a man in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now stands out against the Religion of Jesus Christ,
but who would have done so, if he had lived in the
time of our Saviour, and heard him preach the Gospel.</p>
            <p>As for us who believe, let us persevere in our Faith
without wavering. Our Faith is never the worse for not
<hi>seeing. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>
And as for those that do not believe, their not
<hi>seeing</hi> will be no excuse for them, if our Saviour may
be Credited: For it was as well with respect to them
that did not see, as to them that did, that he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his Definitive Sentence, when he sent out his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to Preach his Religion: <hi>Go</hi> (saith he) <hi>and preach
the Gospel to every creature: He that believeth and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God give us all Grace to consider the things that
belong to our Everlasting Peace. That both all those
who now oppose the <hi>Truth as it is in Christ Iesus,</hi> may
be converted from the Error of their ways; and that
all those who do own and profess it, may adorn the
Doctrine of God which he hath called them to, by a
pure, holy, and unblameable Life; to the Glory of
God, and the Eternal Salvation of their Souls, in the
Day of our Lord Jesus. <hi>To whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
