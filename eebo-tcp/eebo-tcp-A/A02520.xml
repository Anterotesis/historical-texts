            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

blessings? or what place is there for our thankfulnesse?</p>
               <p>If I may take no pleasure in one food above another, what use is there of my taste? what difference doe I make betwixt a course crust, and the finest of the wheat? why am I more bound to God for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me wine then water, many dishes then one, better then worse? or how can I be more sensible of my obligation?</p>

               <p>But the same God who hath allowed us to take pleasure in all these hath also thought good to set bounds, and stints to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which we may not exceed; he hath indulged to us a lawfull freedome, not a wilde licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: If wee passe our limits, we sin. Now because in our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pronenesse to excesse there is nothing more difficult, then to keepe within due compasse, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3790:34"/>
to be at once delighted and holy, it highly concernes us to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those just boundaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which our freest pleasure must be ranged.</p>
               <p>First then, we cannot offend in our delectations, if we be sure to take God with us; more plainly, we shall safely partake of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, if we receive them as <hi>from</hi> God, if we enjoy them <hi>in</hi> God, if we referre them <hi>to</hi> God: <hi>From</hi> God, as the author and giver of them; <hi>in</hi> God, as the allower and sanctifier of them; <hi>to</hi> God, as to the end, and scope of them: the least deviation from any of these, makes our delights vicious. Wee receive them as from God, when we know them to be allowed of him, and granted to us, by him:

Herein therefore lawfull pleasures differ from sinfull; we have his vvarrant for the one, for the other his inhibition.

It is true, there can bee no certaine proportion of our either having, or desiring; since the conditions of men are in a vast difference; for that coat which is too bigge for a dwarfe, will not so much as come upon a Giants sleeve: and it is but just and lawfull for every man to affect so much, as may bee sufficient, not only for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his person, but for the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his estate; the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be sordid, and deservedly taxable.

what man lived most unquietly, answered, He that in a great estate affects to be prosperous: In all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, he that sets too high a pitch to his desires, lives upon the rack; neither can be loosed, till he remit of his great thoughts, and resolve to clip his wings and train, and to take up with the present. Very seasonable and witty was that answer, which <hi>Cyneas</hi> in the story gave to ambitious <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when that great Conqueror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan speech of his designes: Well, said <hi>Cyneas,</hi> when thou hast van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the <hi>Romans,</hi> vvhat vvilt thou then doe?

Caution of sorrow.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof the first shall be, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3790:72"/>
the cause of our sorrow be just: not fancied, not insufficient; For vve have knowne some that have brew'd their owne griefe, vvho vvith <hi>Simeon Stylites</hi> have volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily chained up themselves in their owne pillar, vvhen they might have enjoyed free scope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable liberty. How many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholique peeces have vvith meere imaginations made their lives miserable, and vvorne out their dayes in the bitternesse of their soule; only out of those conceits vvhich the by-standers have hooted at, as either impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or ridiculous? One thinkes himselfe loathsomly deformed, another disgraced and infamous; a third dying or dead: One thinks himselfe transmuted into some
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3790:72"/>
beast: another possessed by some ill spirit. What forme cannot this humour put on? I leave these kind of complainants to good counsell and Ellebore. Others there are, who have indeed reall crosses, but farre below their sorrow, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately lamenting even small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: so we have seene a child, when he hath taken a heedlesse and harmlesse fall, bewray his griefe with loud crying, and in a foolish anguish knocking his head against that ground, which he accuseth for his miscarriage: Thus we finde certain <hi>Armenians,</hi>

Chazin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarii.</note> styled of old by the name of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinzarii,</hi> who kept a yearely fast, called <hi>Arzibur,</hi> in the sad memory of the dogge of <hi>Sergius,</hi> their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, (of that name) devoured by

a wolfe; which attendant of his, was wont to goe before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and by some dumb signes, call forth the disciples to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: It was an affliction to <hi>Rachel</hi> that she had no children,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> but she had no reason so to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it, as to say, <hi>Give me chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or else I dye: Ionah</hi> had cause to be sorry for the losse of his Gourd, but he had no reason to say, <hi>It is better for me to dye then to live</hi>: These dispositions are like unto a new cart, which screaks, and cryes, even whiles it hath no burden but his owne wheeles, whereas that which is long used, and well liquored, goes silently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with an heavy load.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Caution of our sorrow.</note>Our second caution therefore must be, that even our just sorrow
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3790:73"/>
be moderate; for the quantity, not more then enough.<note place="margin">Ambros. de obitu Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyri fiatris.</note> It was a rule of the <hi>Lycians</hi> (as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tells us) if a man would mourn above his stint, to put him into a womans habit;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.13.</note> we may mourne for the dead, <hi>but not as men without hope: David</hi> mournes, at least enough,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.21.</note> for his sick childe, but when hee perceives it once dead, he riseth up, and washeth, anointeth and refresheth himselfe, and changeth his apparell, and comes into the Lords house to worship. Hath good <hi>Melaina</hi> lost her husband,<note place="margin">Hieron. Epist.</note> and her children at once? her teares are just, but she dries them up at last with this resolution, that she shall now the more freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her selfe to her devotion. Have we lost our worldly goods?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3790:74"/>
they had not beene goods, if they vvere not vvorth our griefe for their miscarriage; if, as our riches have wings, they be flowne up to heaven, (being taken away by the same hand that gave them) it is good reason our sorrow should give way to our submission and obedience: and we should say vvith <hi>Iob, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, blessed bee the name of the Lord.</hi> As then on the one side we may not so obdure our selves, as to be like the <hi>Spartan</hi> boyes, vvhich would not so much as change a countenance at their beating; so on the other side, vve may not be like to those Anticks of stone, vvhich vve see carved out under the end of great beams in vast buildings, vvhich seeme
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3790:74"/>
to make vvry and vvrencht faces, as if they vvere hard put to it, vvith the vveight, vvhen as indeed they beare little or nothing.</p>
               <p>Our third Caution is, that the measure of this sorrow be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, vvhether it be more or lesse, according to the cause of the sorrow; for it may be so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as to be unproportionable. Griefe for crosses should be small, and impassionate; griefe for sin can hardly be too much: and as those crosses, and those sins differ in degree, so should the degrees of our sorrow; he therefore that grieves more for a crosse, then for his sinne; or grieves equally for a small crosse and a greater, offends in the undue proportion of his sorrow: Shortly then, there is a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3790:75"/>
worldly sorrow, and there is a spirituall; both which must know their just limits; right reason and true Philosophy teaches the one, the other Divinity.</p>
               <p>I have lost my goods; were they mine first? perhaps I was but their keeper, or bearer, not their owner; I see the groom that keeps the horse is not much troubled to flea him; what doth he lose but his labour in tending him? What was the mule in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> after his lying down in the water, troubled with the melting of that burden of salt, which he carryed? or what paines is it to the silly asse, that the treasure which he bore is taken off, and laid up in his Masters chest?</p>
               <p>I see many sweating in the mint
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3790:75"/>
upon severall imployments, they have money enough under their hands, what are they the richer? or doe they greeve to see it carryed away in full sacks from their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering? My goods are lost; were they not only lent me for a time, till they should be called for? were they not delivered into my hands, only to be paid back upon account? if the owner require them at his day, what harme is done? so that my reckoning bee eaven, how can I complaine to be eased of a charge?</p>
               <p>I have lost my goods by ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; It is well that my selfe have escaped; how have I heard and read of Philosophers, who have voluntarily cast their gold into the Sea; the windes have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3790:76"/>
done that for me, which their hands did for themselves? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that very wealth had beene my undoing, which at least, can doe no harme where it is; why did I trust such friends as winde and water, if I did not looke to be disappointed?</p>
               <p>I have lost my goods by casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of fire; even that casualty was not without a providence: He that sent that fire, meant to try me by it; he had not sent it, but that he knew there was drosse of worldlinesse and corruption to be thus purged out of me: It is a worse flame that I have deserved; and if by this lesser and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fire, the mercy of God hath meant to prevent that greater, and everlasting, I have reason (as the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3790:76"/>
Martyrs were wont) to embrace the flame.</p>
               <p>I have lost my goods by robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, cosenage, oppression; I would be loth to be in his case that hath thus found them: Let him mourn that hath thus purchased a curse: for me, I have but forceably trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my charge, where it will be wofully audited for. It is all one to me whether it be fire, or water, or fraud, or violence that hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me; there is one and the same hand of God in all these events: let me kisse that hand which strikes me with these varieties of rods, and I shall say, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi>

not letting it settle in their hearts, but venting it at their tongues.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3790:153"/>
which are Reciprocally deduced from their certaine, and intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call causes, to their effects; such as, The Sunne is risen, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day: He is God, therefore <hi>Omnipotent, Omniscient.</hi> There are others, which may perhaps seeme to us no lesse necessary, as following upon some premisses by an undoubted force of reason; which yet, another thinks hee can by some cleanly distinction, commodiously evade, and yet hold that ground which we layd for that ratiocination; such is that of <hi>Gualterius</hi> the Iesuite: <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> denyes that the body of Christ can be substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in many places at once; Therefore he denies Gods <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</hi> The Protestant ascribes

If a Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22 shall maintaine that the soules of the blessed shall sleep till the resurrection; If a <hi>Dominicus a Soto</hi> shall hold, that the whole Christian faith shall be extinguished in the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Antichrist; shall wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute these opinions to the See, or Church? If an <hi>Alphonsus a Castro</hi> shall hold hereticks and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, after they are once bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3790:159"/>
to be true members of the Catholicke Church; Or a <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> or <hi>Vasquez</hi> shall teach the Commandement that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids worshipping of Images, to be meerely temporary; If a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> shall revive <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> in denying that there is any need of the divine ayde, either of generall or speciall concourse in humane actions; If a <hi>Richardus Armacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> shall second the <hi>Novatians,</hi> in teaching that there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to be obtained by the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for some haynous sinnes; If an <hi>Occham</hi> shall teach that the visible signes are not of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Sacrament; Or a <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Parisiensis,</hi> or <hi>Cornelius a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide</hi> (little differing from the condemned error of <hi>Rupertus
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3790:160"/>
Tuitiensis</hi>) shall teach, that the Sacramentall bread is hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally assumed by the word. Is there any so unjust Arbiter of things, as to upbrayd these Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who professeth their dislike? Thus if a <hi>Knox,</hi> or <hi>Buchanan,</hi> or <hi>Goodman,</hi> shall broach exorbitant and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions, concerning the Successions and rights of Kings, and lawlesse power of subjects; Why should this be layd in our dish, more then a <hi>Suarez,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> in theirs? If a <hi>Flaccius Illiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> shall uphold a singular error concerning Grace, and Originall sinne; If some ill-advised follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> shall hold the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall elements to be onely bare signes, serving meerely for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3790:160"/>
memory, and representation; If some Divines of ours shall defend the rigid opinions concerning Predestination; If some phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall heads shall crye downe all decent Ceremonies, and all set formes of devotion; why should the Church suffer double in those things which it bewayles? Surely, as the Church is a collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so it hath a tongue of her owne speaking by the common voyce of her Synodes; in her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke Confessions, Articles, Constitutions, Catechismes, Liturgies; what she sayes in these, must passe for her owne: but if any single person shall take upon him (unauthorised) to be the mouth of the Church, his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is justly censurable; And if
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3790:161"/>
an adversary shall charge that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion upon the Church, he shall be intolerably injurious: Indeed, as it is the best harmony where no part, or Instrument, is heard alone, but a sweet compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and equall mixture of all, so is it the best state of the Church, where no dissenting voyce is heard above, or besides his fellowes; but all agree in one common sound of wholesome doctrine. But (such as mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall selfe-love is) this is more fit to be expected in a <hi>Platonicall</hi> speculation, then in a true reality of existence: for whiles every man is apt to have a good conceit of his owne deeper insight, and thinkes the prayse, and use of his knowledge lost, unlesse he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
